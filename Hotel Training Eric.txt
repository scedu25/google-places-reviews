+1  This last time they gave us a top floor room and upgraded us to a suite for no apparent reason. 
+1  They also let us check our bags when we arrived in the morning so we could go around without carrying our backpacks.

0   Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. 
-1  I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. 
0   To which I was told that I could take a taxi. 
-1  So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. 
-1  Should be called park and get stranded.  
-1  WORST park and fly experience ever. 
-1  Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.
+1  My son's Wedding was held here...beautiful ceremony and beautiful room for the reception. .food was exceptional as was the wait help. ..I will look to hold any occasion at the Double Tree..I know they will give me excellent service.
+1  I'm not a picky person and this hotel was just fine.

-1  Maids could be a smidge more thorough. 
+1  Over all, pretty good.
+1  Nice place to stay! 
0   Didn't have a king room our first night there so they said to call down to desk the next day and they would get us our king room. 
0   We planned to be gone all day so called the desk first thing the next morning and asked of it would be possible to change rooms since we wouldn't be here at check out time. 
0   She said no problem we have a king room available right now. 
+1  Soon there was a knock on our door, front desk had brought us our new room key and even asked if we needed help moving! 
+1  So really nice people! 
-1  The downside was the tub didn't drain very well and our first room was too hot and our second room was just about too cold and we like it really really cold when we sleep so not sure what was up with that. 
0   You can change the fan speed in your room and not your temp just like others have said. 
+1  All in all it was a place we looked forward to come back to at the end of the day.
+1  The location of the Doubketree was ideal for me as I was needing to to get the airport the following morning. 
-1  The beds were comfortable, however the pillows, as seems to be standard with hotels, become flatter than pancakes within seconds of testing your head on them. 
+1  The room service was great and super quick - great selections to choose from. 
+1  The service was also decent - can't go beyond that as other than the chap that checked me in I didn't interact much with the staff.
0   Stayed one night. 
-1  Received a room with a dirty bathroom, but the lady at the front came to clean it so that was fine. 
-1  The room I stayed in smelled weird and had holes in the ceiling, but the room next door where my mom stayed was much nicer.  
0   Overall, it's exactly what you'd expect from a Place looks sketchy from outside, however the rooms have been remodeled.  
-1  It is $68 a night and I feel it should be a little cheaper for what you get.  
-1  I'd say $50 a night would be a more fair price.
-1  Very run down! 
0   If your on the run! 
+1  Lol, well it's perfect! 
-1  No WiFi! 
-1  It's just a place barely out of the rain!
+1  Outside looked scary, but the inside was clean and the service was great. 
+1  Bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water. 
+1  If you're just looking for someplace cheap to pay your head, this is it.
0   Just a place to stay! 
-1  Personally I wouldn't want anyone I know to even think I would stay there.
+1  Like most Embassy Suites, view inside is great! 
+1  Has full all you can eat breakfast in a comfortable atmosphere. 
+1  The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. 
+1  It's near the heart of downtown Chicago so lots to see within walking distance. 
+1  For other sights, it's only a Uber call away. 
+1  I recommend this hotel.
+1  The location is amazing. 
+1  The room was very spacious, and they gave free ear plugs if you are not adjusted to City noise. 
+1  Fantastic place.
0   Stayed at this hotel for the Labour Day weekend - 3 night stay.  
-1  Customer service at the front desk was terrible no matter who we talked to and the worst part was that the water pressure in the toilet was so low that the toilet wouldn't flush.  
-1  We had maintenance come out twice to look at it but they never fixed it!  
-1  Why pay $200+ a night to stay in a hotel where you can't even use your bathroom.  
0   Additionally, the hotel is literally right next door to a parking garage.  
-1  It sounded like dump trucks were coming through all the time and we heard nothing but car sirens at all hours.  
-1  When we asked to move rooms, they kept telling us they were full and to ask again tomorrow.  
-1  Lastly, the lobby has a beautiful fountain...that smells like mold and dirty water.  
-1  I definitely will not be staying at this hotel again and highly recommend staying at the Embassy Suites on magnificent mile instead.
+1  Our room was nice, clean, and well maintained. 
-1  Zero view from our room but that was on purpose. 
0   If you want a view you are going to be in a room on a busy street with a lot of street noise. 
+1  Our room was pretty quiet. 
-1  Two complaints, the shower head was mounted neck high for me. 
-1  It was on a hose which helped but still didn't like that. 
-1  The other problem was the TV/satellite signal kept going in and out. 
-1  This problem was not exclusive to our room. 
-1  The breakfast bar was nothing special.
+1  Very great stay. 
+1  The staff was helpful and upgraded my suite to a city view. 
+1  Excellent service all around the hotel!
0   Six of us stayed there for our annual girls� weekend and we are not easy to please.  
+1  The rooms were comfortable, spacious and the view of Lake Michigan was terrific.  
+1  The service was top notch.  
+1  A special thank you to Renee at the front desk who sent us a nice note with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese.  
+1  The location was excellent too.  
+1  We would all highly recommend this hotel.
0   We stayed in room 1015. 
+1  It was exceptionally quiet. 
+1  We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. 
+1  Parking is confusing at first, but once you locate the Embassy entrance coming and going is easy. 
+1  The pool was nice as well. 
+1  The staff at the desk was helpful and friendly. 
+1  We will stay here again. 
-1  I would have preferred more water pressure in the shower, but it would not keep me from staying here. 
+1  The pull out bed was comfortable for our son. 
+1  We also loved the extra sink in the bedroom.
+1  The location is excellent. 
+1  It is within walking distance to shops on Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park area. 
+1  The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were very clean. 
+1  They have a great happy hour where you get 4 free drinks each night from 5 to 7pm and they have snacks out. 
-1  They lost a star because they have satellite tv... which means when it's too windy or raining then you can't get any TV. 
-1  Considering thus is Chicago and they are right by the river, that doesn't seem very smart.
0   Small pool for hotel geared to families. 
-1  Slippery floor in the kitchen area where you went to get your breakfast. 
+1  We love the place. 
+1  Great location. 
+1  Great room / Suite. 
+1  Breakfast was very good.. excellent mattress.
+1  Very convenient location, couple blocks from Michigan Ave shopping one way, about half mile from Navy Pier the other direction. 
+1  Nice parking ramp and Whole Foods store across the street. 
+1  Rooms are very spacious and clean. 
+1  Great free breakfast. 
0   Stayed 2 nights with my family of 6. 
+1  Just what we needed. 
-1  My only tiny complaint was that while at breakfast, we were approached by someone trying to sell Hilton Honors program for discounted future stay rates. 
-1  Maybe a good deal, but felt awkward. 
+1  I only spent one night in this campground but it was fine for my needs.  
+1  It has a very peaceful lake and we had a spot overlooking it. 
+1  Lots of area for walking the dogs. 
+1  Water spiggots are high enough not to have to get on your knees to hook up. 
+1  Garbage cans throughout the park, which was convenient.  
+1  When I first called I didn't get a warm feeling from the woman on the phone, but when I got there the man was fine.  
0   I did find out that they have a dog weight limit of 15 pounds.  
0   We didn't get to that in our conversation until I was halfway through my reservation.  
0   They made an exception for me because I was just coming overnight, told her I'd arrive about 7, leave about 7 am and take the dog out once to potty in the evening and in the morning. 
0   She's a standard poodle and extremely well behaved and I actually have letters of recommendation for her from other places we've stayed just in case I run into issues with people not wanting to allow her. 
+1  Anyway, they did make an exception, and it all worked out.  
+1  It didn't look like there was a lot to do here, but that's the kind of campground I like, quiet with water. 
-1  One thing I will warn about, the state road getting to their property is extremely bumpy, possibly the bumpiest road I've been on, and then their very long driveway is also very bumpy. 
0   Make sure everything is especially well secured in your trailer.
0   We stayed there several years ago, but from reading the reviews, not much has changed.  
-1  The lady that owns the place is very unpleasant, but you can overlook that due to age.  
-1  However, the man that works there, (I think he is her son), is spooky.  
+1  Their website list their nature trails, and there are lovely trails through the woods.  
-1  He followed my husband and I on a walk one day and told us it was private property and to get off.  
-1  There were no signs, nothing that distinguished this trail from any other on the property.  
-1  My kids were afraid of him,  and he did seem to be always watching wherever you went or whatever you were doing.  
-1  The place itself is quite run down, and honestly,  kind of scary.  
-1  The laundry is only open during weird hours during the day so if you are there working you will not be able to wash your clothes.  
-1  Oh, and when you drive in their long rough driveway there are signs warning you to say on the road as they have put nails in the grass!!  
-1  Our stay was several years ago and we still talk about this place as easily the worst campground ever. 
+1  This is a great place to stay.  
0   Disregard the other negative reviews.   
+1  The host here is wonderful and sweet.   
+1  For example... my awning was torn in a storm and she replaced it.   
0   This was after her insurance told her that she was not responsible.   
+1  She still felt like she should help out. 
+1  That type of generosity isn't seen much these days.   
+1  I can't wait to stay there again!   
+1  Cheers!  
-1  They only allow dogs up to 15 lbs. 
0   Yes 15! 
+1  I enjoyed my time in this small RV Campground. 
+1  Nice Trails through green forest around the lake (water is overly green or I would give higher rating). 
+1  Love the geese, sunrises and sunsets in this quite park. 
+1  Poppa Don and the crew at Enchanted Shores make you feel like family & special guest all at the same time!  
+1  Whether you're entertained by an outdoor movie/football game or riding in the barrel train it's a great atmosphere to kick back and relax.
-1  Manager can't admit when he makes a mistake and will argue with you! 
0   They advertise wifi, showers, laundry and bathrooms. 
-1  They have NONE of it!!! 
-1  But they still charge the same as when they did. 
-1  They say they're repairing things but it's been this way for almost going on 3 years according to the campground staff. 
-1  The playground is unsafe for children also. 
+1  It is however good location for I-57, not too close but not too far. 
-1  Enchanted Shores Campground has no shores to speak of.  
-1  What they do have, is plenty of noise from the traffic that runs along both streets bordering the corner campground.  
-1  There was no picnic table, the fire ring was in the neighbor's lot, there were very few trees for shade, and the noise from the traffic went on all night.  
-1  I would never recommend staying there.
0   Stopped by today to see what was there and if I wanted to bring my camper there. 
0   I didn't stop at the office because the sign said it was closed. 
-1  I thought maybe there was some sort of lake or pond there because of the name enchanted shores, but that was false. 
-1  There's nothing there but a run down trailer park. 
-1  Then I was run down my the manager( I guess), who was all upset that I didn't stop at the closed office. 
-1  Very rude and unfriendly. 
-1  I'll never go back again. 
-1  The place is a dump anyway.
0   The park itself was alright. 
-1  The management I found rude. 
-1  I was stopped in my car, a man yelled at me to stop. 
-1  When the man approached my window he didn't announce who he was not even a simple hello. 
-1  He just says can I help you. 
-1  When I told him no and that I'm staying here he proceeded to ask me when I arrived, who I was, and where I was staying in the park in a rude tone. 
-1  Mind you he still hasn't told me who he is so of course I'm giving vague answers to a man that just randomly stopped me in my vehicle.
-1  He made me feel unsafe and uneasy. 
-1  He finally did reveal he was one of the managers of the park  he didn't tell me his name or anything. 
-1  Just that he is a manager and said he didn't recognize me and than just left no bye no nothing. 
-1  I found it extremely rude to stop someone in their vehicle and not even announce who you are and than some.
+1  The price was reasonable and the bed was comfy enough. 
-1  There were no ice cube trays in our freezer and they don't have an ice machine, so getting in late didn't allow us time to get trays and fill them and wait for ice to form before having a drink at bed time. 
-1  The microwave had not been cleaned and had mold growing on it. 
-1  There was also a centipede in our room. 
+1  The staff were very friendly and helpful and everything else was clean. 
-1  More could be done to easily improve the quality of this hotel.
-1  I second guess the cleanliness of the hotel. 
0   We stayed here one night for a wedding. 
-1  There was scuz on the walls in the bathroom, our microwave was filthy and had a huge hunk of moldy food stuck to the rotating plate. 
-1  Fridge had food boogers in it too. 
-1  We didn't use it so it wasn't that big of a deal but still pretty gross. 
-1  No convenience of ice machine, plates, sliver wear, pots or pans. 
-1  They had one staff member running the front desk so they couldn't deliver anything to our door so, we had to run down to get anything we needed. 
-1  When we booked the hotel it said Continental breakfast but it was only coffee and muffins. 
+1  The staff was friendly. 
+1  The air conditioner worked. 
+1  The bed was comfy. 
-1  Those the only good things i can say. 
-1  I was very disappointed and don't think I'll be back.
+1  Management and staff was very friendly and accommodating. 
+1  Room was clean, bed comfortable, amenities provided, free WiFi, nice channel selection and location perfect. 
+1  Kudos for the quietness even though they allow pets. 
+1  Fresh smell throughout hotel!!!
+1  The room was awesome, good size room with microwave, fridge, stove top and even silverware which was unexpected. 
-1  We did however have to wait about 15-20 mins for someone to show up at the desk. 
-1  Not awesome after a 10 hour drive.
-1  This hotel is located as such that it is not easily spotted from the highway. 
-1  The staff is friendly, but the service wasn't very impressive. 
-1  We had a room on the second floor that had a kitchenette which was OK but there wasn't anything in the room for cooking, eating and drinking. 
0   You have to ask at the desk. 
-1  They don't offer amenities so be sure bring your own! 
-1  They might have a small bottle of shampoo and bar soap (which smelled horrible). 
-1  Overall, I was not impressed.
+1  This is a very nice hotel for an overnight stay. 
+1  The rooms are clean and what you would expect from a Marriott. 
+1  The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
+1  The breakfast area was large and there was a good variety of items. 
+1  Would definitely return.
+1  Room was clean and tidy. 
+1  Bed was comfy and the shower better than expected. 
+1  Staff were all friendly and courteous. 
+1  Even with brewing convention attendees staying in the hotel, it being by a highway and railway line it was quiet and peaceful. 
+1  Would happily stay again if in the area.
+1  Clean rooms. 
+1  Friendly staff. 
+1  Convenience of being right off the interstate however be aware that you can somewhat hear the interstate traffic. 
0   But not really much the hotel can do about that, to be fair. 
+1  I would recommend this hotel. 
+1  Close to the casinos and they have a shuttle.
-1  Bed was comfortable but the room had an unusual smell to it. 
-1  Wasn't overpowering but noticeable. 
+1  Staff was friendly and pricing was reasonable.
+1  My room was not initially provided with a spare sheet and blanket for the futon, but the staff quickly provided me with the items when asked. 
-1  The blanket did have a hair on it that did not resemble mine. 
+1  The room and complimentary breakfast were both very nice.
0   I took  about 10 black girls (my daughter and her friends) to the Fairfield Inn Tinley Park, IL Marriott Hotels.... 
0   We were there for about ten minutes when management came to the room. 
-1  They asked us at what time did we plan on not making any noise.  
-1  I was a little confused.. because the girls were not making any noise.  
-1  I asked management did they ask everybody who came in that question or if it was just us.  
0   Mind you I had 3 rooms more that enough to accommodate us.  
-1  Needless to say I left the hotel to take the kids to the mall only to receive a call that I had to checked out and come get my stuff and that police had been called.  
-1  They also informed me that I would still be charged for the rooms in which I had only checked in and been put out.  
-1  It was discrimination at its finest....
+1  Loved the rooms and loved the breakfast and also loved the staff. 
-1  My only complaint is one that I know doesn't effect a lot of people but I really wish there was a better fitness center. 
0   I understand this isn't a popular topic but for someone like me this is a big deal. 
-1  There were two treadmills that didn't incline, an old elliptical, and a few dumbbells. 
-1  Would have five starred if there was even two more pieces of equipment.
+1  Very clean and nice hotel. 
+1  Staff was very polite and the area around the hotel was nice with lots of food choices around. 
+1  I'd definitely stay here with my family.
+1  Nice basic hotel, clean, updated, Paul Mitchell tolitries, comfortable beds. 
+1  employees are helpful and friendly.  
+1  Room was nice size with large couch, that pulled out to bed, large desk, 2 TVs, small microwave & fridge.  
+1  Easy to get to/from Hollywood Casino Ampetheater.  
+1  Several restaurants within a couple blocks, easy walk.
+1  Great quality rooms...always clean. 
+1  The setting is very quiet so you won't be disturbed. 
+1  Free breakfast! 
+1  Free WiFi (though it is quite slow)
+1  I spent 5 days here and I enjoyed myself. 
+1  All the staff were wonderful but for me Jerome at the front desk was the best! 
+1  He helped me so much! 
+1  He went above and beyond and out of his way to accommodate me and feel welcome. 
+1  He is awesome! 
+1  Jerome gets an Atttttt in customer service.
0   Where do I begin with this place! 
+1  They are amazing from the front desk to every staff member in the place. 
+1  I teach Knock your socks off customer training classes and I would think they had my class lol. 
+1  Anyway this is the best place to stay in Merrillville, IN. 
+1  They made my trip so much more enjoyable. 
+1  Clean, Caring, the warm cookies, good breakfast, and they have fresh water for you all night with lime. 
+1  If you stay here you will not be disappointed. 
+1  Oh don't let me forget the heated pool! 
+1  Thanks again Fairfield Team!
+1  Fairfield Inn was easily located right off the highway in an area with a lot of restaurants, gas stations, shopping, and other big city feels in a small town environment. 
0   We were traveling as a family for a professional event in the area. 
+1  We felt it was safe and family friendly. 
+1  The service was quick and friendly. 
+1  The room was newly renovated and comfortable. 
-1  Our room had two full size beds which are smaller than what we are used to (we have usually seen queens). 
+1  For our little family it worked fine. 
+1  The breakfast was nice and included hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, fruit, cereal, waffles, yogurt, assorted drinks, and a coffee bar. 
0   There is an outside pool, however it wasn't open yet, but we stayed the first weekend in June and the weather hadn't been warm enough. 
+1  Nice, clean place. 
+1  Would stay again if in the area.
+1  I rented a suite my 3 sisters, mother & myself enjoyed our stay very much! 
+1  The staff is awesome they were very accommodating and helpful. 
+1  The rooms we very clean.... 
+1  I will definitely staying there again! 
+1  Nice clean and friendly staff has a washer and dryer continental breakfast was good
+1  Top top top notch staff.
-1  But terrible room conditions.  
-1  Room reeked of smoke and the bed was way too soft for my taste on the first try.  
-1  Asked for another room and they accommodated (although had to go from King to dual queen) and the room was better but one could still tell it was old.
-1  Due to the building's condition alone, I'd urge long stay travelers to avoid.  
+1  However if you're judging solely on staff, I'd give it 5 stars.
0   Traveling with senior citizens on this trip. 
+1  Check in was quick and easy. 
+1  Drop off and entry to hotel easy. 
+1  Rooms were spacious enough and clean. 
+1  Breakfast was adequate. 
0   This was a travel business stop. 
-1  Certainly acceptable, very clean, but an older worn out Fairfield.  
-1  Hospitality was nice, but not overly friendly.  
-1  A place where you had to ask, not going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.
+1  Great customer service nice clean rooms beautiful pool area to relaxing with jacuzzi would recommend it and go back again
+1  Great service, great breakfast, great quality room. 
+1  Felt like home. 
+1  There was a lot of stores around it to stay busy.
0   I have been staying at this hotel for a while as a business guest. 
+1  The recent remodel has freshend up the look and feel. 
+1  While not a 5 star hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and always make you feel welcome. 
0   I always stay at this hotel when in Kankakee.
+1  Nice hotel. 
+1  Check-in was very nice and rooms clean. 
+1  Breakfast was better than average and the entire package at a reasonable price.
+1  Location isn't the prettiest town, but inside the hotel is amazing. 
+1  Room looks great and they are currently doing renovations to make the hotel even better. 
-1  Hot tub was not working so that was a disappointment, but the pool is still up and running. 
+1  Overall great place.
+1  Great location and clean rooms. 
+1  Friendly staff and comp breakfast.
+1  Nice for the area. 
-1  But it's a very monotone theme.
+1  Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. 
0   I would definitely recommend paying the extra $ to get access to the breakfast and snacks in the gold club during your stay. 
+1  We got our money's worth of snacks, that's for sure. 
+1  The breakfast was killer. 
+1  I had bagels with lox every morning of our stay and it was heavenly.  
+1  The hotel is centrally located in downtown and within walking distance of the train to get to the airport. 
+1  I would highly recommend this hotel!
-1  Bed was a bit hard for my taste, and the pillows are those old-school feather pillows, which provide no support whatsoever. 
0   Abroad, most hotels offer internet for free. 
-1  People who come to the Fairmont will be surprised on how much they have to pay. 
-1  Place is a bit secluded from major streets. 
-1  Not really sure what is driving the high premium. 
0   $655 for two nights? 
0   Good luck, mate.
+1  The hotel is in a tremendous location. 
+1  It has great views of the city and is extremely well-kept. 
+1  My experience here was to visit a conference and attend some meetings and a suite that was reserved for us and it was really nicely located and done.
0   We are big fans of the Fairmont Seattle, and this was our first introduction to the Fairmont Chicago. 
+1  We had a great view room overlooking the park. 
+1  Service was fantastic, as always. 
+1  This is a great location: just a block to the waterfront parks. 
+1  Our three year old enjoyed both the hotel and nearby playgrounds. 
+1  Recommended!
+1  My lady friend and I spent six nights at this excellent hotel and enjoyed it tremendously. 
+1  Although the hotel could use some updating, our suite was  clean and lovely, with wonderful views of Lake Michigan and the park, and the hotel's location is outstanding. 
+1  In particular, the Concierge staff was fabulous, tending to our requests with enthusiastic response. 
+1  This was my first return to my native city in 30 years, and the Fairmont Chicago made it extremely enjoyable. 
+1  Thanks!
+1  Great hospitality! 
0   Which is hard to find these days. 
+1  We stayed at Super 8 the night prior and paid what we had paid for two nights there very affordable. 
+1  And after staying at Super 8 we were worried about the environment from our experience at Super 8 but it was terrific nice quiet no complaints we actually felt safer there than we did at Super 8 thank you for the terrific stay

-1  If you come to the Family Inn expecting the stereotypical hotel feel of today's society this is not the place for you. 
+1  But if you want a vintage experience that takes you back to the family road trip vacations of the past then you are in luck with this place. 
+1  The owners are a wonderful couple that accommodated us when we had to come to the tiny town of Watseka unexpectedly for a family funeral with a tight budget. 
+1  They even called the morning after our first night to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed. 
+1  While the rest of my family set up at the run of the mill Super 8 just down the street for $80 a night,  my kids and I got to experience the historical, old time feel of real hospitality at the bargain price of a two night stay for $100. 
+1  I have a lot of family in this area and this will be our home away from home every time we have to come into town. 
+1  The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I don't want to give people unrealistic expectations because of some of the conditions of this historical building, but we were comfortable and felt very safe here.
+1  If you are looking for old time courtesy and customer service then FAMILY INN, Watseka must be the choice. 
+1  The property is old no doubt but the manager couple surpassed our expectation of good service with flying colors.
+1  Our room was basic but very clean with nice soft linens. 
+1  Bed was firm and comfortable.
+1  With room rates so low - 70is and 80is era! 
+1  - there is nothing to write bad about our experience. 
+1  Will recommend them in a heart beat!

0   The hotel itself is a bit dated compared to some of the other five star hotels in Chicago, but you won't be able to tell the difference. 
+1  The views are spectacular, make sure you get a room facing the lake!
0   $7.00 for a glass of milk, because my wife felt ill and needed to take a pill.

0   We traveled to Chicago for a mini getaway from 8/09/17 - 8/11/17.  
+1  Although we've stayed in many luxurious 5 star hotels, Hampton Inn never disappoints and Chicago-Downtown was no exception.

+1  The hotel was beautiful, very modern and comfy.
