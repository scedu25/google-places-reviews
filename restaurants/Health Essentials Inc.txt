Text: My wife, friend and I were driving through, going from Denver back home to Houston. We didn't want the usual fast food option, and found Essential Food restaurant attached to Health Essentials.

Wow! We were beyond excited at finding this hidden gem. Quality food from the White Bean Cabbage & Sausage soup to the Horseradish Havarti Cheeseburger (I added garlic aioli). Then, topped it off with an amazing dessert sampler.

We'll definitely stop by again whenever we're in Colorado.

Text: I was in recently for my first ever facial and I had a wonderful experience. Tess did an excellent job on my skin and she had the room setup with the perfect relaxing atmosphere. I am already looking forward to my next facial and I also plan check out some of their other services. This is a great spa!
