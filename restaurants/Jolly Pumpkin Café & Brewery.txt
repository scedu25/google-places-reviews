Jolly Pumpkin Café & Brewery

Text: Great selection of beverage choices, especially if you're a fan of sour beers.  The food is also very good, with options for vegan and vegetarians if you are of the variety.  Get the potato pizza or the truffle fries as a snack.  You won't be disappointed.  During the warmer seasons, the rooftop is also open in the evening, and its a great place to hang out with friends.

Text: Nice place for a beer and bar food. Have been here multiple times and am always satisfied. Prices are a little high for bar type food, but the quality is very good.

Text: Always creative meals with fresh and lite ingredients. They had a number of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options.  Last time (pre-vegetarian) I had a killer BLT; great flavor. Last night I had a tofu sandwich and salad. Friends had a grilled cheese that they said was excellent.  I haven't explored the dinner options at this location yet.  AA seems to be more sandwichy than the Mission.  This is not a critique just a locational observation...It helps that I love sour beers and Jolly Pumpkin has some of the best.

Text: Good beer and awesome food! Nice menu; especially for a foodie. We had a small hick-up getting our table the manager made it right very quickly. Our server, the bartender, and the hostess were all super friendly and helpful. We will return:)
