Text: This pizza is amazing. I've only had the deep dish from here, but honestly is there any other kind? My boyfriend constantly talks about Chicago's Giordano's deep dish so I brought him here. He said it's exactly the same and we save the 4 hour train ride to gets the amazing deep dish.

Text: We got half and half pizza; All Four of us got sick off their pizza! First: It Is over priced in My Opinion-- $40.00 for a pizza! That Better be the best Pizza I have ever tasted! Second: I could see past this price if it was the best Pizza Ever; however, it is Not. Third: I would also not be bothered if one or even Two people from our group got sick. The Fact of the Matter Is: All Four of us got sick, we are never going back. No need to try and make it right by offering another pizza-- it did not go down well the first time.

Text: Did not get to eat here because the wait was rediculous. We were told we could pre-order and then were told that it only applies to thier deep dish. This was after we called ahead to see normal wait times and were told it would "be no problem" and "it's not usually that busy".

Text: Wow, talk about a great deep dish pizza.  The best I've had outside of Chicago.  On the downside, the deep dish takes about 40 mins (our server gave us a head's up).  It's worth it though.  Also the location downtown right beside the Mudhens stadium is great.
