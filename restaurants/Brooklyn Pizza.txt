Brooklyn Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Real New York style pizza in Fulton,Missouri. Daily specials of pizza and pasta;a variety to satisfy any diner. Be sure to get there early Saturday for the Italian Beef pizza,a hidden gem not on the menu. Call ahead,and they will put one back for you. No meal is complete without salad,and the Italian Chef Salad is big enough for 2,if you share. Be sure to order an extra pizza to go,for that sudden urge to go back to New York. Desserts are available,as are adult beverages. A great date night experience.

Text: Ordered delivery. From the person on the phone to the delivery driver, these people are excellent at customer service. Ordered the chef salad and was surprised to find that this salad is full of ingredients. Wow. The pizza is very tasty and crust was perfect. Can't wait to stop back through here again.

Text: Absolutely the best pizza and Italian food ever! The staff is friendly, courteous and efficient. The owners, Brian and Karen, are wonderful people. Brooklyn Pizza was voted "The Best Pizza in Rural Missouri". Yeah, I'm a fan-boy / 
cheerleader because my family and I love great food.

Text: Best New York style pizza I've tried in Mid Missouri! Our family faithfully goes every other Saturday to get the Italian Beef pizza, and fresh garlic bread. We look forward to each visit, and seeing the wonderful staff!

Text: That was by far the worst pizza I ever had in my entire life, I couldn't even finish one slice. Salad was ok service was so so, very disappointing experience
