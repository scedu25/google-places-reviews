Text: The waitress was awful!!!! The one with short red hair is terrible screaming and hollering behind the wall like we couldn’t hear her and our group spent at least $300!!! Managers don’t care let the red hair girl scream and not check on the customers never again and the food was nasty tasting like dish washing liquid
