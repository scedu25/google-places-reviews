The Glitz- Irish Acres Gallery of Antiques

Text: Took my Mother for her 70th Birthday  to the restaurant, along with her Sisters. The Glitz itself was nice for the atmosphere however, the food was terrible. None of my family enjoyed the food, the appetizer was cold, the fish we ate was over cooked and in some type of casserole. The portion sizes are very small considering you are paying 23.00 a person. i took my 3 year old with me and after we ordered for him which was chicken tenders the waiter then comes back and says it is 23.00 for him also. I advised the waiter that it was fine as i wasn't going to tell my 3 year old oh it is too expensive for chicken tenders you will have to wait. But his meal  consisted of peanut butter and crackers for an appetizer, 3 chicken tenders, oranges, and sundae for desert.  Which in my opinion was not worth 23.00. If you are going to have a restaurant that you are claiming is high end then you need to make it very clear that you don't accommodate small children as far as a food option. I will honestly say that i will not be back to this establishment. Plus I had a small gift bag that was for my mother that I was not allowed to bring in so we took it back to the car. Over-all very disappointed with this experience and i could have went some place else and spent a 100.00 for a better meal.

Text: A magical destination in the middle of nowhere!  Always a wonderful experience!   We traveled from Cincinnati just to have a fun "girls" day and the Glitz and Irish Acres never disappoint.  Can't wait to go back!

Text: This is a little gem of a place!  I love taking people here; locals and visitors. People are always impressed by the ambiance when they arrive and there isn't anywhere else to compare it to. The lunch potions are delicate and delish! I love that they bring out the spiced apple refresher to get you started.. it makes the experience feel that much more special. They change up their menu every three weeks to keep it interesting. We love this little place out in the country(which isn't actually very little, but it feels quaint). And don't be in a hurry when you go, as there is a lot to see!
