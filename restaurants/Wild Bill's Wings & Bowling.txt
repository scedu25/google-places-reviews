Wild Bill's Wings & Bowling

Text: Horrible service! Never again will I waste my time trying to get a table. While we waited for a table we had several servers walk by and said nothing. Once we finally got someone stopped they told us they were too busy to seat us. Very rude people working in the bar. Thank you Wild Bill's.... I will be very happy to spend my money in other places.

Text: We called ahead to ask what time they stopped serving food. They told us 10:45pm. We arrived around 930pm. There were people drinking at the bar. We were seated, and as soon as the manager saw we had a service animal WITH AN ID BADGE, we were rushed over to to be told they were closing. I would give them 0 stars if I could.

Text: I always love the wings here. The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Great to take the family and then enjoy some Laser Tag, arcade, or bowling with the kids. Great beer selection, and lots of TV. Modern. A good unique place for out of towers as well. Sometimes the servers are slow.

Text: Great potential but burgers are vey disapointing. Bathrooms are filthy but staff is friendly. Wings are ok but there are better burgers at fast food places. Really keep hoping it will improve, great concept just need better cooks or training
