Text: I had my wedding reception at Grand Street, and it was AMAZING! The staff was incredibly helpful and great to work with throughout the entire process. The day of coordinators (Elliot and Logan) helped me through the entire process of the décor design, food choices, and day of planning. All I had to do was drop off any additional decorations the week of, and they did EVERYTHING for me. The day went smooth, and my family and I did not have to worry about a thing the day of. They were amazing and made our event stress free. The entire staff the night of was attentive and professional, and the food is delicious. Best wedding food you could have. I highly recommend having your event at Grand Street. I was so impressed with how easy they made my day. Oh, they also have SO many decorations you can use at no cost, such as table numbers, different options of candle center pieces, cake trays, etc. It helped lower my cost quite a bit as well. I hope the staff at Grand Street does see this, as they deserve so much credit for making my day perfect! Elliot was our day of coordinator, and was on top of everything the entire time.
