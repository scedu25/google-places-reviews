Text: Called to place an order for a meat lovers pizza and garlic cheese bread.  Told it would be 30 min.  Ok no problem.  Just got off a double shift at work and go in and pay for it.  Told it would be 10 min.  25 minutes later they hand me my order.  Get home and it's a sausage pizza.  I tried to call them but no one answered.  Drove back and explained what happened.  The girl said you only paid for a sausage.  Well that's funny because when the order was read back it was for a large meat lovers pizza.  No sorry let me make it right or anything.  I requested my $ back and went to Pizza hut.  Paid a little more but it was right and didn't have to wait almost an hour to get it.  I won't be going back!!!!

Text: Pizza is good, the rest isn't. The wings were soggy like they were boiled. Service if you sit down is mediocre at best. Get the pizza to go and skip everything else

Text: I would have rated it a 5 but I did not get the extra cheese I had ordered on my pizza nor did I get the extra sauce...I have never had an issue with my order before and when I had called and told them they said the owner would ONLY make it right if I brought the pizza back in but I live a half an hour away and I just was not about to drive all the way back...I spent almost $30 on my order and the least they could have done was offer to put it on the books or offer something instead of asking me to drive all the way back...even if they wrote to double check my order to make sure it was made correctly...VERY disappointed to say the least...
