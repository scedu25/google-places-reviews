Ditka's Restaurant Oakbrook Terrace
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Steaks were cooked precisely to our requests, crab bisque was wonderful, sides were elegant and flavorful, wonderful mixed drinks and fresh decadent desserts. Ditkas is not a quiet place on a busy night, but you can still have a space to yourself without having to yell to communicate. Fast valet and excellent accommodating staff. We will be back

Text: Food was not sent out as ordered, but cooked well and acceptable, and the service from the bartender was that of "could care less". Seems like they just assume you should be happy and drop some money and move on. Very little personalized service the last several visits. It is hard to find good people...they do have some nice people there, but too few.

Text: Good wine selection. Good steaks. Great service. Server was very knowledgeable. My prime rib was good, even if it was super duper fatty. But, it is prime rib and I ordered the 16 oz for that reason. The cheesecake was alright, but not spectacular. I had a good experience, but there are a lot of good restaurants in Chicago and I think I would prefer to try a different restaurant next time I'm in Chicago. I wouldn't say it really stands out for any reason among restaurants in it's class.
