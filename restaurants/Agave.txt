Agave

Text: Best Mexican I've had in Columbia in a LONG TIME! We hadn't been to Agave for over 2 years due to some issues we'd had in the past and this time the place did not disappoint! The food was fresh, amazingly flavorful, the waiter was awesome, and the place was spotless. If you read many of my reviews you will know that I'm extremely picky about waitstaff and cleanliness of restaurants, but this was exceptional. Keep up the great work!

Text: Above average. I was expecting the typical Americanized Mexican food but this was a step above. The seasoning seemed more authentic. Excellent service.

Text: Friendly staff but I wish I'd have something other than the chicken fajita taco salad. It wasn't that great.

Text: If you get fajitas for two, you should be able to serve about four easily. I've never been disappointed.
