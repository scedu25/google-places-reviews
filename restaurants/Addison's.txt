Text: Excellent spot to get martinis and beers. Good atmosphere and drinks are typically consistent. Service is timely as well and friendly people. I frequent often with friends to Addison's.

Text: Drove all the way from Jefferson City, waited 45mins for a table, soda was messed up right off the bat all syrup no carbonation, okay no big deal got it replaced. 
Nachos were amazing, waiter and service was great, the alfredo was horrible.
 Big chunks of RAW onions were in the pasta, the onion taste was so over powering my husbands mouth was burning from taking a bite from just the noodles... 
I was excited about enjoying our dinner tonight and doing something nice, I raved to him about how good it was and we ended up wasting our times sadly... left half hungry. Better luck next time..???

Text: These folks are clueless.  Their management of a waitlist is embarrassing.  It would be hard for everybody waiting to be dissatisfied but they accomplished that.  If you’re looking for inefficient management, this is your place.

Text: Amazing food and service!   This was the first time I have eaten at Addison's and I plan on going back! I had the Diablo Shrimp Pasta which tasted exquisite!   My friend had the Addison Burger with a side of Garlic Roasted Smashed Potatoes. The amount of roasted garlic was spot on... Not to much or to little! 
Thanks to the chef and kitchen staff for the amazing food.   Thank you for your great service and attentiveness Dave Charington.Awesome Sauce!

Text: Good food - love the Nachos Bianco - cool vibe, but really loud if they're more than a third full.
