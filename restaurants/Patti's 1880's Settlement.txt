Text: 10 11 2017 Always enjoy Patti's. The pork chops are the best. Ordered the 1" pork chop this time, usually get the 2" that they are known for but the 1" was as good if not better. The flower pot bread is a experience as well.  Waiter was very attentive and served is well. The place is unique and a good experience.

Text: The only bad thing about Patti's is how long it takes to drive there from our house! Absolutely exceptional food and service, HIGHLY recommended. If you go there during mealtimes expect a 30-45 minute wait for a table, but there is a lot to walk around, do, and see on the grounds to include several shops, a playground, and a small selection of farm animals. I recommend requesting your table, checking out the grounds, then be back in the restaurant about 10 minutes early to wait for your buzzer to go off. It's completely painless. In fact, the only pain you're likely to feel is in your stomach, because the food is so good you can't stop!

Text: Wonderful food and very eclectic and unique atmosphere! We had an absolutely enjoyable experience during our meal! Would definitely recommend this place during the holiday season when they have ALL their Christmas lights up! We only got to see a portion of what they had completed at the end of October, and it was already amazing!!

Text: This was the most amazing place I have been to in a long time.  The food was incredible.  I had the seafood pasta but kept eating my wife's steak.  Then we went outside and the lights were beautiful.  The little shops were equally amazing and reasonably priced.

Text: Incredible! Best pork chop I've ever eaten and the bread and strawberry butter would be worth driving the 9 hours it takes us to get down there! We went twice during our visit and we would have gone more. We were down there for the total eclipse and it was crowded, but the first time we went we got right in. The second time we went they were booked solid the whole day and we couldn't get in, and then we made reservations for the next night. I doubt it is always that busy, but if you are going down there do yourself a favor and make a reservation... You don't want to miss this!! My only complaint would be the lemon meringue mile high pie. The lemon curd wasn't homemade and wasn't good. But the apple pie was incredible as was their special pie for the eclipse. Everyone was so friendly and the place was immaculate. I was mesmerized the entire time by the fact that there wasn't dust on all of the floral arrangements that are dripping from every surface. I can't wait to go back!
