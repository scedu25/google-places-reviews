Text: I do NOT normally go for Chinese buffets, however I am thrilled to have enjoyed this buffet.  Every thing was of exceptional quality including the service and the venue.  Chinese food is not my fav, because the food typically lacks flavor and quality.  This place is the exception to that rule!! I will be back.

Text: Service was good, went at dinner time and there weren't that many people and several of the pans on the buffet were almost empty. The coconut shrimp was fantastic. It was definitely the best thing on the buffet. Nothing else was memorable. The selection was good. Overall it was decent but I'll probably not be back anytime soon.

Text: Have eaten here several times over the past couple of years and have never been disappointed. The lunch menu and lunch buffet is downright inexpensive and the food was piping hot and tasty and I've ate at plenty of Chinese restaurants over the years

Text: Food was normal buffet Chinese style.  Unfortunately unable to be understood that I needed Sushi that was "fish" free.  Service was quick and place was clean.
