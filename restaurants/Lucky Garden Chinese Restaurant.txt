Text: A lot of food but definitly lacks quality, but a good place to go if you're just looking to get a full stomach. But with that said the wontons were amazing

Text: Everything was fantastic, delicious food, out quick, pretty cheap, I missed the buffet but oh well, I guess it's only at lunch. The reason for 4 stars is the waitress was rude as hell. From the moment I walked in she had the shittiest attitude. But other than that 5 stars
