Text: Not quite my favorite pizza, but a very close second, and my favorite place for "specialty" pizzas!  I personally recommend the BLT Pizza.  Great place for the whole family!

Text: Love this place! The pizza is always good and the service is good. It can get crowded but the wait is never very long. Nice outdoor seating patio.

Text: Our waitress was not good with the whole customer service. My experience at this location was not good, the out of the four  pizza we ordered only two were somewhat warm and when we informed our waitress and asked for the manager.....there was no response from the manager and they were playing the whole telephone technique with the waitress with us to see how to handle our complaint. I will go to the original pizza cottage in buckeye lake.

We ordered a Buffalo chicken pizza, veggie pizza, and Thai wings. For the Buffalo pizza, they used Buffalo sauce instead of tomato under the cheese, which made the pizza a lot better than it would have been by just drizzling a little sauce on the top. It had a generous amount of chicken on the top and came out nice and hot. The veggie pizza (again) had a generous amount of vegetables, including peppers and mushrooms. The Thai wings were very large and came with a lot of sweet Thai sauce with Thai-pepper flakes mixed in. Service was efficient and kind. Well worth the time and money.
