Text: Delicious pizza. Perfect crust to topping ratios and the fresh basil is refreshing. They also offer local craft beers that pairs very good with the pizza. When it comes to service, Nathan did an excellent job. He was very welcoming, polite and attentive.

Text: Really good pizza.

Edit: This is one of Omaha's greatest pizza. You cannot pass this without going in. Great pizza, great toasted ravioli, and to be honest, great salads!!!

Pizza by the slice!!

Text: Very good pizza!  The day I visited, we were getting pizza to go... when I showed up, it wasn't quite ready and they were busy, so the manager said "if you'd like to wait in the comfort of your car, I will bring it out to you."  Perfect!  They also were out of paper plates that evening, so the manager came up with the idea of using small to go boxes and cutting them in half... also perfect.  Great service and great experience!  Cant wait to go back!
