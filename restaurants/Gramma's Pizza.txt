Gramma's Pizza

Text: Mediocre. Employees aren't engaged in their work atmosphere. Ordered the lunch special--steak hoagie and fries. It was obvious the pizza sauce was put on the hoagie after the meat was cooked and bun was warmed, this created a very awkward sandwich. Place seemed dead. Employees were outside smoking most the time I was there. Must be nice to have a job being able to drag your feet and wear a frown all day. Place Literally barely lit and no energy at all, not a place I'd recommend to a friend but suppose it's "good enough" for the locals. Overall seems like a crappy little pizza place with no real bar set for customer interaction and satisfaction.

Text: As a visitor and first time patron true pizza was above average. You can tell the mozzarella and pizza dough is fresh.  The side salad for $2 was large along with fresh lettuce.  Staff is attentive and patient.  Overall worth a try.

Text: On Saturday October 7th to be exact I came to a small town called Bethel, Ohio. I was told by a friend to try a place called Gramma's Pizza. Let me tell you the service was horrible the employees are rude and my food sucked they didn't even get my order correct. I'm very dissatisfied by my service. Who ever the owner is really needs to re-evaluate their employees. Never again will I eat here or recommend Gramma's Pizza to NO ONE. I don't see what my friend called an awesome place to eat because my total experience was AWFUL!!!!!
