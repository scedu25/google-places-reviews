Text: Come here every year, and it is one of my favorite parts of the year, we bring our family and cousins and just make memories, we have never had any complaints, and the food here is amazing, and so is the service. Also I don't know why they are lying about the times the food comes and how the servers are "disrespectful" , because we rent the big table in the dining room with close to 20 people, and our food takes a good half hour to come, and the staff is so nice, all in all I love this place and its a great tradition honestly.

Text: Went to the Gettysburg festival this year and there was a great selection of local vendors. We also get our Christmas tree from here and the amount of trees to choose from will blow your mind. Thousands of cut your own in a beautiful setting.

Text: The food was pretty good, but the service was absolutely abysmal. It took over an hour just to get our side salads and even that required chasing down the inattentive waitress multiple times. Once the food came, some of it was wrong. Management was oblivious and unapologetic. I can't imagine ever wanting to return.

Text: delicious, no wait if you have reservations, price is a couple of dollars higher than the prices on their website.  They should update the website to reflect the real prices.

Text: Have been here multiple times but will no longer be a customer. Went in for a birthday celebration on a Saturday afternoon and received very inattentive service and a server that was unwilling to assist our needs. After talking to a manager three times there was still nothing done to help in making up for the horrible experiance. Extremely disappointed and will not be returning.
