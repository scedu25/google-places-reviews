Text: Interesting place, and very relaxing. It would be a perfect place to have a small wedding. Larry-the gentleman who was playing music was amazing. The owner-Deb was so nice and welcoming. We paid $30 for a history tour and cheese tray and it wasn't exactly $30 worth considering we were given chicken and biscuit crackers to eat. I would have much rather spent the money on their amazing wine and drank all day! My husband and I will be back to sample more wine and enjoy a longer stay.

Text: What a wonderful experience at the oldest estate winery in America.  The winery has an excellent selection of very well made wines and a charming history that just adds to the enjoyment of this historic winery.  The winery is adorned with comfortable seating and an atmosphere that can't be beat.  The music is wonderful and provides a nice subtle ambiance while sampling their award winning wines.  

I would highly recommend you try this winery out or better yet, stay in Augusta at the Hawkwood Hall Bed and Breakfast and make a weekend of it.
