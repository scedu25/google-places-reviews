Dynasty Buffet

Text: Wonderful atmosphere that makes you feel like you are in China and Japan at the same time without traveling far. The staff is very polite towards customers and super friendly. The food is magnificent. You can't begin to describe how delicious the food is especially my personal favorites are the cheese pizza and the fruit cocktail with the bananas, strawberries, and the yummy fruit sauce the restaurant chef mixes into the fruity cocktail. Even the music they play is very relaxing to listen to and enjoy while having a delicious meal there with friends and family.

Text: Good food for a great price.  Whole family of 5 (counting an 8 & a 3 yr old) ate on a Sunday afternoon for about $50.00.  stir fry grill and sushi bar were not impressive.  Found food fresh and tasty.  Will stop next time we're passing through.
