Text: Came here for an early dinner.  Such a beautiful building with so much history and character.  The early prix-fix dinner was very reasonable for $40 and included a delicious crab bisque soup and lobster tail entree. Though the Ghostbar was closed for a private event, we were still able to wander around and wonder at the stunning ceiling and decor. Highly recommend!

Text: Reserved for my wife's birthday here... OUTSTANDING SERVICE. Though the prices were higher than your franchise restaurants, it was still quite reasonable considering the service and food that we received!!
Wined and dined at the first level, sweetened up on level 2, then had a few more drinks up on the top level.
The house tour was cool too. Recommend doing that BEFORE drinking as there will be some stairs.
Would definitely go back again, and booking for my in-laws to go there for their anniversary. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Text: Excellent brunch. The building is fantastic to walk through. We took a guided tour that went through all three floors and learned about the owners and the history. The guide was very informative. The food afterward for the brunch was exceptional as well and service as one would expect was Top Notch

Text: My husband and I had our wedding reception there from 12-3:30PM on 10/21/17.  I was blown away by Sams (events coordinator) professionalism, attention to detail, and her calm and cooler demeanor.  She was nothing but a joy to work with and made our day even more special.  I highly recommend this place for wedding receptions.  The staff we had were super friendly and fun to be around.  We had a three course brunch menu and the food was PERFECT.  It being our wedding reception, of course the bar was raised high.  Sam met every expectation we asked for and she went above and beyond. I highly recommend this place.  They also let us bum around afterwards to take wedding pictures there.  We also did a cake cutting, hired a pianist and did dances on the second floor. It was just an incredible day and a large reason was because of Sam and her staff. Cant thank them enough!
