That Stop
Rating: 5
Text: I stopped here a few weeks ago before the eclipse. I have some food allergies and they very carefully made a delicious plain chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun. It was delicious. AND they had sweet potato fries. 
They also carry local jellies and jams-I always like to buy local foods! They also carried "Awake" brand chocolate bars with caffeine.
All in all, a nice place to stop if you are in the area.

Text: Really good hamburgers! Glad we stopped!  Google maps was not accurate as of this review. That Stop is about 1 mile east of Hyannis on highway 2.
