Text: Cool place! Prices were very reasonable! The chicken fried chicken was delicious with a very light breading. Excellent meal and kudos to the nice staff. Never would have stopped by if it hadn't been for my Nebraska passport!

Text: This is place is a throwback to another time - when men were men, and shot animals, lots of animals.  The place is covered floor to ceiling with taxidermy, some endangered.  This will either be a novelty or horror, depending on who you are.  The food isn't too bad.  My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were surprisingly good.  It's not gourmet, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy.  Worth a trip if you like curiosities, and want to see an elephant head / stuffed polar bear / dead giraffe.

Text: An awesome and interesting place!!! Lots of wildlife that has been mounted. Viewing pictures and reading of the original owner's adventures was very interesting. Food was delicious also. We were there for breakfast and was more than we could eat. Be warned, the pancakes are huge! Will be back when in the area!!!

Text: This is by far the best place to eat. There green beans taste farm fresh. Fried chicken wasn't oily at all. The big game on the wall was amazing.  Must eat here, you will leave full and happy.
