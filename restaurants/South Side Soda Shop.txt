Text: Excellent food! I've been here twice and both times I got the server from Sand Castle's (the movie). Fast, fresh, and made the way you want it.

As good as anything you will find on Passyunk Ave, or South Street!  
Genuine rolls too!  Well worth the drive from wherever you are if you are not in PA!
