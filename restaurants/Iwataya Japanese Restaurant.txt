Text: Truly authentic Japanese cuisine. 
I have been to Japan 2 times, and the food is very much the same! 
Great environment, great staff, amazing food, and very fairly priced. 

Will definitely be returning.

Text: It is the hidden gem of Evansville.  We've ate here several times and was very satisfied with the quality and service of this place.  It absolutely blows Kanpai out of the water.  If you order off the regular menu fantastic and if you order sushi even more fantastic.  By far the best service too.  It really is the best Japanese food in town the other restaurants are just posers.  Keep it up Iwataya!

Text: Traditional Japanese food that is by far the best in Evansville. I went with several students from Japan and they very much enjoyed the food. Beautiful interior that makes you feel like you are in a small town in Japan! Will be going here again in the future! 
I got the Ramen with pork and bamboo shoots.
