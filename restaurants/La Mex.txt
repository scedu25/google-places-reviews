Text: Our favorite place in town. The entire staff is wonderful. The food is always good and we always need a doggie bag. Warm chips and spicy salsa!! The best margarita in the country. (We travel a lot and have tried them everywhere and have yet to find another with this tangy-sweet bite.) And for the unmentionables...the bathrooms are always clean.

Text: La Mex has a very friendly staff. The food is delicious and is served very quickly. The margaritas are delicious. Our family has made it a point to stop here twice on our way from Chicago to St. Louis. We will continue to do so.
