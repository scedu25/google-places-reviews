Text: After two days of driving it was so great to stop and have food that tasted like home cooking. Mashed potatoes were amazing!  The kids loved that they could write on the floor and the fun games. The waiter was so polite. We showed up 30 minutes before closing and they welcomed us with open arms! Although the chicken was a little spicy (including kids tenders) the food, service,  and atmosphere was wonderful! 5 stars! 

P.S. lemon cheesecake was yummy!
