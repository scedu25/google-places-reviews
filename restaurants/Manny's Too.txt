Text: You've got to be from Fulton or Clinton to like this place. Is there taco seasoning in the taco meat? The taco sauce is just diced tomatoes and salt shaken in too much water. Taco Bell had a better taco (that's not a compliment to taco Bell either). I have two starts bc the people were friendly.
