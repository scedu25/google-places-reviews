Steak 'n Shake
Rating: 5
Text: Good location,  good service,  good food.  It's fast food for sure,  but one is waited on at the table,  and it's high-end fast food. Prices are comparable to bigger chain  joints offering far less service.  My family finds Steak 'n Shake a good value.

Text: I ordered the taco salad, which was really good, but a bit spicy. Dad ordered the chili, but didn't realize it was on a bed of spaghetti and used taco meat for the chili, so that's why I did four stars instead of five. The waitress was wonderful as well as the manager.

Text: This was the best place we ate on our vacation. We stopped for the kids to take a break and grab something to snack on.  The prices were affordable and the burgers and fries were the best we have had in a looking time. Loved this place

Text: I arrived during the lunch rush and my food was cold, they gave me scraps for my fries and it was not a very friendly atmosphere. If you're headed east on I44, just bypass this one because there are plenty more just east of this location. One is less than 30 minutes away. Would have given this location zero stars if it wasn't for my server.
