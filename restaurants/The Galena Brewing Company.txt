Text: Love this place! Awesome beer and atmosphere. My only criticism is do not bake the wings!! The skin was soft and chewy. Could only eat one bite.

Text: My mom and I visited the brewery on a Friday and ordered a flight, which was only $5 and all the beers were delish! The bartender was fantastic, he answered all of our questions and was just genuinely a nice guy. We also took the tour which was a nice way to spend an hour and get a beer all for $8! We went back the next day and tried the nachos, which were extremely spicy. Next time we will probably just stick to a beer.
