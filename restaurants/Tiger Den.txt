Text: Good place to eat in Lenox. Small space, but nice cafe food nonetheless. Ice cream is a must here as well.

Text: We came in right at nine pm. I gave an order than tipped over seven dollars in appreciation for staying a bit later for my to go order. They messed up my order. That was fine. However, my burger was extremely salty and I wondered if that was done on purpose. 
If I wasn't trying to run across the country, I would have laughed about the service. However, I really needed a good burger. Today's 20-26 miles is going to be painful.

Text: Ally might, or might not, have done better than me. I was just here, for a day. On the job. So, I dropped in at the Tiger's Den at 4 in the afternoon. Besides a couple of kids who just kind of stood there staring at me like I had horns coming out of my head (and seemed like they might have been extras from "Children Of The Corn"), I was told they were closed. At 4 in the afternoon? They're closed at 4 in the afternoon? So… anyway… went up the street to Casey's and got a perfectly fine sandwich with tater wedges and drink. Somehow, I get the feeling the ol' Tiger Den ain't much used to strangers? Which is mostly why I'm even bothering to mention this. Giving it two-stars because I can't exactly say I hated it; I just found nothing much to like.
