Text: called about bounced checks and the rude "lady" that answered the phone hung up on me.  Sounds like they run the office like they run the kitchen - crappy

Text: a Saturday. Ordered for lunch at 11:30. Said it would be ready in 20. My co-worker ordered right before me would take 1hour cause it as cheese crust. Ok no big deal. I get there and no pizza. Ask how long its going to be.Maybe another 10-15 cause its not made. Ask about my coworkers pizza. Not made yet. It will take  hour after ordering 25 min ago.  No good 
'cause i have to go back to work in 10 min. Girl said" well I dont know. I can cancel your order then." yes please!  VERY DISAPPOINTED. Will not attempt ordering again.

Text: Pizza is usually alright about 75% of the time. When told it will be 20-25 minutes, go ahead and add about 10 more minutes to that. Their coupon book is a good deal which makes me give it the third star. The place is good if the other pizza places in town are busy.

Text: The pizza is mediocre at best and the way they treat their employees is horrendous.  It's a shame when a pizza place gets business yet their employees can't cash their checks due to insufficient funds at almost every payday.  The assistant manager has facial piercings and such and is in front of the public customers, yet they are worried about their drivers wearing a baseball cap backwards... I'll NEVER do business there and neither will any of our friends and family! Take your business elsewhere!
