Text: Great food! I always get the brisket and it's always good. The pork steak is a good portion, juicy, and very tender. Definitely a must try if you're in Cape.

Text: Services was horrible. We were seated with only a menu for me. No waitress greeted me are boyfriend. We sat 10 min. 4 employees stood only a few feet way. At the very next table 4 people were sitted given menus drink orders taken very attentive service. 
My boyfriend ask for the manager, she simply turned around and proceeded to apologize and state they had new employees. Which I feel is a good reason to pay more  attention in those areas as the manager. We left never to return.

Text: Food excellent.  Atmosphere historic and neat.  If they got rid  of the smoking section, perfect.  If they haven't, and you're sensitive to this, don't go.  Ventilation isn't adequate for smoking.  Service has almost always been just "okay".  The food and atmosphere make up for that.
