Text: Wife took one bite of the egg drop soup and spit it out. Never seen her do that before. Some of the other food was edible but not great. Prices reasonable. Service was fast, polite, and everything was clean.

Text: I must have come on a bad day for these guys because my experience was nothing like other reviews, the pot stickers and egg rolls here were hands down the worst I have ever had and the service was horrible.

Text: Very good for food court chinese.  Most dishes are made to order.  People are very nice.  My favorite is the Kung Pao Chicken, extra hot.
