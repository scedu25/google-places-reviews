Text: Make sure you have dessert. The taster has 5 different tastings on it. The husband really like is wrap. Sons girlfriend loved the tomato soup. I had curried chicken not knowing  what I was getting. It was good.  Different tastes. Fun experience. Waitress was very helpful with menu

Text: Rode our motorcycles 2 hours to this restaurant. Great service and amazing food! Bean dip was amazing and also the goat cheese wrap. I also tried a bite of my husband's burger which was amazing too. Worth the drive! You would never know it is there though. Loved the little touches like the menus and the glass ware also!

Text: My friends surprised me with a birthday lunch at this British-inspired restaurant.  The food and service were fabulous.  It would be just about perfect if they re-decorated with a British pub theme.

Text: My boys loved the sausage egg and cheese bagel (pictured on gluten free). T
Grilled cheese and tomato soup was an experience, though I did NOT like the balsamic vinegar on the grilled cheese piece. Husband had 1/2 clubhouse and there was a cup of fresh spinach in there, presumably to disguise the lack of meat present? Worms in dirt custard was great, though.

Text: Diamond in the ruff !!! This is an absolute must have if you love good food. Everything from rainbow trout to ribeyes is to die for good. Menu was an eclectic mix of British favorite foods and flavor packed originals. My bourbon bbq pulled pork with mint jelly was Killer good. Pull off the hwy NOW it's worth the drive.
