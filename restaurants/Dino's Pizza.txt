Text: Took a hour to get our food but they told us it was going to be that long. When the food arrived the food was cold we got the 60 piece seafood meal . The wife reheated it cause our grandsons where hungry it was after 8 pm when it got here. I called at 945 to tell them and he said they couldn't do anything about it but if we called when the food came they would have remade it then it would have taken a other hour to get to my house. Then the kids would be hungry even more.. I'll just never order anything from them again

Text: Got one Italian sub asked for no lettuce and dressing on the side.  I got a sub with lettuce, dressing 3 pepperoni cheap save a lot ham and Bologna.  Also got a case of beer 3 packs of cigarettes and another sub with ham and cheese.  I could have made the food look and taste better. Paid $53 for the whole total. Called back and advised of my concerns .  Was told I should have read the menu better.  And that they don't do refunds.  I asked to speak to the owner was told they don't come in.  If you want cheap subs that taste like cheap welfare jail house subs.  Then by all means pay the $12.99 for the subs this place charges. Cause what place puts Bologna on a sub.  I could've went to subway and got a better deal.. one reason I gave one star because the drive was very nice.  Will never go back and do not order there food.  It's sucks!!!!!
