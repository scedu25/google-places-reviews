Text: Pretty good food.  Prices aren't bad. It's comfortable.  It's clean. The staff and service is probably the best thing about this restaurant, they're very very good.  Food is somewhat Americanized but is still delicious.  The Mexican murals are amature, they need to commission a professional Mexican artist to make the atmosphere really great. Overall I would definately recommend this restaurant.
