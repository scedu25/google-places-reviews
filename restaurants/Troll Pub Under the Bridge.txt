Troll Pub Under the Bridge

Text: My friends and I were visiting Louisville and this spot was on our must-do list.  When we stopped by on a Sunday night at 9pm we were rudely told that the bar was closed. This was strange because the local Urban Bourbon guidebook says they close at midnight and Google says they close at 2pm. If they closed early that's fine but they should lock the door and/or put up a sign. So disappointed with them, not just for closing early but for their rudeness.

Text: Really great place to eat. Met with some co-workers over lunch. Their fried pickles were fantastic. The Philly Cheese steak sandwich was awesome.

Text: Place was fantastic, I go pretty frequently. My favorite dish is the hot brown. I forget his name, but the bartender who wears the LA hat is great.
