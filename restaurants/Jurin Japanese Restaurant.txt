Text: Food was great. I wish they had asian music just to go with the ambiance but instead they had spanish music, not that it's a bad thing but I was really looking to get the whole japanese experience. Thumbs up though! Would definitely visit again.

Text: We visited the geneva location, the food was very good, staff was friendly, and habitchi was entertaining. However, the restaurant itself was very outdated and dingy looking.

Text: Brought my 9 year old for birthday and this place had her smiling the whole time. Her friends loved it as well. Great food and even better staff. Always enjoyed the times I've been here.

Text: Horrible!  My Hibachi was super greasy and wife's sushi was very generic.  Jurin in South Elgin is night and day different.  This location is just terrible.
