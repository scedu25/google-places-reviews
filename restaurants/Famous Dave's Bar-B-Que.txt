Famous Dave's Bar-B-Que

Text: Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, our server was very attentive.  We enjoyed Texas brisket, Georgia Pork, St. Louis Ribs, and of course some rib tips (I love 'em and you usually get a lot, since many people feel they are inferior)!  All the meat was tender with a modest amount of bbq sauce.  We had plenty of other sauces at the table to choose from for additional meat-smothering goodness.  We rounded it off with some broccoli and Wilbur beans.  Seating was okay due to coming in at 3pm, but I can imagine rush hour being a bit cramped.  My advice would be to come either mid afternoon or after 7pm for the best seating and service.

Text: This is a fun place to come if you like barbeque. The atmosphere is casual and the people who come are generally a fun bunch. The food is succulent. The sauces are spicy and sassy. I especially like the hot ones! There's lots to choose from and there are some unique items as well.

Text: Called to place an order for pick up and was told it would be an hour and a half before we could pick up food. Hesitantly, we agreed and placed order (even though it would be 830pm). We arrived a little early, but fully expected to wait until original given time. We did not get our food until almost 9 pm, and no one at all came out to update us! That's just poor service.

Text: Very uncomfortable atmosphere!!! Asked several times to have overhead air vent turned down. Not only was I cold but so was my food. Needless to say the request went unaddressed, even after speaking with the Asst. Manager who didn't even offer to reseat us. Corporate will learn of this complaint because no other guest was experiencing this issue but I'm lead to believe that was because no other guest was of color ?
