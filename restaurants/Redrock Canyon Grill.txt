Text: Phenomenal. Best food and service experience I've had that I can recall. I was very impressed with how well they took care of our large party event, it really was shockingly great. The steak... the steak was perfect, it's hard to get a good steak.. they only serve great steaks. They set the bar in every category.

Text: This is our " Go to " place whenever we have a special evening or out of town guests.  The food is always good, the prices are reasonable and the service is first rate.  I dare anyone to try and outpace the servers when it comes to emptying your water glass. They'll refill it as quickly as you empty it and as often as you empty it.

We usually split their Pork chop dinner....  Two meaty pork chops and a side for $19.00.....  Sounds expensive until you see how meat you really get.  Almost all their meals are similarly portioned.  So come hungry, be prepared to share, or expected to be bringing home left-overs!

Text: This restaurant is in Wichita superstar! Probably my favorite restaurant in the city. I think one of my favorite things about the restaurant is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. This is not a New York City steakhouse, or a coastal seafood establishment.  And they don't try to act like a high-end, reservations only  dining club by putting on airs.  Instead, they offer great steaks, delicious rotisserie chicken, comfort food sides, creative martinis, and  desserts worth splitting your stomach over.   Try the ribeye with the red wine reduction and Gorgonzola topping. Possibly one of my top five steaks in the country.  And to top it off, the service is the best in the entire city. Literally. Hands-down. I have never had a bad service experience at this restaurant. Ever!

Text: The food is good and the service is good. For the price, I have other restaurants that I prefer, but my wife loves this place. I will say the key lime pie is very good.
