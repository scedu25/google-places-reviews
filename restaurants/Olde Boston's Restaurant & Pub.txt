Text: Food good. Waitress needs training and listen to requests. Took orders ok. Brought salad with meal. Should at least ask if we wanted meal after salad or with. Never brought soda refills  but asked alcohol drinkers several times. Had to ask if it was two checks or one after we had told her. one asked for shrimp topping on the side. It came on the shrimp.
