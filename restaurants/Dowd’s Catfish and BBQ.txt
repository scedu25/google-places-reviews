Dowd’s Catfish and BBQ
Rating: 3
Text: The people were extremely friendly. The sweet tea was good. If you go get the catfish. Not the brisket. DEFINITELY not the brisket. It's cut thin like roast beef or lunch meat and extremely dry. The BBQ beans are also not good. At all. But it's probably because they put the brisket in it, which taste like liquid smoke.

Text: A great lunch while on a road trip. The catfish and brisket were good, but the catfish needed a little help from some hot sauce and none was on the table. My wife didn't like the flavor of the cole slaw either

Text: Solid place. Had the catfish and the cornmeal is very good and the catfish was cooked just right... fully cooked but still juicy. Good stuff.

Text: Great lunch spot! Fried catfish was delicious. Don't stop if you're in a hurry, service is good, but a little slow. Overall, don't pass it up.

Text: I'd give it 5 stars if they had a better selection of BBQ sauce.  The service was great, and the food taste great.  However, a BBQ joint with only one sauce on the table???  Come on now.
