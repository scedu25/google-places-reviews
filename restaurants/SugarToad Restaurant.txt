Text: Delicious and well presented meals, from burgers and BBQ to salads that can match any palate. The room is dark but modern style, and the banana bread pudding is off the chart, a favorite I still dream about. So worth the calories to share, and the rasberry cheese cake was almost as good!

Text: I was recently in Chicago for business and knew I had to stop by Lou Malnati's to try one of the best (and original) deep dish pizzas in Chicago. I was not disappointed. It was outstanding!

Text: We went on Saturday at 6 pm with dinner for 5. Seated right away. Waiter was rushed and busy the whole time and not very friendly. Had to ask each time for his attention to order a drink.
