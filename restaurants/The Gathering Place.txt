Text: Great food! Sandwiches are made with homemade bread, with a pasta salad that's yummy. And the cinnamon pie is to die for.

Text: This restaurant is worth traveling to Stafford to enjoy.  All the ingredients are fresh and healthy and everything is  made from scratch.  The hamburgers are a full 1/2 pound and have creative toppings. I've enjoyed the Reuben sandwiches, Cobb salad, and ribs and loved them all.  The sweet potato fries are crisp.  Potato chips are homemade too. There are different pies every day, but the cinnamon cream pie and the peanut butter meringue are especially good.  You can buy your cinnamon rolls Saturday night to eat for breakfast on Sunday.  Music on Saturday night adds to the fun and community spirit.
