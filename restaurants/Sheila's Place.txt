Text: This used to be an awesome place to take friends to eat. We'd go 2-3 times a month. Recommended to dozens of people. Two times we have had to send the food back "3" times on each occasion. First time was steak. This time grilled chicken that both my sister & I ordered . We had to wait 30 minutes before being served initially.  Asked if we could get a discount. All they gave us was 2 free drinks. Extremely disappointed.

Text: Absolutely great food. Prices can't be beat either. My only complaint is that it is so far for me to drive here! Breakfast or lunch options available. Good for families or bigger groups. Try the cashew chicken or cinnamon rolls!

Text: Very homestyle food. I definitely recommend the roast beef. I had it on bread with mashed potatoes as served on their menu and it was amazing. All of the staff were helpful and kind! Most people don't even know it's there because it's a little further than rotary park but it's worth the trip out there. Also, the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that is served. Will definitely be returning!

Text: Fresh salad bar. Homemade French dressing. Open faced roast beef sandwich was fantastic ! We ordered two slices of homemade pie to go! Coconut cream and peanut butter chip . Best pie we've ever had ('cept grandma's of course) but awful close to beating grandma's. We will definitely be back soon !
