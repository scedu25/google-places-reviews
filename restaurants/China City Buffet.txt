Text: Terrible service! Asked for napkins so waitress walks off without saying anything. I assumed she hears me and just say to myself alrighty then. So when she comes she gives four of us 5 napkins.... the little ones lol and before I can say anything she attempts to walk off.... once again without saying a word. I politely say excuse me will the advertised hibachi griller be out. She finally speaks! Tells us to hold on. He came out after almost 5 minutes. They had no shrimp. The crab ragoon was anything but crab. I asked about that and was told they were out of crab as well. Mind you it's like 3pm! Well after all that we still paid full price so we just kept our tips in our pockets!

Text: This is by far my favorite place to get Chinese food on the west side of town. It's a smaller buffet with three different buffet bars, but they also have the sushi and hibachi grill, which is what sets it apart. It's included and you can mix and match anything you want and they cook it fresh for you.

Text: This restaurant is no good. I found nets in my pudding and cantaloupe. The cream cheese in the sushi tasted spoiled. The plates were very wet and non dried. I will never come here again

Text: Clean, fresh food and polite staff.  Only complaint is the low rent customers who are pigs and LOUD. Staff sticks everyone in the same section to make clean up more convenient for them to accomplish. So be prepared to deal with belching kids and their moronic parents.
