Text: Never disappointed!  That's not something i can say many places.   Been a fan my entire life, back when it was called Italian Village and my neighbor owned it.  Wonderful memories there, but if the current owners didn't live up to it, I'd say so.  I love to watch the Cardinals play here.  Friendly staff, great food, cold drinks.   AWESOME!
