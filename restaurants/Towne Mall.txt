Text: Everything I need and want, at this time, is at this mall.  I don’t have to travel 30 miles to a mall.  The clothes are trendy and affordable. The employees are helpful and Security is visible. I’m comfortable shopping knowing there are trained security on hand.

Text: It's just at the OK level, the biggest issue is the food court is terrible, not much there and the places there at very annoyed when you order food from them and the quality of the food is really poor. Sometimes the automated disabled doors do not work it's pretty much hit and miss.
