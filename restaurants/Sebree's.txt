Text: We had great food and wonderful, friendly service. The food tasted really fresh and and there was a great variety. I had an okra stew with fresh vegetables that was amazing. Other things at the table that were very good: chicken piccata, prime rib sandwich and fettuccini Alfredo. Would love it if they had a couple more vegetarian options.

Text: We enjoyed a fabulous dinner here this evening! The service was very prompt and friendly and drinks were kept refilled regularly. Highly recommend the caprese salad, garden fresh tomatoes and so flavorful. The prime rib sandwich with creamy horseradish was delicious. And save room for dessert... the Ghiradelli brownie with ice cream was to die for! Definitely will be back!
