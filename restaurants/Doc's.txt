Text: Best Rib Eye steak I've ever had. It's what brings me back and takes up the whole plate! My friend had chicken and rib combo and said it was pretty good. We tried the nachos with everything on it, but it was a bust for us. The cumin was overwhelming on it. I tried the cheese nachos another time and they were good with a generous amount of cheese. Mashed Potatoes are also very good. 
I haven't tried other things on the menu because I always want the Rib Eye. Maybe I will order things to take home for later.
