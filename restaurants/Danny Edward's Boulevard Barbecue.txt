Danny Edward's Boulevard Barbecue

Text: We visited during a food tour and were blown away by the burnt end sandwich and the staff! Danny himself gave us a tour of the kitchen and smokers, he was so passionate about his business, food and customers. Great place!

Text: If there were a hall of fame of barbecue, Danny Edwards would surely own a corner. 
The burnt ends are authentic from the fat cap  - most burnt ends even in KC are not true burnt ends.  
Today they gave me some house made pickles and it is the first time I've not been disappointed in homemade pickles.  
Eat here. It is true KC BBQ and off the beaten path of the usual Q trail.

Text: Great food. Friendly staff.  We arrived just after the lunch rush. It has been years since we last visited.  It was actually known as Lil Jake's the last we were there,  Food was every bit as good as we remembered.

Text: Great friendly place. You get waited on just like a restaurant but you order at the counter. Best Big D burnt ends in the city.

Text: Great quality BBQ that seems to be a bit of a secret in KC, but their food is up there with the better known KC spots. Highly recommend it. Service was great and our server kept doting on my toddler, which was nice.
