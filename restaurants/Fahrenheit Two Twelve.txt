Fahrenheit Two Twelve

Text: HORRIBLE. Soooo disappointed. Had been coming here every so often and did at the time enjoy the food. WOW ! Has it ever changed and not for the good.  I took my daughter their for dinner and the quality of the food was terrible. The perch was soggy, the rice was overcooked as were the beans. They she had a dead FLY in her soup. When we showed the waiter he had this shocked look on his face. He took it and walked away and didn't come back for like 10 minutes, laid down the check and said thank you. !!!!! WHAT!!!  No manager, No, I'm sorry,  No discount, Didn't even ask how our food was or if we wanted dessert. Will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN !!!!!

Text: This is an attempt to bring casual dining mixed with fine dining atmosphere. Casual dress is ok, you will pay fine dining prices and not as good food.
We were pretty bummed. The menu didn't match what was online either. Good service though. Save your money go to another place.

Text: We could not have had a more pleasant brunch. The staff was amazing. The buffet was great. The staff constantly prepared fresh food for the buffet. My friend, myself, and our kids loved this place. We had terrible experice at jellys the weekend prior, so Fahrenheit two twelve definitely restored our confidence in visiting local restaurants. Thanks to staff for our awesome experience!!
