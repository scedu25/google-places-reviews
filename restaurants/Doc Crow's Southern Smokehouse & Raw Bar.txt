Text: Don't believe the trolls!  This place is fabulous.  This place was packed (waited about 30 minutes for a table after being quoted 45) and the service was fast and friendly.  Had baby back ribs with hush puppies, both amazing.  The barbecue sauce is some of the best I've ever had (spicy!) and the cocktails are well worth the price.  Will absolutely come back next time I'm in Louisville!

Text: Went for the BBQ and was seriously disappointed.  I mean seriously.  Potato salad looked interesting but tasted old, potatoes were dry.  It was over-thought in trying to be unique.  Onion fries were great.  Waitress was very nice but never asked if we wanted a refile.  All in all I think it was the most over-priced below average food we ever had.

Text: Place was amazing. Prices were reasonable. Husband had a chicken sandwich and I had half rack of St. Louis ribs. Very meaty and delicious. Neither of us could finish our plates. There was a lot of food per plate. Friendly and clean environment. We will be back.

Text: Great atmosphere, location. Lots of really good dishes to choose from. I grabbed a half rack of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, and fries. Perfect. Loads of drinks to choose from. Menu has two full pages of bourbon to choose from, a whole page of whiskey, all among the wine and beer. Definitely starred this one for a return trip.

Text: Went here for a business lunch and was a bit apprehensive because some of my coworkers and I are vegetarian. This places has a great meat/seafood menu, but also has some delicious options for vegetarians. We got the veggie burger, tomato bisque, spicy chips, and the green beans. Potions were very generous, and food tasted food.
