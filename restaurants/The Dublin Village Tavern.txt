Text: Loved. Loved this place while we were in Columbus recently. Good prices and really Irish. The building use to be the town's post office and something else but our waitress didn't know off the top of her head which is fine. If you love fish n chips... They have one of the BEST in Ohio that I have EVER tasted. Lightly battered and homemade tartar sauce. You can't go wrong. The ruben is amazzzinngggg as well. Highly recommend this place to ANYONE going to Columbus to visit.

Text: Typical Irish pub like you would find just about anywhere in the world.   Staff was very pleasant.  Being from out of town, we asked our server for a place the locals would go for a good breakfast.  He had a few suggestions and a few more of the staff stopped by the table and gave their suggestions.
Shepard's pie and The Irish Dinner Kettle were excellent.   I asked where they got the bangers as they were some of the best I have had.  They stated they were imported from Ireland.  Nice selection of beer. I strayed from my typical Guinness and was not disappointing.  (but still had a pint of Guinness for old times sake ;-) )

Text: Great place to seek out if you visit Columbus! The appetizer egg roll was amazing! The soup was super delicious! And the sliders were pretty tasty too, and nice hot fresh fries. Fries tend to be the judgement of great places.

Text: I love this place.  The hamburger and fries are good and they have this Mac and cheese that is heavenly.  We don't go as often as we'd like, but every time we've been there we've had excellent service.

Text: My mother and I stopped for a quick bite and had the hummus plate, mac and cheese, and an Irish coffee. (A real Irish coffee, though I would suggest asking for light sugar). The ffod was good and the service was great.
