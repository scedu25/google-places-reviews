Text: One of the best places to eat in Gothenburg! Really busy at lunch time! Servers do a great job to keep up and it's worth waiting for. Other times of day it can be quiet. I'm from Texas and this is as close as I can find nearby for great Mexican food. I love the Manny's Tacos or house special (flat flour shell topped with beans, ground beef, etc). Very reasonable prices. They do not serve alcoholic drinks, so if you need your margarita fix with your enchiladas you'll have to go to El Paraiso in Cozad.
