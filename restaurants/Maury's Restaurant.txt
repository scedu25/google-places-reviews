Maury's Restaurant
Rating: 2
Text: The last time I was there. Was 2 days ago. The place was packed and people  were being served in about 45 minutes. One table at a time. Received my cold eggs and hash browns and under average bacon and then my hard flapjack. The point in this review. The disgust on people's faces. One waitress doing all the tables. Coffee refills were few and far between.  Then when I received my food it had a long hair stuck in the hash browns. This of coarse was all do to some rain that brought construction workers in. This has happened to me twice. The last thing was what one construction worker said about the biscuits and gravy. He said the gravy was from a can and tasted so salty that he couldn't swallow it. I've had it once never again. For the most part it's fairly priced. The food is becoming more institutionalized. Like school cafeteria food. Bland!!!!!!!! Clay Center has got a real problem with  restaurants. No competition. No alternatives. I could whip up 3 eggs and good hash browns and bacon in 10 minutes. It would look and taste good too. Maury's needs a change or some better management.  The family is getting away with lousy service and cheap food. The customers deserve better.You won't see me there any time soon. Save your money.

Text: There was a 40 minute wait for food, so we just went for the cinnamon roll and coffee.  The cinnamon roll was the size of my head - we split it - the roll, not my head. The coffee was excellent.
