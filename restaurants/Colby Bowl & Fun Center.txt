Colby Bowl & Fun Center
Rating: 5
Text: Drove through Colby last year in June during a trip to Colorado, and I hoped to find a nice pool room to relax at in this area. The employee here could not have been more pleasant or helpful. They have a well maintained 9 foot pool table and a safe and clean establishment. The food and drink were also very good and at a fair price. I am planning another trip this year and I look forward to stopping by again. This was a perfect break from long hours on the road.
