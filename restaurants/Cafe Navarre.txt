Text: We had brunch.  Service and ambiance was excellent.  Food was very good.  We were told it was a new menu.  With a few tweaks they could easily be 5 star in my book.

Text: Food is okay, we ordered duck, and lamb. The French onion soup was probably the better dish although it was very salty. Wine list was very underwhelming. Service was good although it seemed that "of course" was their favorite response. The place looks nice service is of good quality. Lacks the skillful cooking, and overall level elegance of restaurants of this caliber.

Text: Great place for lunch, especially if you are hosting a meeting or have out of town visitors. The staff are very professional. Love the salads and mushroom soup!

Text: Love this place.  Great atmosphere inside, and the patio is fantastic during a warm summer day / evening.  My current go to is a Navarre Salad with grilled chicken.  They also have a hamburger (off menu, available in the Bar area).
