Text: I had been going to this hill regularly until last winter 2016. It was just okay hills and okay snow quality. Nothing special. Always hated their staff as none of them seemed to want to be there and only helped you if you prodded them. This always beyond bugged me, but I had an issue with a rental I made that pushed me over the edge when it comes to serviced. I was met with the most rude employees and Managment I’ve ever seen. The only person working there that was understanding and good at dealing with the issue was the what I thought was the supervisor (someone seemingly higher up than the managers I had previously been talking to). By the point that I had actually talked to this lady, I had decided I was leaving mid day and not coming back. Bad Taco Bell service makes you feel like royalty in comparison.

Wont be coming back. 

I would recommend chestnut mountain it’s an extra hour and a half commute for me but so worth it. It’s worth it not only for their excellent staff, but also the much more exciting and challenging terrain. Or if that’s too far for you Alpine is a good second. It’s cheaper and the staff is better. I honestly don’t see any reason to go to this resort and I honestly don’t know why I was going there for so long. I guess I used to like what’s familiar.

Text: We hosted our wedding ceremony/reception at Walt's Tavern @ Wilmot Mountain (10/7/17) What a GREAT choice!  The team at Wilmot was thorough in execution and made sure we had exactly what we wanted.  The venue was unique but provided all the standard needs to host our 150 guests.  Walt's has such a romantic vibe that we were able to do minimal decorating and just let the light fixtures and exposed beams highlight the room!  Isaac, the executive chef, made such an amazing fall meal.  Roasted root vegetables, apricot chutney pork tenderloin, chicken marsala with wild mushrooms... it was a total WIN!  The bartending staff were also incredible.  Open bar, the entire night, no one ever waited for a drink!  I can't say enough about this experience.  I would HIGHLY recommend working with Adam, Isaac, and the team at Wilmot for any wedding reception or private event!  Walt's Tavern is the perfect venue, so glad they are hosting events, the renovations make this a new gem for southeastern Wisconsin!

Text: Vail/Wilmot will succeed in ruining the sport of skiing in the Chicago area by charging $64.00/adult on weekends. Imagine a husband and wife with maybe two kids plus some food and your bill will be around $200.00! Who can afford that if you only want to come out a few times during the season? I've been skiing Wilmot Mtn. since 1960/61 under the ownership of the Stopa family. We knew them very well! They were generous people all along. Not Vail with their big corporate dreams in buying up family owned operations!!! Go to Alpine Valley, WI a 1/2 hr. beyond with three high speed lifts and a higher hill.

Text: The hill is already very small and every Sunday they close the best run (in the middle of the hill) for just a handful of racers. You would think after Vail purchased the hill they would have kicked these goons out and setup a proper resort for everyone to use on the weekend but I guess having to keep these pests around was in the purchase contract.
