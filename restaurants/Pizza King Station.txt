Pizza King Station

Text: Pizza was okay. Train is always cool. Service was slow since there was only one server that night. But she still did a pretty decent job.

Text: In an age of artisanal this and boutique that, sometimes you just want that delicious everyman's pizza of your childhood; thin crusted, with ordinary, greasy, unapologetic ingredients.  This place isn't going to try to tell you it's a facsimile of some authentic Tuscan pizzeria; its the pizzeria your parents took you and your siblings to on a Sunday night because they didn't want to cook, and you loved every minute of it.

The pizza is delicious, the train is charming, the interior design is locked in the late 1970's, and I hope they don't venture to change a thing about it...except for maybe a bigger selection of beer.

Text: Good sticks, decent pizza, and good cold drinks. Service was great by both the people servers and the cool train drink deliveries.
