Buckhorn Lake State Resort Park

Text: We went to spend an evening at the park. It's too? early in the year to have the restaurant fully functional, and we knew that going in. The staff was helpful when we mentioned the guitar player as a neighbor. They took care of the problem. As with most State parks, this one is dated... But the room was clean with everything in it the was supposed to be be there. A continental breakfast was a surprise, but, we got up early and headed out before it was available. We have been to many Kentucky State Parks and the experience at Buckhorn is right up there with the others. I hope we can stop by when we have more time to explore the park.
