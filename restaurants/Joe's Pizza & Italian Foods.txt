Text: Waited an hour and fifteen minutes for 2 pizzas, bosco sticks and fried ravioli after being told 35-40 minutes, and the sour cream and taco sauce was missing from the taco pizza. Used to be my favorite pizza in town.....

Text: One of our favorite places to stop always great service and the food is fantastic.  Not sure how I like the remodeled restaurant area it is smaller and feels cramped. Since we always have kids with us we don't go to the bar side.
