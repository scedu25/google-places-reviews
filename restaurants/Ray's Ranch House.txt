Text: Decent home cooking, all you can eat fish specials and friendly staff. Country restaurant atmosphere so don't be surprised if they are out of a specific dish.

I can't talk about the bar side, but the restaurant side is cute with a lot of food for cheap. It's where my family goes when no one feels like cooking.
