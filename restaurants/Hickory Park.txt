Text: This place is quite enjoyable. It is big and they are usually busy but the wait times are not bad. Prices are great for fresh made food but it is a bit like family style. One thing some people may not realize is they do not put any sauce on the meat while they smoke it. It tends to need some sauce as the meat gets a bit dry during cooking. But the flavor is great. They have two heats of sauce on the table to choose from. I cant ask anything more than they provide so they get a 5 star. good for medium sized groups and possibly large groups.

Text: Was great.  Got right in, got waited on promptly.  Got our orders.  I had the tenderloin was very good.  Crisp on the outside juicy and tender on the inside.  Salad was ok.  May have just been crushed lettuce but did not present well.  Looked dry and old.

Text: Very good barbecue and great selection of ice cream treats. Either would be worth the trip. Together it was great. Leave room for dessert if you can? My wife is gluten free and thought this establishment was exceptional.
