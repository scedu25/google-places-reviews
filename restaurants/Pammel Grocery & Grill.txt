Pammel Grocery & Grill

Text: You must eat here while in Ames. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. The service is amazing. They sell all kinds of fruit juices and sodas. I've witnessed the owner sit down with a customer to talk about Christianity and Islam in a very respectful and understanding manner, even though, the customer was being extremely rude. Also, almost every time I've sat down for lunch in the summer, they have passed out free slices of homegrown watermelon or honeydew. Truly an amazing place.

Text: Love the food from the deli in the back! They are very friendly and helpful. Lots of options of things to buy also, but they might have more stuff than their store can handle. Aisles are full!

Text: I lived in Ames for a little over 5 years & Pammel Grocery is one place I will not forget.  I was studying Arabic over the Summer one year & our professor treated our small class to lunch here one day.  The food was fantastic, but also memorable was the owner who realized why we were there & sat down & joined us.  We were all from different backgrounds, including our professor, but the owner engaged us as if we were all old friends.

Text: Decent place to eat ethnic food. And also since it's closer to campus, it's really helpful. Food is good and I like it :-) affordable and cheap too.
