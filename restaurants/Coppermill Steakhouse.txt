Text: Not to bad of a steakhouse. Usually can find negative in any place I eat at but this one is different. Good burger and the lobster mac and cheese was on point. Kept my sweet tea full and let me use the free beer voucher from hotel for tea. Pretty pricey on the mains and steak side of the menu but that's a steakhouse for ya. Bartenders very friendly and the rest of the house seemed to be on their game as I looked around. Would recommend if your in the area.  Never rate five stars as there is always room for improvement.

Text: Way overpriced for what you get and lay off the salt.   So almost every meal here is $20 or over and you only get one side which includes potato and you ask for Heinz 57 steak sauce and you bring house recipe out.   I mean talk about cutting corners.    My salad consisted of lettuce, cheese and croutons.  Oh and 2 green beans.  What a joke.  The kids meal at 7.95 was three pieces of 15 count shrimp and one side.    The au graiten potatoes were just grated hash browns in some thick cheese paste.      The service was great except the bartender sat us down and asked what do you want to drink. But never offered a drink menu or told us what they had.
