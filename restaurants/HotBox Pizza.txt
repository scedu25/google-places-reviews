Text: EDIT: After 2 hours my food showed up. The manager I spoke with on the phone was very courteous and gave me in-store credit. Still, only have 1 delivery person on staff just because it's a weeknight? Doesn't make sense to me if you are advertising 45 minute delivery, but okay.

ORIGINAL: Do not order delivery from this establishment. I ordered online and after 90 minutes with no pizza, I called them. This it what they said : "Your order is taking longer than expected. Would you like me to cancel the order?" My food was supposed to arrive in 45 minutes. Instead I ended up waiting 90 minutes for no food and a pizza place asking me if I want to cancel my order. What a joke.

Text: It's too bad giving one star is the lowest option possible. Very disappointed that it took almost 2 hours to get a delivery order of a simple cheesestix. When the order arrived it was cold, stale, and lacked in taste and quality. Sorely disappointed.

Text: Great food. Good value. Has that local hole-in-the-wall feel, but in a good way.
