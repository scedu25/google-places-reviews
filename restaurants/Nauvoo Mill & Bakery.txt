Nauvoo Mill & Bakery
Rating: 1
Text: The Nauvoo Mill & Bakery has great prices, but does not live up to it's sign that reads "all items made with fresh ingredients." The food was decent, but ingredients like broccoli had clearly been microwaved. The restaurant had a 1980's school cafeteria vibe. Other downsides: $10 minimum on cards, they don't even accept many cards, portions were small, and the bathroom was filthy. Upsides: Food was decent, and prices were on the low side. Generally not a very high quality place.
