Lopez De Mexico Restaurant

Text: This place is great. I know the owner, and he's good people. The waitress (who I believe to be his wife and co-owner) was present and thoughtful. She always made sure I had what I needed. It looks like a hole in the wall, but it's pretty nice inside, and it would appear that they've done just a tad bit of remodeling recently. The food is tasty, and not as greasy as some other joints. Would recommend if you're up there to see the Amelia Earhart museum.

Text: Service was great, but food was not very good. I order carne asada tacos and the meat was cold. The salsa on the other hand was really good.
