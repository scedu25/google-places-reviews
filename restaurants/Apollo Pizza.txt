Text: We waited a half a hour for two grilled chicken salads. The salads had a lot of spinach, about four chicken strips that looked like they were torn apart. The bread sticks were all different sizes, cold and not cooked in the middle. My food was placed on the counter and I was never offered a bag, napkins or utensils.

Text: Best Pizza in Richmond, maybe entire State of KY!  Great selection of specialty pizzas and salads.  Of course our favorite is pepperoni and bacon - they cut it in squares and it's AMAZING.
