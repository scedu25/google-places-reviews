Text: Despite the absence of reviews this quaint restaurant is amazing! The staff is efficient and friendly, and the food is delicious! Chicken fried rice with yum-yum sauce is scrumptious. Definitely one of the best restaurants in the area.

Text: Tiny place next to gas station but the yum yum sauce and the large amounts of food for one meal is enough for two people! Great better than Chinese
