Text: Excellent everything! Super busy during our visit, but we had no wanting for anything better or different. Our server Reece, was courtious and efficient. Authentic Thai flavors, complex and distinct in all our varied dishes.

Text: I had the Rama Chicken and asked for it spicy. It was excellent, though almost everything I've ever eaten here has been very good.

Text: They use too much sugar to sweeten their dishes or to tone down their spicier ones.  Service was good,  however the food didn't come close to meeting my expectations.   

I went back again about a month ago and the food is actually worse. Too much sugar!
