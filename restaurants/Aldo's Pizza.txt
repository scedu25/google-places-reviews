Aldo's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: I love Aldo's. The wait staff is sometimes very young and a little nervous, but always professional in their attitude. All the food I've gotten has been good, but what stood out was the Chicken Bianca, so tender and the white wine sauce is fantastic! 
Even with a crowd, this restaurant is not too loud for normal conversation. I love the Rat Pack photos. A hometown favorite for me!

Text: Aldo's makes the best pizza and salads in the area. They have many sizes of pizza up to 18". Absolutely delicious! And they make more than just pizzas. They have delicious appetizers and entrees, and also a small bar tucked into one of the corner of the building if you would like a drink to go along with your meal. The only drawback to Aldo's is there is not a lot of parking and many times you have to park on the street and usually a wait to be seated. This is a very popular restaurant and they really could use a bigger building.
