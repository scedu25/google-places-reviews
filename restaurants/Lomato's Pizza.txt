Lomato's Pizza

Text: Great tasting pizza! An exceptional crust.
Lomato's was recommended to us by the front desk clerk at Hampton Inn. We were not disappointed. Only helpful suggestion would be to ask, at time of order, if paper plates, napkins, chili flakes or Parmesan cheese would be helpful if delivering to a hotel room. When I mentioned paper plates and napkins to our delivery gal, she took it upon herself to go to the lobby of hotel, get plates and napkins, and bring them back up to our room!!! What a pleasant suprise! Thank you!!
