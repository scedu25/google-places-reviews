Text: So this place I a little out of the way from Atchison. That should not discourage you from going. The food is great, I love the buffet style. The omelettes are made to order and have always been good. This is the place I go with my family after church on Sunday, and really you should too!

Text: Best Sunday buffet to be found around here. Charming atmosphere that is worth the short drive. It's an experience as much as it is a meal!
