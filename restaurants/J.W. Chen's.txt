Text: Great lunch. Owner sat down with the group and covered the menu with us. She made custom dishes for a few of the daring. No photos of the food because it was eaten too quickly. I would highly recommend.

Text: I have never had a bad meal here! The woman who owns is just incredible! If you can manage to be there when it isn't busy, she will sit at your table and chat with you. The atmosphere is so great. The food is incredible. Everytime.

Text: The food here is very good Chinese food, and the lady that owns the place is a very sweet older lady. When I dined in, I noticed she comes and sits with each table and guides them through the menu according to what they're hungry for, and she's very attentive, making sure you're enjoying your meal. I was recipient of this treatment, too. Great experience, and will come again.

Text: I love this place... Jean is great! She is very accommodating with my food allergies. If you're like me and hate having to choose, as her to surprise you. It's especially great with a big group. She finds out what you like and brings out all these awesome dishes that you can share family style.

Text: Normally the service is not great but the food quality makes up for it completely. Go there and ask Jean (the owner I assume) for her suggestion. Tell her what you like and she'll prepare something for you that you won't forget!
