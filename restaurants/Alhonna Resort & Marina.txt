Text: Nice place clean rooms. Friendly staff our room is right off the water we can fish off the deck.boat dock right out front so you can get to fishing or water activity's easy. So far the only things that I have found that need upgraded is the beds are pretty hard in our room my husband likes it but I would prefer one with a little cushion. There are no TV'S in the bedroom's witch I wasn't aware of I have a problem going to sleep without one on. The 2 back burners on the stove top don't work other than that everything is great. We will stay here again if in the area.

Text: Spent a weekend here as a "stay-cation".  We had a two-bedroom unit, which was very clean and had everything we needed!  Kitchen with fridge, microwave, stove, pots/pans/utensils, table and chairs, separate living area.  Fantastic location and nice view of the lake from our unit.  Fishing wasn't the greatest, but can't blame the resort for that!  Enjoyed the hot tubs, indoor and outdoor pool!  Bar/restaurant on location as well, but we grilled.  I would stay here again.

Text: Absolutely fantastic place to go with family (kids love it) or with your significant other, or just friends. Very clean cabins, large in-door and outdoor pool, restaurant and bar, all on the premises. Also if you like to fish, a covered dock and many others to fish off of. Tons of fish caught and to be caught. Also, enjoy a boat ride from Alhonna or maybe a Jet Ski. Amazing place to vacation. Had a great time. Oh, did I mention very friendly, family owned environment. You must go!

Text: We had our family reunion here this summer. The cabins were very nice and had great views. The pools and hot tubs were well maintained. The cabins had kitchens to cook in, as well as dishes to use while there. There was also a restaurant on site that was very convenient. We had a blast!
