Text: (Review post #2 because apparently you can delete negative reviews now) Just witnessed a cockroach walking across the cutting board where they make the sushi.. that we had just eaten 10 min prior. Immediately put the plate down. We told the lady about it and all she offered a 20% discount... HA. Absolutely disgusting!

Side note: Their resolution to the problem was "we will check to see what is going on."  Hint, your restaurant is dirty that's what's going on!
