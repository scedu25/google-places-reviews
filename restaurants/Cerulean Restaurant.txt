Cerulean Restaurant

Text: I have always loved this place. Our last experience was disappointing. It's an expensive place and it has always been worth it in the past. Unfortunately they discontinued my favorite dish. So I tried a different one.  The sauce tasted like pureed type of barbecue and was nothing fantastic. We waited a very long time for our food, although this is not a place for quick table turns the wait was extensive and more then we usually wait. The best part if the meal was the coffee, I have always loved their coffee. For two of us with two drinks each, coffee, an appetizer and two entrees it was almost $200. Not sure we'll be back for dinner again.

Text: This was my first time at Cerulean and it was amazing. Everyone was nice and smiling. They treated my wife and me like we were the most important people there. The food was too notch. I ordered the smoked duck. The presentation was good and it was amazing. Needless to say, we will be going back!

Text: I'm one of Cerulean's no #1 fan but I have to say, I was really disappointed in the carryout lunch I got from there today! The panko crusted chicken was dry and tough. They really skimped on the sticky rice. The udon noodle is back on the menu but they changed the recipe.....yuck! The spinach greens recipe has been changed too. Don't like it at all! Why do you mess with a good thing??! AND.....the portions are smaller and prices have been raised. Very sad. #notahappycustomer

Text: We love Cerulean! One of our favorite restaurants in Winona Lake. They are located right on the canal - perfect for watching boats moving through. 

Their bento box lunches are great!

Staff are extremely friendly. Highly recommended!
