Text: Got the prime rib. Cooked to order. The baked potatoes are a meal itself. They bring a salad and small loaf of tasty bread with your dinner as well. They have great inexpensive daily lunch specials. Every time I been ther they have a soup of the day with is good too. Mixed drinks a little pricey but good. Service is good most of the time. Once in a while you might get a slow waitress. Nothing to complain about. Restrooms very clean and place is wheelchair accessible every where. I would recommend it for a date or a night to get away from home.

Text: Good food, not great! Service seemed okay, but needed reminding. Brought steak before salad, reminded. Did not bring complimentary bread loaf as before. Meal was $45.52 for two, left $5 tip, felt too much considering service. It was obvious waitress was trying hard but not fully trained. We will come back , of course, small town, like choices we have. Usually better. 

New day, sunny Sunday changing to clouds. Too much food, all fantastic. Just off diets, hard to eat as much. I had chopped steak covered in gravy, mushrooms, peppers, fantastic. Wife had sirloin tips and tanglers. Waitress only one in place, she will get extra tip for super service. We will be back, fantastic.
