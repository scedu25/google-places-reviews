Text: We got to this place after a long drive and had to cross the street with no crosswalk. Granted, the street wasn't that busy, but please note that the parking lot is dirt and on the other side of the street. When we went in, there was absolutely nobody there. One waitress greeted us and said to sit wherever we wanted. We ordered quickly and the food came about 45 minutes late after we ordered. There were 3 chefs and 0 customers there! They should have had it ready before. Still, it was good and we had pie after it all, which was amazing!!! Overall, the service was pretty bad, the food was good, and the people were really nice. Thank you for providing food for us on our journey!

Text: This place is awesome, eat here about 2-4 times per year and they always recognize our hunting crew when we come in. Great food, friendly wait staff, and amazing prices. This is not a fancy place, it's a WHOLE place. Come to enjoy food how you'd want it at home.
