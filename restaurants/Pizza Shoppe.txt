Text: Pizza was ok, one step above a Totino's microwaveable. Absolutely no customer service, workers more worried about their friends hanging out than the 2 customers in the place. Even though there were only 2 customers and 2 waitresses and other people working in the back, every single table in there was dirty.....what do you guys think a job is?

Text: There's a real great feeling to the Pizza Shoppe on the square in Savannah. It's perfect if you care about small town ambiance. The pizza is best in town, but it's also most expensive. We'd eat there a lot more if there were value options on the menu.
