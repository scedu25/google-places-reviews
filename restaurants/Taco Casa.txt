Taco Casa

Text: First time last time. Store was clean, staff was friendly, food was bad and pricy. Food was bad. Aldi's frozen burritos are better.

Text: CAUTION: EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. TRASH... All the food tasted like it came straight out of a can and the customer service was aweful. The best part of the meal was the lettuce. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO HERE. I REPEAT. DO NOT GO HERE. If you want some bang for your buck, go to tortilla jacks or taca villa.

Text: For the second time I feel I didn't receive my extra cheese that I paid for and when I mentioned it, the workers are not very nice about not giving me any more, since its portioned, I'd have to pay more its not like that in other places I go, they are happy to please.

Text: First off, this place is really expensive for quick tacos. The food is bland, and everything we got was made up of mostly lettuce with very little other fillings and spices. When my girlfriend asked to have her food remade because she's allergic to the hot sauce, the staff were rude and reluctant to do it. We will never go here again.
