Text: Great customer service. We were having a guest lecturer on campus and ordered Subway catering. They were on time, the order was freshly made, complete and exactly as ordered plus they gave us complimentary cookies! The deliver person went so far as to leave her cell number just in case we needed something else. It's nice not having to worry about the food or delivery especially when during an event there are so many other details to pay attention to. Thank you.

Text: Great service, but there was only one associate there and it was really busy. I've seen this as a trend at this location even on Friday and Saturday nights.
