Text: This place has been around for ages for a reason, it's relatively inexpensive and has a great variety of food options and most of them are good. Try their chicken or turkey and mashed potatoes for lunch or any of their breakfast options. Good stuff.

Text: Food here is always very good. Unfortunatly the waitress was just rude and didn't return for refills,  to check on us or even see if we wanted dessert . My friend was so upset (who is a fairly regular customer) was so upset he doesn't want to come back again ......which is ashame. I have noticed many things taken  off the menu  that I really enjoyed with it now being very stripped down and basic compared to  the before  options . Food quality is still very good and portion sizes are  always usually generous. Still a good value  for your $$.

Text: I enjoyed their steak and egg breakfast very much. They were very busy so the service was a little slow.
