The Buffalo Tavern

Text: Have enjoyed everything except the big ass nachos. They were just meat and cheese with chips... nothing else. And the cheese and meat weren't particularly great. However the buff bites and everything else I've had has been great

Text: Great food, atmosphere. Waitress was friendly and helpful. Between food and service, was worth giving 5 stars! Wings are just... Try them yourself... Leaves the chain places looking like amateurs.
