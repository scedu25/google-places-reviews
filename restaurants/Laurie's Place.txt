Text: Always a great experience. Amazing fish. Cheap beer.

They really need to figure out their late night happy hour though (1/2 price apps). I think nearly everything falls into an exception, but only a few exceptions are actually listed on the menu. Not a huge deal, just kind of annoying. At least be upfront about what's excluded.

Text: Great place to listen to live music.   Good atmosphere and food.  The jam session Saturday afternoons is fun and a great way to see our local musicians in a casual setting
