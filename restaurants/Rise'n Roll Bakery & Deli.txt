Text: Lobe this place. I had lunch, and some donuts. The caramel cinnamon sugar donuts and donut holes will ruin all other donuts for you. They are amazing. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Text: This place has completely revamped itself. Business is great and they do have some good stuff but it's not great anymore. Their donuts are some of the best around Michiana still, everything else is good but there is better somewhere else.

Text: These people have THE BEST donuts. Their signature donut is a cinnamon caramel. It literally melts in your mouth. It's a "must stop" if you are going by there

Text: Their yeast donut with apple glaze and powdered sugar with cinnamon is a very good donut. My husband enjoyed their sausage gravy.  I do not eat pork and they did not offer a vegetarian or poultry breakfast sandwich. They have a deli case but was told I couldn't get turkey or chicken until 1030. Coffee not so good; recommend getting tea. Large selection of baked goods, breads, jellies, spreads and candies.
