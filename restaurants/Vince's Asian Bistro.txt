Text: We visit several times a year. Should go more often! Won tons and potstickers are some of the best I've had. Authentic and carefully prepared taste in each dish we've ever ordered. Absolutely highly recommended.

Text: Vince's Asian Bistro is is not your typical commercial Chinese restaurant rather instead everything is made fresh with fresh ingredients. The appetizers are all handmade and yeah entrees have lots of flavor and nice texture. My visit I tried the fried wonton and fried egg roll. The exterior texture was delicate and flakey with a soft interior filled with delicious fresh ingredients full of flavor. For the main course I ordered Kung Pao Chicken also Spicy Crispy Beef with an order of chicken noodles. The food was very good I walked away very happy the flavors were better than expected and I absolutely am glad I took my wife and children here much better than the most of the Chinese restaurants locally in the area of O'Fallon. Our server was Chloe a very sweet woman and extremely thoughtful about the needs of the customers. She was personable and related very well to our children and encouraging many smiles during our stay.
