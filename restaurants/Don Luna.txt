Text: When I want good Mexican food in Harrisburg, I go to Don Luna! Their beef, bean and cheese nachos, steak and cheese nachos, and beef burritos are great! I did having a craving for tacos once, so I ordered a couple of those, but I wasn't impressed with the tacos or the taco sauce. The tacos had too much grease in the meat that it made the shell soggy, and the taco sauce was too watery and tomatoey (not sure on the spelly of the latter, but I'm sure you know what I meant). This surprised me, because all the other food I've had from there is great. Regardless, it is a wonderful place to eat Mexican, and it definitely beats taco bell! Highly recommended.

Text: Food is better than the other Mex food in town, but the attitude is so bad I usually don't go there.
