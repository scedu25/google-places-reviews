Text: I don't know why pasta has to be so expensive, but if I'm going to pay high prices, this is the place to do it! The food was good, and the service was amazing. I was on a date with my wife and we both loved it. The sauce was an in-house tomato and it was delicious!

Text: Amazing little gem!  The pesto cream sauce is delicious.  The bread and olive oil are perfectly seasoned.  I eat out in the Columbus area frequently and this is a fantastic little Italian Restaurant.

Text: Nice locally owned Italian restaurant.  Large portions. Tilapia was mediocre. All other dishes were very good. The homemade Roasted Tomato soup was excellent. Plenty of Gluten Free entree options ( no GF pasta options)

Text: I had tilapia which was pretty good. The risotto was pretty good too, but too rich in my opinion. Service was fine. 

The restaurant was not full, but the noise level was LOUD. I wouldn't mind going here again, but I wouldn't suggest it.

Text: I stumbled across this place on accident while passing through and couldn't be more pleased with our selection. The food is incredible and it's such a cute little cafe. I stopped for lunch and I wish I loved closer so I could try out the dinner menu!
