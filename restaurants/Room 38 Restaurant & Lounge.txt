Text: Went after dark. Very bad customer service. Waitress was nice and sweet. Bartenders were not cool dudes at all. Not a good place to hang out. Bad obnoxious music. It reminds me of the show jersey shore, only sweatier. In my opinion Rose Music hall, eastside, the 9th circle of hell, basically anywhere would be a better place to hang out than here.

Text: I have officially found my place to go after a long day at work. My Tuesday spot is now Room 38. Bug the bartender is so customer service friendly. She takes care of all her customers and remembers their names. Very nice place to go and unwind. Drinks are amazing and the food was so good. I sat at the bar and met some great people. Bug knows a lot about the drinks and I wanted to try something new. Have her make you a Pineapple upside down cake. So good!!

Text: I'd been wanting to try them out for awhile and finally got a chance. Walked in to a busy restaurant, nobody there to greet so we just sat down at an open table. Waitress walks by and says that table is reserved and every other spot is taken. So we wait a few minutes for some seats at the bar, and THEN it took forever to get the bartender's attention. You see, we weren't young, attractive college students, so they got priority. Every time we wanted something, it was a struggle. Finally, one of the attractive people next to us got the bartender's attention to tell him that we were ready for our check. Apparently, this is pretty common practice from what I hear asking around town. If you're not a 7+, you'll probably be ignored. And that's a really terrible way to run a business. 

Meanwhile the food was really really good. So there is that.
