Bristol Bar & Grille Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: Had an excellent time and great meal tonight at this Downtown Louisville stop on the Urban Bourbon Trail. After a lack luster stop before landing here down the street we found this local joint. Great selection of Bourbon including a house selection and some rare items. Had their signature appetizer, the green Chile wontons, really good. I had the pork chop and my wife had the shrimp and grits. Menu is locally sourced,  portions are generous and food was well prepared. We really enjoyed our meals, visit at the bar and highly recommend this spot. As an industry person,  I believe this is the type of place the public is in need of, good food, good service and fair prices. Cheers Bristol Bar and Grille!

Text: Always enjoy coming here for lunch. It's a nice place to sit with table service downtown. I really love the steeplechase salad and Harry's dressing is SO good.

Text: The downtown Bristol customer service was horrible.  I ordered a hamburger that was supposed to be medium well and it came out well well well done. I then asked for something quick because everyone else's food was already out. The server suggested crab cake appetizers which were very small.  When my bill came out nothing was comped and when I spoke to the manager he acted as if i should have been glad that he took off the hamburger. The food was terrible I will not be visiting that location again.
