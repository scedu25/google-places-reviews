Text: Very slow service waited 10 minutes before our server came back to order. Very expensive. Ordered the Greek pizza and it was pretty dry and consisted of like 20% toppings and 80% crust. Breakfast buffet was 6 out of 10.  Everyone else ordered breakfast and i ordered pizza amd they got their food in 5 mins and i got mine in 20 mins so they gave me pizza free. Which is fair for their poor service.

Text: Not great food. Just so so. Atmosphere was a lot of fun, though.
