Text: I've been here quite a few times and while the food isn't the best in Kalamazoo, it's a great place for families to eat and get good food for a great price. Also, if you're stopping by in Kalamazoo and want a quick bite that's inexpensive, this is the place.

The people who work there are very nice and although the place isn't as clean as some restaurants, I see no issue at all with that. When you are there it's a very cozy feeling so a wonderful place to eat during the winter. Their soups and sandwiches are delicious also.

All in all, a great place that provides friendly service and decent food for a good price. Very nice local restaurant to try.
