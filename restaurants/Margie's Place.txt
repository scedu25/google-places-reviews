Text: I would give it a 4 if it were non smoking.  The food and service were great.  We did not linger because of the cigarette smoke.

Text: First trip to eminence mo. was pretty good. If you want a good quality cheeseburger for decent price, go to margies place in town. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is the cigarette smoke, other than that it's a good place for a burger and beer. Solid down home feel and great people.
