Text: Good food, great beer selection.  I went in and saw a cubs game and a draw of Goose Island 312 was only $2!  I had a great bartender, great atmosphere!  I really like this place.  It was my first time there and very impressed!

Text: Server was very nice when she was around-which wasn't very often . Sat at the table for 10 minutes before we received menus, our appetizer order was wrong the first time coming out, totally burned the second time and the server still expected us to pay for them. Food was very bland. Server not very concerned. Overall, disappointed. Will not be returning

Text: They have good bar food options like appetizers, sandwiches and fries.  There is a variety of pizzas on the menu. I would not recommend going there for the pizza.  It is thin crust and I didn't think it had good flavor.
