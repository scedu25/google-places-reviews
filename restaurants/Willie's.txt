Text: The best burgers I have ever had. Mean Green and Five Alarm are my favorites. The staff is attentive and wait time is crazy low. Literally had my food ready in 5 minutes. Can't recommend the place enough. Thinking about moving to Atchison just for Willies. Don't hesitate for 1 second to stop there if you're passing through.

Text: Service is good, but this is the second sandwich here that has disappointed me here. The patty melt had only one skimpy slice of cheese and the one before was the Philly. One slice of cheese. If you enjoy cheese this isn't the place. Everyone seemed very pleased but me I like cheese on my patty melts and Philly cheese. Makes for a dry sandwich.

Text: Great food great atmosphere. Nice and quiet between the lunch and dinner rush. Had Mountain oysters for the first time in my life. Been wanting to try them for years but could not find a place with them on the menu.

Text: My FAVORITE. The Mean Green Burger is my #1. Delicious with just the right heat! Plus Guinness on tap. Plus baseball. ?

Text: Almost all of the food is great except the "buffalo wings" I called in and brought them home and they were less than savory to say the least. Do not recommended.
