Text: Great day to go on a Thursday night. Double cheeseburger and fries and beer (any), for $8. Great service and they already know what beer to bring before I even order. Highly recommend for a great meal and service.

Text: Oy, outside of some decent beers and cocktails this is not a great spot to dine. Had the burger for lunch and to be honest, you're better off at a fast food burger joint. Burgers were overdone, rubbery and smothered in Mayo and other condiments. With the fast food burger joints around you would think this place could step up and be the difference maker.

Text: One of the worst meals I have ever (partially ), eaten. The black bean soup was extremely salty. The menu description of grilled tuna and avacado with black bean salsa and chips was a cold halved avacado stuffed with tuna salad.  There was a smattering of salsa and tortilla chips. The veggies that came with the hummus were old and wilted.  The hummus.......inedible......the diced tomatoes that were in the hummus were soft and watery making the dish very foul tasting.   The waitress was very pleasant, but did not check on us, no beverage refills were offered. It seems like Spoons is very hit and miss in the reviews I have seen, tonight was a big miss!
