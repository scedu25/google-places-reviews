Text: This place came highly recommended, but they sure didn't live up to the hype.  Dirty tables sat unclear a very long time. Was not impressed with the cleanliness of the kitchen I could see.  I'm not sure why people are raving about their salsa.  The food was acceptable, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Mexican dinner. More interested in trying other Mexican places in town than returning here.
