W.g. Grinders

Text: They are constantly understaffed. I've gone multiple times when they can't get the food out in a reasonable amount of time. Whrn tbrh are busy the food taste like dog food mixed with cat food mixed with a catfish. I would avoid this business at all costs. Also, their customer service is beyond bad. I will never visit again and I encourage every other person in the world to never visit again either
