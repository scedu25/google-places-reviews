Text: The club serves a steak dinner once a month. We stay at the motel across the street on weekends. ( I am the interim minister at Midland UCC in Sterling.) This is the first time we have gone for steak, and it was WONDERFUL!  The staff and atmosphere are pleasant.

Text: The V has the best staff, atmosphere and food. Tacos on Monday, fresh grilled burgers on Wednesday and a homecooked meal on Thursday. The coldest drinks and some great music with all the live entertainment that comes in. If you havent been yet you need to try it. There are no strangers here.
