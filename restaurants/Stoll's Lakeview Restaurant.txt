Text: Wonderful service and food. I've never had a bad experience here. I love to stop in to eat when I'm visiting from Colorado. If there's something you want, like Pecan pie, they'll bring you a slice when the next batch is out.

Text: Even the BlackBerry cobbler was good. If the bacon bits were real and if they made their own croutons it would be a five star in my book. Well done

Text: If you're in Loogootee and not feeling the fast food options that litter the town, then this is the answer. This place is an awesome surprise off the side of the road just north of town. I grabbed the lunch buffet on the way back to Indy and it was almost worth the trip by itself. There's not too much on it, but what's there is really well made and of far better quality than what you could find at a chain buffet. Will definitely stop back by if I'm down that way again.

Text: Awesome Amish home cooked meals. They have the best fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, bread, peanut butter, and apple butter. Always do the buffet and try to get a window seat with a lake view!

Text: This is a very decent restaurant. Good old fashioned Indiana food. The people who criticize this place for limited food selection don't understand the underlying "Home Cooking" theme associated with this restaurant. 100/10. Would eat again. ?
