Schoolhouse Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: This place gets a 4 star from me mainly due to the nostalgia. Let's be honest. The restaurant is cramped, loud, and dated, but they have remained popular and open so long for a reason. They offer simple, home cooked, classic menu items at an affordable price. Is the food amazing? No. But it is still a great place to visit.

Text: We had been wanting to eat here for a while and we finally got the chance to go.  We went at lunch and sat at a table.  It took a little bit for a waitress to bring us a couple menus.  She seemed to be the only one working when we got there.  Prices are a little expensive but food is good.  I don't know that we'll be back, not because of the food, but because of the hours.  It just doesn't work with our schedule.

For history buffs, the schoolhouse is really neat!  It looks like they kept the original windows and I love that.  It looks very authentic!

Text: Enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the service.  This wonderful gem is from another time, when things were more relaxed.  Will definitely be returning.

Text: Service is excellent here, by far the best dining experience I have ever had. However, aside from the green beans everything else is terrible. It's like seasoning hasnt been invented yet! The corn... tasteless, the fried Chicken... Tasteless... Seriously just tasted greasy. Mashed potatoes... Terrible. Even the fried corn fritters were terrible. Don't do it... Just don't unless your prepared to get arthritis from shaking salt and pepper everywhere.
