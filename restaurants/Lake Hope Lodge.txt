Text: LOVE!!! One of the best parts of our trip! Getting there was a little difficult but well worth it, once you get to the top of the hill you were welcomed by a friendly staff.  Not only is the food delicious the view was a must-see I never knew Ohio could be so beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone,  and hope to be back in the near future. Thank you for the great experience!!

Text: We enjoyed our dinners there: good food and nicely prepared.  Also, there is a nice view from the dinning room - especially at this time of year, especially if you sit by the Windows.

Text: Excellent food and wait staff. Very friendly and aware of what's available in the kitchen. Didn't hover but was very attentive with our 6 person table needs. Brisket, pulled pork, and smoked wild turkey was amazing!!! Excellent desert menu and beer selection. The wood fired pizza was fantastic!
