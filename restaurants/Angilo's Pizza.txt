Text: So far since we have moved up here,  Angelo's has always been delicious and consistent.  We love it! I wasn't expecting my alas to be so big and look so good!

Text: Worst taco pizza ever! I've noticed rude behavior on the phone and refusing to refund for any of their mistakes, which happen alot! I've tried several different menu items but they are all bad. I'd advise to go out of town for pizza and any other dinner items.

Text: * WARNING*    I placed an order at 6:43 pm on Saturday , steak hoagie , buffalo chicken salad , bread and a order of potato skins. At 7:50 I called and was told my order was out for delivery. At 8:15 the first delivery driver shows up and he told me he was sorry for the delay and gave me a 6 dollar credit for the delay. I checked my order before he left and was missing the buffalo chicken salad and all the food was cold. He told me he would go get it and be right back, at 8:57 I called back and was told that the original driver took another delivery and he wasnt sure if we still wanted the rest of our order ?! what !! And that he would bringing it out after he made that delivery. Twenty more min goes by and another driver shows up and laughs how long have you been waiting > I told him 2 hours and obviously voice my displeasure about our food being late and being cold, he response was hes just the delivery driver and not to get upset with him in a very sarcastic tone . I will never spend another penny at Angelos Pizza when there are other Pizza joints in town.

Text: It's horrible when the Mgr. Screws up both of my pizza's I ordered.  She was in such a rush to get off the phone and i made sure to repeat my toppings but she didn't seem to care and got them completely wrong.  Also they are not willing to do anything for their screw ups, that's not good customer service at all. Def. Go somewhere else it'll be worth the drive.

Text: The new owner needs to use the same burger and bun as the previous owner. The meat was bad and bun a disappointment. Chefs salad not as good either. I came from Wilmington to be disappointed.  I won't be back.
