Text: Excellent food, good atmosphere even though a bit close to other tables and diners. Servers were extremely efficient and the recommendations on point. Prices were what I expected with tip dinner for two with appetizer, sushi, and two entrees came to $56. A definite future visit is planned.

Text: Such a great time! Came here for the boyfriends birthday and was immediately greeted at the door and sat down. Food was great and reasonably priced, service was PERFECT. Rod always kept our drinks filled and answered every single question I asked in detail. Very knowledgeable about the food. I would definitely recommend this place and plan on making this a regular restaurant of ours. When you go, ask for Rod!!!

Text: Absolutely amazing experience. My wife and I went expecting just a little hole in the wall sushi restaurant and left with full bellies and intentions to come back often. The service was amazing and the sushi master was wonderful, very quiet atmosphere and not a bit of food left on our plates when we finished. Ordered the crab ragoons; savory with a hint of sweetness. The sushi itself was wonderfully priced the spicy white tuna avocado roll, eel roll, and the white tuna avocado roll were absolutely fantastic. 5/5 will defiantly recommend.
