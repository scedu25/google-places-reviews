Tropical Mexican Restaurant

Text: This is a neat little Mexican restaurant with delicious food and polite staff. We just happened across this place on our way through Kansas. I would definitely recommend it to anyone passing by. 
The fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and burrito supremo are delicious. The guacamole is amazing.

Text: We just walked out. Sat at our table so long that we ate all of our chips and salsa and my husband's drink was empty and the waitress had STILL not come to take our order. Will never be back.

Text: Great stop on I-70! The food was excellent (taquitos and taco salad) salsa was great, rice extremely yummy, and it was all served very quickly! I'm so glad we pulled over instead of going to DQ. Big thumbs up!
