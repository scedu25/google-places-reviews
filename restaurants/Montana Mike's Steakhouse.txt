Montana Mike's Steakhouse
Rating: 1
Text: We have been coming to Montana Mike's since it opened and ponderosa before that, I cannot believe how downhill this restaurant has went.
I ordered steak medium and it came out burnt more than my husband's well done steak. Sent it back and then they gave me a RAW steak barely toasted on each side. Sent it back again and still got it wrong! AND One of the male waiters threw a handful of straws at a 67 year old man while we were there!! Will not be returning, just remind myself that I can cook MUCH better for way less that $85 for only 4 people. Ridiculous

Text: I have been going to Montana Mike's in Danville for a few years, at least once a month. Typically? its good, but not this last time. Ever since they have started making the louisiana pasta thats what i order. I went there the other day and our plates were covered in seasoning so bad that i had to send it back. The rolls were cold, i didn't even bother with the butter, because it wouldn't even melt. After they remade our plates, it was still gross. I didn't say anything to the waitress the second time, just let it go. I'm? sorry to say this but i won't be going back. $40 dollars is a lot spend on something that may or may not be good. :(
