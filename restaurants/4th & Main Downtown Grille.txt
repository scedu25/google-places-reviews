Text: Above all the service here is outstanding. You'll always be greeted by smiling faces and receive prompt and reliable service by fantastic people. The food is excellent, as evidenced by how many "out of towners" you'll see on any given night. 
A great mix of small town charm and bits of a "big city" establishment. 
If you want good food with good people and a drink that's never left empty, it's the only place to go.

Text: What a nice surprise in this small town. the food was amazing good and the service was great. The prices where worth what you get. Not very well marketed but man what a place to return when back in the area. A must go to if ever in this town. Next a wait and very clean wood style layout. Restrooms are clean as well.
