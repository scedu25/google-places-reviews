Text: Enjoyed dinner with my family on the new patio! Everything is better on a patio! Southwest Chicken Salad (with Southwest ranch dressing) is my go-to here. Wife ordered chicken fried chicken and shared a bite with me. Also very good! Good selection at the bar. Good service. Check it out!

Text: The steaks were good, the service was great, and the prices were fair, but the decor isn't anything special.

Text: It was clean even the salt shakers were clean. Great kids menu. Real mashed potatoes. Fresh hand cut salad not from a bag. Had the tequila lime chicken and it was yummy. Kids enjoyed their food too. Very nice server.

Text: Best place to eat in Abilene. They are always quick, the food is exceptional, and they have the best staff. Highly recommended!

Text: We had chicken fried steak & club sandwich. It was quality good food, not especially flavorful or unique. M&R has an extensive menu for a sports grill with TVs. It was open on Sunday for which we were thankful.
