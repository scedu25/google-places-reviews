Crossroads Family Restaurant

Text: Family friendly with excellent customer service. The food was good and the portions were generous. Bathrooms needed attention and some items seemed slightly over priced. Easily accessible from route 50 and we were able to park our 38ft RV very easily, as we were just passing through the area. Overall we'd stop and eat here again if we pass back through.

Text: They always have great food, and thier toasted marble rye is to die for. I am changing my mind about what amounts to a greasy spoon. Along with the kitchen help, dropping things on the floor, not throwing them away, but not bothering to wash them off. Pick it up, dust it off,  in the batter,  in the cooker. Plate it up, put it in the window, out to you it goes.
How do I know, I worked there for one 7 1/2 hour day. Never went back.

Text: This was our first time to eat here & it will be our last. The food was great. The server was good in the beginning, but after we got our food we only saw her once. We had to wait for long time before we got our check & it was a different server. The girl at the register wasn't nice. It seemed as though we were bothering her. We were there on a Monday night, it was not busy. You would think that the service would be better.
