Text: I went on a Wednesday at lunch time.  Its was busy but the wait was reasonable for the time of day. Debated on the Veggie or grilled cheese and ended up getting the grilled cheese with the Asiago cheese spread.  Talk about delish and they surprise me with the small sample of tomato basil soup for dipping. Wish i had gotten a whole bowl of that it was very good and a great pairing with the sandwich.

Text: One of my absolute favorite local places to eat at. They make cheese spreads there and incorporate them into many of the items on the menu. It's on the extreme end of casual, walk in and order to go or eat in the hallway outside it's doors. But if you live in Lexington, you should definitely check them out.
