Text: The food was really good and the service was awesome. I had no idea what to expect so the older diner atmosphere was pleasant. The chocolate ice cream machine wasn't working while I was there (which is a thing that happens) if it was I would have given this place 5 stars.

Text: We've been here almost two hours.  Monday is date night with my grandson Malcolm.  He's been eating since 4:00. First fries dipped in his chili and mountain dew, then the number 1 burrito deluxe with chips, then his ice cream cone with sprinkles.  Malcolm is a bottomless pit and he loves Krumbly Burger!!  He says "sprinkles take care of headaches!". Thanks Matt for making all this tasty and affordable!

Text: This is by far one of best restaurants I've ever been to. There's not many like it anymore. Its very family oriented. The owner Matt Bass and his wife not only own it. But they work here and they make sure they personally greet each customer and make sure everything is perfect. They are great people and the food is incredible. Everything looks and tastes fresh. The food isnt expensive. Is cheaper than stake n shake but tastes better.
