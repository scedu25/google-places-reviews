Text: This place is pretty good to grab a good meal and a few cold beers.  The specials tend to be great and they always have greasy bar food if you are looking for it.  Prices are reasonable.

Text: Good food but poor service.  After my last experience, I won't go back.  Picked up a take out order only to find it TOTALLY messed up when I got home (7 miles away).  Called and they apologized for their mistake and said my next visit in would be totally free on a similar order.  However, 5 minutes later I was told I had to come right NOW to compensate this order because the manager was getting ready to leave on vacation (not sure why that mattered, but whatever).  I told them my plans were taking me the opposite direction that day and I couldn't come "now".  Fell on deaf ears; their mistake was now my problem.  I tried calling to talk to the owner to see if he agreed with this decision but he not only won't take my call, but won't return them either.  It's now been 4 weeks and have heard nothing.  Sad when they don't respect their patrons enough to at least pick up the phone.  They're off my list and several others that I've spread the word to also.  Their loss!!!
