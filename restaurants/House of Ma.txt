Text: I grew up in Emporia and while in the military I've lived in several states. Out side of real China towns or large cities this is the best you get around. The egg rolls are by far the best I've ever had. I have yet find a place to serve anything near how great they are here. A place in Chicago came close, but no cigar. Get the egg rolls.

Text: We were just passing through town decided to give this place a try. The interior had us worried for a second but the food was fantastic. We ended up getting two orders of egg rolls and crab rangoon, both were amazing. I ordered fried rice and it to was amazing. My other half ordered a poultry dish I think moo goo guy pan which he devoured. We will defiantly go back next time we pass through.
