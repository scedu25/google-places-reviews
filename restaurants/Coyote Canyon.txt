Text: I'm only giving four stars because I have a concern regarding service. On Sept 3rd I came in to eat your buffet. I remembered. there  was a format for customers that said when they were finished eating to turn over their paid receipt. Well I had a plate of salad that I finished and headed back to get more food. When I got back I found my glass of water and a clear table. I said "What the"? and the server told me where the table I was sitting at. She apologized and brought me another glass of water. Later she told me that some of the staff doesn't comply with that policy of a turned over receipt. Do customers have to inform the server that they are finished and not returning from now on? Or is this something the server has to make the call on? I'm just glad I didn't have to get up and didn't leave a plate full of food! Also I'm glad that the section I was in wasn't crowded or I would be out of a table also. I just want to know what to expect if I ever come back to eat there again! It would be interesting to know!Because it is a good buffet and I been eating there for years.

Text: Food was good and a decent variety. Busy place. Being this busy, it's hard for staff to keep up... Both drink stations were out of ice and ladies room wasn't clean (according to my wife). But overall, was good. Better than we expected for a buffet. Lots of families here. If you're looking for intimate dining, this is not it. But if you're wanting to feed a lot of people a lot of decently good food quickly, we'd recommend it. The food isn't wow-great, but everything we had was pretty good.

Text: I love this place and they have the best food. Super clean everywhere in here. I was impressed by how quick the team moves to clean up. Everyone working had a smile and greeted us right away. We had a chance to meet the owner Jim, who seems to be an amazing guy and we could tell he treats his staff awesome. If you like food.... You need to come here!!!!
