Text: Very clean restaurant. Food was awesome.  Service was courteous and quick. They’re in the process of remodeling but don’t let that stop you from going there. You won’t be sorry.

Text: The service was unfriendly and the restaurant was not clean. "Lost" order of 2 ice cream cones and had to wait 20 minutes. When we received the cones, they were melted and tasted terrible.

Text: Jessica the Manager was very impressive!  Excellent sense of urgency!  It has been a very long time since I have seen someone with that type of work ethic!  I would strongly recommend!
