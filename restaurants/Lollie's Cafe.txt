Text: This cafe serves good, basic American food at good prices.  It is not a fancy place, but if you want good food and a homey atmosphere at a moderate price, this is a good choice.

Text: YUM, YUM, YUM! If I lived in Sparta, I would be eating at Lollie's, all the time! Their fried pork chop, with fried potatoes, milk gravy, and grilled asparagus is the BEST, EVER!

Text: Staff needs to smile and be more attentive speak clearly to customers and have confidence greet people when they walk through the door 
This staff did the total opposite all very quiet and stand offish I'd hate to see there tip cups
Anyways on a plus note the food was excellent I had the chicken Alice and I absolutely loved it!!! 
Get new staff or suffer the consequences of customers not coming back...
By the way I'm a manager of a successful restaurant with great customer service
