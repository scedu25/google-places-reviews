Text: I liked the Ribeye steak. Make sure you ask for the bread. it's free, but not volunteered. Cinnamon butter is really good. Waiter kept our drinks filled up well. Slightly pricey, but I think it's worth it. A few small shops nearby if interested.

Text: While out with the husband car shopping, we stumble upon this gem! I've read the other reviews of Pine Mountain and I am shocked! Our meal was wonderful!!! My husband had the ribs and chicken tender meal which was delicious. The ribs fell off the bone and the chicken tenders were so tender and juicy. You can tell they are prepared fresh. As far as it being overpriced, I disagree. I had Uncle Gerald's Favorite breakfast combo and our total for dinner was $25.07. Sorry there are no pics of our meal. We were hungry and honestly, the food was so good that I forgot to snap a few shots. Other than a handful of drive thru fast food restaurants, I didn't see any other restaurants in the area. This community is lucky to have such a wonderful place for a great meal. The bathrooms were so clean and the decor is beautiful. Also, the gift shop will blow your mind. Kinda reminds me of a smaller hometown Cracker Barrel! Will definitely be back if visiting the area again!

Text: I went here once and the service and food was terrible but the was in like mid 2016. The last time I went they were remodeling and the place looked a lot better. The food and service was a lot better too. The booths are small so it might be better to ask for a table for larger groups of people. I enjoy this place. The salad bar is pretty good too with good selection. I enjoy it and it is a god family place to eat at.
