Woodstone Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent restaurant. We showed up about half an hour before they close, but they took us in anyway and didn't rush us. They have plenty of gluten-free options, which are all labeled as gluten-free on the menu. The ribs were delicious and meaty, unlike many places where they are mostly bone. And at $23 for a full slab, it was a pretty good deal. The outdoor seating has a great view of the surrounding countryside. Would recommend.

Text: We ate at Woodstone with friends Sunday evening. The atmosphere and view were amazing! Service was good. The large pretzel with beer cheese sauce was delicious as was the mushrooms. We ordered the Woodfire Meatamorie pizza. Loved the Woodfire flavor and the pizza. We have to go back again before they close for the season October 21st.
