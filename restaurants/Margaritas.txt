Text: The first thing we noticed upon arriving was how polite the staff was-especially the host. We were seated immediately with complimentary chips and salsa. There are a lot of options on the menu with lots of ways to customize your order. My friends who have been to Mexico many times commented that this is one of the most authentic restaurants they have been to. They have a huge dessert menu that I really regret not ordering from!

Text: We are from out of town and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. We had the fajitas and the meat was cooked perfectly. The kids had plenty of food and all of the meals were very well priced. Great experience overall!

Text: I should have read the review about the fajitas before I ordered them. I love fajitas but found these to be excessively greasy in a thin sauce that had flavor, but not a flavor that either my girlfriend and I enjoyed. Nice atmosphere and pleasant staff along with a great story of immigrants making it in America. Unfortunately, the food didn't make the grade for a couple of foodies.
