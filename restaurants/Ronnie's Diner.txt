Text: The food was great and the service was excellent. My wife and I are retried and do a lot of traveling.
 We eat our big meal of the day at lunch so we share dinner. They had no problem splitting a burger and onion rings and gave each of us a separate plate with our own salad for the burger. Our daughter ordered a club wrap and sweet potato fries and loved it. We highly recommend this diner.

Text: Ronnie's Dinner is a cute small town dinner. The day we were there they were very busy with the Bike Across Kansas crew. The staff was very friendly and the food was good :)
