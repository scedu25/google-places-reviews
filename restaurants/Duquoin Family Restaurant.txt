Text: Recently changed hours to 6a-3pm. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Nicely decorated. Chandeliers.  Restrooms clean. But, need an update, bad! Good service. Friendly staff. Breakfast anytime. Hang out for locals. Family friendly. Travelers treated like locals. 
I've never had a  bad meal or service there. Menu expansive. Daily specials.
