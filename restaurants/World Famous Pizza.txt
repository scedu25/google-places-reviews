Text: Tried this place earlier this week. Order the double crust. Was fresh and hot. Had a great taste and was very filling. Would definitely eat here again. It's more of a carry out/delivery style place, however they do have a couple tables for dine in.

Text: Love their pizza.  Garlic as a topping is fabulous.  Delivery drivers are fast and the pizza always arrives hot.  The best pizza in DeKalb county.  Don't forget the JBs World famous in Lord Stanleys too!
