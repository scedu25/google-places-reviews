Smith's Restaurant

Text: This place has really delicious food. Although it's pretty crowded on the weekend. Expect a 10-15 minute wait. There is limited seating, so if you plan to go try to get there before the crowd!

There food is of good quality. They have efficient cooks because you can tell by the taste of the food.

The customer service is excellent. I got the sirloin with two sides; green beans and a baked potato. It was delicious!

Text: On vacation we always look for local business, non food chain, restaurants.  We found Smith's Restaurant in our search.  There were a couple people waiting to be seated upon our arrival at 12:30pm on Sunday.  We had a large group, so we figured our wait would be slightly longer than normal.  All the customers were super nice and courteous.  We were finally seated at 1pm.  From the time we sat to the time we received our food was 50 minutes.  Our food was lukewarm, not hot, as if had been sitting finished for a while.  The vibe we received is this is a local only restaurant, not one that welcomes out of towners.  We won't be back.

Text: There isn't a better pork tenderloin sandwich available in the United States. I highly recommend this place. They make their own pies in house. Smith's has a country kitchen type atmosphere. It's kind of one of those little hole-in-the-wall restaurants. It appeared clean and the staff was friendly. Enjoy.

Text: Great comfort food for a crowd or a single person, kids live it, we used to stop by on our way through, now my wife and i, or even her parents will drive down just for dinner.  I would recommend the Philly, or Tenderloin.  You gotta try the onion rings also, we've never had complaints
