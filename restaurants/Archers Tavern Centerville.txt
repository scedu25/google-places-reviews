Archers Tavern Centerville

Text: Always friendly service, you feel like part of the family. Great food with plenty of favorites but also frequent new and limited time choices. My husband loves all the different options of beer on tap, but be prepared to pick a second just in case the keg is tapped.

Text: Ordered a $9 burger; was not asked how I wanted it cooked. (Medium, well done, etc.), and the buns were basically generic store-bought and dry. When I got the burger, it was, pretty lame. However when I asked for something different, they were very friendly and did give me something else.

Did not have any beer but was not impressed by the selection.

Text: I love archers. Their burgers are really good and their nachos are yummy. My favorite thing is their taco salad. Try it with grilled chicken!

Text: A comfortable place to eat with enough of a twist on typical pub food to make it memorable. Can get pretty crowded and noisy during peak hours though, but if you're looking for a place that says "cool without trying too hard", perhaps to bring a date or meet with friends, this is a good spot. Try the peanut butter burger, but make sure you ask for some hot pepper jelly on the side, or go for the Sleepy Dutchman if you want a gut buster that will leave you on the edge of food coma.

Text: This is a very popular hometown restaurant, with a local flair. I recommend the Brandon Burger and the cheesecake made with blueberry donuts from Bill's Donuts.
