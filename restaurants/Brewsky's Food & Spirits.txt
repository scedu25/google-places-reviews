Text: There were a few of us that attended a company meeting on 11/1/17. As a group we wanted to thank Cole T (1527, per receipt) for his excellent customer service, patience, accuracy and overall positive attitude. I don't know how he managed to keep all of our orders and tickets in order but he did! We will definitely be coming back here!!! Thanks again Cole for the awesome service!

Text: Good was good once I got the correct item. I got my change back in quarters, dimes and nickels. So the waitress got a tip in quarters, dimes and nickels.
