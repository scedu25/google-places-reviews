Text: Terrible pizza ordered lite sauce and it was burnt on the bottom, I called imo and they said it was crispy because of lite sauce, I said its Burt on the bottom because of lite sauce " really" my dog who it's eats ?would not eat it so I called the owner Craig and he said the same thing that it would be crisper with lite sauce, I guess that's the way they are trained, Don't waste your money and time with these clowns, order from Alex or Pryors pizza and enjoy a real pizza pie.
