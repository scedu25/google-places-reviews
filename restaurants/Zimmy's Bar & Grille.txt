Text: We had a great meal. Traveled all day 5 hours on the road.  Stopped and had supper there. I had the ribs, the best I have had.  My wife had the steak unbelievable, great food. Service was poor at first, but when the manager found out about the poor waitress service he took care of us himself.  Will definitely go back anytime we are in the area.  Went back for breakfast the next morning, that was also worth going for.   Check this out.
