Text: Awesome food, decent service. Our waiter didn't understand English very well, which is fine unless you're trying to serve a primarily English speaking community. We wanted a pitcher of margaritas, but he thought we wanted to see a picture of the sizes of margs and brought out the different sized glasses they are served in. We tried to mime it, we tried to do English to Spanish translation online. In the end, he brought over a different waiter to figure out what we needed.

Text: The food is fantastic! They serve the best shredded beef I have had at a Mexican restaurant. The salsa is delicious and the green sauce. They are cheap, but very good!
