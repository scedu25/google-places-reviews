BRGR Kitchen + Bar
Rating: 4
Text: The atmosphere here is fairly good.  They have a garage door that opens up to the patio seating area, the plus is an open air feeling; the minus is it allows the bugs to come inside. (I believe that they do their best to keep the restaurant clean and neat.)  The service was very good for lunch on Sunday.  The food is almost your standard "surf-n-turf" done Midwestern style (not much, if any "surf" food).  This part of the country the options for this type of establishment are burgers and chicken.  The mustard and ketchup where bottled and branded under the BRGR brand, thus it leads one to believe that it is made locally (I was not able to find out if this is the case).  Overall, I enjoyed the "Blackbird" sandwich and the fries. I recommend this establishment for a return trip and would like to try it for dinner next time.

Text: The food here is really good. Somewhat more expensive than it should be considering nothing is included with your burger. Clean with nice decor. Staff was friendly. Sit inside or outside.

Text: The shake was delicious! But the veggie burger was inedible... it’s a shame they didn’t put more attention to the recipe

Text: Good food, with some delicious innovations. Several versions of burgers, each compelling so I have reasons to return. 

Today I tried the Haddock sandwich, which was good, but it came with cheddar cheese. It was noted on the menu but I forget to request that it be prepared without cheese. 

We also enjoyed sides of fries and onion rings, also well prepared and served.
