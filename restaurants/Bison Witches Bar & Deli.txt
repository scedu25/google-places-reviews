Text: One of my favorite local food joints and has been for at least 15 years. The food is excellent and the prices are extremely reasonable. It's not a fancy place by any means, but that just means you can come as you are with no worries!

Text: Wholesome food. I always go half sandwich and soup, and usually switch something up. I've never been disappointed with anything I'm served. I love this place!

Text: Delicious, no nonsense soup and sandwiches made with premium ingredients ad served in a welcoming bar/deli atmosphere. My mouth is STILL watering as I think about their cheddar-bacon soup. Soooooo good!
