Text: Such a fun place. We had the three tier tea. There was plenty of savory bits and some lovely sweets. However,  the best part was tasting all of the teas. They have more than 50 delightful varieties of tea.

Text: Using my girlfriends account b/c I don't have google. Not only poor service. But as we were leaving she mentioned some jewelry she liked. Later I went back to buy it for her. The kind she wanted was almost gone. So I went to hostess stand and was completely ignored. Only 3 or 4 feet away, and she just looked the other way like I didn't exist. I almost said something but decided they were not worth my business. Especially after the poor service with my girl

Text: The staff is very accommodating and friendly. I went with a group and was able to request gluten free options for part of our party which were brought out on separate plates. The snacks were tasty and filling and the teas were amazing. I will definitely be going back. The only con for me is the location and distance to get there from Louisville.

Text: Great finger foods and multiple teas to try! Caffeinated, caffeine-free, and herbal are just a few kinds of tea they offer, along with black and green teas. They has multiple gluten free finger foods to try. Nice little boutique in the front, very clean. Very busy on Saturdays. You can reserve their private room for baby showers, bridal showers, and more.
