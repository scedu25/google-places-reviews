Text: Food was good but overpriced.  I had the buffet and will say they have a very nice selection and that includes the salad bar.  The food was plentiful.  The fried chicken was delicious. The only issue was their desert selection, which was very limited.  My bill for one without a drink but, with tax and a $3.00 tip was $19.00.  

The decor is very drab and needs some extreme updating.  Building looks somewhat run-down and in need of cleaning and repair.  I was there at the peak of dinner (approx. 6:30 p.m.) on a Saturday evening and I counted a total of 18 people including myself.  By 7:50 p.m. the place was almost empty with no one else arriving.

Text: Almost always the best food but on this visit the ribs tasted precooked and then over cooked when adding bbq sauce. The chicken was amazing and the two curvy sisters and mom that work there gave the best service and hospitality ever. Truly southern charm and team work was brought to our table time and time again. Thanks gals!

Text: Great crab legs on Friday nights, very responsibly priced at 7.99 a lb. Fresh food on the buffet and friendly service. Excellent family dining or large groups.

Text: Everyone is super friendly and food is excellent and homemade. And for those that complain about them not being open, if you can post negative things on here surely you're smart enough to call a head or check business hours online.
