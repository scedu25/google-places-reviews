Text: We just had Sunday brunch to celebrate my wife's birthday. Great service, fresh oysters and ample parking. Our server was Jose T,  super attentive and patient, which was especially appreciated since we had our two young rambunctious boys in tow.

We'll definitely be back!

Text: My girlfriend and me went for Brunch last week and the price was higher than anticipated for a restaurant that is supposedly to have fresh seafood. The Brunch was 45$ which included a hot a and cold bar. The cold bar had sushi that wasn’t authentic nor an amazing selection, the shrimp cocktail was over cooked and the oysters were fishy which indicates old and not fresh. This was disappointing and the hot bar was just as a let down. All food at the hot bar was over cooked and not hot nor seasoned well. I truly feel this restaurant is over priced and not fresh i feel this restaurant also is “americanized” and could use some improvements. I hope to visit soon with the changes set forth.

Text: Absolutely Amazing and Fresh!! Best lobster bisque And Best Clam Chowder. I ordered the seafood sampler that had garlic shrimp, scallops, and a crab cake with spinach. It was the best seafood I have ever had yet. The service was excellent as well. To top it off, being our first time we got a chocolate mousse cake that I probably wouldn’t have ordered but it was DE-LIC-IOUS!! This is the place to go!!
