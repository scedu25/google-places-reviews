Text: Great place for Chicken, Chicken and more Chicken. Portions are huge and pricing is cheap. Expect a wait in line, but well worth it. Everyone is very friendly and their workers go the extra mile. Always a great experience when I go.

Text: Super generous portions, very attentive, friendly service. It’s also an affordable place to eat - I got a chicken dinner for under $9 and it was better than any fast food I could have picked up. Looking forward to coming back here!

Text: I've been here 3 or 4 times. Strangely enough, and without a guess as to why, this visit was not busy at all. Bring a large group if you have one - they have the space. I typically get the 1/2 fried chicken, but I've had the wings dinner, too. I need to branch out and try something else on the menu sometime. So, yes, I'll be back. :)

Text: Once again the food and service were both superb! The prices are great and you get a TON of food. If you go in make sure to ask to be seated in Mike's section. He is the absolute best!

Text: The place is in a not awesome neighborhood, the chicken was nothing special (cornmeal breading, so what, tasted like plain old chicken). Not sure what they hype is about but save yourself the time and just go to Southern or Gus's.
