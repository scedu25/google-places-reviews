Text: Good place. There weren't any patrons eating inside when I arrived but there were a couple take out orders called in. Great food for a reasonable price. Not a place to be rated on the outside but very much worth a trip inside. I would go back.

Text: For a small town, this is about my favourite restaurant. Lunch buffets and Friday  night buffet . Made to order whenever you ask. Very polite and attendant wait staff. Good food. Family owned and ran. This is our families *look forward to* place to go.

Text: Very friendly staff and great food, all in a small town. Also the building it's in is quite unique and you can just image what it was like in the 50's with the fireplace and piano in the lobby.
