Text: Dickies bar and grill was amazing. Remember to. Ask for Julie for Superior service. The food is good. The menu is also good. Beware they do not open until 5!

Text: It's a great place, with an absolutely beautiful golf course. The rooms are small and 'cozy', but the bathroom/showers are slightly small. The pool and hot tub are really nice, but very hot. Very hot. There is breakfast in the morning, and while it is unoriginal, it still tastes very good. The location itself is nice, while the golf course is very visually appealing and fun to play on. Overall, great place at a very competitive price. Go here if you need somewhere to stay for a night or two!

Text: Great conference facility and really helpful staff that are willing to do whatever it takes to make your event go smooth. The wait staff are also incredible and so polite. Food is good and coffee is tasty. The grounds are very well kept too.

Text: My experience may not be representative of Swan Lake as a whole, as I there for a work conference. Limited interaction with staff, but in my experience they were pleasant and helpful. The facilities are spacious and clean. The lunch buffet left a lot to be desired. Overall, it was fine.. But I admittedly did not get see most of what the resort has to offer.

Text: Wasn't there overnight, just for a conference during the day. So I can't say much other than the food was pretty good and conference rooms were nice. Seemed like pretty good service too.
