Text: I really enjoyed the hotel. It is clean, and the front desk staff has been great. I've already stayed there twice, and will be staying there a third time next week. This is my go to hotel when I'm in the area for work.

Text: Stayed in those hotel while we were in town for a wedding. The room was surprisingly large, and my husband and I both agreed it was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've slept on. The breakfast was included as a part of the wedding package, the omelette station was a fantastic treat. The only cons to our stay were how early the bar closed and having to physically check out. I haven't been to a hotel that you had to actually go back to the front desk to check out, in years.. we found that very strange.

Text: One of the friendliest front desk staffs I have ever had the pleasure to meet.  During my travels to Chicago I experience a runaway suitcase from someone in the airport that proceeded to try and take out my knee... the front desk staff noticed my hobbled up knee and immediately provided a welcomed ice pack for me.   Not often do you see this kind of care and concern.

Text: Very reasonable price for what they have offered. Nice lotion, close to all the stores and restaurants. But the hotel itself located in a quite little corner away from all the busy traffic. The best part of this hotel is it's room set up. Bedroom is nicely separated from other rooms, it's beautiful. looks new and clean.
