Text: My favorite part was my drinks, very tasty-however, the brie appetizer was not great. It was served in a cheap dough, had no taste. My lamb dish had an odd sauce. The restaurant did not accept a visa giftcard. It was hard to pay SO much money for food and service that did not match the bill.

Text: Poor experience which is quite disheartening for how much it costs to dine there. I was very excited to try this restaurant but was let down. Our food took an hour to arrive, my food was cold and the noodles were mushy because they were overcooked, and overall the flavor was bland. My date's steak also not up to par at all. When we asked our server which wine he suggested with our meal, he rattled one off and we asked, "Oh why do you like that wine in particular?" And his response was, "Oh, I don't like it, but it's the cheapest." I am thinking because I am in my twenties he assumes I'm poor and can't afford nice wine. So incredibly rude and offensive. I will not return and do not recommend.
