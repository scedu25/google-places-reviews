Text: Great food and lovely milk shakes made to order and great service too even if they get busy at times.  They also do ice cream cones that are really good, and they come in a chocolate and vanilla half n half version too.  Don't wait, stop in and get their great food.

Text: Free ice cream with bacon for dogs! Best pork tenderloin, & really good shakes~ Fried cauliflower was good to try, too. Right along the Mississippi River so nice to eat outside (also allows dogs at picnic tables).
