Text: Italian beef sandwich was served cold, we sent it back,  it was returned almost warm. The one slice of cheese wasn't even melted. Aujus was warm, yet had no flavor. That being said, waitresses were sincere with their apologies, our service was 5 star.

Text: Deserves less than one star. Did not have a great experience last week and the fish was not that good. Decided to try again just to sit outside and enjoy the evening but the potato skins were horrible and we canceled the Rubens and decided to leave. It took about 10 minutes to get an answer about how much one beer cost. Left enough to pay for the beer and cover the tax and walked out, making sure the staff knew of our displeasure about the food and experience. We will definitely NOT return and will make sure to share this horrible experience with anyone we speak to.
