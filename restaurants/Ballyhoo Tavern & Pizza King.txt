Ballyhoo Tavern & Pizza King
Rating: 3
Text: This place was friendly. Typical bar food. I was there on a Thursday afternoon so I can't accurately judge this place. The service could have been more attentive. I didn't want to appear to be high maintenance when I made a request for silverware or napkins. However, during lunch the staff neglected to check to see if I had basic utensils. The personality of the staff was welcoming.
