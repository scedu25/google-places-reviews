Text: The food is always good, but they started to skimp on their white cheesy sauce. When you ask for extra they bring it out in a little bitty ketchup cup, and then charge you $2.00 for it. They need to work on their English as well. It can be very difficult to order your food with especially when you have questions on a certain dish. Their margaritas are good though, and they have several different flavors.

Text: I usually love this place but ate there today.   Didnt get what i wanted made the way i asked for it.   Which was without beans.   And it was full of beans.  Waiter never came back after we received meal so could not make a complaint then. Had to ask for our ticket to leave.   I will go back nut super disappointed this time.
