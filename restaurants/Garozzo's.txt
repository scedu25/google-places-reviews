Garozzo's

Text: Wish I could give negative stars.  During a non-busy time, over an hour and a half wait for food.  Then the food was cold and had been obviously sitting for a while.  Some drinks that were ordered never came.  Asked for bread 3 times before it finally arrived.  Poor service and subpar food.  

I have been to other Garozzo's with a good to great experience.  I would rather go to any Olive Garden than to this location again.

Text: Great place lunch with old friends visiting from out of town.  Excellent pasta and salads.  Attentive service.  We will be back!

Text: Very good Italian food. Portions are plentiful and could even be shared. Prices are $16 to $30, plus extra for salad, drink and dessert, so anticipate accordingly.

Text: Service has been excellent every time we've been here, and the food is always great. Good place for actually being able to hear and talk to the other person you're with as well.  Highly recommend the house salad, the stuffed artichoke appetizer, and the bistecca salerno (if you're there for dinner).

Update Aug 2017: Very sad to hear the Lee's Summit location is closing.

Text: Seated quickly by a very friendly hostesses. Atmosphere was pleasant even when every table was full.  Salad was below average and didn't come with meal.  Only one serving of bread but it was high quality and tasted great.  Pasta was amazing, very generous size.  Wait staff was great, checking in frequently and keeping our water full.  I would eat there again!
