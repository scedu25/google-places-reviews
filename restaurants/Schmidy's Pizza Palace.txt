Text: Great pizza! AWFUL service!

It was a Friday night and I started calling around 8:30 to order a pizza. I proceeded to call multiple times within the next 20 minutes before someone finally answered. The person on the line went on to tell me that they stop taking orders at 8:30. I said I called around that time. He proceeded to tell me know I didn't it was 8:35. Needless to say he heard the 10 calls and didn't answer the phone. A simple explanation that they stopped taking orders at 8:30 would have been nice instead of just ignoring the phone for 20 minutes.

I have also gone to the restaurant multiple times and the waitress rarely comes to the table. 

The service could be better. A lot better.
