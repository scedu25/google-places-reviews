The Meeting Place on Market

Text: This place is a nice little spot downtown, the food is good the atmosphere is a little dark but overall ok. Today I went in for a coffee and see that they now offer pour over coffee, which I do regularly at home. The whole process was done incorrectly, the barista/ server didn't care about it nor was she taught correctly. If your going to offer this grade of service make sure the staff knows how to correctly do a pour over coffee, it makes a world of difference if done right. I won't be getting coffee again from here.
