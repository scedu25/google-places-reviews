Text: Love this place. Great food and rustic atmosphere. It's only open three days a week for dinner so make sure you get here when you can. I only get one thing, the only thing... walleye dinner! Half pound of walleye, fries and coleslaw. I will skip lunch just for this place. Fyi it is cash only here.

Text: Very good fried Carp and Catfish fingers.  Cole slaw is a bit sweet but I like it that way.
Friday serve staff swamped but wait not excessive.
