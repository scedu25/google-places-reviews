Text: Me and bae had a $50 gift card, so obviously we got half the menu... God lord... We felt like The King and The Queen (capitalized on purpose) of the land. That's how good it was. Little pricey, but in the end well worth it. Great location, great service, and ultimately great food.

Text: It was decent Italian food. For the price we paid, I think it could have been better. Aside from that, it has a cool location at fountain square and the wait staff did an excellent job!

Text: Food was excellent, service was attentive polite and patient. All courses were served in good time and everything was cooked to perfection. Not to mention a classy yet laid back atmosphere. We were laughing out of pure joy (and montepulciano abruzzo) by the end. Fantastic food and memorable night out.

Text: I wish I could leave two totally separate reviews. For the kitchen I would give 5 stars, for the staff 1 star. The food was fantastic, my husband and I had the gnocchi to start and then the lamb shank and steak, all cooked perfectly. On the other hand, our waiter Ian was the strangest / rudest waiter I've ever met. He was brusque with us but to the table next to us he bragged that "all my tables love me" and that he is "often mistaken for Ed Sheeran". At the end of the night he threw the bill and pen on the table and said "thanks for coming in" and walked off. But about halfway through our meal, the hostess sat someone behind us that was clearly homeless (we had seen smoking outside the restaurant for the last thirty minutes). While they gave him bread and waited to take his order (of course he never ordered) he kept yelling at us at our table that he had been robbed and needed money. I've got to admit I've never had this happen inside a restaurant such as this. Even when the waiter interrupted him from talking with us, he still stayed until we finished and kept trying to ask us for money. Of course I think he should have been treated with compassion and the staff could have given him something to eat at the bar and offered to call the police if he had really been robbed, though I doubt he had. Overall - great food, horrible staff.

Text: Delicious food! We had a party and reserved the upstairs room. Staff was incredibly professional and attentive. I always had a drink in hand! The chef is very friendly and you can tell he takes great pride in everything he does. Definitely upscale Italian! Highly recommend!
