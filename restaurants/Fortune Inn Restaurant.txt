Text: Worst Chinese I've ever eaten. Had about three bites of the happy family and threw it away, the chicken was very mushy. The beef in the lo mein was chewy and the noodle and sauce were very bland! The egg roll and sauce served with it was the only good thing about the food. The lady was very friendly though.
