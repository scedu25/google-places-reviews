Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza

Text: The pizza here was pretty awesome. There are so many different options to choose from and I'm excited to come back and try different pizzas. The only gripe I have food-wise is about the breadsticks. They were good, but seemed like freezer bread sticks. The dipping sauces with them were amazing though. Service was fast and the employees were super friendly.

Text: We had excellent service! I'm so grateful Kevin was our waiter. The 9th salad without shrimp was my favorite of the 3 we tried, and the creamy garlic dressing is absolutely to die for! I wish I could safely transport it back home, many states away. I will find a way...

Text: Met some friends for lunch. I haven't been to the area before, so I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the neighborhood was. Jockamo was equally as pleasant.  The restaurant is very inviting and the staff was friendly and attentive. I've had Jackamo pizza before in Greenwood, but this was even better.  My whole family had a great time and we will definitely be back.

Text: Best pizza in Indy, with something for just about everyone.  Definitely some interesting combinations.  Sandwiches are also excellent.  They also have great weekday lunch specials.
