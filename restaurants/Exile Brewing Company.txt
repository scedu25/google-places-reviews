Text: Wow! This place blew me away. Food, service and atmosphere (especially the patio) were top notch. I was in town for a wedding and the hotel recommended it to us. We had a great lunch! Highly recommend.

Text: Atmosphere was good. Staff was nice. I recommend ANY burger (personally loves the Black & Blue burger; comes on a pretzel bun & has amazing onion rings in it). 
I suggest doing their flights. Great deal for four 6oz glasses. 
They have plenty of parking.
Nice outdoor, indoor area with a more personal dining area in back.

Text: Super disappointed! I have never had a problem when coming here with my co workers before. Brought my husband here for lunch, we watched 3 tables seated after us receive food before us. I had to go find our waitress to let her know we were still waiting for food after 45 minutes. Before even getting our food the waitress asked if we would just need a to go box when it was ready. We finally got our food an hour after ordering. It was greasy and flavorless, fries seemed over salted, hard pass on the to go box thanks! I got an apology and no adjustment to our bill. Will not be going back.

Text: This place is great. Came here family and friend and was blown away by the quality of food at a “brewery”. I had pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. I highly recommend this place to family and friends and will be going back soon. I only gave it 5 starts because google won’t allow me to give it anymore.

Text: I can't recommend a visit to Exile strongly enough! We were visiting from Indiana and searching for a dog friendly place to have lunch. We are thankful to the kind stranger who strongly suggested we try Exile! The staff was beyond kind and helpful, the food amazing and our dogs had a great time! Thank you Exile!!
