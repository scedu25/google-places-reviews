Text: The Chicken Crab Rangoon rolls were amazing!  Everything else Including the service was awful!!!! We were staying at the hotel next door and ate here three different times. The service was incredibly slow each time. I would understand if the place had been busy but each time we came the place wasn't busy at all. Worst part, the waitresses were running around like it was crazy while extra employees stood at the front talking, not helping at all. Including the manager.

Text: food was great, if you like waiting a half hour for drinks, and an hour for food. I am pretty patient, but the place was not busy at all.  heard took over new ownership, if this is true, you need to get in there and hire people who want to work.  we got our drinks, then waited forever for another, decided to just go to the bar to get them ourselves, bar not busy, saw our waitress on the phone!  lol  had to wave the bartender over to order drinks! just ridiculous because last year place was packed, and service was great.  complete flop this year.  probably wont go back, not because we didn't have fun and food wasn't good all because of the service!
