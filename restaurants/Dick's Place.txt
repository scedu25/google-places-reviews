Text: This was the worst service I think I ever had they were a couple Indian guys there that you had to beg for your beer not to mention the hamburgers that we had ordered were Raw they had nothing to do with the cook they had some young girl there cooking and the Munch plate we ordered were overcooked the onion rings that were on the Munch plate we're so over cooked that the onion there was no onion in the batter that was cooked and I didn't drink beer but my brother did and every time he wanted a beer he had to and it was next to impossible to get their attention. I will never go there again

Text: I haul grain through this town  every so often and I can say that the burgers here are really good. Man alive they got it topped! Coming to the area is VERY dangerous though as the locals in this area " drive it like you stole it" mentality when it comes to their cars and trucks. I guess I can't come through here and enjoy it as much, if you have people that are so dangerous when you drive to the area that you have to call your life insurance agent just to make sure it is up to date!
