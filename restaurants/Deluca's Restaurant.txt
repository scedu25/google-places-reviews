Text: I love this pizza. I order a meaty meat with extra meat and triple cheese. It's not even on the menu, it takes twice as long to cook, and occasionally two people to carry it out of the kitchen. Old school feel to the place and their turnaround time on getting orders out is pretty awesome.

Text: Amazing food, drinks, and atmosphere! I've been here several times, both takeout and dining in, and every time is delicious! Their food is authentic Italian and pizza. Their cheesy bread is unbelievable and they have great Moscow Mules too :) Of course the pizza is amazing as well. Highly recommend!

Text: Often very busy and hard to find an open parking spot, but for a good reason. The food is amazing and comes in huge portions. The prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food you get.

Text: The Monday spaghetti special was excellent.  The meat sauce on the angel hair pasta is thick and tangy.  Not knowing that in advance, however, I ordered meatballs which were large and very good. Soup or salad with a basket of breadsticks comes with the meal.  The cost of this fine Italian fare was very reasonable.

Text: Great down-home dinner place with great food and prices. I had a half serving of spaghetti and could only eat about half. It was very good. I really appreciated the atmosphere--not at all like a chain. You could tell the decor was from an earlier time, but it was still well-kept. That it was packed on a Tuesday night and everyone seemed to be having a good time said a lot.
