Text: Staying in Dublin after attending a Blue Jackets game, looking for a place to grab a beer and a quick bite.  Found it! Perfect place for a couple of drinks, an appetizer and a sandwich.  Morgan our server was awesome! Very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  Atmosphere was spot on, authentic Irish pub vibe.  Food was above average and came out quickly. Will definitely be back.

Text: I went on a Wednesday which turned out to be $4 burger night. I got a burger for $4 dollars and they asked how I wanted it cooked. 

The drink selection is great and priced well. Awesome atmosphere. This place is worth a wait

Text: Summer 2017- we went on a Wednesday night. They were having a special on burgers, only $4. The food was good but they were so busy it took 45 min to get them. 
The bar tender was amazing. He kept everyone's drinks full even the non alcoholic ones. 
Besides it being so busy the worst part was there was no hostess. So we had to seat ourselves... Which would have been fine if there was available tables. I'm heavily pregnant I didn't appreciate having to go outside to the patio, to the upstairs, to the downstairs only to discover the only place to sit was at the bar. There was honestly not anywhere else to sit.
