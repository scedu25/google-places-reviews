Crazy Burrito

Text: Food was decent but the star of the show was the service!  I was asked by no less than six different employees while seated if I needed anything. So many people got drinks and brought food I am not really sure who my true waiter was. I hope this type of service is rewarded with large tips.

Text: We only had a short wait for a table for 7 on a Saturday night. Service was decent, although I don't believe we saw any staff member more than once. One waiter took our order, another brought our drinks and chips, another brought our food, and a 4th brought our check. Portions were large and the food was good, although nothing spectacular to separate them from other Mexican restaurants. Overall a good experience.

Text: Service was awful and slow. We had to hunt down our server anytime we needed anything. It was obvious he did not care. Food was good but there are two better Mexican restaurants in Marsyville.
