Text: We had a reservation for 645pm. We arrived at 640pm.  We were told was being clean that it would b a few mins.  Another hostess came and she gave r table away and laughed at me when i asked her why?  Not professional at all.  She kept lying to us for 30 mins until we got a table at 720pm

Text: All I can say is, I’ve never had a bad meal here nor has anyone I’ve been here with.  Probably the better way to put it is, every meal I’ve had here has been wonderful!  Recently had the Osso  Buco special.  It was divine, the veal shank was tender, the veggies cooked perfectly, the gnocchi and sauce delectable, yummm.  I can also speak for the eggplant parm, it’s the best I have ever had.  Kudos to Rosebud in Naperville.

Text: My favorite summer meal is the eggplant salad!  Wonderful "parmesan " style, thin slices of eggplant with artisan lettuces and fresh mozzarella slices in between. Dressed with reduced balsamic vinegar. This is a large portion and very filling.  I have also ordered it to go, and the vinegar comes on the side so it doesn't get soggy.  A must try!

Text: Consistently good Italian food across all locations in the Rosebud family of restaurants. Vesuvio-style, flank steak with potato wedges was great. Recommended for those seeking classic, Italian food by a reliable Chicago restaurant group.

Text: Awful service, they do not hold their word on reservations and awful hostess working in front. Incredibly rude and no manners. NEVER GO HERE!
