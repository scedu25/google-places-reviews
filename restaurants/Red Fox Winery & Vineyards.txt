Red Fox Winery & Vineyards
Rating: 5
Text: Our family went back to Red Fox Winery and had another amazing experience!  We tried their new red wine, Three Oaks, and it became my favorite.  We had a gyro, burger and fish and it was so delicious!  For dessert, we had the tiramisu, which was home made, and it was so wonderful!  We learned that they grow blackberry bushes and cherry trees for their wines. They grow fresh vegetables and herbs for their food.  This is definitely a place to relax and enjoy!

Text: Finally quality food with Flavor. One of my favorite places to eat within 50 miles. Great atmosphere. Good place to celebrate something special. Dirt road access. Fresh herb garden. Can accommodate a large party. May have limited help staff. Diverse menu. Chef and owners from Armenia. Can get pricy but you get what you pay for. Limited dining hours.

Text: We stumbled on Red Fox while heading to Springfield and it has to be one of my top ten wineries. Hidden away from the city it's a nice quite winery with a lot of tasty wines, as well as food. The owner's are welcoming and very knowledgeable, even after we're done trying wines we find ourselves hanging out and talking with them.

The wine was fabulous and we brought some home until we go back again. I have already set up a girls outing and have told all my friends! Definitely go experience Red Fox Winery! Thanks so much for an amazing Sunday!
