Text: I had my baby shower here and it was amazing! The food was great and we were able to reserve a private space. Super chic place. Prices a reasonable. Parking on Mass Ave can be tricky during the week but other than that I would definitely recommend this place!

Text: Mediocre. I expected more.  Halibut Tacos we’re dry and not much flavor.  In the dining area where we sat, it wasn’t as special as the website.  I could have stayed in Carmel and found a more unique place to celebrate a 50th Anniversary.  We were looking for more of a “city” feel.  I also think my brother got food poisoning from the scallops too.

Text: This place used to be good.. They have clearly cut corners to save money or something.  Food is uneventful but still pricey.  I'd suggest going to many other choices in the area.
