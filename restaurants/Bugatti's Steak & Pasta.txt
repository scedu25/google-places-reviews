Bugatti's Steak & Pasta

Text: Been here many times with large groups and once with just my wife and all times the staff was great and food was awesome. Environment is more upscale but no dress code which is nice in my opinion. I normally get the king cut New York strip or ribeye cooked medium-rare Pittsburgh style and it's always cooked to perfection. I once ordered a beer that they were out of and to my surprise they walked down to the sports bar next door and got it from them. Can't ask for more.

Text: Place is really amazing. Bring your girl..or guy....whatever your into. Buy a bottle of wine, relax and enjoy the food! It's all very good, but that damn bread they start with is to die for!

Text: Holy cow... This was an incredible experience. Our group had a great time! Two guys split the 44oz tomahawk steak, and the other two got the t-bone steaks. Both were absolutely mind blowing. They threw in extra sides, and deserts, and the staff was amazing. Thanks for the great time Yuni! I was skeptical of the price, but it was worth it.
