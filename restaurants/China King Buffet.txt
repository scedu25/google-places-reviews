China King Buffet
Rating: 3
Text: Staff is usually friendly, but not today. The server was cranky when I asked for a different table then where she wanted to seat us.....I don't like to be crammed together. There's more than plenty space for family's to sit with a table or so between them. The food is good, when it's fresh. Too often my family and I have come in to "old nasty food" that has sat on the steam table WAY TOO LONG! The only way to get them to make fresh is to load your plate and leave it to be thrown away. Tonight, the soup isn't even hot. Honestly, barely warm. Come on, they know when things are no longer good.
