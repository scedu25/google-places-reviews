Text: Cream sauce was a bit thin. Generous servings on red sauce items. Garlic bread could have been more flavorful. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Silverware wrapped in paper napkins. Good for families.

Text: The food is great here.  I love their salads and the pizza special is great.  Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but besides that, its worth checking out!
