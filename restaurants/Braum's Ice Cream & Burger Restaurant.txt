Braum's Ice Cream & Burger Restaurant

Text: I buy 90% of my milkshakes from your store, and the quality of both food & service has gone way down. We were not even acknowledged when we were there, took us at least 15 min to even order & neither shake was even full. I love the food & shakes, but some of your help looks like they could care less about the customers. One girl, who's name tag said "Morgan", kept looking in the mirror every time somebody walked in, like it just annoyed her. I've been on both sides of the fast food cabinet, and this is a problem that keeps getting worse & worse. Sorry, but teamwork is a necessity in this business, and it didn't seem like anybody working even knows what that is. I will continue to go to braums, but customer service issues need addressed.
