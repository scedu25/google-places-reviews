Iowa’s Best Burger Café
Rating: 2
Text: Bearable at best. The first impression I got of this 'Cafe' was a gas station, and a grass lot next to a highway with RVs. I stayed the night in my camper, and was kept up by the constant sound of cars on the interstate 80, which was just 200-some metres away. The bathroom and shower amenities had no hooks, hangers, or shelves, and did not have anything to protect your feet (such as a grate.) The shower head was alright, though. I got warm water for the time I had in the shower. The actual 'Cafe' is really just an ice cream bar and a single grill inside a gas station. The bathroom in the cafe did not lock. All in all, I left one night early and headed for a state park in Minnesota.

Text: The place was absolutely filthy and disgusting. Should really be closed by the health board and the building condemned and torn down! Take my advice, DON'T BOTHER STOPPING HERE!!!
