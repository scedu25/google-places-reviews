Royal Mile
Rating: 5
Text: I always look forward to a trip to the Royal Mile! On our most recent visit, the place was so packed it was hard to find a table, but the servers were all helpful, pleasant, and patient. The poutine is the best appetizer, the savory meat and gravy mixed with the crunchy, salty fries shouldn't be passed up. As for the main entrees, the Cornish pasty is a favorite.  The food is a wonderful surprise in addition to the extensive beer selection.

Text: I love this place. Good beer, great scotch, excellent pub food. Best place in town to watch soccer.
And don't miss the Red Monk upstairs. Specializing in Belgian and Belgian style beers. Quaint.

Text: Good beer, and great whiskey selections.  The bangers and mash are good, but I wasn't a big fan of the fish and chips.  This is a great place to go with a small group of friends, if you want to have a few drinks, and a good conversation.

Text: Great place for a bite to eat or a drink. Classic pub look and food to match. If you love British meat and potatoes type food, this place cannot be beat.

Text: The Royal Mile/Red Monk is my favorite bar and has been for the last 5 years. I've met so many wonderful patrons and have fun memories with friends. Every time we come to visit (we moved out of state) we get together with friends here. 

Their food is also worth trying if you like lighter traditional Irish food.
