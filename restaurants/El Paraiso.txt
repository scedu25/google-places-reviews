Text: I found el parariso to awesome ! They have decorated this place over the years ! I find it entertaining to see all the Momentos. 
Their nachos are fresh along with all their food as it is all  homemade ! And it's incredible to get such good food at such a great price. I recommend The fresh cut beef fajitas. I hope you do go it's right across the street from Burger King and very rare to get homemade food I did go at lunchtime and noticed that it was very quick service so go see for yourself !!

Text: My family was visiting Cozad and decided to try El Paraiso for Mother's Day lunch. They were understandably busy. We were seated and given chips and salsa and water. We waited for a server to take our order but one never came. There were 2 servers serving the area we were in and we watched other tables who were seated after us order while we were ignored. I even tried to get one of the server's attention as she was busy putting two tables together next to ours but she didn't respond to the two times I said, "excuse me, madam". After we waited 25-30 minutes without being acknowledged, we finally got up, offered to pay for the chips and salsa and left.
