Text: Great dinner on the rooftop deck as we are winding down a terrific day date on the Michigan coast.  Hubby had the Blackened Grouper and I had the Perch.  Nice starter salad and even the veggies were great.  But more than that was the excellent service we got from Jenni!  Will visit again!

Text: It is nice to have the option to dine on the roof patio when weather permits, although food options are limited.  The restaurant one level down is nice, but rather dark. The food was great and the service fast. I'd go back.
