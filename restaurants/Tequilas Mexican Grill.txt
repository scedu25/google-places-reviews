Text: I feel so sorry for you poor folks up here that have to eat the Mexican food around these parts, come on down to Texas one day and see what texmex is really supposed to taste like. God bless your hearts. I think I just ate philly cheese steak nachos at a "Mexican" food restaurant. Little pieces of leather shoe string doesn't equal steak.
