Text: My wife saw this place on the news, we were on a day trip with friends. Just made a quick stop for a beverage, and to check it out. Neat place, lots of history,  and the young lady working the bar was very pleasant and knowledgeable concerning the bar history.  Checked out the menu for future trips. We will definitely go back to try out the food.

Text: I really enjoyed the place. Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  I had fried shrimp and they were big and crunchy. The coleslaw was fresh and very flavorful.  I also had fries and could not finish my food because such big portion.  The bar is  beautiful with all the old wood work. Loved it Loved it?
