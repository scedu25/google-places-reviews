Buffet House

Text: This is an excellent buffet and well worth multiple visits. We enjoyed a lovely and inexpensive meal, lunch on Saturday was only $7.50! I had a piece of white fish with trimmings that would easily cost $15 elsewhere. By trimmings, I mean fried potatoes, onion rings, broccoli and a cottage cheese salad.   Is the food authentic Chinese? Nah, it is Americanized as is appropriate for Nebraska.  This is a buffet, and I enjoyed getting a teaspoon of a LOT of different tastes!  Enjoy the variety and pleasant flavors.

Text: Been coming here for 12 years. Sometimes they don't have all the food out but that's a given since they are usually busy when I go. The food is always good and I've only had a problem once but that's not the restaurants fault. They run a good business, but one waitress seems to always have a little bit of an attitude and doesn't seem to like to refill drinks and rushes us to leave. But that's just her all the other workers are fantastic, especially one guy he's kinda short, little chubby but he is the nicest guy ever. Always welcomes everyone and he never leaves a cup empty lol.

Text: The chicken was raw, the crab Rangoon was soupy, the egg drop soup was congealed. Found a spider in the sweet and sour sauce. Totally disgusting! And they still made me pay $29.00. Took off $10.00 and change for food we couldn't eat.

Text: Everything was delicious! Took my 4 year old out to lunch and he actually ate everything on his plate.  He is ussualy a very picky eater. Love the upgrade to the interior.
