Claudia Sanders Dinner House

Text: Very classy restaurant and the food is always at its best! I highly recommend this place. I have not had anything bad on the menu and I've been eating there for years. The wife of the Colonel Sanders, founder of KFC, started this business and it's definitely a fine dining restaurant but a little pricey just so you're aware.

Text: Beautiful place..quite large..a two story restaurant with plenty of parking and seating. I ordered the two piece all white meat, fried  (delicious chicken breasts). It was all you can eat, including all eight of the regular vegetables. A taste of each was all I could eat! It was all really delicious. I am certain it is full of calories..but worth it. My husband ordered the ribeye and really enjoyed it. It was tender, juicy and tasty. Not many people at 5pm on Thursday..but the salad and soup bar was kept fresh. I really enjoyed the chicken and dumplings and chicken salad. A nice fruit selection, too!

Text: Went for the buffet. This is fresh, home cooking. Husband loved the food and he is not a buffet guy. So many options!

Text: Wide selection of food from chicken to roast beef. Be aware their website is not clear about if they take reservations or not. Reservations taken for just large groups. We called and were put on hold for about 15 minutes to try for a reservation. No one ever came back on the line.
