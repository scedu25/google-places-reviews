Text: Great local spot. The wings are fantastic! The wings are sold by the pound and there are about 8 wings per pound (just FYI). Our server was attentive and friendly. Bar has some character to it. I'd definitely recommend checking it out.

Text: A great place to eat, casual and  not too expensive.  They are known for their tenderloins.  You can literally feed 4 people on one.  I had tenderloin sliders and they were delicious.  There were seven of us, including 2 young children.  We were seated promptly, and the service was great.

Text: I asked the bartender if I could have all wings for my order of chicken wings. she said sorry but we can't split orders. don't know if the man was owner or manager happened to be sitting at the bar eating his dinner. without fuss he says let me check, we may be able to do that. luck was with me as they had extra wings that day. small things can mean a lot and they have the coldest draft beer in town.
