Avalanche Pizza

Text: This was our first time eating here and the pizza was delicious. We live out of town however and were unaware this was a take out only restaurant. Thankfully it is a beautiful day so we just took it to the park and ate there. We wanted to order the ny pizza or 3 for deal and there was no way to order either of those online which makes no sense to me. We will likely order from here again due to the taste of the pizza, but there are some business aspects could use some tweaks perhaps.

Text: Not too big of a fan of Avalanche. The pizza is sub-par compared to other pizza places in the area. Pizza is okay, just not spectacular. The biggest disappointment was the Super 99 pizza. The pepperonis are so small, that it seemed like a regular pepperoni pizza. And the sauce is too sweet for my liking. However, the bread items that are at the Farmer's Market on East State Street are out of this world!! They are pretty great, I recommend trying the bread!

Text: Great Pizza. Try the Chorizo and Chips?. If you want a challenge I dare you to eat a large "Nudge" and then try to move after

Text: What is not to love about Avalanche? They make super fresh, extremely delicious pizzas from a huge list of local, organic ingredients in a variety of styles at an extremely reasonable price. I make sure that all of my out-of-town guests get to try it- and they are all consistently impressed! Avalanche has delivery or pickup, but there is not an eat-in area. They also have sides and calzones in addition to pizza! My top recommendation is the cheese bread. Their pizza is amazing, but the cheese bread is the best we've ever had. If you can splurge a little I'd also suggest getting their NY style pizza. Huge slices with fantastic flavor. Athens is lucky to have Avalanche Pizza!
