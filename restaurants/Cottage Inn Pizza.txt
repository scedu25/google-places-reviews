Cottage Inn Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Food has always been fantastic when delivered. This particular time we decided to pick up, and the customer service was outstanding. We had a large order so there was a little bit of a wait which is 100% to be expected. While waiting an employee offered us a couple two liters for the trouble. That was an example of going above and beyond. Very satisfied will absolutely recommend to anyone looking for good pizza in the area. Thank you!

Text: I used to love cottage inn. However, more than half the time they get the order wrong - in ways that are just poor quality control. I like their chicken Caesar salad. Once it came with no Parmesan. Once with no dressing. And once with NO chicken

Text: Their Pizza is always good here. The staff members are polite, and gracious. I come to this place all the time for their carry out deals. One of their Large Pizza's is a great lunch for me and a few co-workers.
