Text: Service is amazing and super friendly. Food was delicious. I've never been somewhere so authentic with real food. Totally inexpensive even though their quality and quantity is worth way more. Atmosphere is great. I'm make this a monthly date spot. I loved it.

Text: Just ordered the a medium stuffed pizza to go and when I got to my location (2 miles away) enough grease leaked thru the box that it actually pooled on my front seat. It was nothing more than a big conglomerate of oil and ooze. The box was actually disintegrating and almost lost the sludge pizza thru the bottom. I just tossed a $23 pie in the trash. Never again.

Text: I ordered the tortellini carbonara and it was very good. Even more impressive was the waitress who was very helpful, friendly, and despite not having anything special for birthdays decided to buy me a dessert out of her own pocket.
