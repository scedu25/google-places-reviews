Text: I have been going to Lemp Mansion for over 35 years. The Sunday family style dinner is wonderful. Best pan fried chicken ever. The German green beans are amazing and you can tell they use real potatoes for the mashed potatoes. The chocolate cake is to die for. The service is always great and the refills keep coming. I spend every birthday with the Lemps and plan to keep on doing so! Plus it is such a cool house with such an amazing history. Learn about the family, it's fascinating.

Text: We went for the Sunday fried chicken family style dinner. Chicken, ham, beef plus various sides. Was fine, but not my favorite type of food. In the past the food off the menu was terrific.

Text: I cannot say enough good things about the Lemp! We had our wedding reception outside under the white tent and it was absolutely beautiful. Patty Pointer was helpful throughout the entire wedding planning process and her staff was polite, fun, helpful and had a fantastic attitude. The bartender was awesome too. The staff set up all of our table decorations before the reception and they did a great job.
