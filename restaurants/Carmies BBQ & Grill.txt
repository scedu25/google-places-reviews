Text: A bit pricey like buffalo wild wings. My daughter & I had good service today from a nice young lady. She was prompt & attentive which I'm happy to finally experience at Carmies. The food was yummy as usual. I had decaf coffee, a starter of fried pickles w/horseradish based sauce, margarita flatbread, and a cup of French onion soup. Fried pickles were abundant & flavorful without being too salty. The sauce was a nice contrast. The flatbread could have benefited from the classic margarita topping - fresh basil- as it was on the blander side without it. All the toppings were fresh & good. Would have been over the top yummy with a balsamic reduction drizzle like I've had at other places! The soup was as yummy if a little heavy on the butter this time. But always my favorite there! I'd visit more than a few times a year if the prices were a bit lower. We always enjoy our visits though!!
