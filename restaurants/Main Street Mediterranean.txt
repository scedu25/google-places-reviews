Text: Family of 6 -- one of our favorite places to eat.  We order an appetizer sampler, a combination platter, and a vegetarian platter, plus a few kids' meals and a doner for the teenager.  Always fresh good food; always a friendly greeting from the proprietor.

Sometimes the small dining room is very busy, but this too may be soon resolved with a move to a new location?

Highly recommended by a local family with picky kids!

Text: Great food (: we always love the cleanser the put in your hands after you're finished! Great experience! It's also very quiet. Which either means it's a good place for a meeting or you feel slightly awkward

Text: This establishment recently moved, just around corner to where Google had it located. It is now called The Med. Amazing place. The owner served our meals, which were not overbearing at all. Just enough food, at a very reasonable price. I could not rant more about the homemade hummus. It was so creamy and delicious, and again, just enough.  We also had the cheese wraps, which were ok, but not as flakey as I would have hoped. Our meals were very good, and loved the tzatziki sauce it came with. The only problem was we didn't leave enough room for pistachio ice cream or baklava. There's always next time.
