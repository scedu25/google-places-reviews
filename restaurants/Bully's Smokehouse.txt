Text: Fantastic service. Mollee is one of the best servers I have dealt with in a very long time. 

Food lived up to the marks of others.  Put this place on your list to go to!

Text: Service was horrible. We sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a server come to take our order or anything. A server helped a table next to us that came in about 5 minutes before we left and ignored us. Hostess told me to have a great night as we left. She could see our table as we were in the front room. So disappointed.

Text: Great food and service. Everyone was friendly and efficient. Much better than when we were here a few months ago. New staff? Will be back.

Text: Was seated and then left alone for almost 10 minutes, no one even looked at us.  We walked out.

Text: We went here for a late lunch. We had half price appetizers (wings) and split a slab of ribs with sides. It was delicious and we have enough going home with us for another meal. Will definitely come here again.
