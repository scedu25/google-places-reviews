Text: Delicious food, especially the homemade pasta. The space is quaint and cozy and perfect for dates or group events alike. The portions were a little on the smaller side, so we rounded out the meal with espresso and homemade dessert, which was perfect. It might be preferable to get there before 6, otherwise, have a reservation. However, we did see plenty of walk-ins get seated as well, but if you want to secure a table, have a reservation.

Text: Friendly, helpful staff that made good recommendations from the menu. Creative variety of happy-hour small plates that were pretty solid and fun to share. House music was a little loud for comfortably conversing across the table, but I tend to prefer quieter restaurant environments.
