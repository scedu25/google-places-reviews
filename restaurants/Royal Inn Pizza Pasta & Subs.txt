Text: Good pizza and sanwiches. They have a buffet. There buffet has pizza, lettuce salad with other salads as well.  It comes with the taco bar, with hard or soft shell plus all of your fixins for a taco or even nachos if preferred.  Season fries, spaghetti,  and corn nuggets on buffet. They have  a regular menu too. They got a separate room for birthday party or other events.
