Text: The service and the food here is great. The Waitress was very polite and the food was cooked to order great. The atmosphere here is pleasant. Nice and clean place.... I had the hamburger steak with grilled onions and mash potatoes and gravy. Stop in if you get a chance...

Text: I have honestly eaten here countless times. After today's service, I knew I had to post a review. I ordered the bacon and two eggs with hash browns and toast for 5.49 with the additional request of extra crispy bacon and hash browns. Let me tell you, they certainly fulfilled my request! Kenneth does a fantastic job cooking and our waiter, Billy, was very attentive and delivered our meal very quickly. Certainly worth the 5 stars. I definitely recommend the Branding Iron II!

Text: The older waitress was loud and rude. She was angry when 4 tables walked in. She literally threw condiments at customers and complained she was on her own. We came in from Nebraska and wanted to try something new. Another waitress showed up and it really helped the swamped older waitress. As for the food, I got the Phillipsburger and it was AWESOME! BEST BURGER! My friend got a hot roast beef and she said it was great. Food was good, but service needed some tweaking. I am thinking they were short staffed.

Text: My husband and I were there ate breakfast. I think it was almost one of the worst meals I have eaten. The food was cold, that was after waiting a half hour or longer. Then people next to us got their food within minutes after we did. We had been there for a bit before they came in. I will NEVER go back.

Text: My sister's and I ate lunch there today. The food was very good. Speedy service. Waitress was checking on us every few minutes. We will definitely eat there again. Best experience we have had in our travels.
