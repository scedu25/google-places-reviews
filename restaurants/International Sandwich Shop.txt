Text: The lady who operations the phone is a total ass hole , she lied to me multiple times about timing for my food . She told me that the dilivery women got lost on the route to another customer . 20 minutes later I called back and the lady told me that the dilivery women was just leaving out to deliver my food . 30 minutes later I call again ( pretty pissed at this point) demanding a refund . To my surprise the phone was sent straight to voicemail. Now I call again 3 minutes later to and the lady operating the phone tells me that the delivery driver got lost on the way to my house. So she got lost twice ? Long story short I asked to speak to a manage and I was told he would call me two days later since he was on vacation , that call never came. This is the worst sandwich shop in the Midwest . I didn't pay 17 dollars for a sub to take two hours to deliver. To top things off I live in the eggers apartment complex which is located .7 miles away from the shop. I could've spent 30 minutes walking there and back  3 times in the time it took to get my sanwhich
