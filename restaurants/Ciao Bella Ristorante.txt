Text: Food was great! Much to my surprise. I didn't know what to expect from looking at the place from the outside but inside was pretty nice and the food and service made it even better.

Text: We had dinner there last night, specials were superb.  All the food items were perfectly prepared without being preciously presented.  The chefs are amazing.  The waitstaff, including our server Roxy, also completely charming, professional, attentive without hovering and never pushy, qualities that I as a former waiter from college days can totally appreciate.  And this was reflected in our tip.

Text: Ok food service was great, small portions. $7 for a salad with your meal I thought was a bit pricey.
