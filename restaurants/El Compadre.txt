Text: My friend and I went in for a drink, the waitress was generous with the chips and salsa although a little absent. They were playing pop music instead of something more appropriate for a Mexican place, but overall the atmosphere was good. Beautifully painted tables and chairs.

Text: The food is surprisingly good for a small town Mexican establishment. The prices are fairly reasonable. They have a large menu selection, and their dessert options are the most varied I've seen in a Mexican place - I always have to get the cheesecake chimichangas, even if I have to take it home to eat it.

Text: Service awful. Server was eating his food while we waited for ours and we needed refills and chips,  he wasn't worried about us. We will never be back.
