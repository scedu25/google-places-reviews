Text: I asked Pure Pit to cater for my wedding and they did not disappoint!!! We had their delicious pulled pork sandwiches, Cole slaw, baked beans and cheesy potatoes!! All of my guests kept talking about how amazing the food was and kept asking where it came from. It's a little drive off the interstate, as it is located on route 60 but it is SOO worth it!! Best pulled pork I've ever had and the sides are delicious too!!

Text: Traveled all over the U.S. and is by far the best bbq I've ever had. Everything is made with a special twist different from anything you have ever had before. And don't worry about flavor if your not a fan of BBQ sauce because the pulled pork, brisket, and turkey all have unique and amazing flavor without it. No fat what so ever in the pulled pork and just the minimum on the brisket. Is locally owned and operated great atmosphere. In my opinion this is a must stop for great food.
