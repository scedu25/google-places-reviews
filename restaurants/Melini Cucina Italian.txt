Text: I have been visiting this location for at least twelve years.  The menu is huge, the food excellent, and the portions large. The next time I head back east, I plan to stop yet again.

Text: Worst service i ever had, when i went up to pay for my meal i told my waiter had horrible his service was to me,  he threw my change at me, pointed to the award he recieved from voters, told him that meant nothing and his attitude would not get him very far!  He never refilled my water, he walked past me several times without stopping to ask if i needed anything.  He acted as if it was no big deal.  I usually leave $5-$10 tips, he got $3, i will be calling back to speak to manager or the owner!!
