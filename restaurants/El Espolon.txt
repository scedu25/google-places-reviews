Text: The food is always great and the staff is friendly. I would give them 5 stars but, I have had times where my takeout order was not correct or took almost an hour to get after being told it would take 20 minutes. I arrived around the 20 min mark and waited in the restaurant for at least another 30. I watched customers come in, be seated and then served before I got my take out order. Then, I get home only to find out I had a half cup of cheese dip...UGH!

Text: From a New Mexican, this food isn't Mexican food. Not spicy, not even a little bit. Service wasn't top notch either. Also the food came out in about 5 minutes, that tells me it's not fresh at all. Good price though.

Text: Took 2 hours to get food. Food was cold and over done. Some was way to salty tasting people went in after us possibly a hour after us and ate before us. We got other people cold food because the left because of the wait.  They said 5 minutes we waited a hour and 38 minutes. We do not plan to go back there any time soon. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND. We only gave it one star instead of zero because we had to.
