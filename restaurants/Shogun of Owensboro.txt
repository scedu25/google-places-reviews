Text: This place is wonderful, clean and friendly place to eat! Best hibachi show in town. Always consistant with flavors and food quantity. Sushi is on point and I do mean the raw real sushi the way it was intended to be eaten. It's perfect and quality of fish is super great and never disappoints. Staff is super friendly and happy! (BONUS POINTS HERE) Every dining experience is always better with a true smile and friendly disposition! I can say enough about this place and we will go back again and again with this type of food service. Love these Island folks! 
Cheers?

Text: Shogun has amazing Japanese food, from the salad to the hibachi! The atmosphere was very nice and the restaurant was clean....we received awesome service, with a smile. Portions are very large, but about right for the price. Expect to bring home a doggy bag. I would definitely eat here again!!

Text: This place was fabulous! Literally still in the parking lot and had to write the review before I left. They have half priced rolls on Mon-Thurs even during dinner hours. The sushi was so flavorful. I would highly reccomend.

Text: Hibachi was lovely. Server not so much. I enjoyed the food and service we received from the chef but the experience was limited because of the rushed server. I am a regular here at the establishment so I will be back!
