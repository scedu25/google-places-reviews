Text: Nice place, unexpectedly fast given the mass of people here for Irish Fest. Loved the chip selection and opted for some New Orleans Kettle style. Solid. I got the chicken salad. It was nice, but wish it would have had something exotic... a cranberry, slivered almonds, or even grapes... but it was just kind of plain. Prices were pretty standard for the area. 2 sandwiches, chips and drinks for just under $20.

Text: Fast service, friendly workers, and great food! My only point of criticism is that the wait was a little long

Text: Caseys pizza is better. They just melted the cheese on top of the ingredients the inside was cold and the crust was terrible.

Text: A far cry from Ny style cuisine. Pizza was extremely dry and my sandwich could have been made at subway.

Text: We were about to order our food when one of the guys stepped back from the food warmers, blew his nose (right over the sink), grabbed a couple of kitchen utensils and continued on to his work.. that's right, he never washed his hands... Absolutely unacceptable. We walked out with out ordering so couldn't tell you how the food taste and don't really care after that.
