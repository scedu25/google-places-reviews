Thai 9

Text: I had a great experience at Thai 9. The ambiance is great, and their is quite a lot of seating. They have patio seating and two floors inside as well as a sushi bar. We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and there was a 35 minute wait for a table but open seating at the sushi bar. Naturally, it was sushi bar for us! They are full service at the sushi bar and serve the full menu. So really it was like dinner with a show! 

He ordered one of the specials, pine nut chicken. It was good, but the chicken had more ginger flavor than I prefer. It came with a big side of white rice and lots of veggies. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, and it was LOADED with shrimp. So delicious! I can't help it, I'd love to order something new but I'm so in love with pad Thai. It had a great flavor and spice level 4 was perfect! 

Great Thai place in the Oregon District. I will return!

Text: Always great food there. Always would get Cashew Chicken excellent!
But tonight had Thai 9 fried rice. Really enjoyed it. You can get a heat factor from 0 to 9. I usually get a 3. Their food is top notch! Great place to take a date or celebrating a birthday, anniversary etc.

Text: Food was good, varied, and could easily be customized to individual preferences. Prices we're very reasonable. We created our own all-you-can-eat smorgasbord of new delights. The stand outs that we absolutely loved were the Thai iced tea,  shrimp in a blanket, pineapple fried rice,  and Singapore noodles. Yummy in our tummies! What really made this a 'place to go' though was our wonderful waiter Owen. He was attentive and very helpful with great recommendations. Every time we go here in the future, we'll definitely be asking for him. Thai 9 is just a great place. Even the bus boy was friendly and kind. The staff was truly exceptional! We can't wait to visit again.

Text: Unique building that was pretty unepexected when we walked up. It was too cold for the outside area but that looked nice. Our table ordered fish cakes which tasty and plenty of them, but smaller than expected, that didn't matter too much because there were so many but I tend to prefer them a little bigger. We also ordered red and green curry, both at a level 9. I wondered if that would be too hot, as it is listed as their highest level, but it was perfect for both of us. Hot of course, but delicious. I usually can't finish a whole bowl of curry; while I didn't finish all the rice I couldn't put the red curry down. Service was good and the bathroom was clean. Yum!

Text: This Thai fare restaurant is tucked away in the historical Oregon district. If you have the courage and desire for deliciously spicy good seafood , their chili paste will give you the heat without the salt or vinegar. The recipes are piping fresh & great quality for the price. Not all recipes spicy but large portions to share.
