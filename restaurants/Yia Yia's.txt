Yia Yia's

Text: A Lincoln go-to. Pizza by the slice in tons of flavor combinations, so there’s a little something for everyone. Love their vast beer selection, too both on tap and in bottles); I usually find something I’ve never tried before. 

It does get busy, so keep an ear out for your name over the loudspeaker when your slice is ready!

Text: had our rehearsal dinner here. They serve "gourmet" pizza which is unique, and done relatively well. occasionally your slices might be a little burnt around the edges, but it's tolerable. tons of different types of pizza to choose from. worth a visit every once in a while.

Text: Great pizza and awesome atmosphere. It has a great grunge/hipster vibe to it. The music on the radio is perfect for the environment.

Text: My wife are not originally from Nebraska so when we heard about Yia Yia's we were pretty excited to try it out.  I had the Local (basically a combination) and she had the Francais (blue cheese, walnut, mozzarella).  I enjoyed the atmosphere and for those of you who drink there is a very large assortment of beer.  For two slices of pizza we spend about $11 with tax.  I am giving this place 3 stars because for a Lincoln, Nebraska pizza establishment I'd rank it 4 stars but in comparison to every other pizza place I've been to it was average.  Great and interesting selection of toppings and the thin crust was a great choice but the taste just wasn't great.  I would come back to this place but I wouldn't tell anyone:  "you have to try Yia Yia's or you'd be missing out on great pizza!".  Overall, a great place to share a drink, conversation, and average pizza.

Text: Great food and lots of tasty beer from all over the US and Imports as well. The pizzas are unique and very good. Just had the Mediterranean and I would definitely recommend it. Whither your a Lincoln native or just visiting it's well worth stopping by.
