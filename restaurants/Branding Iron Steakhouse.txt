Text: Just kept getting worse....half full but not crowded. Slow to get service- then watched only cook there prepare one order at a time.  When our order came up 45 minutes later they realized they were out of chicken
strips...my wife had to re-order.  They assured me I could order a prime rib sandwich but fixed me a full dinner...prime rib 1/3 all fat....finally served after 90 minutes or longer.  Overpriced for service and quality....even with tiny discount given.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY
