Golden China Buffet
Rating: 1
Text: Charged nearly $8 for a child, when that isn't the advertised price. When she corrected it, we were still charged $3 more than our total should have been. She then handed my husband the ticket back and told him he needed to put a tip on the ticket. I had planned to hand her cash but changed my mind after all that. She looked over at the table looking for a tip, turned and was super nasty to us...then started speaking in Chinese to the others there. Food was good but rice and green beans were nearly raw.... but when you are overcharged repeatedly, enough is enough.

Text: Great little eat next to the liquor store. Hit and miss on if the food is fresh though. If you can catch the food while its hot and fresh its great, but when its not? Yikes. Good service though.

Text: It's getting over priced for chicken cooked 10 ways. A soda is almost 2 dollars and the buffet is 9.
The food is good along with the service

Text: Normally this restaurant is a good place to eat. I ordered coconut shrimp tonight for take out and I was so disappointed. The food was hot but the shrimp had little to no sauce on it and the rice was old and hard. I was excited to get home and have Chinese food for supper but instead I had to throw it out. It was a waste of money.
