Text: Food is excellent, usually not too busy. Staff is awesome! We had them cater or event and the servers they sent were the best! One server, Sydney, went above and beyond, helping with our event and food service to the extent that I did not have to worry about a thing, she had it handled!

Text: Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Best BBQ in town! It is hidden... to get to it, go to Target and then drive around to the backside of Target.  We have never been disappointed at this location!  Everything is good.  Don't let people convince you not to go here because they ate at some other Famous Dave's that was bad (which,  sadly,  many are not good)... THIS ONE IS GOOD!!!! Not just good, but amazing!

Text: Don't sit in the bar area unless you want to be ignored. Food was mediocre at best. The beans were not great. I'm used to Texas BBQ, so this was a let down. We got the feast for 2. It was a lot of food. The name is what brings you in, but the food will not make u stay.

Text: Good barbecue. Had St. Louis style  ribs and sausage. Had corn on the cob and coleslaw. Bread pudding for dessert. Good service.

Text: I would leave a zero if I could.  I went to famous daves alone tonight, and seat there for six minutes, no one comes to my table and asking for what drinks do i want, every waiter walk by my little table without looking at my gesture.  That’s just so rude!
