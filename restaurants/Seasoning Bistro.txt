Text: The Black Garlic Burger was hands down, the best burger I've had in a long time. Our experience was great - good, quick, attentive service; great food; and dessert to go. I recommend it for anyone - so good!

Text: Wow!  In town for a funeral and popped in for a sandwich!  Oh nay nay!  Ribeye was cooked to perfection with some sassy sauce. My pasta with broccoli and chicken rocked!  All the sides were fresh, veggies not overdone but perfect. Adrien our waitress a delight!  What an unexpected surprise!

Text: We were coming into town and wanted to sit at this restaurant but it was closing in 20 minutes (I know, rude) but we were greeted by a pleasant waitress who didn't seem to care about the time. We ordered our food and it came out quick! I had a burger and asparagus and my boyfriend had the shrimp, a side salad, with green beans and we had a stuffed portabello mushroom to share. Everything was fantastic! If we didn't live in Ohio, this would be one of my frequent restaurants!
