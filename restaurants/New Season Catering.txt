Text: Pierre and his team are the best. The food and service are magnificent. They cater to all our work events and everyone is always congratulating us on the food. Recently i called him within a day's notice to cater for a personal event at our home, and he did an outstanding job, all our guests loved it, even the salad! His mixture of french and Caribbean flavors are  exquisite!

Text: New Seasons is  a winner.  Dine in or catered, Pierrer has always proformed to a level that is excellent.  This weekend I attended a private couples bridal shower.  more than 30 people were in attendance.  1/3 of the group arrived 3 hours after the seated dinner party started.  Needless to say the others had eaten by the time the late arrivals showed up.  A hostess and caterer nightmare for most....not for New Seasons!  The food was delicious, hot and fresh for both seatings.  I highly recommend New Seasons!
