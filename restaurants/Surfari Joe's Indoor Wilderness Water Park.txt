Surfari Joe's Indoor Wilderness Water Park

Text: We had a great time! Perfect for our 4 and 5 year olds and convenient for us. The pool area and hotel were very clean. The room was very nice and comfortable.  Staff in both areas were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was delicious and the food was kept hot. Price was fair and you can get a discount signing up with rewards through Marriott.  We will definitely be returning for frequent overnight mini-vacations as we live only 2 hours away.

Text: This place was horrible. It was disgusting inside and the employee were rude and unhelpful. Additionally, they are extremely over priced. I would recommend saving yourself the trouble and never visiting.

Text: Great night of sleep! We stayed a Sunday and Monday night so the pool was empty which was great for my 4 year old. The pool was hot! Breakfast was top notch- waffles, omelettes, fresh cut fruit. It was definitely worth the money spent.

Text: It's a small getaway. Not a ton of things to do  but it's close to home and buy one get one helps. Nice to do while it's cold. Could use some expansion for older kids
