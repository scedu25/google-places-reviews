ZOEY'S PIZZERIA
Rating: 3
Text: It's a smallish restaurant in an old building in the downtown area of Marion.  The service was from a teen who said "perfect" a lot but she was quick and did a good job. The pizza we got was the vegetarian thin crust. The crust was thin and crispy which was very good.  We didn't care for the extreme amount of cheese and joked that maybe we should've ordered un-extra cheese but apparently this is how it's done at Zoey's.  It makes each bite very chewy and, well, cheesy.  Not a fan.

Text: Best za in Iowa.  Best garlic cheese bread you will ever have.  Service is amazing.  Oh, and if you're not in the mood for pizza they make amazing subs.  These guys kill it!

Text: Order the Chicago deep dish. You won't regret it. If you've ever eaten at Lou Malnati's in Chicago this is about as close as you can get. Excellent food and friendly service. Best pizza in Iowa.

Text: Great pizza, Chicago deep dish style, New York thin and crispy and their own style, New Zago, a deep dish crust in hand tossed thickness. 

Cheese garlic bread is great, almost a meal unto itself.

Dining area is limited, so expect waits for a table to open up during main mealtimes. Pizzas can take upwards of half an hour to cook, this is the sort of restaurant to go to when you are looking for good food, local flavor and have time to enjoy your meal and the company you bring.

Text: Nice small local place. I had a slice (hamburger topping with lots of cheese). Pizza is good, but I am from Chicago, and been to New York city lots, so I would say I have had better pizza. But this is quite good, and overall you won't be disappointed. It does need more seats and better order placement procedure, when it gets busy.
