Text: Delicious, brick oven pizza. They are priced well, clean, friendly, and accommodating.
I don't know where they get their ingredients, but they always taste fresh. They welcome individuals, families, and groups of all sizes, and do their best to accommodate if their tables aren't big enough. 

 My only complaint and this a very minor one is while it's great that everyone can have their choice of pizza , I'd like to see larger pizzas for families. But that's truly a minor complaint.
