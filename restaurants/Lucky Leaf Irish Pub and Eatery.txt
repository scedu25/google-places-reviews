Lucky Leaf Irish Pub and Eatery

Text: As with the previous establishment at this same site the management is seriously deficient.  Of the 6 times I have been there I found the food acceptable 3 times and not acceptable 3 times.    Today when the waitress asked me how my lunch was I told her that the fish was over done and the chips were over seasoned.  Her response was to ask if I wanted more soft drink.  No visit from the manager even though I was the only customer.

Text: The only decent thing on the menu are pretzel sticks and cheese, and they burn those often.

Text: Unfortunately, we decided to try this again. Food was ok. Service was subpar: took forever to get waited on, forever to get drinks (waitress said her computer was down, we watched bartender playing on her phone constantly, I guess I could have walked over and poured myself), finally got food, had to ask for napkins, ask for silverware. Husband's tall beer was in a short plastic container. Even paying took a while. Sorry, never have left a bad review in my life, but ugh, won't be back.

Text: My favorite food item at Lucky Leaf is the sunrise burger. I love how friendly the Restaurant was and was pleased by the service.
