Text: Not sure what all the complaints about prices are about, but I can't think of another Chinese restaurant where I've gotten more food for my money. I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole combo order from here, instead it usually becomes two meals for me. It's likely not going to be the best Chinese food you've ever had, but it's pretty dang good and the prices are very reasonable.

Text: Food is decent. Looks like a popular place. Egg rolls could use some thinning out as they tasted doughy. Overall i would try it again.

Text: Cool spot... I usually bring my lunch in to work,  but one day I didn't have time. I  came in and the place was very clean. The food was made to order, staff was polite, the price was affordable, and the food was good. Decent place to come in and eat if you want something affordable and quick. Definitely not Authentic Oriental cuisine, but you get what you pay for and the food is pretty good.
