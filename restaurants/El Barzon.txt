Text: I come from Long Beach and I decided to come to Detroit for the weekend to see my family and I end up coming here to try the food. I had better I can't complain the food here in Detroit isn't that good at all. When I order some food the tacos where a little cool and my mother ordered a chicken dinner she didn't like it. I heard that other cities in Michigan have better Italian food I may end up checking those out before I go back to California. The staffing needs to step there game up because it seems like they don't care about there customers.

Text: This was my first time going to this restaurant. And I tell you what, I was impressed. Very cozy place for dinner. The atmosphere was really nice., the service was very friendly and the food was very good. If you go, I recommend sitting on the patio. It's well worth it.

Text: Excellent food and a nice atmosphere.  They offer a unique menu of Mexican and Italian cuisine.   Note that it is not a fusion but separate menus, both of which are excellent. 

The neighborhood is a bit rough.  There is a parking lot and entrance behind the building -  be sure to look for the sign (you can see the sign as in the side of the building as you approach from Michigan Avenue).
