Text: A local guy told us this was a good place to get steak. We are glad we listened and had dinner there. From the outside, the restaurant looks plain. Step inside and there is a bar and dining rooms with old school steak house charm. The wait staff is professional. I ordered a file and lobster tail. My spouse got Kobe beef. Excellent meals with good wine.  My lobster tasted great but looked like it had trouble getting out of the shell. To my surprise, the waiter delivered an additional lobster to me gratis because the owner didn't think the first one was good looking. We couldn't believe it but enjoyed it. We will return any time we are near Columbia MO.

Text: Very good food and staff. For the type of establishment, the menu is very pricey. However, don't let the price scare you away because it's worth trying at least once. Never know, it may be a place that you may return over and over again.

Text: The service was great and the food was amazing!!  My wife and I went here for our wedding anniversary dinner and we weren't disappointed.  Louis, our waiter, was very personable and took care of all our needs.  The filet was among the best I've ever had.  The food is pricey, but for a special occasion, it is worth it!
