Text: I ate here with a large group and the waiter was exceptional. Often times with a larger party the pace of things such as the drinks, appetizers, food delivery and so on are staggered and it ends up taking forever, but not tonight. The service was exceptional and the dinner was top notch and our group was in and out in a very reasonable time.

Text: The server was very pleasant. Beautiful dining room. Bread was the best part of the meal however. My meal was okay but definitely not the best I've ever had. My wife's $50 steak was Meh-okay (her words). Her salad never made it to the table and our shared side dish was--basic.
