Text: Always a place to meet your neighbors and sit down for consistent quality with food and service.  I know Pizza Unlimited is a long time favorite for locals and returning visitors alike. Example of truly home-grown excellence in friendly service.

Text: Great pizza from a friendly staff.  Lots of small town, hometown charm. Salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes are served and a salad bar is available.  Reasonable prices.

Text: We've been riding our bikes for over 3 weeks from west to east coast. Had many pizzas along the way, and this is best yet. Super friendly and wonderful people. Took us in and made us feel completely at home.
