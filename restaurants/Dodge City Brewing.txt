Dodge City Brewing

Text: This brewery just opened the week we first visited. We returned four more times while in town. They really have a great thing started. Very solid beers that the only difficulty they are having is keeping enough to pour. The pizza oven is cranking out great pies with excellent flavors and perfect crust. They made room for a couple guest taps that they've made excellent decisions with. I expect that the beers they are crafting will only get better as they gain experience, and I hope to see a barrel aged program started by the time we return.

Text: First visit.  Already had dinner so didn't try the pizza but it looked and smelled great.  Beer was very good (especially the cream ale) !  Nice addition to the area.  Give it a shot.

Text: Pizza is really good and staff is helpful and friendly. BrewMaster took the time to talk to us about his processes and projects... Very cool. I enjoy the pizza but the beer is the real lure and brown ale is my fave. This is an oasis-a real treat for visitors and locals alike.
