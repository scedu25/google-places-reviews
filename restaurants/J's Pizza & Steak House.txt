J's Pizza & Steak House
Rating: 5
Text: Good food. Generally crowded during peak times - not a lot of seating unless they open the second or third rooms, which they rarely do for some reason. Cute decor. Prices are average for an eat in restaurant, so not a cheap place. Their pizzas are super cheesy, and they're very generous with toppings. Other meals are good too, especially the pasta combo plates.
