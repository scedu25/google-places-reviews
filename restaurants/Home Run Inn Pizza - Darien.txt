Text: Manager was great. However the buffet never had enough of food. Chef was not ready for the opening within a half an hour of opening we had to wait 20 minutes for food to be brought  out. Only 1 item at a time .No pizza really? At least pizza should have been coming out. We had a party of 10. Birthday party.  Like I said the woman manager agreed with me. Chef never was able to catch up. Make me your secret customer and I will improve that place. Good food when you  can get it out of the kitchen. I have over 30 years of management kitchen experience

Text: Friendly service and tasty food. Got the cheesy garlic bread and a large pepperoni pizza with garlic crust. Yum! Our waitress had a great personality and made sure to joke back and forth with us. I always have the frozen Homs Run Inn pizzas in my freezer, it’s nice having something fresh.

Text: The food is excellent. The service however was lacking. They had big parties scheduled and did not prepare enough pizza.
