Text: My wife was very happy with the thali. Not the best she's ever had, but very good. Great service. We enjoyed the food in time with their friends. Nice atmosphere.

Text: The Oven is one of my favorite places in Lincoln. The food is amazing and the service is always fast and friendly. I usually go here about once a month and never have had a bad experience. Not a place I would go every  week because it would break the budget but I would definitely recommend this as a great date night experience.

Text: Always good Indian food. Nice quiet atmosphere. Parking is an issue at the downtown location, but not at 70th street. Reasonable prices. Great variety.
