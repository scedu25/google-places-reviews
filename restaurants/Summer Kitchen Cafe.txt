Text: This is a great local family restaurant with a large menu. Can be a bit pricey though. I love the breakfasts and my girls love the Frappès. Service is friendly and attentive.

Text: Food is so good here! The bakery items are amazing and they have the absolute best cheesecake! (Even better than the Cheesecak Factory!)

Text: Consistent quality food and courteous staff. Excellent bakery items, paired with a Scooters Coffee location, and more kinds of potato casseroles than you could dream of!

Text: Nice friendly staff. Good menu if you like the old fashioned home style type food. Long waits to get in and long waits to be served because they are so busy. Good place if you have the time!
