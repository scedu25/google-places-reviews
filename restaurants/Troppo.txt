Text: The food was absolutely amazing I had the chicken marsala and my friend had brazed duck. We also had 2 soups both were top notch. This place is a little expensive but if your out to treat yourself I would highly recommend it.  Wonderful experience.

Text: “Excellent Food and Atmosphere!”
I have been to the establishment many times and have found it to be exceptional each and every time. The food is always cooked to perfection! They have incredible chefs who care about the quality of food they put out. If you join their club you can get a free $25 gift certificate on your birthday and each time you...

Text: The atmosphere is great with wonderful views.  The food was very subpart for the price.  My braised short rib was slathered in gravy and reminded me more of a piece of roast.  The roast carrots were barely cooked.  The presentation left much to be deserved for a "high end" restaurant.  My wife's scallops were cooked and seasoned great but the rest of the plate was below expectations.

Text: This one of just 2 or 3 top-quality restaurants in the area. The food is first-rate, and there is always something interesting on the menu. The seafood chowder is killer. Every time I have dinner here, I like it better and better.
