Durty Gurt's

Text: After researching some of the best restaurants in Galena, Durty Gurts, was at the top of my list. My husband and I love discovering great burger joints....and this is definitely among the best we’ve had.  I had the Blue Moon Burger. It was amazing. My husband saw Gumbo on the menu and had to try it.  He liked it better than the gumbo in NOLA.  Great place. We look forward to returning on our next visit to Galena.  Our waitress was very helpful in guiding us to some of the best shops in town.  Loved this place!

Text: Great place! Great atmosphere, and most importantly Great Burger! Everything was fresh, fair priced, and the seasoned fries blew me away. Burger was huge and satisfying. Service was excellent! Strongly recommend!

Text: My wife and I went in here for lunch mostly because the breakfast/lunch places were closed and the dinner places hadn't opened yet and we were very pleasantly surprised. I had a cup of New Orleans  Gumbo that was very good and contained andouille sausage. I coupled it with a decent shrimp po' boy and crispy sweet potato waffle fries. The shrimp were big and tender and seemed fresh. My wife had a pretty good Reuben. Service was friendly, helpful, and efficient.

Text: Durty Gurty's has a very unusual decor but it is funny. The specialty is burgers but they serve other sandwiches. The food is good and they have large portions.
