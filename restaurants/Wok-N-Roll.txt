Text: Very clean restrooms and well maintained building. It wasn't very packed and we were served soon after we entered. The waitresses were kind and happy to serve. After we ordered our food came quickly and was exactly what we expected. When we were done the manager came out to ask us if we enjoyed it. We would say it's a good place if you're looking for a good Thai

Text: We love this place! The food is spot on every time, lots of wonderful Thai food to choose from.  Try the soup and of course Pad Thai. Everything we've had has been wonderful

Text: Terrible service. Low quality food. Frozen egg roll was still cold in the middle. Bland. Was looking for authentic. Not here

Text: We love Wok and Roll! Super tasty. It is more expensive than some places but the quality of the ingredients and the preparation are well worth the splurge.

Text: Great food was afraid to try Thai food at the lake after trying Mexican and being so disappointed. But this place is great the food was very authentic  albeit a bit pricey, but I guess it is the lake and restaurants are a bit more because of the tourists. Will definitely come back lots.
