Fat Patties

Text: After dining at this restaurant on November 10th I was completely unsatisfied with the food. Although you get an abundance of a burger on a bun, the burgers had absolutely no flavor, no seasoning and was extremely dry! 
We had the lick creek burgers with fries. Absolutely horrible. Not to mention the fries overcooked. In addition to the taste of food the bill was extremely high. 
We could have bought 2 T- Bones from Kroger and enjoyed them vs eating this food with no taste...no flavor and shriveled up overcooked fries. Next time I want to go and eat a burger I think I will go to S& B's and the prices have this place beat.

Text: Went there one day, and it was a pretty good choice. I love the unique local restaurants in Carbondale, and if you do as well this is a good place. The food is phenomenal and staff were nice. The one and only problem was it is a little pricey, which is reasonable considering it's not a chain like McDonald's or Taco Bell. All over nice urban restaurant.

Text: Great sandwich, great fries and cool Little restaurant. The cashier and cook both seemed nice, I will definitely be coming back. Fat patties is a must to bring out of towners to.

Text: My all-time favorite here is the Lick Creek Beef burger!  The fries appear to be double-fried, making them crisp and delicious!  I love the adobo mayo as a fry dip!

Text: Had the Matty Plummer. It was awesome. Had a side of Cowboy Caviar washed down with a Blueberry brew. I'll definitely be back. If you've never been, do yourself a favor and stop by. You won't be disappointed. Something for everyone and all dietary needs.
