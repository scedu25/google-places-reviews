Text: Been coming to Eminence for over 20 years. Back in the days when Bucky was alive THIS was the place to be for dinner and drinks. Flash forward 20 years later... the menu choices shrunk, the salad bar shrunk, some advertised items were completely unavailable (on a weekday), and it took 45 minutes to get a sirloin steak and fries cooked. Asked for medium, got well done and fries were under-cooked (both of our orders), there was only 3 tables occupied during our visit. Our server was nice but that's about it. I will not return to Ozark Orchard. It's a shame, this used to be a VERY good place. Hope managment reads this, for the sake of a long standing successful business that deserves better.

Text: Great restaurant!  Their food was absolutely delicious and great service!  We were having a meal with my cousin who lives a little bit away from Eminence and they were so kind in letting us stay til they closed so we could catch up.

Text: Been here twice.  Both times the food was fantastic.  The servers are friendly and helpful with tips about the area attractions.  Sitting on the balcony is a real treat on a warm summer evening.

Text: Enjoyed the food, had a great time. They sometimes have locally caught fish or other locally caught or hunted our farm raised food :-)
