Text: The food was great, but very slow service and it was a slow Monday night. We would go again to give them another chance. There is a handicap bathroom, but it is outside the restaurant in the hallway near the elevator. It has a door with no sign on it. There is open floor space which is easy to navigate with a wheelchair, and lower tables for ease of sitting. We enjoyed the view of the expressway, and the quiet atmosphere.

Text: Excellent food. Service exceptional since there were 4 more than we knew were coming. However, there was another party behind a curtain ...Very noisy while we had a speaker for our meeting!
