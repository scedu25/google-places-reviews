Miscues Sports Bar & Grille
Rating: 2
Text: Acceptable. However there is no air conditioning, it is very loud, and if you're at a table refills can be slow even though it is never busy.

Text: Fairly decent priced beers on tap and tons of pool tables.  One of my favorite bars here in town to just sit down and enjoy a beer or two.

Text: Definitely the best burgers in town. The rest of the menu is good, with huge portions, and if pool is your thing they open the tables up a couple weeknights a week to play for free.
