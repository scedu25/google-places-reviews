Text: This used to be BY FAR my favorite restaurant in town until they switched management. I have been going here for nearly 20 years and recently have been very disappointed. Rarely do they completely get my order correct, the portions are WAY less than they used to be, and over all it just isn't as good as it used to be. Also it takes a lot longer to get your food now. Sadly, I think I will be looking for a new Chinese restaurant in chambana to start frequenting.

Text: On average the food is pretty good and service is always fast.  I've never seen them extremely busy.  The best meal I've had is their Angel hair special. Not a huge fan of their fried rice, but it isn't bad.
