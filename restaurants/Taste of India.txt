Taste of India

Text: You can't go wrong with the Taste of India. It's a culture experience along with a great dining experience with attentive servers. Food is excellent if you like Indian food. I usually get the chicken Korma or shrimp curry and neither disappoints . The bread is out of this world. It's an extra cost but well worth it.

Text: Consistently good food and stable buffet offerings.  Good services.  Don't like that they charge a 10% fee for paying by credit card.
