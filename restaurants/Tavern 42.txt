Text: I really want to support this local place, but it's so bad every time. Been hoping they would change for 2 years. Hamburgers are dry. Quesadillas are just cheese and a few pieces of tough chicken. No spices or much flavor on anything. Things that are on the menu are never available when we try to order. Dishes are sloppily served.  Won't be ordering from here again.

Text: Very nice!   Customer service was awesome.  My husband had the French Dip, I had a quesadilla.  There is a large patio I am sure we will use in the summer.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We will definitely go again!

Text: Ribs off the charts good! Prime rib cooked perfectly medium rare. French dip was fabulous. Service was great, chefs making rounds at tables talking to customers about the quality of good. Very impressive, we will definitely be back!  Highly recommend.
