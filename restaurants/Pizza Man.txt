Pizza Man
Rating: 4
Text: Stepping into Pizza Man is like stepping back in time - it's changed owners several times over the years but the pizza remains as I remember from being a kid: thin cracker crust, slightly sweet tomato based sauce, lots of cheese. Of all of the different types of pizza in the world, this one is still my benchmark.
