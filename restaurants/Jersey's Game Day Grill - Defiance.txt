Text: My first visit and I enjoyed it. The price seemed a little high until I got my food. I felt it was a good deal. Nice place to eat and watch a game.

Text: This place has friendly staff, food is soo good and they are local. I love coming here to get their burgers and pizza's. I've been coming here a few years now when I go through Defiance to shop at their stores. Prices are reasonable and you get more then what you pay for. This place is family friendly  and has many options on the menu to chose from.

Text: Brittany was excellent,she took care of me and my coworkers on 8/8/17. Food was ok but service at the bar was excellent. The juicy Jersey could've been cooked all the way through. Visited on 8/15/17 with a coworker,shared the deluxe pizza and immediately got the runs after we left. Glad I'm leaving this city.
