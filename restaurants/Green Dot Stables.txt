Text: Great atmosphere, but felt very rushed to get in and get out.  The wait staff were constantly checking to see if they could remove items from your table until there was nothing left and started to clean it while still seated.  That is just rude! Ask me if I want another beer but don't ask if I'm done eating that while trying to take the plate!  A subtle way to push you along...  I had 3 sliders, fries, mac and cheese.  That was plenty even though we were pushed to order 5 or 6 of them.  The truffle fries were the best I have ever had.  The catfish was OK, and the tofu was over cooked but was very tasty.  Son in-law had the "Mystery Meat - Ox Tail" was a huge surprise.  He loved it.  The peanut butter fluffer was fabulous.  I would try this again for sure and looking forward to it.

Text: Really enjoy going here! The sliders and fries are awesome. They also have a tasty wedge salad. This place gets absolutely packed whenever there's a sporting event going on downtown so don't be surprised if you have to wait ~45-60 mins to be seated. They also have a special "mystery meat" slider which they change up frequently. Overall, fun atmosphere, great food. Would recommend if you're in the area.

Text: If your looking for delicious sliders this is the place.  These aren't your greasy spoon diner style sliders, these are creative and sometimes exotic (duck, llama, who knows what the mystery meat will be). The sides are outstanding and you can wash it all down with a tasty cocktail or beer.

Text: I had a great time; the food and drinks were cheap, a good variety, and tasty. The truffle oil fries and apple pie moonshine took me by surprise with how good they were. I was disappointed with the Moscow mule since that's my go to mixed drink, the ginger beer was too overpowering. I loved the service, they have a great staff.
