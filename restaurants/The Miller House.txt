Text: I've been here many times, a lot of those times while entertaining customers. I personally have never had a bad meal here. My meals have always been excellent. It's a little pricey but worth it in my book.

Text: Wow, what a selection of bourbon. From the outside the place is quiet and low key, but downstairs resides one of the widest selection of bourbons in KY, maybe US (jack rose?). By chance I met the owner, Larry, who was very kind and welcoming.  A great place to get a Weller 12 yr and a great fried chicken salad to boot!

Text: Love the atmosphere, especially in the bar (basement) but the lighting could be better. I love that the menu changes seasonally so there is always something new to try. They have one of the largest bars in the area. Only downside is parking.

Text: Upon entering the restaurant the hosts asked if we had reservations. Since this was our first time and it was thrown together at the last min with another couple from out of town. We said no. At first there was a little hesitation but they looked through the books and made accommodations for a table of four and high chair. Service was spot on and friendly. Drinks stayed full during the whole service. Food was great. And reasonably priced.
