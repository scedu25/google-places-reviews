Text: My wife and I are fair people.  We have been here 5 times to try and give them a chance to wow us or at least get the order correct. Each time the service is good most times. Their downfall is they must not invest in skilled chefs.   My steak was always cooked well done each time when ordered medium.  And when sending back everyone including the manger seemed annoyed.  The manager put my recooked steak on the floor in a doggy bag said here ya go and walked away. They did refund our meal but that's not what I wanted. I wanted good food to order at those prices. Also the wine is over priced.  They carry screw tops.  Not indicative of a high end restaurant either.  Take some lessons from chop House in Chicago or capitol grille in Indy.

Text: This was the second time we've been there. Its good food. We love the darker lighting as it just seems to be more relaxing and even more romantic.
