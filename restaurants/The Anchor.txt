Text: The waiting staff is very polite and quick, the food is top of the line and quick after you order. I didn't even have to wait 5 minutes after ordering one of their larger burgers and had my food. And the crowd of people, other customers, super friendly. I am definitely coming back to eat here again and I recommend this for anyone looking for a good eat and groups.

Text: Good service but they never checked back to find out my eggs that I ordered over medium were fried so hard the whites were brown. Biscuit was dry, they must have ran out of gravy. The sausage was phenomenal but a screaming kid kept me from enjoying it. I had to leave my food and doubt I'll return.

Text: Delicious food, unique atmosphere and a great beer selection for us beer snobs. One of the few places I can find a Rochefort 10. It gets a bit noisy with the larger crowds but the food is well worth it. A must visit if you are a local or just passing through Wichita. ?
