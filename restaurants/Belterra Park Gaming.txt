Text: This casino is smaller than the Jack casino. It has a patio for smokers, with slot machines, so you can smoke while you play. While we were there, live music was up on stage behind the bar. That was pretty cool. The restaurant has a limited menu for service at late night hours. The food was good and the service was nice and fast. My group had a good time.

Text: Beautiful decor. The amenities are outstanding and award winning! MyChoice rewards are amazing. Free buffet, which is luxury at its best. And $5 free play . I truly enjoyed the experience, and plan to return in the near future. Thank you Belterra Park.

Text: Tightest slots ever! Spent thousands there and cant even get a flyer in the mail from them letting me know what is going on and when. Funny thing that Belterra in Indiana now sends me coupons for free dinners and concerts now and I dont even visit there. Seems as though management black balled me for the bad review. On November 11, 2017 went back and heard a guy there airing the same complaint to staff. Be careful what you say on this site or you will be next. I refused to use my players card today and actually won money!

Text: I'm not a seasoned gambler, but I had a great time. Placed some bets, watched the horses run and had a well above average meal. One terrific day.

Text: Had a great lunch, walked through the entire facility, then played slots for a couple hours. Very impressed! Everything was clean and employees friendly and accommodating. Going again very soon!
