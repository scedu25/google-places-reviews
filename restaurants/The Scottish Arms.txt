Text: I tried fried haggis...and LOVED it! Went for a friend's birthday specifically for haggis and scotch eggs. We got the Highland Gathering to share which has a variety of things to try (all worth getting on their own as well!) For dinner, I ordered the root and holler lamb burger with seasoned fries. Delicious and enough for lunch the next day. There are several other items on the menu we will be going back to try!

Text: It's worth noting how excellent the service is here; the weekend brunch servers are awesome people! The menu has some great traditional British entreés that are well-prepared with generous portions. The endless mimosas are a great value. The dining atmosphere is very elegant, yet there's still a lively bar scene within the restaurant. Overall, I'm very impressed by this place and I'd highly recommend it!

Text: Really enjoyed this place. Service was incredibly friendly and useful. Beer and cocktail selection was spot on. The Highland Gathering sampler was fantastic and as filling as a meal for one person.

Text: Here for dinner. The Highland Gathering and the blood orange wings are incredible!! The bartender Thomas and waitress Judy were super friendly and very attentive to us. Also, they have a great beer and cocktail selection. Would definitely return here!

Text: I have been here for brunch and dinner both times the food was exceptional as was the service.  Though the wine list was small the great selection still made it hard to choose, plus they always have local and unique drafts.
