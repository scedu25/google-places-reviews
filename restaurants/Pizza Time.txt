Pizza Time

Text: We ordered delivery it took over an hour to get the pizza it look like it had been sitting for over an hour the crust was hard and tastes like cardboard it was absolutely the worst pizza I've ever had not to mention the price is way too  high for its  quality and they forgot my breadsticks. Definitely will never return

Text: We eat here about ever other Sunday and on Saturday today. I would give five stars, but they never seem to have enough help for the amount of people they serve. An hour and a half for salad and pizza is rediculous.
