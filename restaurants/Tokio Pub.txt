Text: Modern fusion of Asian cuisine and some Asian flare on some non asian dishes.  All in all not bad, the happy hour special is very generous half off items in red on menu. Some of the dishes can be salty due to the combination of flavors, so if you have an issue with high sodium make sure to ask the server which dishes are better for lower sodium.

Text: so the flavors were good, but everything you order is extremely salty. the ramen soup, the fried chicken and the fries were over the top salty. i paid $14 for an ENTREE that came with 3 tiny fried chicken pieces and the side was MINDED cucumbers in the smallest bowl possible. i'm not even over exaggerating on how small the portions are here. you can even look up the sizes on google images. the sushi pieces are tinier than bite size. so so salty ?
