Text: Tried the Avocado green curry in my first visit here. Rich in flavors, aroma and addition of avocado compliments the green curry really well. Do try the Thai coconut cup custard if opting for dessert. It is served in 3 cups just for 5!..Mildly sweet with a creamy texture of coconut layer on the top aptly sums up the entire experience of dining at this restaurant. The portions were good for the price.
Service was fast. Will definitely visit again to try more food..

Text: Multiple people ordered from my company. Delivery. It took 2hrs for them to get here, which is fine to wait for good food but..... it was not good food. 3 peoples orders were wrong. I ordered a sushi roll and I am wondering why I paid $15 for this. It looks like gas station food and is wet, dripping. Second time ordering and I wont ever order from them or suggest them again.

Text: This is the most awesome place i love to eat food at.... all the appetizers and the curry dishes are yummy not to forget the pineapple fried rice. They satisfy us with both the quantity and the quality. The best place for vegetarians with lots of veg options. Fortune cookies here are to die for... visited it lot of times and never been disappointed.
