Text: Really happy with out visit. We were crossing the state and decided to stop in Manhattan for a quick breakfast. The food was homemade, fresh, and delicious. It's a cozy little cafe with a nice atmosphere and great service. Plus our server was cute af. Overall, 5 star experience. Definitely recommend for lunch or breakfast

Text: My favorite breakfast joint. Be warned, there's always a line. So if you don't want to wait, come alone or come very early. But that's a good sign that they're always busy, right? Totally worth the wait, IMO. Good service and great food, daily specials, and you can grab a beer or Irish coffee, if that's your thing.

Text: It was SUPER busy when our party of 6 went here for breakfast but the wait was completely worth it! This is a family friendly place that also serves a lot of different types of boozy morning drinks! The staff was very nice and attentive and it was an all around great place to eat for our first time in Manhattan, Kansas! We will definitely come back again!

Text: We love The Chef! They have a unique spin on breakfast but also have the classic breakfast items you want. Be prepared to wait on the weekends for a table but just give yourself time and be patient; it's worth it!

Text: I was not impressed with what seemed like a pre made egg for my omelet......was dry and not very good. But my friends biscuits and gravy was good. Everyone says I tried the wrong thing. Sorry, a breakfast place should make a killer omelet.....my opinion.
