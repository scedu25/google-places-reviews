Pasta Fare

Text: This is the Center for Autism BUT they cater parties and/or you can call the day ahead of a family style or single serve take-out.  I enjoyed a catered meal of spaghetti, salad with all the trimmings and the pasta was the best.  I have not enjoyed a single serve take-out.  It IS at 5900 N Illinois.  Call the phone, press ZERO for information and ask to be connected to the food department.  Therefore, apparently this is not a dine-in restaurant.

Text: The advertised number sends me to IL center for autism.  Not pasta.   I can't find this place or a valid number to give them a try.

Text: My Granddaughter and I stopped there to try it, should have known by the lack of customers that this was not the place to go. Service was great and the people very friendly and the resturant was very clean. The Problem was the food ,it was awful we ate a couple bites of each thing on our plates and payed and left,so if you just want to make a donation of twenty dollars for two lunches ,by all means go there,but I would not suggest you eat the food.
