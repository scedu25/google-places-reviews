Text: The rooftop is a great place to hang out with friends, and have a drink.  It's a great after work destination.  I stopped on a Thursday with some coworkers, and it was busy, but not crowded.  Our waitress was right there when you needed something.  I was told that they also do trivia nights on wednesday.

Text: Service was lousy. Waitresses argued who was going to take table, once she got our order she never returned to our table. Someone else brought out our order. She didn't check on us, didn't full drinks, we had to go to the bar and pay. Will never return to this location.
