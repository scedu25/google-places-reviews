Text: Best lunch spot in town. Local fare, excellent customer service, simple menu, fresh bread, and sweet treats. Thursday night is pizza night, call ahead to order. They also have good breakfasts, but I'm usually there for lunch. Show up a little before noon if you want to get a seat.

Text: Britney was exceptionally helpful. Food was stellar for a very reasonable price. Decor is well put together and sorta hipster-y (plates aren't matching, rugged wooden furniture, etc.) Great place! If there's ever another eclipse here, we'll be back!

Text: Delicious home-cooked meals. The menu is different everyday and I actually really love that. I don't grow tired of the same meal. Their meals are always very filling as well. They include a variety everyday, serving lighter fair to the down-right hearty meal. Everything they serve and sell is made in Nebraska. They have fresh bread and baked goods every morning, too. The cheesy garlic loafs are to die for, would recommend. They also sell some small business products such as Pacha Soaps which is made right in Hastings. The atmosphere is so inviting and warm in the restaurant. For the nice days they do have seating out front as well which is wonderful. All servers I've had here are very friendly and have a smile even when it's crazy busy. If you only have a half hour lunch I wouldn't suggest here as stated before they make everything fresh to order, so you may be pushing it with a short lunch. Very laid back atmosphere. I do suggest this place to friends all the time.

Text: The staff is friendly and helpful. They are mainly a dessert shop but also sell various breads, lunches and pizza on Thursday evenings. I've been going in for over a year and everything I've eaten has been great. Even their plain white bread is a special treat and delicious.
