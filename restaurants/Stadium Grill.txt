Text: We were here for a few days and some local people recommended Stadium Grill.  We had a Chicken Caesar Salad and Blackened Catfish.  The food and service was very good.  Catfish was as mild as I have had and perfectly cooked.

Text: I am driving for the second time MN to TN and this time made a point to come back. Huge portions, excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, relaxed but good service (you're in the countryside, so yes - chill out!). Highly recommend.

Text: Great place, with great food. I came here thrice while out of town for work. Shelby rocks behind the bar, there was a certain manager that berated a few employees in front of patrons. Huge no-no in my eyes. Might have just been a bad day, do not let that make you pass this place up.
