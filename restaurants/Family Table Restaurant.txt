Text: Waitress was great! They wouldn't substitute Turkey for an omlet. Opted for a hot beef instead. Not bad. No WiFi

Text: The Family Table is a great American diner. The servers are friendly and incredibly attentive! I had steak and eggs. The steak was not a great cut of meat, but was cooked and seasoned well. The hash browns were the best I've ever had! The cook mistakenly fried rather then scrambling my eggs, but overall, this is a great place serving up wholesome American fare!
