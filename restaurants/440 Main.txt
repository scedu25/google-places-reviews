440 Main

Text: Up scale dining at it's best. A bit pricey, but considering what you're getting and how well it's presented, not so much. One could easily forget you're still in Bowling Green. With the formal setting, ambient lighting and surf and turf items on the main menu, one could just as well be in a much larger city-New York, New Orleans or Atlanta. There is also a bar menu available upon request for those with a less than grand appetite. I must add how impressed I was with the decor. It seemed timeless. Were it not for the paintings on the walls, one could have easily been sitting in the same spot many decades ago. Eventhough space was a bit limited in this location, the designer certainly did an excellent job with what they have. It has a cosy, not crowded atmosphere. Over all, a very pleasant dining experience.

Text: Best meal I have had in a while.  Good menu, great beer and wine selection.  Tuna appetizer was good.  I had the red snapper that was an off menu special.  It was cooked perfectly and the jalapeno grits were awesome.  Will definitely keep this place in mind if I come back.

Text: Our food was perfect and our service was above average.  We aren't local, but would go back if we were around.  The idea of a low key bar paired with a nicer sit down atmosphere is interesting.  I wouldn't say being in 440 fooled me into thinking it was high end, but the concept is unique and works.
