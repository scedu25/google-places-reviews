BRAVO Cucina Italiana
Rating: 2
Text: Went here for dinner when my mother and mother in law were visiting. We are all born and raised in NYC so we KNOW what authentic, good Italian food, not to mention we're all 100% Italian and we weren't that impressed with the food. I got the pasta woozy and the chicken tasted fake and the spinach was hard and chewy. The sauce wasn't terrible. My husband got the chicken Parmesan and it was ok. The lasagna was dry, not enough sauce. The peach Bellini was pretty good and the atmosphere was nice. The manager was rude yet the server was wonderful. The prices are not equal to the quality. For what they charge, we were expecting real Italian food, not Stouffer's.

Text: Prompt and friendly service,  good food in large portions,  nice decor, comfortable outdoor seating.  Dined with elderly parents who know exactly how they like things, a boyfriend with a dairy allergy who kept getting calls from work while trying to order, and 2 kids, and everyone ended up satisfied. Also no waitstaff died or resigned. A miracle.

Text: Poor food quality. Ambiance was nice, if you're lucky enough to sit away from the kitchen. Limited menu. Staff was sub-par.
