Text: I'm probably one of the few people that goes to a burger joint for fish and chips but they rock here! The garlic fries are yummy and they do fish well. It's a little unconventional but you should try it.

Text: I absolutely love their half pound Angus burger. Cooked perfect every time. Consistency at a restaurant is very important to me and that's what you get at Red Robin.The fries are amazing. I only wish they would bring more fries the first time, but there endless so it makes up for it. The staff is super friendly. If you go by yourself I recommend sitting at the bar. The guy who work's there checks on you frequently. They are however a little pricey but so worth it. You do get what you pay for.

Text: Tim is the best server I've had. Even my son said he was the best!  He kept our drinks filled and offered more fries. He was friendly and attentive. He had several tables but made us all feel like we were his only table.

Text: Although the food was tasty it was not prepared as ordered. The wait staff is the worst... We set almost 10 minutes before getting my server, bottomless fries nor refills on the drinks were offered.
