Text: The pizza is decent, but the real reason I come here is for the breadsticks. Nobody else makes them like Angelo's! Deep fried, sprinkled with garlic parmesan cheese, delicious! The baked version is pretty good too. They have good salads and hot ham and cheese sandwiches too, and the price is great!

Text: Gotta love getting your boneless wings home to them being labeled barbecue, but they are Buffalo.  Asked for Ranch for the wings and got bleu cheese.   Even got a bonus hair in the pizza.  0/10 would not suggest.

Text: One of the few places to still make their crust from scratch.  They did not skimp on the cheese or the toppings, it was all so fresh. Great prices for all sizes, for the picky eaters in your group they have plenty of other options.
