The Amazing Pizza Machine

Text: Great place to bring the kids for a good time and to tire them out!  The pizza however is terrible, definitely get the buffet.  The buffet is actually pretty good.  The overall experience can get to be a little pricey though.

Text: We loved this place. We visit Omaha a couple times a year and this will now be a definite must for each trip. This place was like going back in time  to my childhood  when old-fashioned family fun and customer service was a priority. 
#1. Prices are not bad especially considering you can get unlimited gluten free options. Thank you for not upcharging for gluten free.
#2. Nice staff 
#3. Clean
#4. Decent food especially for a buffet with a huge selection!
#5. Fun themed rooms to eat in for the kids
#6. Huge arcade! Prices not bad at all.
We were so pleasantly surprised that a place like this still exists for kids in 2017. We hope to visit more often! :)

Text: Had an  awesome time. Went at 4:00 pm on a Friday afternoon and stayed till 10:00 pm . The unlimited ride card is the way to go. Food was good and the place was pretty clean. ( just a few dirty tables). A better deal on games would be awesome and a phone charging station or available outlets.

Text: It's not cheap but it is lots of fun for kids and adults. The food isn't amazing but it's a lot better than what I've had at other similar places and they do have a good selection. There are lots of different games and a few fun rides.
