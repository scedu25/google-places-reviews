Text: Great middle eastern restaurant.  My only complaint was that the service was moderately slow.  It took over 10 minutes to get our order.  It was a busy lunch rush but I'm not sure even if it wasn't slammed it would come out faster.  But the food was delicious and worth the wait.

Text: Best pita I have ever eaten. Chicken shawarma and beef kifta is my go to orders. I but plates so there is leftovers to bring home. I haven't had a bad meal at any of the after Naf locations. Go enjoy. Only beef is the chairs screech in the floor and makes a nails on a chalkboard sound. Every food item I have tried has been good enough to revisit to eat again.

Text: This is a really nice place. I had the veggie feast which was enough for 2 people. Then the falafal with pita bread is also really good. I am vegetarian but, my friends had the pita with chicken breast kabab and the kabab was really fresh and very tasty. There is huge rush on weekends but, still the wait time is not that big. Overall it is a nice place.

Text: Fast service!
I ordered Falafel on plate with Israeli salad. Falafels were really good. 
The plate comes with 2 giant freshly prepared warm pita breads - in short a lot of food.
