Text: Absolutely perfect. When you walk in the door you see a beautifully designed interior. The Waiting staff made you feel like you were the only customer in the room and they didn't miss anything and this was during a very busy time of the day. And as for the food. It was the icing on the cake. The salad and other vegetables tasted as if they were picked from the garden that day and the selections of meat tasted out of this world. And always make sure that you order the onion rings at the start of your meal they are the best. I live an hour away from this restaurant and it was well worth the drive.

Text: Awesome restaurant with an old saloon atmosphere. Service second to none. Had Prime Rib, Rib Eye Steak and Batter Lobster Tail. They are well known forvtheir Onion Rings which were fantastic. I highly recommend this place if your in the Macon, Missouri area.

Text: I wish they were closer to our home! 

The owner was our host and was extremly friendly and went out of his way for us.  Our waitress obviously loves what she does and was very friendly as well.  

Try the onion rings, there is a reason that they are popular. Use the house dressing with your salad.  My wife and I ate the prime rib special and we're both blown away. It melted in our mouths.

$40 for two prime rib dinner? Are you kidding me?  WOW, what a deal.  That's with an appetizer and dessert.  

We will be back!

Text: Food is high quality & very well prepared. Same for service.   What should be when you dine out.  I do not dine out frequently but this is high on my list when I do.  Coffee bar great too.
