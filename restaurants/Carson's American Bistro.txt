Carson's American Bistro

Text: I always order the prime rib. My daughter in law ordered the pot roast and it was wonderful too. The salads are large and very fresh ..even the side salad is large. They bring bread and it is delicious. The srunjs are innovative and delicious. Brunch is great, and they have chicken and waffles as well as other choices; order off the menu, and bottomless mimosas. We went for dinner on my birthday. They gave us a big discount and brought me a piece of the best cheesecake I ever had.

Text: It is above average for Traditional American Bistro.  Calamari was good and the dessert was great.  The fish and chips was a bit off because it was a bit soggy.  Perhaps the friers were out that night because the previous visits were all fine.

Text: The food quality was decent to pretty good. If you choose to eat here I hope you like blue cheese because it is incorporated into most dishes (even the cole slaw). I went with a large group of 10 and the majority of the party enjoyed their food. The biggest problem was with the service. The waiter started out friendly and then became very cold during our meal. When the check came he put everything on one bill and then avoided us. I had to flag him down and ask for the bill to be split. When I got my bill I was shocked to see that two "rum and cokes" (with Barcadi) cost over $21.00. Two drinks cost me more than my meal. To review: good place to eat, but get drinks some where else.

Text: Our server Kraig was amazing! Very polite,  knows exactly when to come to the table,  has a pleasant voice (you can tell he is sincere) and very knowledgeable about the company and the menu. 

The food was better than I expected.  We ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the lobster/shrimp appetizer which is a must try!

I highly recommend this spot!
