Text: Small town local restaurant. Service is nice. Cesar salad was good but excessive dressing was added. Breasted chicken was undercooked and flavor was bland. But skin was nicely crispy.

Text: The broasted chicken is quite good. For dessert I had peanut butter cream pie but it's not the tall cream pie you might expect. It's more compact but still very tasty not too sweet. The chef even put some garlic into my mashed potatoes even though that was not on the menu. Overall a very good experience.
