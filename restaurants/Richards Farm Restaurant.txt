Text: Beautiful scenery and hostess made a point to seat us privately, which was very nice. Lovely decorations and ambiance inside, very neat to look around and explore. The food was good but not excellent; I had the ribeye and my husband had the pork chop.

Text: The lunch buffet was delicious with a nice variety of items. It includes hot buffet, salad bar, soup, fresh baked bread and dessert. A little pricey at $13.99 + $2.59 for drink and with 3.00 tip you're at $20.00 for lunch.

Text: Slightly obscure location but worth the effort.  Quite possibly the best buffet I have ever enjoyed in both quality and variety.  Recently another dining room was added  to accomidate increasing patrons. This place is not just a restaurant,  but also a unique experience.

Text: Had a late lunch early dinner today.  Too late for the buffet so we ordered off the menu.  Salad bar was excellent!  Very fresh and lots of toppings.  Homemade bread was great!  Food was not so great.  Took quite some time to get it.  My husband had a chicken and mushroom dinner entree that was $18.  When they brought the plate out we were shocked at the serving size.  It was like a lunch portion.  It was really small for the price.  I had a pork loin barbecue lunch plate.  Size was good but I was not crazy about the taste.  A very sweet barbecue sauce.  For $35 we were not crazy about our meals.  The atmosphere is really cute.  But will not be returning or recommending this restaurant.  And we really are not picky and don't complain.  And we did not complain.  Just won't return.

Text: New to area looking forward to eating here.  Drove in from Effingham.  Arrived at 1:45 pm Sunday.  Line was so slow to put in your name.  At 1:56 pm we were told they were not seating anymore. Poor system.  Uncaring staff.  I recommend "The Hacienda.". Much better experience.
