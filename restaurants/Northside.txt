Text: As a past server I feel that I am pretty understanding as far as service, but I also know how service should look. This place definitely does not have friendly service. VERY slow. We waited 1.5 hours for our food (and the food was nothing to get excited about.) A couple cheeseburgers, salads and some bull fries. The ceiling above our table was moldy and soggy and dripped onto our table and our heads. The bathrooms were gross. After waiting a little over an hour, I asked about how much longer the food might be since we had two small children. At this time it was about 2pm and was not very busy. The waitress stated it would be out right away. We waited another 20 minutes, then I asked her if it would be possible to put it in boxes to take to go. They put all the food into to go boxes and then in plastic bags and stated everything was ready to go. They shorted us a burger and when I came back in she acted very irritated and stated the other burger was sitting right on the counter the whole time (although it was not packaged up with the food she handed us). No discount or apologies were given for the slow, rude service. The burgers were just ok and salad had old lettuce. Way too slow for families or those not wanting to waste 2+ hours on a lunch of sub-par bar food.

Text: This place is beyond awesome. The staff is amazing and the owner is a generous man and a true patriot. He put up with close to 40 marines for 2 days while we were in town for a funeral and treated us so well. Thank you for everything.

Text: This is a great place to come and just look at the walls.  It's like a museum with a bar/resturant inside.  The t-shirts are  hoot too but what really stands out is the service we always receive.  Highly recommended!
