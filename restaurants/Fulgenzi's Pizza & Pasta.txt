Fulgenzi's Pizza & Pasta
Rating: 4
Text: Just got a carry-out order to take home.  Everything was great.  I think they have the best chocolate milkshake in town, even better than Dairy Queen or Steak n Shake!  I got the walleye and fries and both were good.  I prefer catfish, but they didn't have it.   My husband got the meatball poorboy, onion rings, and chili.  All were excellent.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the prices are a little high.  Will definitely go back.  And the girl who took the order was very friendly and actually got everything right.  That's a plus.
