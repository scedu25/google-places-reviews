Genova Italian Restaurant

Text: Great place for authentic,  non-chain Italian food.  Rosie runs a very tight ship,  keeping an upbeat and entertaining atmosphere.  The Hawaiian chicken is truly to die for...

It's my favorite place for Italian,  bar none.  Prices are VERY reasonable for the quality of food. I recommend this place very strongly!

Text: This place is amazing! We had fantastic service and even better food. The bread alone is worth going for. Our table had several different dishes and they were all good. If you don’t live in Newton, this is a place worth driving to from out of town!

Text: Genova is an amazing restaurant! Rosie greets you, as you enter, and makes you feel as though you're in her home for a meal she is preparing just for you! The rolls, served before the meal, are eaten as soon as they hit the table! Each meal is handmade and since the cook times vary, Rosie and other members of the wait staff deliver them at different times. The Stromboli had to be cut into two because it was so big. The portions are huge! The meals don't come with salads but the staff will quickly make you one if you ask. Our group left with multiple take out boxes to enjoy the leftovers the next day. We will be back and that's saying a lot since we are from Texas. Kudos Rosie and crew!

Text: The food is great, the portions are generous and the prices are fair. The staff is friendly and engaging. The atmosphere is simple and homie. We travel 35 miles from Hutchinson to eat here and it&apos;s well worth it. Thanks Genova for memorable dining experience.
