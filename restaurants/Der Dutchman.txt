Text: Amish style food with a 2 island all you can eat buffet. They also have a menu with a large selection of items not on the buffet. The food is good, not spicy, seasoned mainly with salt and pepper. As you walk into the building, there is a really good bakery with breads, pies, huge donuts, and a lot more. They have a gift shop on the second floor with quilts draped over the hand railing.

Text: Tons of comfort food choices, all very well prepared. Salad and soup bar, extensive buffet, and off the menu options. Best known for broasted chicken. Large open dining areas, with table and booths. Not too much room between tables in some areas, but I believe wheelchairs could be accommodated in most areas of the restaurant. There are fresh baked breads,  pies, treats, meats, confections, and gifts available for sale in the lobby. There is a gift shop upstairs with all the items you would expect in an Amish restaurant, including beautiful quilts. This is one of a chain of restaurants and I have been to others as well. All pretty much efficiently run, with good comfort food, good service, reasonable prices, and a bustling, sometimes noisy atmosphere. Very family oriented and a good place for a crowd, though I think it would be a good idea to call ahead and learn their policy on quite large groups. They have banquet rooms, also. Always a good meal here. I've been here many times and I will return.

Text: Came here at lunch time during the work week. Amazing food. It was like a best-ofs highlight reel of thanksgiving. I tried some of everything on the buffet, my favorite was the pulled pork. Plenty of seating, wonderfuly polite staff, and very nice bathrooms. Highly recommended.
