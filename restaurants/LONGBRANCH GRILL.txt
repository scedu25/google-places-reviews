Text: We had great service and the food was very good.  Granted it was about1:30 in the afternoon and they were not crowded but it was still very nice.  I ordered the Philly hamburger and the presentation was great.  I almost took a picture it looked so good.  It tasted very good.   There were 4 of us and they were all highly satisfied.  I would go again!

Text: Went at 4:30 So we could go to winery later. Food was amazing and service stellar. My husband said he's never had a better baked sweet potato. He had stk and I had walleye. Both were excellent. They got busy by 5:15 . Great value.
