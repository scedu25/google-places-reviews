Text: This place is a cozy little gem we are so happy we found.  It has a great selection of pizzas and are willing to make you your own unique pizza to put on the buffet!  If you're in Burlington I i definitely suggest giving it a try!

Text: This restaurant made sure there was fresh food on their buffet even when it was their last business hour of the day.  As soon as we walked through the door, we were asked what type of pizza we liked and immediately delivered to the kitchen. This is a small scale buffet, but food variety was great.  They had a decent salad bar in addition to several types of pizza.  Thw buffet also included comfort foods like fresh fried chicken, mashed potatoe, green beans, egg noodles and gravy.  We are foodies and we enjoyed this buffet.
