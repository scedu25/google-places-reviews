The Mall at Partridge Creek

Text: This mall is very family friendly. My kids love coming here to play in the fountains and play area. I love that people can bring their dogs into most of the stores. The restaurant and shopping sections are great. There's something for all of my kids so it's one stop shopping!

Text: This mall has everything you need... and more. I've been here many many times, sometimes just to walk with my kids so they can play in the fountains. As far as store selection goes, you'll find a lot of options, 
 do you want to go out for dining? this is the place to go. Would totally recommend The Mall at Partridge Creek to anyone living or visiting nearby.

Text: I really enjoyed my visit to this wonderful outdoor mall. The quality of the stores is exceptional, and the grounds are very well kept. I visited the LL Bean, the Apple Store, the Bose, the Lens Crafters, the Nordstrom's, Aunt Annie's Pretzels, and the Clark's. There was a pie judging contest going on during our visit and that was fun to watch. The grounds and stores seem to be dog friendly as there were a number of well behaved dogs people were walking around. They even had dog cleanup bags for guests to use. I would certainly recommend visiting this area for the food and the shops if you are looking for higher end service and quality. There is also a valet parking on-site if you choose to use it.

Text: It's an outside mall that is dog friendly. Most shops allow dogs inside their store. There was a play area for small children. Allot of space to be able to walk around, Wednesday I went i never felt like I was crowded. A ton of places to be able to just sit and rest.
