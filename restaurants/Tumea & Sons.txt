Text: Excellent Italian food. Generous portions.  Our waitress was awesome.  Parking isn't the best but a spot can usually be found.

Text: This place is the real deal. No other Italian joint in town compares to Tumea and Sons. Fantastic service every visit. Highly recommend the Pasta Diablo.

Text: Amazing appetizer and main dishes at a great price. Large portions. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the canolli was not very good. Everything else was wonderful!

Text:  The service was pretty poor. They had forgotten to put in the food order of two of the people in our party, as well as getting two orders wrong. It was a party of roughly 10 so I understand that it can be difficult but after all was said and done they still charged fill price and it is very pricey. There are a lot of fantastic Italian joints in Des Moines.  I would personally skip this one. Especially if you have a handful of people.
