Text: I've been here and ordered food. They are very friendly and have fast service. The food was good. And the people working here are talkative and always make sure you have the things you need. I suggest you come check it out here. Also they play good music.

Text: Outstanding, a must visit. Located between three lakes, Lucas RaceWay, lake of the Ozarks, pomme de Terre lake and Truman. Bridal cave, ha ha Tonka. Very peaceful after a long day of fun. Food is great. Owners go out of their way for their guest. Wait staff are amazing. Inside is a grand spaceous area for many to gather and not feel cramped like the small sidewalk bar and grills on the strip at lake. The bands are great. Cuz I said so, souljoke are outstanding. You must put this stop on your travel destination.
