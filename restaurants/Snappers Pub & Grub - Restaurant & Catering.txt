Snappers Pub & Grub - Restaurant & Catering
Rating: 5
Text: Snappers catered a recent family reunion for us in Lincoln, NE coming all the way from Hanover, KS.  They had been recommended to me by a couple people from my hometown. Mark from Snappers was very easy to work with.  He was very pleasant and always returned my phone calls.  So accommodating.  The menu and food were the best part!  Many menu choices and at such a reasonable price!  We could not find anyone in Lincoln that matched the choices for the price per plate.  And to top it off, the food was excellent and plentiful!  I would not hesitate to use Snappers again!

Text: Wonderful experience!!  We hired Snappers to cater the rehearsal supper for our son's wedding.  They had a great menu selection and were very helpful in organizing the event.  We had several compliments from guests on the food and service.  We were pleased with everything.  I would recommend their catering services to anyone.
