City Limits Saloon & Grill

Text: It wasnt bad, tenderloin was homemade but not as great as the reviews talked about. Bun was very small for the tenderloin. Fries were good. Would have liked a second glass of water, chicken wrap was good but couldn't taste the garlic parmesan sauce at all. Staff was exceptionally polite and the food came surprisingly fast
