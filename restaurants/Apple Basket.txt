Text: Took a while to be helped. Then the booth were sat at had flies all over. The server did ask us if we wanted to move. We were moved to a table that was next to the bathroom. There were many empty tables. The smell was terrible. It smelled like a sewer the whole time we were there. Food was good. Took a long time and they were not busy.

Text: My husband and I and some friends recently ate at The Apple Basket in Macon. The receipt and Credit Card charge were correct on my ticket when we left. However when reconciling my Discover Statement approximately 10 days later I noticed they had charged $3,050.96! It was credited 6 days later. When I phoned the owner he made no apologies. He said this isn't the first time this has happened! He said the tip was charged as $3,000 instead of $3. He got huffy with me when I said the figures don't add up. ($44.08 w/o tip + $3,000 = $3044.08. The charge was for $3050.96) Luckily I had enough available credit on my card! Customer Beware!

Text: We were driving through Macon MO and searched for a restaurant.  The food was very good.  We had the patty melt and Cajun chicken sandwiches.  They were excellent.  Decided to try desert.  The apple crisp was delicious and the ice cream great.  The waitress (Brittany) was excellent always making sure everything was perfect.
