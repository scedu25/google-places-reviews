Text: Excellent place for food, fun & family to spend a couple of hours or the day!  The ice cream of course is the highlight!  Lots of flavors to choose from and it's all delicious. They serve lunch and dinner but my husband and I especially like their breakfast.  The putt putt is fun as it's all the other things they have to do.  There are also numerous festivals, craft shows and car shows throughout the year.  I highly recommend a visit if you have never gone... You won't be disappointed!!

Text: Delicious Food! Had the Hot Shot Roast Beef and Gravy with lumpy potatoes with the gravy on them as well. A little skimpy on the meat but the flavor Outstanding! The waitress Dione was a natural. Despite how busy she was, didn't miss a beat. The food and service is definitely worth a visit. Give it 2 thumbs up!

Text: The ice cream is fantastic. The food is just ok but we only go for ice cream and activities. Although the deep fried cheese curds are good.  My kids love all of the activities such as seeing the animals, going down the big slide, ridding in the 55 gallon drums pulled by a small tractor. They also have mini golf and batting cages.  They usually have other seasonal activities too. The fall ones are my favorite.

Text: We had the BEST dinner experience here...  We arrived not knowing that they closed in less than 30 minutes.  Not wanting to keep the staff after hours, and not having an issue with eating in the car, my husband and I (we drove up from Cincinnati), got our order to go and ate in the parking lot.
The kitchen staff absolutely hooked us up.  My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and they gave him a double breast.  And my god the fries...  Hot, fresh, and abundant.  Even though we didn't order two dinners, just sandwiches, we still got all of the dinner extras.  Coleslaw, applesauce, and sweet potato bread, as well as the sides that came with our meal.  And since I had a birthday coupon, this feast cost a whopping $11.00.  We sat in the parking lot and absolutely pigged out.  It was awesome.  We will definitely make the trip for dinner again.

Text: This is just an excellent experience for younger kids. We've taken our little guy here for the last few years in a row and he has a blast each time. Add the tractor rides back to the pumpkin patch, great food, clean bathrooms, petting animals and don't forget the awesome ice cream, cheese and other dairy products.. this place is a great pit stop on your weekend travels!
