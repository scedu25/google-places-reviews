Text: I ordered 20 piece nuggets with honey mustard sauce!  After I order the sauce the attendant tells me,  remind me when you get to the Windows!  As I sat there waiting I mention it to him again and guess What?  I get home and no freaking sauce.  This is the 3rd time this place has hacked up my order.

Text: Worst BK ever. After waiting 10 minutes for our food after paying, they forgot one of our burgers. Had to go back in to get it and they gave me the wrong one. Had to go back in again and tell them 5 times no ketchup add mustard because they couldn't remember that. And we weren't offered anything for our trouble. Horrid customer service.
