Text: Catch of the day was great. The burgers got good marks from my lunch mates... including the bun. The sides were good but not great. That includes the baked beans, Cole slaw and green beans. The potato salad got good grades. If I had it to do again I'd try the macaroni salad.

Not a great lunchtime choice if you're in a hurry. Granted, we didn't ask the server to rush... but lunch for four people took an hour and ten minutes.

Text: A group of nine of us stopped in for dinner before going out to see Tecumseh.  Very friendly waitress, awesome food and super size portions, had to pass up dessert.  I had the BBQ Pulled Pork and Brisket, "Fabulous" and this is coming from a retired chef.  Brisket was 'fork tender' truly amazing.  Will definately eat there again and again when in town.

Text: We had dinner here last night while visiting with friends in Leesburg! It was exceptional! Atmosphere, service and food, all top notch! 
The smoked prime rib was wonderful and worth every penny. 
We will definitely make this a place to eat whenever we are in the area!!!
