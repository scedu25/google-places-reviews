Pizza & Subs

Text: I have actually eaten here for years and the food is very good. I'm not sure why people are saying it is "reasonably priced." The prices have gone up quite a bit and appear to be the most expensive in the area for a one topping pizza. $20 for a cheese pizza? I would put it more on the expensive end for pizza.

Text: I generally give positive ratings. Been patronizing this place throughout the years and various owners. Seems like this place is going down hill. Food quality not as good. Current owner seems pompous.
