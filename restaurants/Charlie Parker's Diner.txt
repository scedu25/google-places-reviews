Text: Very cool diner! First time in the US and wanted to visit a real diner. So then we visited Charlie Parker's! Pretty cool, nice food and nice server! Tried to eat a 16 inch pancake, but didn't make it... then I bought a T-shirt for souvenir and signed in the guestbook. Definitely worth a visit!!!

Text: Went with family from out of town based on a recommendation. Waited over an hour and a half for food. After 30 minutes was told food would be out shortly, but obviously not the case. Was told that there was a problem in the kitchen. Food was just okay, but felt portions were small. Waitress was nice, but after several people who were seated after us got their food felt like the waitress should have checked on our food sooner. Complained to owner who basically said sorry, but didn't offer to do anything to remedy the situation. Won't be going back!

Text: Great service and great food as always.  Great local restaurant for breakfast.  They get busy, but they move food quick, so usually the wait is very short, even when they are packed.  Food is definitely worth the wait.
