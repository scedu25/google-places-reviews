Text: Service was great, food was not.  The chips were so stale that they were inedible.  We each were only able to take one bite.  I ordered two tacos rice and beans.  The tacos had plenty of meat and was seasoned a little bit.  But it tasted just like the "Mexican" that I made myself earlier in the week.  You know, ground beef and a tortilla.  My wife had the tostada.  It was soaked in grease.   The lettuce was literally glistening.  She took a few bites and made a face.  She kept trying to eat it making faces with each bite.  Eventually she gave up.  I thought maybe she was exaggerating.  I took a bite and almost spit it out.  It tastes like the tortilla was a week old and then refried in cold oil.  It's sad when you have to make a trip to McDonalds after eating at a restaurant and the McDouble is the best food you have had all day.
