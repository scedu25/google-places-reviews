The Barrens Winery

Text: Stayed here in our RV for the eclipse. Spent a lot of time here and enjoyed every minute. The owners are incredibly hospitable, and they spoiled our young daughters rotten. The food was good, the wine was too.  They showed us Southerners that hospitality isn't only found in the south. Thanks for a great stay!

Text: We walked in at 6:30. Told us the kitchen was closed but we could by a bottle of wine if we wanted to. We wanted to taste the wine before we bought any. We have a wine rack at home that was getting quite low and we wanted to replenish it. Seems like we could have done that in 30 minutes. She said when it is this slow they close early. A couple was leaving when we was walking in. Didn't seem slow to me. We will not be back.

Text: While the wines are nice, the experience is one of the worst tastings I've been to. Staff is unorganized and untrained, food pairings are explicitly mentioned with the wines, but not actually available. Additionally, the pricing per glass is absurd.
