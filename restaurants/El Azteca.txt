Text: There burrito ruleta is especially good.. but all their food is great. I have been so impressed with their speed that I decided to time them during my last visit. My two friends and I had our food delivered to our table within 4.5 minutes of us placing our order. (We went on a Monday night so I assume time will vary dependent on day and time.) Keep it up El Azteca staff! You're great and so is your food!

Text: Great place for some if you're in the fixing for Mexican food. Staff are always alert and responsive. Very fast paced clean environment if you need to be in and out. Food comes out so fast its almost like they were waiting for you to show up. Servers are always nice and fun to be around.

Text: Went here two weeks ago, 
Food was good. Service was lacking. We went for lunch and after food was delivered, our bill was dropped off. No drink refill, no opportunity to  order dessert. If the place was busy I'd understand but it was empty.

Text: Its really good Mexican food but their service is not as good. Also, most waiters dont understand english, so if you have questions about the menu, then be prepared to wait for another waiter or the manager. However, this is the best Mexican restaurant in Ames according to me.
