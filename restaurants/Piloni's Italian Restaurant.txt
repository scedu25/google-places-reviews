Text: Went there for dinner on a Friday night with my parents and I had the pizza and after that for dessert I had the tiramisu. It was decent. Our waiter was supper nice to us. You should check it out. I will be returning to Piloni's again.

Text: Great food. Packed restaurant. It's popular because everyone we asked way across town knew the name of the place and recommended it. My dish was great (shrimp) Fettuccini Alfredo. The server was happy and pleasant. Food was served in a timely manner. Beer and glass was cold as hell. The severs helpers were helpful and attentive. Our asparagus was overlooked but they quickly replaced it with a new dish of fresh asparagus. No one really liked the bread though. I would not recommend the bread. A homemade Italian loaf would be nice with olive oil and spices. Everyone was pleasantly surprised and happy with service and food. We recommend this place.
