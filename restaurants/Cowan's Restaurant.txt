Text: We were visiting some friends that live out in Washington and they showed us all around downtown! After lunch we wandered into an antique shop and walked along the water to enjoy the view. By then we'd worked up an appetite for dessert, so we stopped at Cowan's for pie! My husband ordered the Blackberry Pie, which he loved!! He raved about how he could actually taste the berries and how it hadn't been overly sweetened. I had a chocolate pie with meringue topping. The chocolate layer was described to me by the waitress as being a rich, custard. But in my opinion, it's texture was much more like a pudding (not as thick as custard) and it was sweet, not rich. The layer of meringue was about 4 in. tall in the middle and VERY lightly sweetened. 

The restaurant itself was very cozy and homey! It was a comfy place to grab a treat!
