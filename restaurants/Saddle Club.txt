Text: The best prime rib!  A friend, member, brought my husband and I here.  It's a members only club that overlooks the lake.  Dorothy was the nicest lady and very informative.  She told me about the days of the tornado and explained the pictures to me.  Very friendly and nice.....and the food was beyond good.
