Text: Had a delicious omelet for dinner with gobs of hash browns cooked just right. Molly was a great server, checked on us several times but not too much. I would go back again any time I was traveling in the area.

Text: We went to the Christo's in Plymouth. We sat there for over 15 minutes and never got waited on. So we got up and left. The girls visiting at the counter did not care enough to ask us why we were leaving. We travel all over the US and we come back home and are treated so badly. We will never try to eat at a Christo's again, anywhere. I have a very hard time giving them one star! But at least the place was clean.
