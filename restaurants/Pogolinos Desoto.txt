Text: The mini specialty is s matter piece. I'm picky about my food and pizza had always been an iffy dish for me. Very friendly place. It's like the pizza version of CHEERS and everybody treats you like you're a part of the family.

Text: Had fried pickles and a roast beef dip sandwich. The fried pickles were awesome! The roast beef sandwich...meh. Without the cheese and the dip you were left with very dry roast beef but it was there so I was able to finish. The service was good and the place was clean. If I'm passing through again I'll give it another shot. Next time I'll go for the pizza.
