Text: Amazing customer service stayed open late for us so we could feed the kids. Had a late soccer game and didn’t get back to the hotel until they were closing and I called and they said they would stay open for me. Food was great would definitely go here again.

Text: The chicken is a little dry. The chicken livers and gizzards are wonderful. The rolls are great, and the mashed potatoes and gravy hit the spot. What makes this place a really good eat would have to be their sauce.

Text: Always good, always fresh. It's a treat when I get to work in Olathe just so I can have lunch here. Friendly employees and very clean inside.

Text: Very good chicken! Known best for their livers and gizzards. Im a breast guy though! (Wink!) Make sure you try their special sauce and a side of the taters & gravy and a roll. Mmmmm.
