Text: We visited this time with a group of 13. Their spacious dining room and large tables easily accommodated our big group.  Everyone loved their food, many commented on the generous portions! Great menu, plus daily specials to enhance your experience. Service was terrific, every order was correct and timed well, all arrived together! If you are a "gamer" and want to test your luck, they have 3 slot machines in a special 21 and over room.
