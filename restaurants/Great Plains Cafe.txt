Text: Great family restaurant.   Home cooked meals even real potatoes.  Hot beef sandwiches are awesome.  Breakfasts  are a high point as well.  Give them a try, you'll go back again and again.

Text: We were in a hurry so didn't have time to wait the 20 minutes for the fried chicken buffet on a Friday evening, but it smelled heavenly! We ordered burgers and fries and chicken strips. Not only did our order arrive RAPIDLY when the chef was busy trying to complete the buffet prep, the food was SO GOOD!!! Prices were extremely reasonable!! Service was EXCELLENT!!! Super happy to have discovered this place 10 miles from our new place!! Definitely want to get back for that buffet some evening!!
