Text: Excellent service,  fantastic entrees, great drink and atmosphere.  Prices are best in St.Louis area.  If your looking for a small dish this is not the place for you.  Large entrees fresh ingredients. The wait is, so worth it, on a busy night. Looking to impress this is your place old world class.

Text: The food was amazing, and the service was even better! Toasted Ravioli was the best I've ever had, no joke, and the house Cunetto salad was so so good. I had the Linguini Tutto Mare and was not disappointed. But what made Cunetto even better was their staff. Our waiter, Derek, was very pleasant and took the time to make a connection. We will be regulars for sure!

Text: Food quality and portions make this place a tremendous value. The reasonable split plate charge to share an entree still gives both people a heaping helping of food. Best lasagna I've ever had (Tuesday nights only). Also love their carbonara and house salad. Be prepared to wait but well worth it. There's a busy bar section as well.

Text: Absolutely love this place! Family is from St. Louis but I was born and raised in Texas. I was in St. Louis for work and had to stop here and have some chicken Fettuchini Alfredo and Fried Ravioli. Probably the best Italian meal I have ever had in my life! If you are in the area, I suggest eating here.
