Text: It's a corner bar in Brunswick!  Friday night karaoke is awesome.  He can get any song instantly for you.  His mics are above average and actually make an average singer sound great!  Food was typical fried fair.  Barmaid was less than friendly.

Text: F#$K this place. The old broads that are behind the bar are so freakin rude. I went in, there were maybe 4 customers, I waited about 3 minutes to get served while the 1 old lady was texting. I finally told them they were rude bitches and walked out. Horrible service, I don't understand how they make money at all with that attitude

Text: Walked in and the regulars all stopped talking and looked at me until I ordered. Something like out of a movie made me feel uncomfortable. I only stoked in there because I was meeting my dad for the first time and that bar was near his house and I wasn't.  From the area so I stood there because the situation I was in I needed a quick drink.
