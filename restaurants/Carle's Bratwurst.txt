Text: I love Carle's. Their food is really good & reasonably priced.  Their bratwurst is the best & they offer Amish pies, rolls. & cheese, (brought in on Thursdays by Mrs Troyer from an Amish community East of Bucyrus). You can't go wrong, so try it.

Text: So I call everyday to ask if they have wraps or holdovers before I leave work to get it. So I called today and was told they have them avaiable. And when I get there they tell me they are sold out. So I move on to something else and what a surprise they are sold out of that also. My question is what restaurant is sold out of something before lunch hours are even over! Terrible experience!
