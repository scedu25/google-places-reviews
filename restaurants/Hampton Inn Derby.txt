Text: So we just visited, we didn't stay at the hotel for the night. Nice place, the lobby had several places to plug in a laptop and get started with work. Friendly staff, convenient location right on Rock Rd.

Text: Worst experience ever with a Hilton property. Beware of the 48 hour cancellation policy. They would not let me cancel my same day reservation even though I had just made it. I got charged for a one night stay. I will never stay here again and would recommend you stay in Wichita at one of the other area Hilton properties.

Text: The rooms and hotel we're nice, but a couple issues I noticed. The pool was very small, it seemed like they just put it in so they could check the box that says yes we have a pool. The Continental breakfast was so so, the food was good, but not a lot of choice. My key quit working after about 3 hours so I took it to the front desk and she reprogrammed it, she said keep it away from your cell phone, sometimes the phones will wipe the keys. I found that very odd and would consider it a major design flaw if it's true.
