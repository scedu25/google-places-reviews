Text: I just ordered my lunch from there. It had a nasty flavor to it. I can't even describe it honestly. It was like a mixture or dirty dishwater,  old grease that tasted like fish and rotten vegetables. Very disappointed and will not order from here again

Text: I'm not normally the type of person who leaves reviews, however I feel compelled to say a few things. My husband and I live in El Dorado where the Beijing is updated and more modern. After coming to this one in augusta twice, we will not be going to the one in El dorado again. The restaurant is cozier and less crowded, the prices are lower and you get more for your buck, the wait staff is much nicer, and the menu selection is vast. Food is the most important factor. We have not gotten one thing we did not enjoy here so far, whereas the one in El dorado I have left completely disatissfied with what I ordered. We would definitely recommend the pot stickers! If you're in town, stop and grab a bite., and if you arent, it's worth the drive because the food here is SO much better.
