Text: Love Fat Boys Pizza!! The Bonzai Pipeline is my favorite pizza! I usually don't eat the crust on pizza but I love their crust. I have never had anything not taste good from here. The staff is awesome and friendly. They are quick too!

Text: Fat Boy's pizza is the premiere pizza shop for Holt and the surrounding area. Families have grown up enjoying Fat Boy's. The meat lovers pizza and grinders are superior in taste and value. If you haven't had a Fat Boy's pizza...have one soon. Well it's three years later and I wouldn't change a word of my review, keep it up Fat Boy's!
