Text: The waiter was not very helpful but in the end it is just a take away, and I guess food was ok for its price.

Text: One employee was working and by the time we got our 4th order the first couple were cold.  Ribs and brisket was dry, almost tasted like jerky. I didn't like the BBQ beans either, they were pretty overpowered with a flavor I can't name. Waste of time considering Joe's World Famous bbq isn't too far away.

Text: The one staff member that was manning the place was so ridiculously slow that people kept leaving the line. He acted like he was stoned or just really lazy. He was so slow and didn't care that he was losing business. When it was our turn to order, they were out of the items we wanted. How does that happen? The only saving grace was that the pulled pork sandwiches were good. I would recommend avoiding it. It's KC, there are tons of other BBQ places to eat.

Text: She older lady at the front desk was so rude and loud and disrespectful. I left Coz she was way too rude and has no respect for customers. She was mad Coz one lady was looking at menu from the wrong side of the line. This lady was so unprofessional about the whole thing and rude. So the lady and her kids left, alongside other customers who witnessed her behavior. I'll never go back there ever again to be talked to like an animal. I went there on 9/12/16. The lady was a white older short lady with a deep rusty manly voice that smelled like cigarettes. She an angry person and miserable and she should go work somewhere else if she's not happy there. You're losing a lot of great customers because of her. Trust me. 5 people left in a matter of seconds.
