Tuffy's Tavern Bar & Grill
Rating: 4
Text: I grew up in this Tavern . with Aunt Lucille and Uncle Tuffy , Sharon was like a second mom to me and Shawn and Eric like brothers . Even now 35 yrs later I go there in my mind , back to a little boy . when times were free and easy , summers lasted forever.
Lived with the Hagens at the end of Niobrara St. among other places in this beautiful small town . There was a water pump in the middle of main street . Nobody locked their doors and everyone helped each other. I still feel the need to gather at the Tap during a bad storm or heavy snow fall . Just to make sure everyone was okay . I miss the days of the Taylor's garden ,eating strawberries til I was sick with Larae. Life is too complicated now. I tried going back in 93' but nobody remembered me . it's true ...you can never go home again. I keep Smithfield in my heart . I go there in dreams and it'll always be my safe place.. fireworks ...rodeos...fishing trips..all gone from me ...
