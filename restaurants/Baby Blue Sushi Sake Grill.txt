Text: This is my favorite place for every special occasion and am always very happy with my experience. But I don't like the fact that in large parties everything comes on one large plate, with no smaller plates to come with it. I ordered 2 maki rolls, but didn't get to eat them. I eat slow and like to enjoy my food. But when it comes out like that, it makes it difficult to enjoy

Text: The sushi tower and Hawaiian roll are good. The manager stopped by the table to offer a complimentary drink or dessert for my friend's birthday. Great service!

Text: Been here at least 20 times in the last year but first time I have felt compelled to write a review. The service I received on my last visit on Saturday (01/07) was far above typical Blue service standards and really stood out. Emily D was extremely friendly, tentative, accommodating & very personable. I will definitely make it a point to ask for her as my server whenever feasible.
