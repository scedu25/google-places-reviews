Text: Delicious food! Worth waiting when there's a line. Fantastic service. The black bean raspberry chipotle dip and fried tacos are our family favorites. If you're celebrating, go for the layered dark chocolate cake with raspberry sauce.

Text: Fun atmosphere that fits more people than it seems like it should. Go for high quality, delicious burgers, fries, and a Nancy! Not for a quiet date night, but for sure for a fun loud one.

Text: Best burger in the free world. Do they serve burgers in communist Sweden?
Also the only time the term "Nancy" is a compliment or a good name.

Text: Don't get the fish tacos. Literally get anything else.

Also try the chipotle raspberry Black bean dip. Your life will never be the same.

Text: Checked this place out a few weeks ago while in town from out of state.   Food was delicious!  They had a special drink with old Milwaukee and pineapple juice  (sounds disgusting,  but was really good!).  The only thing is that it was really crowded with nit much seating space.  Glad to have been suggested this gem in little Manhattan,  Kansas!
