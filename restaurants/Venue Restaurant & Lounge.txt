Venue Restaurant & Lounge

Text: My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Venue.  I have a food allergy, so they prepared a special dinner for me and my husband. Everything was delicious and the staff was fantastic. Then, after we paid the bill, the manager came over to give us a gift card and apologized for the wait for our dinner to arrive. Couldn't be happier with this restaurant, the staff and the chef.  Best restaurant in Lincoln--hands down!  We will definitely be going back.

Text: The food lived up to the promises of the menu! The harvest board with 3 cheeses was excellent. I had the quiche of the day which was spinach and Gouda. It was light and delicate layers, with flaky crust. The creme brulee was small, but just the right size to finish with a sweet ending. I look for to my next visit!!

Text: Great food, and amazing service the staff is very pleasant but not overbearing. One of the true romantic restaurants in Lincoln. The chef knows what he's doing.

Text: Overpriced for the quality. I got asian-style duck. The sauce was way too sweet, and the rice was already cold. Oh, and I found a macaroni noodle on my plate. The restaurant is extremely loud, so don't expect a quiet meal.
