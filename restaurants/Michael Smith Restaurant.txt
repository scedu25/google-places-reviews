Text: The food was good and the service was great but I was charged more than the menu price for the bottle of wine I ordered.  I confirmed this with the restaurant but received no promised responses (4 attempts).  My suggestion you carefully check your charges.

Text: The flavors are amazing!  Such care is placed into the creation of every single dish that leaves the kitchen.   Sit, relax, and savor every bite. I recommend the foie gras!
