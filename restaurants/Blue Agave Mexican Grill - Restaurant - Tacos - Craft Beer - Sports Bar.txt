Text: The food was great, but the fajitas were so filling that I didn't get to try dessert. Enchiladas trio was tasty. Also, our server Joe was super amazing.  Definitely try this place!

Text: I have never had better service. The gentleman who greeted us, sat us, took our order and served our food.. was amazing.  I believe he was running the whole place with a smile on his face. Had 6 other tables and got our order right,  on time even checked back with us.  The food was so delicious.  You have to try the cheese dip and guacamole! Everything was so fresh and their chicken actually had flavor.  Complements to the chef and the staff.  Great place!

Text: We visited for the 1st time tonight and hands down it is the BEST Mexican food we ever had. My fiancé and I highly recommend giving it a try. Its a small family run restaurant and the prices are more than reasonable. The portions are large and the service was wonderful. This is the only Mexican restaurant we will be going to from now on.

Text: I come here randomly when I crave Mexican and I'm at the house. I've always really enjoyed it and am glad I found it. Been coming for almost 9 years.
