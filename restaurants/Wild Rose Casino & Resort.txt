Text: I booked this hotel and was a little unsure as it is a Casino resort.  I have to say, great value for money.  Big rooms,  well equipped, friendly staff, complimentary breakfast for both of us, quiet at night, no rowdy folks and we really enjoyed the coaches corner horse racing betting.  The staff were helpful, polite and engaging.  Rooms are not super modern, but clean, and everything you need.  We will use the hotel for sure next time we are in Clinton.

Text: Good atmosphere, simple and easy to be at.  Machines are decent, pays enough to keep you playing for a while.  I liked the shops and parking was nice.  We will be keeping this one on our radar.
