Text: Best Mexican food in Meade Co. for sure!  Waiters and waitresses are always friendly!  And if you are a regular, they pretty much already know what you want when you walk in! :)

Text: Researched the website and on google maps for the Brandenburg restaurant and it said it closes at 1030 pm on Saturday night. Got there at 940 pm and was told that they were already closed. Even after I said what their website showed, still was told they were closed. Hostess was a little rude about it too.  I guess I will just go back to Elizabethtown to El Tapatios.
