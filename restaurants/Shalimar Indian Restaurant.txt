Text: I order delivery from them for lunch at the office sometimes because I'm tired of greasy fast food or sandwiches from home. Everything I've had so far is absolutely delicious and well prepared. The menu has pretty much anything you might be in the mood for. Overall, really happy ordering from here

Text: For this being my first experience with Indian food I have to say I love it. I've always been a big fan of spicy foods and their dishes bring the heat along with wonderful flavor. I can't find a negative thing about this place the prices are even great my fiance and I love and recommend it.

Text: Incredible Indian food.  We've been going to Shalimar for 5-6 years.  We think it's the best Indian restaurant in Louisville.  Every dish we've had is exceptional.  For seasoned dishes let the waiter know the degree of spiciness and they'll gladly accommodate you. The breads and the garnishes offered are a great complement and the beer and spirits prices are more than reasonable.  The service is attentive without hovering.

I've been to Indian restaurants all over North America;  Shalimar is top notch!!
