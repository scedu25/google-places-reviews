Kahuna's Burgers
Rating: 4
Text: Kahuna's is a local favorite for good reason!  I give it a 4/5 stars, the elusive fifth star only being withheld because of the drive through/parking situation.  The drive through is usually pretty slow, and the parking lot can be filled up incredibly fast. You won't find food sitting in a warmer here - everything seems to be cooked fresh as you order it - which usually causes some delay in the drive through.  The food is great - try the breaded mushrooms and the western burger.  I also greatly enjoy the horseshoe with white cheese.  The portion sizes are pretty good (the horseshoe is a ton of food - try the ponyshoe if you aren't a big eater), and the atmosphere is nice.  The prices are reasonable, but expect to pay more than you would at a fast food place - the burgers are worth it.
