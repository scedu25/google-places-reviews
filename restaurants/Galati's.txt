Text: Excellent experience. Service was instant and to the detail. Our waitress, Mary Ann, was very friendly as was Sal, the owner. There were quite a few things on the menu to choose from. The food came quickly and tasted terrific! The prices were very reasonable. We will be back, because there are definitely some more things on that menu that we want to try.
