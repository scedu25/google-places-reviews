Text: Outstanding service and amazing sandwiches... far better than any chain sub sandwich establishment. Dally's offers a huge variety of fresh meats and ingredients (veggies and dressings). You really have to try one of their soups... my favorite are chicken gnocchi & Cheddar potato. My youngest son loves the taco nachos and my oldest the ice cream... we always leave happy!
