Text: Just saw the grand daughter of the owners on "Let's Make A Deal" in California. She plugged the 100 year old restaurant in Spring Valley, Ill( 90 miles South of Chicago),I had to Google & found it( knowing it was Italian). Checked out the menu & it definitely gets a 5 star, especially reading the reviews. GOOD EATS!!Wish I lived closer, but I live in. Huntington Beach, Calif. ????

Text: Good Italian food. I recommend the Classico chianti by the bottle for $26. Be sure to ask them to open it at the table, not sure why ours was brought to us uncorked.
