Rocafella's Pizza A Taste of New York
Rating: 4
Text: Nice little chill place, after waiting for 30 min they told us they threw our ticket away so it took a little over an hour to get served. The pizza made up for it, as it was really good. I definitely recommend the Bronx Bomber. Will come back at some point.

Text: Good pizza although I waited 35 minutes... longer than stated. Not sure why as they did not seem that busy. Half hearted apology and did not want to talk about it. I will give them one more try. Have been back several times since...and the pizza is good...not heavy or greasy.

Text: Horrible customer service!! I'm from out of town and when I called and just gave them the name of the hotel they started by telling me that it's 30 minutes untill they close and if I don't have the address to the hotel they can't help me anyways. I worked in pizza for 5 years in management and never have I talked to a customer like that.. guess that's why we were a million dollar store though. This hotel had  brochures for rock a fellas and I couldn't imagine why. So I continued to order online, in which ended with 40 minutes later the online services calling me and telling me they are going to refund us because they couldn't get ahold of the store and they know we hadn't received our order.  they apologized for our inconvenience and refunded us. I'm sorry I ever gave this place a try.

Text: Rockafella's has one of the best pizzas in Southwest Ohio.  Their specialty is the thin New York style but I'm sure they have more.  I've been going there for years so they are consistently good. It's worth a short drive down Highway 42 to get to the Sharonville business district

Text: Pizza cut in triangles then squares incorrectly. Greek pizza was cold overall taste and quality just didn't hit the mark.
