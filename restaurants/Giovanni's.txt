Text: Makes one of the best pizza's I've ever tasted. My family had a reunion there after going to the graveyard in Lucasville,Ohio I ordered the chicken bacon ranch pizza and a Pepsi in a glass. I am from Columbus IN. Used to live in Portsmouth, Ohio until 1995 then got a job at a factory making exhaust systems for automobiles. Now after 20.5 years I work in different factory making driveshafts for automobiles. Pointed out at old job. But this one parts weigh less. And work less hours everyday.  $14.47 hour and .50 more second shift. Time and a half after 40 hours. NTN Driveshaft inc. Columbus IN.
