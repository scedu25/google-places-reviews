Text: The food gets a 5 star rating! The food is great. They change the menu a little bit to much but the food is always good. Now I gave a 1 star rating due to the service. Theres been times where we made reservations and they never wrote us down at all. So They put us in a wobbly corner table. Then one time we stood there for 10 minutes without anyone even acknowledging us so we just walked out. There's been times where we will have empty drinks for a while and our server is nowhere to be found. The food is amazing, decor amazing. The tables are a little small though and the service is lacking.
