Taco Hide Out

Text: Staff are nice but what they cook just doesn't float my boat. I understand from others that this place is kind of a landmark and one of the first taco places in the area, but I grew up in an urban Latino community so only natural that I am kinda picky. People seem to like it though, so they are doing something right, but there are better Mexican eateries in the area IMHO. Your experience may be different.

Text: This place is a local favorite. Just the basics here but you get a lot of value for the dollar and the food is tasty. Taco shells are excellent.
