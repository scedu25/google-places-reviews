Text: A GREAT little place off the beaten path.  Service was fantastic, fruit
was FRESH, food all around was fantastic and inexpensive.  It's down home, no frills and very good. 

The museum is eclectic and fun, you will have fun pointing out things you haven't seen in a long time and things you haven't seen before.

You will like this gem of a find.

Text: We had just eaten so we stopped by the museum. It was like stepping back in time. The museum was very clean and the displays were nicely set up. The staff asked us to let them know if we had questions and told us some background information on the family. Next time, maybe tomorrow, we will be sure to stop and eat too. We also stopped by the store and my husband thoroughly enjoyed looking around.
