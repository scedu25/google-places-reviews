Larry Bobe's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: If I could give this particular establishment a 8/5 stars, I absolutely would. I drove 4 and a half hours from Hannibal, MO where I went to college just for Bobe's pizza. Then I drove 4 and a half hours back to school. I did this on two separate occasions. 

All of this to say, this is the greatest pizza ever made by mankind.

Text: Really good pizza. Worth the drive especially since they have a drive-thru. BUT... I sure wish they had beef for their pizzas.
