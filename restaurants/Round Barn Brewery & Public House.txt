Round Barn Brewery & Public House

Text: Absolutely poor experience! This is my favorite place to stop when in SW Michigan. Staff was rude, didn't want to work, just wanted to sit at the bar and drink. Manager let it go on. We had a group of 22 with reservations. You think they would be prepared. Sadly, they were put out.

Text: The red building at the end of the street was easy to find in this small downtown.  The flights were full of options as you could choose a combination of beer, wine and spirits.    We decided to order the nacho's, crab cakes, and the soup a sweet corn chowder.  Crab cakes were some of the best we ever had.  We really enjoyed the fresh sweet corn in the chowder.  As for the drinks I enjoyed the Kolsch, Sangria and the Red Sky Rum.  Prices are reasonable.  The pizza looked delicious, we will be back.

Text: I wish they would bring back their older menu items. They change too much. Their beers and wines are good, they're sangria is life changing.

Text: We go to Round Barn Public House as often as we can. The crab cakes are absolutely the best we've ever had, in all our travels. The service is impeccable, the food is always great and the beer/wine selection is amazing. We love this place. Sitting on the patio is always great. They even have sports on T.V. which is a huge plus for us.
