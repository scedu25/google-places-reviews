DoubleTree by Hilton Omaha Downtown
Rating: 1
Text: Was disappointed. The room was so hot and no way to control it. When we turned the heat down and the fan on it made too much noise. Too hot to sleep. Breakfast buffet was not good. For the price not happy. One positive we did have a good pizza delivered to the room.
Also charged for parking and the ramp was empty. Will not be back.

Text: The access from a major street is easy to navigate. Parking was very close and validation available in the hotel. The desk clerks are knowledgeable and friendly... They actually looked at us instead of the computer screen. 

Amenities are plentiful. We stayed in the honors room. It was  clean,roomy and ventilated.

The price is reasonable for a  upscale hotel. If you need a place to stay and want a little bit of luxury, this is your best bet.

The pub and restaurant were open until after midnight. Starbucks was a treat!!

Text: The double tree is located in downtown Omaha in a lovely location. It is walking distance to mostly everything. The hotel itself is gorgeous to look at and has incredible views from the room. We stayed on the ninth floor in the King suite. Guests get free parking the duration of their stay and there is a convenient shuttle that runs until midnight. There is a fitness center and a pool but no sauna or hot tub.

Text: We had two events that we went to one on Saturday and one on Sunday. The event on Saturday was great lots of space. The feeling that were served was okay. The event on Sunday was only top 4 and the view was amazing. It was a little hot in the room
