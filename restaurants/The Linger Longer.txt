The Linger Longer
Rating: 5
Text: Visited The Linger Longer during a day trip with a friend.  It was open for a private occasion after a funeral for my friend's aunt.  The Dr. Pepper memorabilia is worth the trip, in and of itself.  Quite an immense collection.  I ordered the Pepperoni Pizza Panini.  I also got a bag of chips & a homemade Dr. Pepper.  Even though I live a state away, I want to return sometime to try their other delicious food.  In fact, I highly recommend skipping the main food items & just make a meal of an ice cream dessert.  If you are near the area or are on a road trip, swing by Bennington to enjoy this gem.

Text: Ok I'm guilty. I knew if I didn't make supper tonight my husband would recommend Linger Longer. And it has never disappointed us.

Text: Cute and a little off the beaten path. Come for the sodas and nostalgia more than the snacks. We didn't try the ice cream but it looked yummy.
