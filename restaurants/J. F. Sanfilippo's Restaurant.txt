Text: I play a game when I eat somewhere I haven't been before. I only eat what is recommended.  This time I was rewarded with beef medallions with eggplant, marinara, and mozzarella. Side dish of rigatoni with a slightly spicy tomato sauce. Perfecto! ????? the meat was cooked perfectly. The staff were very friendly and attentive. A really nice dining experience. Totally worth the slightly higher price.  I liked it so much. I asked for my server to surprise me with a desert to take with me, but not tell me what it is. I cannot wait to crack it open and see. I'm very confident it will be too
P notch.

Text: Food was tasty but the wait for lunch was much longer than expected. The salad was overly salted. The seafood ravioli was very tasty.

Text: This salad was $8- way over priced. Pastas were pretty decent and prices were reasonable for those. Overall it was good.

Text: Delicious! Entree (Chicken with Fettuccini Alfredo) and dessert (Tiramisu) were just perfect! Will be back next time in town.
