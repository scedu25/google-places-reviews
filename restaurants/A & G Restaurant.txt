Text: So excited to be able to meet my best friend on her 1 hour lunch break since I am from out of town for my favorite spinach salad! The salad once it arrived was good but the service saddens me! We waited 45 minutes with no water refill or attempt to make eye contact! Came with salads placed them on table with no dressing took my water glass, never ask my friend if she wanted a refill, came back with my water glass and still no dressing, went and got dressing and said nothing. I stated just enough time to inhale them and she ignored the comment. Came back within 5 minutes placed the check down and never bothered to ask if we needed anything or if it was good! Life is short...don't ruin customers lunch with your bad attitude. Obviously your in the wrong business. I encourage you to go find something that make you happy!

Text: For a small town Steak House, it was real good. They serve all kinds of foods, including pizza. Very reasonable in prices and friendly. Nothing fancy.
