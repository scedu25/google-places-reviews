Hillbilly Hot Dogs
Rating: 5
Text: Hillbilly Hot Dogs was a heck of a time. Happened to be driving along Ohio River Road into Huntington and they caught my eye, had to turn the car around to check this place out. I'm infatuated with this place, such a unique attraction and some of the friendliest people you will ever encounter. Came in on a Saturday afternoon, they were fairly busy but still speedy in getting our food order to us. The cashier, I believe her name was Miranda, was just incredible. Had lunch inside of an old school bus converted to seating with tables to eat, what an experience. Took a look around the beguiling antiques and license plates strewn about the property, very intriguing stuff! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Huntington area or looking for a good time in West Virginia, extremely grateful I came through!

Text: Super busy but well worth the wait. I got the Hillbilly dogs that are deep fried. Excellent!  My wife had something different,  but wasn't impressed. It's really more about the experience  anyway. Sitting in an old school bus eating hot dogs. Fun!  Also had a milkshake,  don't waste your money on that. Great food and fun!

Text: A very unique experience that was very satisfying.  The food was delicious.  The service was awesome.  We did a short bike trip, (400 miles round-trip) to partake of this establishment, and was not disappointed.  There's a reason why they are on the national radar.  GO THERE!!!

Text: Seeing this restaurant on drive ins diners and dives, so it sparked my interest to go and check it out when I was close by. Drove a little over an hour to get to this establishment, the food was good the beer was cold it has a great deal to look at. Very unique to say the least. Prices are slightly higher than I'm used to paying for hot dogs.

Text: I've been here a few times over the years. It's a fun place to go and the decor is just neat. It looks like a lot of junk but they put a lot of time and thought into it and The place has a great story. The hot dogs are very tasty. The combinations of toppings are very unique but amazing together. The french fries are good and they serve a variety of different beers and beverages. The staff is always a very friendly. Great concept.
