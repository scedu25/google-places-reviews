Buffet China
Rating: 5
Text: The table was still wet from being wiped down, but it was nice to know it was cleaned. Something lacking at other recent outings. The buffet choices was great, fresh, and filling. We were checked on several times, and were well looked after. Eaten here many times and always been a happy camper. 5 stars, and recommended. Xie xie ( thank you).

Text: 0 stars if I could. This place was so awful! I'm from LA so I have had a variety of Chinese buffets back home, good and bad. This place is the worst so far. Fist of all, don't come here late I guess. My bf and I came at 8:30pm when they close at 10pm. That is not late at all. There was no food! Everything was dried up and has been sitting there. Majority of the food were empty and they were already cleaning everything up. We had a long drive from Tennessee and this place had good ratings, I do not know who rated this place or if those ratings are only valid during the day. But for sure do not come here at night. I have never been so disappointed. My bf and I are gonna go eat at the bar as we should have done in the first place.
