Text: Love this place. Service may not always be amazing, but the prices are great, my food has always come very quickly, and it tastes wonderful. The variety of the basics to crazy combos I never would've thought of is fun to explore, and keeps me coming back for more. Not to mention the late-night hours... I work second shift, so I love having a place to go for a midnight snack after work that isn't just another fast food chain. You have officially made me a fan - keep up the great work!

Text: Excellent service for such a small place.  Even though it was packed, seating was very well organized and there was no wait.  Drink selection was great; food selection was amazing and taste was outstanding. I was impressed compared to my experience at the other location. Next door arcade makes for a fun evening.

Text: You don't think "hot dogs" and not think "Dirty Frank's." This is THE number one hot dog hang out in Central Ohio. A "Short North" (millennial) environment and a wide selection of gourmet styled all Beef or vegan hot dogs. Best fries North of High Street close to Downtown, I 70 & I 670.

Text: This place is yet to disappoint, the seating is snug but worth it. A filling and delicious dinner can be yours for about 15 dollars including a drink! The dogs are dynamite and the beer is great, service is fast, one of my favorite spots in Columbus.

Text: Great "hole in the wall" local joint.  Very gichey, but the food quality was high.  Staff was very nice, very helpful, prices were very good.  Menu had a few surprises, good surprises to be sure.  Busy, but comfortable.  Definitely a must try!
