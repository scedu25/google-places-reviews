Text: I had the fried chicken it was very good portion we're very generous. Everyone took food food home with them for another meal. Service was great. I would definitely go back . Great for large family gatherings.

Text: To say we weren't impressed is an understatement! Upon entering this establishment it is very dark and to have to seat yourself at 2 pm on a Saturday ....where do u sit? There's rooms and tables everywhere and no-one to ask for help! Our waiter was very slow coming to our table, after seating ourselves! Took our drink order and I asked for a Lemon in my water...TWICE..and guess what? No LEMON! The cheddar cubes, dino nuggets, fries and tenderloin were WAY overcooked! Almost burnt! My steak was just OK nothing special and my baked potato was old tasting. The only thing good about our visit was my Caesar salad! Hard to mess up! We won't be back.

Text: I don't always make it to Sprout's when I visit Quincy, but I have enjoyed it every time I have gone.  This trip, I did get there for both breakfast and dinner.  The food is alwaus wonderful.  The serving staff is always friendly and helpful.  This is certainly a place anyone visiting Quincy should try!  :) :) :)

Text: Great service by Tim.  Chicken strips to die for.  Son had chicken parmesan on spaghetti noodles (only on spaghetti night) and it is his favorite.  Great pumpkin pie as well!
