Text: Didn't get what I ordered for Thanksgiving. Ordered and payed for a 14lb. Turkey whole. Got a aluminum pan of cut up sliced turkey that was dry as a bone and Tuff as shoe leather. Payed almost $100.00 in advance, they treated me very rudely, I'll never go there again it was the last thanksgiving I had with my parents I was working long hours and was counting on this place. The employees were the most disrespectful individuals I've ever met in my life.if it was the last place on earth to eat at I'd just rather die than eat there.
