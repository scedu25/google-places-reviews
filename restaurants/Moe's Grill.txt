Text: I always enjoy the atmosphere. New younger waitress visits too often for proper service of waiting patrons. Grilled chicken sandwich was okay but there was a sticker left on the sliced tomatoe. Normally I really enjoy the food and I love to take my granddaughters with me but we haven't been able to do that lately. Hopefully these small issues can be resolved.
