Jaspare's Pizza and Fine Italian Food - Portage
Rating: 3
Text: After reading the reviews my husband and I were expecting something awesome from here. We pre-ordered pizza and bread sticks an hour ahead of time and ended up arriving to pick up the pizza about 20 minutes late. However, once we arrived, we still had to wait another 10 minutes for our order to be finished. The food was fine but nothing to write home about. Breadsticks were a little bland and our pepperoni and sausage pizza were pretty greasy. In my opinion, it was a little pricey for the quality of food.
