Text: Visited a couple years ago and made a point to return during my latest trip to Columbus. The sandwiches have been amazing, and the soup today was great. Beer or root beer by growlers to take home.

Text: Nice selection of beers, some very tasty ones in there.  Also try their "home made" sodas, they are delightful too.

Text: I went for for the craft beer. Had a salad and an American Lager. Both were good, would return again. The seating at the bar is not very comfortable, stools made me feel like I was being violated lol. Only one TV though, mellow atmosphere.
