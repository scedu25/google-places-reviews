Text: First thing: Plates are $25–70. Sides are extra.

I've only been one time, but the food did not match up to the price for me. I got a pork chop and green beans. The pork chop was very good, but I've certainly had better. The plum sauce for the chop was not good at all. My green beans were boiled to death and pretty tasteless. The whole plate was otherwise empty; no garnish or other accompaniment.

Text: J. Bruner's is a true Steak and Lobster tail supper club. Well appointed. Excellent serving sizes with well seasoned steaks and prime rib. My medium rare KC strip was delicious.
