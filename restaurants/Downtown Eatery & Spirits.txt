Downtown Eatery & Spirits
Rating: 5
Text: A signature destination in Warsaw for a night out with friends or a simple bite to eat. I mostly drink here with my pals and occasionally they'll have live music. They have a really nice outdoor patio if you want to smoke or get fresh air. They also have darts and really great bartenders who are very friendly.

Text: Just pub food but really good.  They have some creative burgers,  good wings,  and a really nice atmosphere too.

Text: The only thing missing is the the staff yelling "Norm" when you enter the joint.   Otherwise 5/5 stars for service, atmosphere, food, drinks and friends
