Ho Wah Chinese Restaurant

Text: First off, anyone who doesn't give this establishment at least 4 stars is an idiot. My girlfriend and I have eaten in the restaurant, as well as called in orders for pick up numerous times. Staff is always courteous, food is always hot & delicious. Portions are huge even for a big boy like me. We always modify our order and they get it right every time. Best Chinese in the area.

Text: You would think because  they speak English they would get your order right.  I ask twice fresh vegetables  on the fried rice.  Zero veggies when I get home.  I tell her twice she repeats  it to me and nothing.  I tell her make sure the General  chickennhas sauce on it not dry.  Seems like I told her make it dry. Only one time have we gotten ourborder right.  Please owners insure  your hired help listens.  Not happy at all.

Text: Food is decent but the service inside is EXTREMELY slow and pretty terrible all around.

Text: This place is in my hometown and I move away often. Yet I will easily drive hundreds of miles to come back here. The crab rangoons are to die for.
