Text: Great food! Amazing service. The place is always populated on weekends. Food always ready really fast.

Text: It was rough with the new ownership taking over.  The order times were extremely long, and the food was subpar and sometimes not even correct.  BUT they have improved a LOT, and now the wait time and quality is quite good.  It will probably never be as good as the old days with Dave, but I will still continue to go here.

Text: The new ownership is ridiculous.grant it they offer friendly but sub par service. What used to take10 minutes top under previous managements now takes 25 to 45 minutes and get this it does not even taste as good as they used to. Just a disappointing experience.
