Wabash BBQ
Rating: 5
Text: This is a restaurant inside the old train depot. They have a delicious rub that they use on everything from the French fries to the meat. Our absolute favorites are the fried mushrooms, baked beans and pulled pork!  Pulled pork is always juicy and flavorful. Tenderloin is very good also and can feed two.

Text: Awesome BBQ brisket sandwiches.  BBQ ribs were burnt to a crisp,dry and inedible. Waitress was very good and lrectified the situation quickly. Nice atmosphere.

Text: We were out driving around east of KC and decided it was time for lunch. Looking in Chillicothe for high rated restaurants we came across Wabash. We navigated to the restaurant and were pleasantly surprised it was in a train depot! I'm a huge train buff, and the name should have tipped me off to the heritage behind it, but it didn't click. The service was fantastic, prices were good and food was amazing! We didn't know we didn't know there is also a Wabash in Excelsior Springs, which happens to be way closer to our house, so we'll definitely be checking them out again.

Text: We have been here before. The food is very good. The service this visit was terrible. One young man waited on us after a female started to wait on us and couldn't seem to get it together. The guy was good, but there was no way he could handle the whole room by himself.
