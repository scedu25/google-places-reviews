Text: Great Customer service! Slice of pizza & fries is enough to feed a 16yrs old athletic boy. Burgers meals are delicious & fulfilling. 5 piece Jumbo Wing (regular sized wing that you would buy at the grocery store) meal are delicious & fulfilling. Reasonably Priced! You can easily spend under $20 to feed a family of 3 (1 adult & two teenage boys). Hopefully this review  helps?
