Text: Great little bar and really good food at a reasonable price. Underrated for Horseshoes and Fried Fish! Burgers are awesome, just like the nachos! Give this place a chance, you won't be sad.

Text: I have to say that I was slightly impressed here.  The bartenders keep the place really clean, the food is good, and they serve some really cold beer! More than enough TV's for entertainment, decent seating for a "strip mall bar", and good music when sports aren't on TV. Great prices on their drinks and food which isn't common place as well.  What made me give 5 stars is that Paula, the bartender called me by name roughly 10 minutes after I introduced myself.  That's rare to say the least and should reflect their personality and quality of employees that work here.  

Highly recommend!
