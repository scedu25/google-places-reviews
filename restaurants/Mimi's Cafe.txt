Text: I have gone to Mimi's for a decade or longer and never had a bad meal. I even have my top three waitresses that I enjoy working with there and they work hard enough to always deserve an excellent tip. Fabulously varied menu both for lunch and dinner. You must try one of their muffins!

Text: Service was a little slow, but the new menu was interesting. Had the salmon and it was great. Service was good. Soda seems to be WAY OVER PRICED at close to 3 dollars for a glass.

Text: Our first experience at Mimi's was sublime! The banana foster pancakes are to die for. And the potates are tasty! Not to mention the bread and Madeleine's were the start to a wonderful overall experience. Our waitress, Luna was very sweet and attentive and took care of our needs and meals.. Great atmosphere for a day out with family.. love the food!
Be back soon
