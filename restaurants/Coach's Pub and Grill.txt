Text: I'm from Wisconsin where Friday night fish fry is a way of life.  Now that I live in Michigan it has been a struggle to find a good Friday night fish fry.  Coaches is the best one I have found yet.  Sports bar atmosphere noisy, busy, but the staff are wonderful and attentive.  The fish is great the service is great and while you can't get a Wisconsin style, Brandy Old Fashioned there (or anywhere else in Michigan) you can get a Guinness on tap.  Wheel chair accessible and just might  be the best fish fry in lower Michigan.

Text: Pizza was terrible.  Overdone. Pinapple had no flavor,. Maybe it was old.  Ordered double Pinapple, not very much at all. And where was the pizza sauce?  Cheese wasn't even right.  Done ordering pizza here!  Waitress never picked up dirty plates or checked how it was either, but still tipped well.

Text: 3 of us got to Coaches at about 10:00PM. Tables had glasses and food on then. Waitress acted pissed off because she had to clean up before we could sit down. She left to take items to kitchen...she never returned. 2 waitresses  passed by numerous  times..took 20 minutes to get a drink..never asked if we wanted food. We won't be going back anytime soon. Service is deplorable
