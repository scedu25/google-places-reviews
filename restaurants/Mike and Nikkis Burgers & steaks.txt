Text: The owners are two of the nicest people I know. The food is very tasty and prepared the way you ask. The place is also kept neat and clean. This is a great family place or cozy couples place.

Text: Great food, good atmosphere, you can't beat a family restaurant. Highly recommend the fried tenderloin, it takes up your whole plate! Also the sweet potatoe fries are fantastic!

Text: I tried 3 of the 1/2 lb burgers...

The standard go to Cheeseburger and a side of fries. Which was prepared perfectly. 

The burgers were all juicy and delicious. So I won't have to mention that again. But, they were damn good burgers... Ok, I didn't have to mention but hey.

Now for the specialty burgers...
The Texas, with the details in bright red with a caption pretty much saying that if you don't try this one you'll regret it. (No, not literally. But, you can't tell me when you see it that it doesn't place just a bit of peer pressure on you.) This one has a Texas Toast for a bun and holds true to the everything is bigger in Texas. The bacon and cheese made my stomach smile.

Saving the absolute best for last...
The Bourbon, OMG... From my first bite to the last, bliss had filled my mouth. The grilled onions hidden by the melted cheese. Com'mon! This is the one. The burger to make me happy and when your needing a happy tummy... GO BOURBON! For which I have to thank Daphne our server as she recommended it.

Oh, don't think I won't mention the fries. Or, I should call them pommes frites, as they were definitely not like the usual fries. So perfectly crunchy and light. If you have a burger, get the fries... you won't be disappointed.

This foodie, will be back.
