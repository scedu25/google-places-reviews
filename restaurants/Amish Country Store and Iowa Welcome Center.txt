Text: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! We stop on our way to and from Milwaukee when visiting my daughter. I buy Christmas gifts, jelly jams lots of things.
They also make the best fried chicken that I've ever had.

Text:  Nice atmosphere, great country selection of goods and foods. No rush, clean and reasonable pricing. The jams and other spreads selection is wonderful. I'd tell you about the rolled butter but I don't want to cause a shortage or price hike. Better than Ireland's best for much less, ooops, I wasn't gonna say that either. -Enjoy and be well. - Bob Berry

Text: This is a great place!  I am not sure why people complain on other reviews that it has Amish products and other things? The other things are a nice bonus.   Everything is of good quality, unique, and fun to look at.  The store is stagef BEAUTIFULLY.  Friendly staff.   Super clean restrooms.

Text: I was visiting the Midwest from Texas with my children. I grew up in Amish country and I was excited to get kolaches and bread and candies. 

I was disappointed. The Bakery was skint and I didn't get any of the things on my wish list. And there were not as many authentic foods and what was there seemed a little factory made. The gift were definitely 99% "English".

Still. It was beautiful and the kids did get some candy. They also really like the chickens!

Text: I can smell the homemade cinnamon rolls as soon as I walked in...so good. Immediately got one. French roast coffee went well with it.  Also picked up  a bag of freshly lemon snap cookies and mini pb cream sandwich cookies. You can taste the real lemon flavor and raw nuts in these...love em!! Pickles in horseradish was amazing. So much varieties and flavors. Well worth a visit.
