Text: Nachos should not look like water was added. The service could definitely be better. 
I'm sure other things on the menu are good but not what my family had today.

Text: The taco shells were definitely very strange on the fried tacos all of us that had those were very disappointed in the shells for sure they tasted like deep fried pita bread which is not what you use for taco shells. The service however was absolutely outstanding I would come back just for the service and if they would change their taco shells I would gladly become a solid customer for them.
