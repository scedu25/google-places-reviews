Game Time Sports Bar&Grill

Text: Stopped by here with the family before the parade. Decor is about what you'd expect from a bar. Food was really good. I had the wings which were done amazingly. Wife and kids had the burgers and shrimp all of which was good. Would stop by again especially given the limited options in the small town.
