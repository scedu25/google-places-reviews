Shokai Sushi

Text: Considering we're in Iowa, this place is darn good. The service was very professional and the sushi was tasty. The building seems to be going through some upgrades but don't let that turn you off.

Text: Awesome food and quick friendly service. The best part of my Shokai experience was hearing the bus boy complain about having to do his job an hour before closing time. Must be rough.

Text: OK I'm from Cali (to say the least I love sushi, so I've been to grate places) and I have to say the experience here was as good as can be! The staff was grate! And the food omg! I can't discribe it you need to come and eat here! If you can drink alcohol ask for the warm sake.
