Text: The food was excellent and was served very fast. Our waiter was very polite. We ordered rice, but did not get it, which was fine, but they took it off our ticket, no questions asked. Overall, it's definitely a five star review worthy.

Text: I used to really enjoy this place. It is nice and clean with decent service. This time the meat was fatty and more expensive than I would have liked.

Text: Great food most of the time. Sort of hit and miss. If you ask about gluten free options the waiters roll their eyes at you. Probably not a safe bet for celiac people.
