Text: Jamila was very, very rude. My mom asked for my sisters drink cup and she scoffed at my mom and said she would get it when she got it. The food was enjoyable but the service was not.

Text: My daughter and I stopped in after the Cards game. After we ordered we realized my daughter did not have her bakery item. When she went back to the counter there were no employees present and a young man named Mike who works here but was off the clock came over from the table where he was sitting and helped her. Excellent customer service from a very nice young man!
