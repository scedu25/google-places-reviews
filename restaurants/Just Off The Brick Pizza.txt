Just Off The Brick Pizza

Text: We ate at a few places this holiday weekend and this was one of the best. Garlic cheese bread is where it's at! Service was exceptionally great and friendly. It is definitely locally owned and a rare find so if you're more into the 1875 Steakhouse this might not be the place for you. Family friendly, great service and good food. Thanks guys!

Text: So happy we stopped here to eat! Garlic cheese bread was awesome as well as the cheese stuffed bread sticks. Pizza had a thinner, crunchier crust just the way we love it. Would definitely come back again!

Text: We ate at multiple places over the weekend and this was by far the best place. Super comfortable atmosphere, very friendly service, absolutely amazing pizza and the garlic cheese loaf is out of this world. The keep odd hours, but dont let that detour you. Honestly, a real gem!! Would recommend to anyone. Nice beer selections as well!!??

Text: Overpriced, understaffed, and bland overall.  Perhaps my pizza standard is too high anymore but I recommend Pizza Hut if you are in a pinch over this place.
