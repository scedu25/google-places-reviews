Dinner Bell Restaurant

Text: Excellent food!   I had fried chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes and gravy.   Beans and potatoes were savory.   Chicken was so hot I had to wait for it to cool.   Also served with delicious corn flat fried cakes.   True country cooking and real comfort food.

Text: Stopped here on our way home from vacation. Outside looked very welcoming. Food was amazing!  I just had a burger and fried pickle, husband got the fried chicken. We ended up sharing once he gave me bite of the chicken! Wait staff were really friendly. We will be back!

Text: We have visited the Dinner Bell often as we travel in that part of the state. We came back often because we have always been very happy with the food. But this time I was a little disappointed, some of my dinner was not very warm including my baked potato and my turnip greens. We will probably give the Dinner Bell another chance. Hoping it will be back to "very good"...

Text: Very friendly staff.  The southern fried chicken was fresh made and authentic.  Very attractive restaurant, and a great place to get together with friends or family

Text: The restaurant's front exterior is very inviting with Boston ferns, potted plants and farm artifacts. The tastefully lettered windows offer a sampling of what's inside. From a selection of hearty and healthy menu options we enjoyed a satisfying lunch of fried cod, green beans, bean soup, sweet potato and cornbread. Both the cashier and Tyler, our waiter, were friendly and attentive
