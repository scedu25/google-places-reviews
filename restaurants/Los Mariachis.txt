Text: Asked for a chicken tamala without sauce on it, cut it open and was pork. Asked the server and she asked the cook, said "that's all we have"- no apologies. I don't eat pork! They never bothered to let me know till I asked! I sat without food while everyone else finished. Place gets minus 5 stars in my book! I'll never go back!

Text: I like Mexican food so I was happy with the experience here. I think there are other restaurants in the area that are a bit better but I am glad I tried it. The refried beans here are actually really good.
