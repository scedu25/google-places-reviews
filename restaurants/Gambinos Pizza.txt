Text: The food was good staff was friendly however a table that was dirty when we entered at lunch time was still dirty when we left.  Also informed the staff that the tea was extremly bitter was told it comes that way in a bag.  I know old tea when i taste it and whether it comes in a bag or not it was most likely old.  i had my friend try it who also said it had a bad after taste.  the buffet was a good meal for the price i did enjoy everything but the tea.

Text: Usually they make a darn good pizza, but today they've disappointed me. I have a severe reaction to meat that makes me gag, puke, and lose my appetite. I ordered a large pizza with cheese and alfredo sauce, and the pizza came with NO SAUCE and PEPPERONI. You guys made me sick. However, the delivery man is one of the nicest people I know and told me good morning even though it's 8:45pm. 3 out of 5 for ambiance.

EDIT: I got a call and they're making me another, personally inspected, for free. You guys have earned my trust and my respect. Especially that sweet man who said good morning. Props, Gambino's. You've earned yourselves a 5.

Text: Fantastic food! Try the Italian cheese stick pizza. Seriously. Friendly staff. We wouldn't mind having this place in our home town.
