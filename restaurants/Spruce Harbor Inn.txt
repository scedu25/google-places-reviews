Text: Please DO NOT come here for anything other than frequenting the bar with the rest of the other loud patrons. Our party of three ordered two Ribeye dinners that we requested be cooked medium. They were not only extremely rare when they were brought out to the table, but were so tough, chewy, and grisly, that they were barely edible. Not even half of each one was eaten, and when we addressed the issue with the waitress, she not only neglected to inform management or give us a discount, but turned around and billed us for the entire amount. We also ordered an "all you can eat shrimp" plate, and not even once did  she come by to ask if she could bring more. The young woman even tried to get us to move to a table that we didn't want to sit at when we arrived. If you want fine dining, this is not it. Bad service. Bad food. Bad experience.

Text: We come here every year for our anniversary & get the best beef tenderloin in the world. They have a great salad bar & fantastic service. When we left tonight, we said, "All these years coming here, they have NEVER disappointed."
