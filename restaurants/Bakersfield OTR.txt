Text: So good! I went for the Shrimp and Al Pastor tacos - each one was packed with flavor. I recommend the Queso - great appetizer dish and the chips are delicious as well. Friendly and fast service. Wild west themed restaurant with a cozy setting. First dining experience in Cincinnati and I highly recommend this place.

Text: We ate there for the first time today. Delicious food made in-house (tortillas, salsa, and chips included) and the service was over-the-top! They have a unique seasonal pineapple margarita!  They also offer some vegetarian options. I only wish they took reservations, but that is the case most Over-the-Rhine restaurants.

Text: Food was great! Staff was amazing! Location and environment were awesome. However, they do have to lower the music level. You have to yell across the table. Care when walking around late at night, kind of sketchy.

Text: Great place! Good drinks, smaller selection of beers but known for their Margs & tacos. Definitely a small venue and would be packed at night or on Friday happy hours. Good food and good service though!
