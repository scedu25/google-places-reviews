Metropolitan Club

Text: I cannot express how wonderfully well the Metropolitan Club handled the details that surrounded hosting my wedding and dinner reception.  I gave them a two week window!  And they pulled everything off to perfection.  The setting is beautiful all by itself, but it was transformed into an even more elegant space for my guests.  The staff was exceptional.  They handled every detail of the delicious dinner, cake, and transitioning from one part of the evening to the next.  It seemed every time I looked up someone was there offering to help.  My singer and keyboardist remarked that they had not had such courteous, helpful staff anywhere else they had been before.  Thank you for treating us like family!

Text: Was here as a guest for a holiday work dinner party. Dinner was good. The inside and the view very lovely. Bar is much too limited though. Need to add craft beer selections.
