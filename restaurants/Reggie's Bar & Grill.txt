Reggie's Bar & Grill
Rating: 4
Text: I eat lunch here almost everyday, and there's usually a lunch special that will fill you up for less than you'd pay anywhere else close by.  The owners ( Reggie & Betty) have been married for a long time and work well together to serve their customers. They have chips, sodas, candy bars, jerky, beers, hard liquor, arcade games, a pool table and an enclosed smoking area in the back.
