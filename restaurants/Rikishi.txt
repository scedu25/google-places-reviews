Rikishi

Text: My husband and I used to come to Rikishi all the time and it was always excellent. Our favorite server, Mackenzie, was always on it and kept us coming back. On our most recent visit the service was sub par, and our food took forever to get to our table when there was hardly any tables in the restaurant. The man behind the sushi bar wearing the steelers hat was slow and kept wiping his forehead sweat with the back of his hand. When our rolls finally got to the table they were falling apart and incredibly hard to eat. I am sad to say that my husband and I will not be returning to Rikishi.

Text: The teriyaki chicken was average but nothing to die for. I've had better fried rice but I've definitely had a lot worse. The vegetables that came with the dish were undercooked and lacking flavor. The only reason I didn't give a lower score was because the sushi was above average and priced decently.

Text: You get some really massive rolls for some fairly normal sushi restaurant prices! Was pleasantly surprised when the sushi came and how much we got, we couldn't finish but brought home some delicious leftovers! Good quality sushi, clean nice establishmet, great place for dinner for sure.

Text: My husband and I went there for a date night, and atmosphere was great, but our sushi was not. The quality seemed subpar, the texture was off and all the rolls tasted fishy except one which was deep fried and reminded us of a funnel cake. This was not the romantic dinner we had in mind!
