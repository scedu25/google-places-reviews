Text: I love to see a local place thrive, but this is not the best Thai place in the Region for a few reasons. The food tastes good, but lacks authenticity. This is because their target audience is not Thai lovers, but businesspeople and others wanting a more "upscale" dining experience. Dinner prices are honestly outrageous—30-50% more expensive than they should be. I believe this is due to the upscale atmosphere. Having said this, the servers are very helpful, as well as knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. If the dishes were more authentic (which is to say, less watered-down to reach a wider audience), it would justify the price point. But it's just not there—yet. I hope that changes, because the potential is there.

Text: My mom and I make this a regular stop, maybe monthly. We have had the pleasure of having many servers, all of whom are fantastic. Tonight we had Rosie and she made our experience extra fun. Can't wait to be back!

Text: I had a business meeting here earlier this year.  It was my first time dining at Asparagus and it was very nice.  I had the Pad Thai Noodles w/Chicken and it was delicious.

Text: Omg! The food was awesome! We had our girls night out at Asparagus. Everyone had different tastes and one vegetarian. Everyone was happy. I had the pineapple curry shrimp. It was amazing. Great customer service. It was live entertainment night. We all love jazz and said we will definitely be back.

Text: The service is professional and quick, the decor is elegant, and someone raise the bartender's pay. I love the lamb chops, I would have tried to eat the bone. Everything is delicious, I recommend the whole menu and bring friends. 
Perfect for an elegant romantic dinnner or classy drinks!
