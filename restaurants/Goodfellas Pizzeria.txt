Goodfellas Pizzeria

Text: Good value and tasty pizza.

Things to improve: 
wipe off tables outside.  Be more consistent with the toppings on the pizza, one slice I had was half topped.
Selection in display case was limited.

Text: Easily my favorite pizza in town. I am biased toward New York style slices though. The location in the distillery district on Manchester street is recommended if you want to eat inside. This location only has a small counter to eat at. Open late. Expect a line late on Friday and Saturday nights.

Text: Huge pizza! Very good! Breadsticks are over a foot long and a large pizza will barely fit Into your car door! Highly recommended!

Text: Horrible. We walked in and stood for 10 minutes without seeing a soul. Nobody greated us, half the lights were off, the bar looked disgusting, and again- nobody greeted us. Good thing Mellow Mushroom was right across the road.

Text: OMG!!! Best pizza ever I lived in Manhattan 4yrs and this pizza is better than any I have ever eaten in NYC or anywhere else. Pay the extra and get the best.
