Text: Never again the customers are ignorant had I known that Hoes ate there I would have avoided it. the poor girl conversation was about sucking dick and swallowing cum.To top it off she said "I know this generation is fucked up" she took the words right out my mouth. PRAY FOR THEM!

Text: I've been to starters a number of times & have enjoyed it each & every time. I always go for a promotion & am hardly ever disappointed. I ordered the 4 bone ribs and sad to say they were fatty, sauce was decent, & meat was tender. China was my waitress & she was very attentive & very accommodating.?? The adult beverages you'll NEVER de disappointed bcus they don't skimp on the alcohol. Thanks china for that slight buzz.?????
