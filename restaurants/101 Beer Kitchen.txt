Text: This is by far my favorite place to eat. Never been disappointed at any of their locations. They change their menu according to the season but always keep their top sellers. Their loaded tater tots app. is a must try because they are amazing. Their soups are wonderful and their lobster Mack is the BEST I've ever had. Staff is great and very knowledgeable about their menu. You won't be disappointed at 101 Beer Kitchen!!

Text: Oh. My. Goodness!

This place is absolutely delightful. The decor is great, the staff is attentive and the food. THE FOOD! A friend ordered their tater tots and they changed my life. I vacillated between two entree options and settled on the Cuban. That was one of the best decisions of my adult life. That pork belly was juicy and flavorful, paired with everything else...magnifique! The only thing was that their "salt and vinegar" chips that came with the sandwich were barely that but I guess my unsophisticated palate used to Lay's. Oh well. All in all, a great experience and I can't wait to go back!

Text: THE BEST! The best for beer and awesome food in the area. We moved from Charleston, SC and I would put this menu offering against nearly any place down there. Plus the prices are much better and a great value. We love the variety of the changing menu and have yet to be disappointed.

Text: Good grilled wings.  Nice atmosphere.  The hangar steak with dried cherries and cherry coffee sauce had excellent flavor but was VERY tough.  Still not bad because of the flavor but you'll need a strong jaw!

Text: I highly recommend this for any time of the day. It is a little pricey for a casual meal, but it will not disappoint. My girlfriend and I went for an early dinner. The food was delicious, the server was attentive, and the atmosphere was casual yet appealing. All in all it was a positive experience. I will definitely go again. It is a good Sunday-fun-day option for brunch.
