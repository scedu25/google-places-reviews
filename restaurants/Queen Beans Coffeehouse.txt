Text: A nice coffee shop with 5 different selections. The food looked incredible, but I just needed a drink. I will not hesitate to stop next time I am back. All in all a nice addition to the Carroll area.

Text: Stopped by on my way home from Sioux City and ordered a latte (Bee Hive) and a salad. The salad was very nice and the atmosphere was nice and quaint. Quiet but busy and the decorations added nicely. The staff wasn't exceptional, they made me feel like a burden. I watched them make my latte and they didn't pull fresh shots or steam the milk (something all lattes should be), I was highly disappointed that they call themselves a coffeeshop while not making quality coffee. This spot is a great for a quick bite to eat, but I do not recommend their coffee (especially not at the $6 price tag!)

Text: My second visit and the food is great, coffee not so great, there was not dark Roast! I read the other reviews and I do not agree on the service. I do not want to think because I am hispanic, I hope not!! They need to be friendly  with everybody, no matter your color or race.

Text: Kinda high priced for what you get.  Coffee is mediocre but for a small town I guess it's as good as it gets.  Service was a bit lacking.
