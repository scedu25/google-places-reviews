Text: High quality in a small town.  Probably the best place in Mount Sterling and surrounding area.  Nice bar.  Lots of history here, with pictures.

Text: When visiting Dorothy's for amazing deals, do yourself a favor and eat lunch or dinner at Have 1891. The menu is somewhat limited, but that's a good thing as the dishes are prepared with seasonal eating in mind and taste as a top priority. You'll find a great drink menu as well with a few specialties that beg to be tried.

I had the Hagel burger with onion strings.  First of all, the bread they bring out is top notch delicious, especially with their butter.  The burger was fresh, juicy, and delicious.  And then the onion strings... Oh em gee!  I washed it all down with some great tasting iced tea.  Afterwards, I had the lava cake.  I'm pretty sure I died from deliciousness during this experience.

As far as the price, it is very fair!

This is an upscale restaurant, worthy of any big city, almost misplaced in this small town.
