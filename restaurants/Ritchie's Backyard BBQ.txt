Text: This is a great place to eat. The food is always awesome, the service is good and the employees are friendly and helpful. They have a full bar and you can play Keno. We go eat here every time I visit my parents and they are regular customers.

Text: A regular pub with regular food. Packed at dinner, just a few at 9:00. Various items on menu, all appetizers fried. Wine special was interesting. Lots of sport tv screens. Pub attached to a grocery by the same name.
