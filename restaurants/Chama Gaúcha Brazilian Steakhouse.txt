Text: The service at this restaurant is simply OUTSTANDING. The staff is constantly attentive and they go above and beyond to make guests comfortable. Water glasses never go empty, food is always being delivered, and they have nice touches like folding your napkin when you leave the table and assisting guests with removing their coats. On our latest visit they heard a comment I made to my husband about his birthday and brought out a desert for him to celebrate! I've never dined anywhere where the staff worked so hard and were so attentive to guests. The food is also excellent - a great salad bar and choice meat is always circulating. We will be patrons for life!

Text: This is honestly one of my favourite places to eat (and drink) in the whole world (and I travel a lot)! The service is impeccable without being pretentious. The salad bar, although slightly limited in scope (sufficient choice without being ridiculous), is not limited in size or quality. But be careful not to fill up on the extras, especially considering how good the dozen or so cuts of meat are. I've eaten here numerous times, as part of small and large groups, and have nothing but praise for this restaurant.

Text: Fun experience.  Food was tasty.  The meat has a lot of seasoning.  A bit over seasoned on some cuts.  The salad bar has a nice spread.  Sangria was very refreshing.  It was very pricey.  For myself and my husband our tab was $150 (dinner, 1 drink for him, 2 for me) and with an additional $50 tip it was an expensive night for us.

Text: Wow what a great restaurant.  The free valet parking was a huge bonus.  The salad bar was great but the meat was outstanding.  I've been to a place similar but this one was better.  Service was amazing and the selection of drinks was one of the best I've seen.  Highly recommended!

Text: Great service. The wait staff is very attentive and will keep refilling the side dishes. The food was great and cooked to perfection (make sure you make plenty of room). Try everything! You can always ask the wait staff for a specific cut of meat and theyll bring it. Parking is very limited but they have complementary valet parking. Make a reservation it does get really packed on the weekend.
