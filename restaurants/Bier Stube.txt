Text: Generally a pretty good beer selection.  The crowd can be hit or miss - sometimes it is absolutely packed, others its slow.  Karaoke is always torture, but I don't mind watching some drunk people crash and burn from time to time.  Prices are okay and there isn't a cover to get in.

Text: Our group wanted to sit on the back patio, the bartender said they do not take orders or bring food out to you if you sit there. You have to go inside,place order then pick up your order. But,they serve on the front patio. Confusing! Why have that space then. Menu had been shortened also. We took our business down the road.
