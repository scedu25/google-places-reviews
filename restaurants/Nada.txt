Text: Just had one of the best Mexican meals ever. I had the shrimp corn tamales meal.  Wow, what deliciousness.  Shrimp was tender, corn cheese thing was excellent with enough heat and sweetness. The tamales was seasoned perfect. Becca was a wonderful waitress. Very easy going, personable, and well knowledgeable of the menu.  Definitely will be going back.

Text: I have no real complaints about this place. I don't think the food is quite worth the money. The tacos are good but not much better than some other local places (like Bakersfield). I ate here before a show at the Arnoff and was satisfied. Waiter even made sure to give us our checks quickly because we were cutting it close on making the show.

Text: The food and drinks here are delicious. Quick service at lunch, a little slow at dinner (usually because they are busy). Everything tastes fresh and the sweet chili fries are BURSTING with flavor. Love their chips too.

Text: One of my favorite spots for dinner.  Food is unique, but very good.  Certainly cannot go wrong visiting.  I particularly enjoy sitting outside in the warmer weather.

Text: Being from Phoenix, this upscale restaurant has tapas down. I don't think I could give an objective review because I can get the same food from a taco truck in AZ. Unbelievably expensive and as far as Southwestern cuisine goes. But for Cincinnati, Midwestern palates, I see the draw. .  The decor is bright and fun. Lots of happy faces
