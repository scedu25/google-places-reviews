Subs N More
Rating: 5
Text: The bread for the subs at Subs & More was not the least bit exaggerated. That was by far the best sub I've ever had. The bread had like a soft crunch to it that made the sandwich just amazing! I have never wrote a review for any place or thing, but I had to for this place. The food was just that good. The employees were great as well. If I ever come back to Michigan I WILL come back to this place!

Text: Fantastic pizza, ready in a jiffy, at a fair price. Don't forget to order some of the cheesy garlic bread. Really friendly staff.

Text: Terrible restaurant waited 45 minutes for 2 subs and fries and when we got the fries they were cold and nasty and one of the orders was wrong. I do not recommend coming here u will regret it. The restaurant is also ran by a bunch of 14 year old girls that don't know how to work. The restaurant is so poor they don't even have a deep fryer the fries took literally a half hour to make and they tasted like great value frozen fries anyways.

Text: The service was okay, but the pizza we got wasn't very good. The crust was doughy, there was almost no cheese even though we paid for extra cheese. I don't think we'll be back.
