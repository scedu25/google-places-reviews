Spicy Tuna Sushi Bar & Grill

Text: The only time I come here is for Wednesday night sushi. About 20 or so sushi rolls are half priced on Wednesday starting at 5:30. The service even on these nights is fast and the sushi is fresh. It can get busy so it's best if you make a reservation.

Text: Used to be my favorite sushi place about 6 years ago, but in the last 2 years it has lost its quality and service. Even on a slow night we've had to wait almost an hour just for a few rolls and the waitress' excuses are always the same "The new sushi guys don't want to work fast." It's a shame since I used to love this place, but the inconsistencies have turned me away.

Text: Probably the best sushi restaurant in town. Although their prices are very high I still like to come here once a week and get something off their half priced menu.
