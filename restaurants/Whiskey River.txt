Text: I wish I could give this 5 stars because the food is good and the bartenders are awesome but every time I have been there they have  charged us for more than we have ordered... idk if they think because we have been drinking we wouldn't notice? But still not cool! I want to trust the bar I go to not to screw me over.

Text: We have been going here for years and recently the service has been just the absolute worst. the new staff just doesn't know what they are doing. Needless to say we are done going.

Text: The food was delicious, but unfortunately that was about all that was exemplary about this place. We saw the waitress maybe twice during our hour here, which was odd because it was a Sunday afternoon and the place was mostly empty. Beverages weren't refilled. One of the orders was incorrect...but we weren't able to get it mended since the waitress was nowhere to be seen. The beer and mixed drinks are a bit pricey for what you get. I know it's a bar serving a college crowd, but if you are going to be open on a Sunday afternoon and advertise brunch specials (bloody mary bar) you should really be prepared to offer brunch-level service.

Text: Great stop for a bite to eat with some drinks. Service is good most of the time. I've had experiences when its busy and you wait for awhile. Overall, I'll keep coming back.

Text: Interesting bar. Too loud to talk at easily but everyone was friendly.  Good prices and decent beer selection.
