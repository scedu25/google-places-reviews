Text: Good place owned by friends of family, just wish they remembered to give you refills.  I don’t know if they are understaffed, or just lazy but If I were the owner, fountain would be with the buffet.

Text: Nice salad bar! The only complaint about the hot bar is that they put too much food out at a time and some of the food that is supposed to be hot gets cool. Especially the fish, which is delicious when it is fresh and hot.
