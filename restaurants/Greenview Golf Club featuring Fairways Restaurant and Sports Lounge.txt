Text: Even though I go for just salads because I'm vegan the waitresses are so awesome to work with me. No cheese, milk, butter etc. And the salads are so good! I love the veggie pizza with no cheese. And I will eat the sides and they make sure no butter is put in it! Always clean and friendly.

Text: We used the party room and it was perfect!  The guest could move between the bar, the patio, and the room.  The sandwiches and appetizers were excellent!

Text: Stick with the lunch menu.  It's what they do best.  Party of 5.  4 of us served at once and the 5th, a pizza, 6 minutes later.
