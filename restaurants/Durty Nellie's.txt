Text: Clean place. Good for big crowds. Was pretty perfect on a Thursday night with some typical 90s-today's top hits where you could request something. Outside place to sit. Nice neighborhood. Music venue attached but I think it mostly has a cover. Food was good. Just a good bar to go to. 4$ any draft on Friday if you get there early. That was really nice.

Text: Cool spot to hang out and chill. They have a nice patio upstairs. Gets busy late on the weekends. Drinks are fairly priced, and the bartenders are great. I recommend this spot.

Text: Good service, ample parking, traditional bar food done well. If you like local bands, this iconic northwest suburban rock and sports bar needs to be high on your list of places to frequent.
