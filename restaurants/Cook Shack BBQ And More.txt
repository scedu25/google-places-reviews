Cook Shack BBQ And More

Text: Love it! The desserts (we tried the cheesecake, the banana nut cake, and the strawberry rhubarb cobbler) were delicious (homemade every morning). The coffee was smooth and flavorful. The smoked meats tasted homemade. The burger was juicy. And the atmosphere is the best part. You walk in and smell the meat smoking. Locals sit about the place talking and joking with the proprietors. It feels like you're eating at a friend's instead of a restaurant. Prompt, friendly service and kind faces. The perfect place for a sit down meal or just coffee and dessert. In a hectic world where the comforts of small town, easy going life are rapidly disappearing, this place is a slice of sweet memories that warm the heart and fill the belly. Cook Shack BBQ and more; When you're in the middle of nowhere, you're just about there.
