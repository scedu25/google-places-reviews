Text: The food is pretty good and the service is great. It isn't the best Mediterranean I have had but there are great healthy options on the menu. There are better specialty food options in the area, so it is hard to give a five star recommendation for this place, but you will definitely enjoy your meal.

Text: I love the food here the problem is the service is a bit slow, so I would not recommend this place for a quick lunch. If you are in a hurry not not the place. But it is great food and the staff is great as well.

Text: Love the food. Soup was as authentic as you get, Salad was fresh crisp and delicious too. I'd recommend ordering Shawarma as a sandwich instead of a lunch plate. Falafel and Hummus were both delicious. Service could've been a tad more pleasant, but since it's a family owned place I understand as hey might be busy running everything. All in all 5 stars, definitely recommend if you're craving Mediterranean.

Text: I love their food but their prices keep going up and you get less now. I was going to order carry out today but walked out when he handed me a menu and my chicken Sharma meal went up $14.99 from $9.99. and this was at 11am.   What happened to lunch prices?????? They need to change the menu online because  it isnt the current prices.  Much more expensive now.
