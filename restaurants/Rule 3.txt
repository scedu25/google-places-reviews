Rule 3

Text: The employees are friendly and do their best to satisfy customers. I have eaten here once and it was tasty. There is a large bar where you can watch sports. 

The bowling lanes are nice. They turn off lights as it turns into evening. Making it impossible to see the diamonds on the lane.

The floor is a little sticky so you can't use a seasoned  bowlers technique. 

 The drawbacks are minor & we plan on returning.
