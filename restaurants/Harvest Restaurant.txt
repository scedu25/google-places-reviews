Harvest Restaurant

Text: Harvest was a flawless meal top to bottom. The cheese dip appetizer with the fresh pretzel roll was so good I cleaned the bowl with a spoon. The tartar was as delicious as it was beautiful. I had the duck breast that was without question the best I've ever ordered. I will be back.

Text: The staff and atmosphere were great. With that being said, I was not impressed with my entree. It was well prepared, but I just didn't like the taste.
