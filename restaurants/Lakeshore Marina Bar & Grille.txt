Text: We went on father's day 2017 and it was horrible!!!! Our waitress Becca didn't attend to us and it was not busy. She was more occupied with the other staff and who was going to bartend. We o my got a half menu but yet 5 minutes later the people behind us got a full menu. My husband wanted a steak but it wasn't available!!!! Our food took forever and was cold and no flavor at all!!!!! $112 not worth it.
