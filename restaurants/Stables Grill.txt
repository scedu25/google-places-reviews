Text: After a long day on the road we pulled in at this delightful restaurant. It started with a fabulous pretzel appetizer made on site. Then the main attractions arrived. Both gravies were terrific.  The fresh made onion rings were too good!  Not one member of the party had a complaint!

Text: Tenderloin was great.  Guy behind the bar only had time to visit with his regulars.  Asked to have a ballgame put on the TV he said " sure if ones on". Which was fine but he went back to visit with his regulars.  Never looked up the games on and never came to see if I needed a refill. Right now I'm sitting here with an empty plate and an empty glass.

Text: My wife and I stumbled upon Stables on a Sunday evening after several restaurants on our "go-to list" were closed. This place is amazing! The service was great and the food was top notch! Nothing that was frozen, thrown in a deep fryer and then served. It was all fresh and hand-made.  Great prices, wonderful atmosphere, will be returning soon!
