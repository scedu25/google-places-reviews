Al & Leda's Pizza Villa

Text: Pizza over done and crust dry. Parts burnt. Offered to make another, yet said having problem with the cheese and maybe cooks should not bake it as long. This did not instill confidence that the next pizza would be any better. Took home to dog.

Text: We love this place! Tried the wings for the first time & then we wanted the whole chicken! The pizza is always awesome, and the bruschetta, and the pasta crocks, and the staff! Please keep up the good work!

Text: Even though the place was packed, we got great service and great food.  My thanks to the only server on tonight.  We could not have asked for a better one. . . and she was also taking care of a party with 12 people!

Text: I order and call them 3 times, I waited for 3 hours something and almost made me call the cops on them. Since last year or 2 years ago. But the older lady manager is better though. Those damn kids needs to be fired. I don't like the guy manager, trying to avoid my problem that I order. Ya, at the 2nd call, I have to reorder, it's pretty upsetting too. That's when my order went late, call 3rd time, told the guy manager, I will call the police, I feel like they robbing my money on my card, I almost call the cops when my order finally arrived at an 1 Hour something.
