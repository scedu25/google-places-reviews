Text: While the portion sizes were generous and the waitress was good, it was about the most tasteless food that I have ever had. The onion rings and the breaded mushrooms had no flavor and required ketchup or ranch to taste anything. The fries with my burger tasted like they had been frozen for too long and while I got the bacon cheeseburger, all that I could taste was the bacon. My companion thought the same thing. Will not go back.

Text: All their prices are about $1-$2 higher than what is listed on their current online menu, so that is a pleasant surprise when you go visit a restaurant for the first time.

Workers just stare at us before seating us. I have never been here, How am I supposed to know if I should just sit down or wait?

I ordered the French Dip Sandwich. I don't know what I expected but this thing was really bland. Was the meat boiled? There was just absolutely no flavor. Maybe a piece of swiss cheese would make it better? 

Probably would have rated a 3-4 if it weren't for the difference in menu prices. Don't have an online menu if you aren't going to have the same prices once I sit down in your place!

Text: Took forever to get the food. After we put our order in it was about an hour before food came out and it wasn't even busy. Food was horrible! Runny biscuits and gravy, greasy hash browns bacon was absolutely disgusting  (and I love bacon) I definitely will not be going back. They didn't even ask if everything was ok when we were about done with the meal. So disappointed. I try to stay local and support but not anymore!!
