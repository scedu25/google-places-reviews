Text: The food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't terribly good.  The service wasn't fantastic either.  Two little girls took our order and the main courses came before the appetizer. Also, we ordered white rice and they were out.  But, as previously stated, the food wasn't bad, the service was quick, and they did have fried rice instead of the white rice.  Overall, it wasn't the greatest, but if you're hungry from a day on the road like we were, it's a good place to have dinner.

Text: Simple setting, delicious food. I swear by the peanut chicken. Food is always freshly made and quality has not been lacking in the 10+ years they've been open.
