Text: When you pull into the parking lot you will see that it is full quite often, and that is because Oscars Classic Diner is such a fun place to go. When you walk in the door it feels like you stepped out of a time machine. The walls are ordained with all stars of the ages but locals are often entranced with photos of their home town from long ago.  If you must wait to be seated, you will more than likely enjoy the conversation, as people reminisce about the good old days. Then you will see a regular walking out the door and the entire staff says "bye, see you tomorrow." If pictures just don’t cut it, you will still feel like you jumped back in time when you see the booths, the bar, the jukebox, and don’t forget about the rotating pie display in the back just screaming at you to buy a slice of this “blast from the past” homemade pie, but you should try to food first. They have a huge selection for all ages and cravings. Breakfast items include Omelets that are served all day, to French toast, and if lunch is what your after then you might choose “The Love Me Tender chicken strips.” If you are there for a date night, “The Honeymooners for 2.” That comes with TWO 16Oz steaks, sides and a piece of pie for $36.99. When you get done eating your meal the pie display might not be calling you as much, but maybe the root beer float with push you over the edge of full to the brim. 
All in all, Oscars is a great place to go whether you are your, or young at heart.
