Fronteras Mexican Restaurant and Cantina
Rating: 5
Text: Was craving Mexican food and had never tried this place although it was recommended to me years ago. I just popped in for food to go but liked the fun inviting atmosphere so much I know I will go back and do eat in. Food was all very good, actually have generous enough portions that I will be having the other half tomorrow. Good salsa and the tortilla chips are so  light, crispy and thin. My favorite kind.

Text: All our family all like this.  The only negative is that they are usually very busy.  That speaks for itself; their food is good plus they have a bar.

Text: The first thing that hit me once I walked in the door was the warm, inviting atmosphere.  It didn't feel like a place where you sit down, eat, and leave.  It is clear that the staff wanted to set the restaurant up as a place to enjoy yourselves alongside some friends and have time to talk over good food.  The quality of the food was even better than I had expected, and I had heard good things from the family that took me.  The service was quick and I never felt like we were ignored.

Text: Prices online are all cheaper than on menu. Came here because we thought the prices were great online. However, we arrived and saw everything was a dollar more at least. 

Ordered 2 12oz margaritas, was given 2 20 oz's and charged for it even after bringing it up to our server. 

Online ValPak coupon says to redeem here for buy 1 get 1 meal half off. We presented the coupon and our server then tells us "Oh uh, it needs to be printed off." 
It does not state that on the coupon and you can clearly read it? What a cheap joke!

Oh and the chips and salsa is mediocre.
