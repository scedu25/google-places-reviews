Springfield's Incredible Pizza Company
Rating: 5
Text: A wide variety of good food: salad, pizza, pasta, hot dogs, desserts, including soft ice cream. I like the variety of pizza choices. Slices are small, but that size let's me sample more types of pizza. Of course, you can take as much food as you want and return as much as you want. 

Three areas (diner, family, cannot remember name of third) to sit when you eat. Diner area normally the most quiet if you want to talk. On Saturday, though, no where is quiet.

Lots for children of all ages to do, but you do have to pay. However, you can just eat.

Text: We visited for the first time this weekend with our grandsons (3 & 6). We all had a wonderful time! The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I personally loved the drive-in cafeteria!  The boys loved all of the games and rides!

Text: Best value for the unlimited food and great games!!! I can't believe that this kind of place exists here! Such a blessing finding this place. My entire family enjoyed every minute of our moment here! Money well spent!!! I love the go kart experience. All of the staff here are very accommodating and happy. This place is perfect! Their buffet selection of food are all fresh and newly cooked! Loved their pizzas especially their gluten free! Super yummy!

Text: Pros: Even though this place is staffed with mostly teenagers, I was EXTREMELY impressed with the service. We were there today 9/30/2017 from noon until 4:30 (so management if you're reading this, you've got some excellent kids working for you). They were all very helpful and very attentive. There's a huge variety of games, blows chucky cheese out of the water. Well worth the money especially for the laser tag and the jumping area. The go karts were a blast too! 

Cons: The food is horrible. I'm not a picky eater either. It was so bad that we had a small lunch (mostly salads after trying the pizza and various sides and not wanting to eat any of it) and then went out to dinner afterwards. Considering you're paying for a meal on top of the attractions and games, to me that was a huge blow. I would have rather paid less and not eaten.
