Text: I would like to say the club has a great view with plenty of room and a second level.  It has allot of potential for a great club in the making.

Text: Sweet little Buffet right on the water. the couple running the place was very attentive as was the staff. $12 breakfast buffet with custom-made egg dishes and Bloody Mary bar for five bucks a drink. Service was great food was delicious and well-priced we were able to load up and eat a lot before we went to Cedar Point.
