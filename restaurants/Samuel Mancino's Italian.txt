Text: Good food but for some reason never want to deliver. So if u don't mind driving to go pick up your purchase every time you order or even enjoy it being cold by the time they get to your house (if their 3 hour delivery timing is offered) which if it is you must be calling when no one there is getting text messages then please by all means it's definitely recommended!
