Red Ox Restaurant & Lounge

Text: Started with excellent service by our waiter Ryan , who was extremely accommodating by checking with the kitchen if we could get the dinner Special because we had not noticed that it was just a after four dinner special.  Food was absolutely delicious... and we would like to say it was some of the best service we have ever experienced in a long time. It is rare to have a waiter go above and beyond to take care of his guests!!!

Text: The food is good. The prices are great. GROUND ROUND hamburger in house with a generous serving of fries is 6.50. Come and see for your self. Great back room with a nostalgic bar. Great service! Steaks are delicious and reasonably priced. Catfish,shrimp and Alfredo is wonderful.  Cocktails are stellar!

Text: Classic burger was overcooked with no seasoning whatsoever.  I was charged $2.35 for about 4oz. of Pepsi.  Tables were dirty and coed restroom had urinal visble through the opened door.  One of the poorest restaurant experiences I have had.  I'll throw my money in  a ditch before eating there again!

Text: I had the ugly chicken dinner w broccoli cheese ?, baked potato and bread stick.  Lola had half rack of bbq ribs,  baked potato,  fresh asparagus. & bread stick.   Didnt like the stuff they put on the chicken chicken but thats my only complaint.  They get busy from 6 on but the service was great. Ya its a little pricey but well worth it. We were celebrating lolas birthday.  Ya i am late since her birthday is in April. Lol.
