Rube's Steakhouse - Waukee

Text: This is a great place to bring a group and/or out of town guests. It offers a unique atmosphere where you can grill your own steak, chicken, or seafood. You are able to choose your own meat to grill. If you're not used to grilling your own food it can be a little intimidating for your first visit, but you will get the hang of it quickly and have a lot of fun. This place also has great beer and wine selection. Dining here can get pricey, but it still offers an affordable dinner out if you watch what you choose for your cut of meat.

Text: A local recommended this place for good reason. I balked at first, why pay to cook my own steak I thought?  Well, quality of meats are superior, no need for fancy aging, this is just good fresh beef.  Unlimited sides and salads included in the price.  Fun to grill and chat with other patrons as well.
