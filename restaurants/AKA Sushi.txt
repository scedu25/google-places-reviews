AKA Sushi

Text: Most popular sushi in Jackson, so they move a lot of fresh product.  Great atmosphere.  They have a full bar and while the wine list is quite limited the wines they offer are good quality for the price offered.  It would be nice to have some high-end wine options.  The sushi chefs do a great job. Service is good.

Text: The service here is quite poor. The food deserves a solid 4*. We have dined here 3 times, and each time the service was upsetting. The gentleman who waited on us today seemed more interested in chatting with other staff. We waited so long to place our order that we almost got up and left. Our glasses remained empty until he brought our bill. When he brought our bill, he had placed it in the to-go box. How filthy! They seem to do a lot of carry-out business. I can see why. We will definitely not dine in again here. Each experience had some friendly treatment mixed with a large helping of rudeness. The wait for the food today was very reasonable, but they weren't especially busy.

Text: Great place for a quick but still tasty bite along the I-94. Very modern decor and interesting sitting layout. There was a very significant number of carry outs, phone was constantly ringing. I was there around 7pm. Very well priced. Really recommended.

Text: I ordered a simple roll and asked for it to just be wrapped in rice paper. The waitress and another employee stopped to ask if I wanted rice or soy paper and we had a discussion about the difference, I settled on rice paper. Anyway, the food came out and it was rolled in rice. I sent it back to be corrected and the waitress brought it right back out to me and said "we can't make sushi without the rice"  what?!?! Then how do I get it wrapped in just paper pretty much every other sushi place I've been to? Ugh
And - the spicy mayo is gross. Its just mayo.
