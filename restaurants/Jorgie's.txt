Text: Favorite place to go for a drink! Great service, great food! I'll admit that I don't eat here often, most times my visit is after work for an adult beverage. Although I wouldn't consider myself a "regular", I'm always treated as such by the bartender or wait staff. The couple times I have eaten here the food has been excellent. Have had the fish and chips and the pizza and was impressed by both. They are known for their pizza but the fried fish was the best I've had in the area. Their pizza is extra cheesy and the perfect amount of greasy. Great crust too. Great place for taking the family but just as great for adult fun later in evening! A must stop of you are in the area
