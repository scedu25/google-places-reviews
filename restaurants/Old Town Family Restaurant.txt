Text: One of my favorite places in town to eat. Never had anything that didn't taste good from there. My favorites are chicken strips, fries are awesome and their omelets are huge.  You won't walk out of this place still hungry,  their portions are huge

Text: Great food great prices. Super friendly staff very clean and cozy. The only reason for not returning is their regulars in the morning are very rude and judgmental people made the restaurant a 3 out of 10 to me.
