Text: This place has great options! Lots and lots of fresh food and tons of bread choices. Watch out around Thanksgiving when they do the Ultimate Turkey Bread which uses stuffing as an ingredient...the stuff is fantastic! I've always loved anything I've tried here and the staff is incredibly friendly. For me, the one negative is that there aren't great organic options. But I like this place a lot!

Text: Bought a cherry pie at the skips farmers market for my husbands birthday.  Crust and flavor were absolutely delicious, but it had a layer of undercooked tapioca in the filling.  Called the store to find out if it's supposed to be like that or if it was a mistake, and was told they do that to all of their pies to give it a little crunch.   Unfortunately we won't be buying pies here again because we are not a fan of the crunchy tapioca pearls ?everything else I've tried there has been very good.

Text: Did have good service when taking our order. The food preparation was slow. It was crowded. Took our breakfast burritos and sandwich to a park to eat. Small servings for the price. My vegetarian burrito tasted like unflavored mush. Did not finish it. My husband's sandwich was also awful.  No need to return.
