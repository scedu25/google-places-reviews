Callihan's American Pub & Grill

Text: The atmosphere is casual and easy. Food is very good and done well. Hostess was bright and cheerful. Both smoking and non smoking section. Music fitting but not overly loud. Both young, old and family. Our server wasn't rude but lacked enthusiasm for the job even though I left a nice tip. Only bad thing I can say about it. Maybe better next time because I will return.

Text: The food was good, but would have been great if there was some seasoning on anything...like salt & pepper before cooking would have made a huge difference. Next for people like me that had never been to your restaurant it would have been nice if your hostess would ask if we minded to set by the door going to the patio due to there was going to be a band playing. The band was good but too loud.  Oh well first meal I've ate out that literally we didn't talk because we couldn't hear each other.
