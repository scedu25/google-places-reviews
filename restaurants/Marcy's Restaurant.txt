Text: Great food! Friendly people! Reasonable prices!
Maybe should change up menu & definitely install some sound deadening materials. If there are more than a couple of tables, the noise is too much.

Text: Great food. Ribs fall off the bones. Potato was big and moist. Service was fast and great. Price was reasonable. Off the beaten path but worth the drive.

Text: Good food. Small place. Noisy. Need plants and some sound deading wall decor. Sound echos all over the place.
