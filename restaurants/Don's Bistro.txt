Don's Bistro
Rating: 2
Text: The food was microwaved in front of customers in styrofoam. It was poor quality and not even warm. Don was rude and barking at customers "you, what do you want to eat" pointing at people. It wasnt at all caring for a place that should be about helping people have a more tolerable experience at a hospital.

Text: More into their friends than they are their customers. Place would be amazing with new staff that actually had good customer service skills. Staff kinda trashy to be in a hospital.
