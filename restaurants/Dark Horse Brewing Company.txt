Text: Food was great and a cool atmosphere. Beer was also very tasty. I'm giving a 2 star because our waitress was awful. By far one of the worst we had in a long time. After our main course we ordered a cherry turnover. During the wait multiple other waitresses approached us and we informed them that we were fine and just waiting for the cherry turnover. After 30 minutes of waiting and still no turnover I approached one of the waitresses and asked about the status. She informed me that there was no turnover order placed. I told her that we were tired of waiting and just wanted to leave at that point. I didn't care for the way they run the waitresses. We had at least 3-4 different ones check on us at one point or another. Other than wasting at least 30 minutes of our life waiting for the non-existent turnover the experience was good.

Text: Super fun environment, cute, cozy, and packed. You can see the love for the place from employees and patrons alike. Beer selections is just ok, most things you can get in bushs or other out of town retailers. Service was great and multiple people checked to make sure we had everything.

Text: Great service! I had the mug club at the recommendation of the server. She was right, it was the best. They don't have a kids menu. Our kids enjoyed the elephant ear. I don't drink beer, but I heard it was good.

Text: I love the beer. The pizza is the best in town. Great place to hang out and have a good time with your friends.
