Text: I had high hopes for the diner. I heard they had the best pancakes in Jefferson a City. The pancakes were okay. The diner is family friendly and the service was good.

Text: Waiting for 15 minutes to be given menus and recognized, we were served dirty cups for our drinks with no straws or napkins, our server was rude and place is not very clean. Left after 30 minutes of waiting for a sandwich.

Text: Ratty decor. No veggie meat. OJ seems to have come from a condensed mix (and expensive for that).  My daughter says that the server looks like Miley Cyrus' big sister (this was meant as a compliment--she was very nice and helpful). Food was good, though, and the folks were nice.
