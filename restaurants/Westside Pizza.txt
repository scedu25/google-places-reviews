Westside Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Westside Pizza is a precious gem from the Westside of Sioux City. They've been around since 1978 & their food has unique taste, & is always delicious & on point! As a locally owned business, they have & continue to provide endless support to schools, athletics, & organizations around town. 
Their 80's commercial jingle still stands the test of time... "252-3864, Westside Pizza brings it to your door...Pizza, chicken, ribs & shrimp...we'll bring it to ya, just take your pick..." A great business, with dedicated people to back it up.

Text: It's 7/29/17 @6:26 pm I called for the first time to have pizza delivered..the lady on the phone was very unprofessional. I asked if there were any special all she said "uhh uhh" ?..when I finally ordered, gave my card info for her to charge she said" it'll be ready in 30/40 min" I saI'd "ok thank you" and she just hangs up RUDE! ..first and only time I order here..I hope the pizza is good because the service sucks!

Text: I have been buying pizza from them for over 30 years because they do not skimp on the toppings they load it on.

Text: Service was good and prompt, and the broasted chicken dinners are really good.
