Text: Go there and order some food, I guarantee you will be back with some other people to show them how good it is. Great food, top notch service and good prices! Also the menu is VERY extensive. I hardly ever give anything five stars, this restaurant deserves every one of them.

Text: Food was great, for American Chinese food. Cooler was broke again, so do not order a beer. Unless you like warm beer.
