Ernesto's Mexican Food
Rating: 4
Text: The food is okay, nothing mind blowing, but the meats were very high quality for a small town, and the vegetables were definitely fresh. Great atmosphere and staff as well. The prices are the only thing preventing five stars. 13$ for a steak chimichanga. Not 13$ quality.

Text: Good service and nice wait staff. Good food and medium prices (10-20 per dinner dish and they are large plates). Nice atmosphere with lots of families. Didn’t have to wait for a table Saturday during the dinner rush.

Text: Authentic Mexican food and it's great.  They have the very best chips and salsa of anywhere I've ever eaten - bar none.  Sometimes there is a waiting line but it moves pretty quickly.  Their service is second to none and food is brought to you in record time.  The staff are plentiful and are always pleasant and friendly.  The restaurant is clean and orderly.  There is also a bar there where you can enjoy your favorite drink or beer while waiting for a table.  The only thing I don't agree with about this place is that the wait staff pools the tips received and then divides it up at the end of the day.   In my opinion if you receive exceptional service and offer a sizeable tip, your waiter-waitress only receives a portion of it.  Seems to me that a waiter-waitress should receive all of the tip he/she has earned.  Nothing more, nothing less...  Try this place.  You'll be glad you did.   I am a local resident and customer and eat there often.

Text: The best mexican restaurant in Kansas. We always have to come here when we are back home visiting. Wish we could find a place like this where we currently live but have not had any luck yet.
