Text: This place is a diamond in the rough! Not very big, but the food is terrific! My favorite part is the sushi they offer on select nights. Freshly made while you wait. 

My go to Thai dish is standard Siam Pad Thai with chicken. They offer a wide range of Asian dishes as well as their Thai specialties.

Text: All the food is excellent but the sushi is over the top. Sushi is a bit slow but that isn't unusual. No alcohol but if you bring your own they don't charge a corkage fee. If you really want spicy you have to negotiate. The scale is 1 to 4. 4 is fine for little children.

Text: The food here is excellent.  The Tom Yum soup, pineapple fried rice, drunken noodles, sushi, pad Thai, all are favorites.  But we have never had a bad dish and have tried many.  The spiciness can vary sowmtimes but if you know that going in it's fine.  If you are sensitive to space at all order a level 1 and add spice at home to what you would like.  Their take out I'd fabulous.  It's presentation rivals a seated dinner presentation.
