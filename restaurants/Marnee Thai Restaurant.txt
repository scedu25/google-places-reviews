Marnee Thai Restaurant

Text: So, this here's a story all about how my rice got flipped, turned upside down. But not really upside down. First off, I love the location. Not even joking. It reminds me of this great Thai place I used to go to back when I was young. There only appeared to be one server, so you may imagine my surprise at how good service was. The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting. The food tasted spectacular. I got it as spicy as it comes but it wasn't enough, that's why it only gets four stars. Yes I know that's preference, but isn't that all a review is? 

Overall, a very good experience. If you like spicy food, try it first, but bring some chili oil just in case. Maybe some red pepper flake too.

Text: The service I got at this restaurant should NEVER happen to ANY customer ANYWHERE.

Today, October 21st 2017 was my first time at Marnee Thai.  We waited over 5 minutes before someone from the back came out.  We were told by a lady, that the server was not in yet and he is the only one who knows how to run the register.  She said we could wait and hopefully the server would be there any moment.  A few minutes later, a family of about 6 people came in.  The reviews are great and the menu looks so good...so we all stay.  AFTER 20 MINUTES OF WAITING, ALL OF US, 8 PEOPLE, DECIDED TO LEAVE.  As soon we get to the door (me and the other family) the pleasant lady comes out and says that the owner is coming and she can start on our order now.  So...we all came back in...because things happen, she was really pleasant, and we really were looking forward to the food. 

Soon after the lady took our order, the owner walked in and check on both tables.  Then the server came in shortly after.  From there the server, Kurt, a middle aged man is assisting us.  HIS SERVICE WAS MEDIOCRE AND TO TOP IT OFF HE SMELLED OF ALCOHOL.

 When our bill arrived I asked the server what can be done with the bill since we were waiting 20 minutes before someone serviced us. He said, “we don’t do that here”.  I proceeded to explain that as new customers, we should not have been waiting 20 minutes, however we decided to stay, and the best customer service thing to do is offer something, such as a discount on the bill, a free drink, a refill during the process, something.  Kurt said…” WHY DID YOU WAIT?...LIKE...WHY...WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?, WAS THE RESTAURANT EVEN OPEN WHEN YOU GOT THERE?”  After some back and forth he takes $3.50 drink off our bill, walks away irritated and tosses our bill on the table next to him.  The family at the other table, didn’t like one of their dishes because it was too salty, he becomes physically irritated again and just stands there looking at them with a face like “ I can’t believe this!”.  The customer explains the dish was not pleasant.  He comes back to both tables with new bills, acts very pleasant, saying thank you and acts so mannerful after being so rude.  I leave the restaurant and think...the food was great...but I will NEVER come back!  THE ISSUE WAS NOT THE BILL, THE ISSUE WAS ABOUT PRINCIPLE...CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE QUALITY OF FOOD.  The proper response should have been, “ I am sorry that you had to wait, and I appreciate that you decided to wait for us to serve you.  And because this was not a completely pleasant first experience let me talk to my manager/owner and see how we can recover this experience for you, or let me discount your bill.  NOPE..I HAD TO ARGUE FOR MY CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE.  

IT GETS 10X WORSE NOW.  So I sign my bill and we leave, I decide that I will go back and ask Kurt, the server, for the contact information of the owner.  When I go back there is an older couple sitting waiting to be served.  I get to the counter and ask Kurt for the contact information of the owner.  He says - you have to go online to the website to submit the issue and the owner will get it.  I state - I want the direct email of the owner.  He continuously refuses.  So I ask for the name of the owner.  HE STARES AT ME AND WALKS AWAY.  HE COMES BACK ANGRY, AND YELLS - YOU ARE ANNOYING AND A NUISANCE,  I TOOK THE DRINK OFF YOUR BILL, WHAT DO YOU WANT!  The couple behind me gasped so loud.  I tell him- ALL I WANT IS A PROPER CONTACT FOR THE OWNER BECAUSE YOUR SERVICE HAS BEEN POOR.  He yells again, YOU ARE A NUISANCE, I DEMAND THAT YOU LEAVE THIS RESTAURANT, IF YOU DON’T I WILL CALL THE POLICE.  YOU NEED TO LEAVE!.  *did I mention we happen to be black and Kurt happens to be white...* I AM CALLING THE POLICE RIGHT NOW, I AM CALLING THEM, YOU A REFUSING TO LEAVE, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL YOU TO LEAVE THIS RESTAURANT.

Text: General atmosphere nice. Food okay. Pad Thai had a ton of noodles, a bit of chicken and tofu--very over-priced at $14.  Soup (shrimp) not hot (temperature-wise) but a medium-spice on it was hot. Chicken Satay okay. Spotty drinking glasses. Ladies restroom okay but really could use a deep cleaning. Sadly, we won't come back again.
