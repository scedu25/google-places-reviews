Text: I make sure to stop here whenever I am driving across Iowa. Really great lunch food. Love their tomato soup and sandwiches. Friendly staff, large place with tons of seating. Highly suggest you avoid the fast food and travel a couple miles to eat at this great locally-owned spot. You will be happy you did!

Text: Food was great but maybe a bit overpriced. Service was unorganized and slow. I had to get up and ask for a refill on water and it took an hour from start to finish for a burger and soup

Text: Delicious food, I had the Kale Salad and the Sweet Potato and Black Bean burger; it did not fall short of amazing. Staff was very attentive and it seems like it's a great spot for lunch AND dinner

Text: The atmosphere was great, very modern aesthetic. There was a bit of a wait for the food, but that's to be expected at 7pm. The charcuterie board was phenomenal! The main course was good, but my steak was a bit under cooked. That was no issue though, I caught my waiter and informed him, and he took 1/2 off of my entree AND had another steak grilled for me. Great alcohol selection as well. Overall it was a great experience, my girlfriend and I will definitely be going back!

Text: Very slow service. Not worth the price. The steak was good, but wasn't much better than a steak from Applebees
