Text: Good staff, good food, good atmosphere. We sat down 3 minutes later we ordered drinks then ordered our dinner. I'm impressed with how many people were here and the waitress was fast. This was a good experience and we will be back.

Text: I would give zero stars if possible. Waited an hour for our food (just wings and a wrap). Asked why the food took so long and the answer was "well we had a party in the back". Being up front and communicating that the kitchen is behind goes a long ways but they didn't do that. My buffalo wings were overcooked and very dry. Very tough to chew. Plus my wife orders Cole slaw but they said they were out so she asked for fries instead... Never got em.
