Text: Had one of the best presentations ever here at a birthday dinner with family. Our chef/host was incredible! He was funny yet polite. I caught like 11 shrimp in my mouth when he tossed them - crazy!

Text: A very good Hibachi restraunt and cheap lunch options. Server was excellent and very friendly! Cook was a little quiet at first but became much more friendly before the service was over. Overall a good cheap fun option.

Text: Could be pretty good food, could use more seasoning, and maybe some optional hot peppers. The food was pretty bland. They did accommodate my nephews allergy to sit and sesame.
