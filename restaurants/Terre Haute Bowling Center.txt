Text: Great place for family fun! Strikers keeps the kids busy while my husband and I get to bowl a few games. The food is nice so we can snack while we are there.

Text: Very fun times here. It's not the cleanest place in town, but it makes up for it by being the one stop shop for fun.

Text: Cool combo of a bowling alley and a bounce house.  Not the fanciest bowling alley, but it was kinda interesting that they still had the retro CRT scoring system.  Decent looking bar/fast food area.
