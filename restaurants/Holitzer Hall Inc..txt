Text: I have just been down to the Holitzer Hall for its "new look" open house..Let me tell you it blew me away!...New Dance floor, upgraded furnishings and a new capacity of 300-320, I think. I already booked for April! lol..If you need a place for a reception or something, I would definately check this place out.
