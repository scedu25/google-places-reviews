Tavern At Coventry

Text: Good food! I went here for dinner and then again for lunch the next day. I had the sinful seafood pasta with garlic risotto the first night, very good and flavorful (I especially liked the risotto, which had a solid garlic flavor without being overpowering). I went back because someone ordered the prime rib and it looked good. So I tried that when I came back for lunch and was not disappointed, tender and juicy. I also tried the lemon meringue pie for dessert and it was tasty with a nice flaky crust. So, I had several random dishes from the menu and everything was good ?

Text: Good food. Large lunch portion. Service was a bit slow, but not overly so especially since a new waitress was training.
