Text: One of the most down to earth service and the food is always great.  I highly recommend it to anyone. Drink specials every day of the week. Daily food specials for lunch and dinner options.  The staff makes you feel like your part of the family.  Come to enjoy the food and atmosphere.

Text: Service was great, we had Jenna. Very sweet and kind. Down to earth. My steak was very good. Shrimp was little salty. Salad was good as well as home-made mashed potatoes loaded. Nice atmosphere and a Long island was only$6.
