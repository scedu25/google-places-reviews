Text: My husband and I went on a visit. We got there early and had time to kill so we decided to get something to eat. He said it's either McDonald's or Bonanza. I of course chose Bonanza. Hadn't seen one in years. We went in ordered our food plus the Buffet. I'm telling you, my mouth fell in love. I'm a picky eater. Everything I ate was amazing. When my steak and potato got there, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Everything was very good. I Loved it! I am definitely going to have to go back there again. The staff was very polite and the place was clean. It was Great!

Text: The steak was very choosy and fatty.  The salad bar was not kept up.  We have ate there several times and was always good but not this time
