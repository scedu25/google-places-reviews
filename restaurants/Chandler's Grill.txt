Text: I ordered the 8 oz sirloin medium rare and baked potato and it came with a house salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and had great taste and the service was top notch my server Amber was very pleasant and I asked if they had sweet tea she said no but I can make you some and the minute my glass was empty she was right there to fill it up she delivered A+ service. I can guarantee the next time I get this way I will be stopping back in here. Side note they can handle charter busses I brought in 26 people

Text: Clean restaurant, used to be a Bennigan's, so some of the menu looks similar.  I have been there a few times and the service is generally good.  The food needs some work.  The last time I was there I had spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs are probably the worst meatballs I have ever tasted.  It was like eating meat paste.  No seasoning or flavor at all.
