Text: Food was fairly good for the most part. Onion rings left a lot to be desired. Service was poor. Will go back, but hope we have a better experience.

Text: Overall just a terrible establishment with horrible food and even worse service. The manager Dustin, is very rude and not accommodating to customers having a bad dining experience. Will not be going back. Ever.

Text: Food was good, good beer selection.  I liked the seasoned fries.  Everyone was nice but the hostess seemed like she really did not want to be there.

Text: Food was good. Disappointed that my child was asked if she wanted a big kids meal when she ordered a kids meal. Of course she said yes. We were there on Tuesday, which the menu says is kids eat free day. Got the check and found out that didn't include the big kids meal - which ended up being almost $12! To top it off, drink wasn't included with the big kids meal like the menu said it was for a regular kids meal. This, a bill I was expecting to be about $15, ended up being closer to $30. This was our first and possibly last time eating here.
