Basil Thai At Urbana
Rating: 3
Text: 9 to 13 dollars a dish. I would advise ordering from the wall, not the menu. I got the pork chop with fried egg and I think it was pretty good. The pork was cut thinly but there were 2 cutlets. The small salad was nice and refreshing and the rice was warm and sticky. It's not amazing, but its pretty good.

Text: I love the vegetarian/vegan options although these are limited. Particularly, if you like spicy food, it is the place to be. They have a range from 1-6 "hot to insanely hot".

Text: They start cleaning the restaurant at 8:30, and it reeks with very strong detergent smell. To me food tastes terrible when the place smells like that.

Text: Overpriced. Not AUTHENTIC Pho. Go elsewhere for food. Kow Moo Dang drowned in red food dye which is actually a violation of FDA regulations.

Text: I love basil Thai. Make sure to check out their unpublished menu consisting of the pictures of food next to line. This is my go to spot when I want a good and filling meal with leftovers.
