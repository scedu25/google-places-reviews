Text: Fish and chips is good. Would have liked a little more cole slaw because it was tasty. 
Good beer selection and fun atmosphere.

Text: Grace was our waitress and she was top notch. We would give her an A++++  
It was about 9:20- 9:25pm when we were seated. The restaurant was not that busy.
About the time we thought we'd be getting our food our waitress was informed by the kitchen they were out of it. No problem at all we knew the waitress wasn't cooking the food. My wife had chicken wings which were good but my salmon sandwich was over cooked and dry. The other problem was we didn't receive our food until 10:35 pm. Our waitress even offered to pay for the meal they were out of. We said no. We found out all the food was taking at least an hour to come out for everyone.  We hadn't been there in a while and won't hurry back that's for sure.

Text: I visit this establishment frequently with coworkers and friends. The food is great for the whole family and if you just want a casual drink with friends, it's as quaint, comfortable, and relaxing as a neighborhood bar. I highly recommend it.
