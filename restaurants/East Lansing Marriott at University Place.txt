Text: I came here for a wedding and we got placed on a for away from the wedding party. The very courteous staff got us an available room on the same floor. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Also being able to hang out downstairs was nice for a wedding after party.

Text: The parking was easy and well lit for attending an evening event. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the sides and dessert, however the main dish served was dry. Overall good experience.

Text: Love the decoration and interior, but mostly the good was great. The best part was the food, had a graduation ceremony there and was completely blown away by the food. They had great selection and everything tasted fantastic. Would highly recommend for a wide variety of occasions from weddings to birthday parties.

Text: A little too expensive for what I was needing, also there was no fridge in the room. 
Watch out for the bed frame as well, easy to hit your shin on. Hah.
Otherwise nice location and great view, clean room with a good amount of space.
