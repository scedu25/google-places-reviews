Text: My girlfriend and I are in town for a wedding. She is an Alumni here at Mizzou. She suggested this place saying how good it was when she was in school so I wanted to treat her to a nice meal at one of her favorite places. Last night when we ate there it was a very unenjoyable experience. Our waitress was not very friendly and looked completely overwhelmed. After we ordered our food, we waited over an hour and had not gotten anything yet outside of a tiny bowl of soup. We had to pay for our beer and soup and leave which is to bad the food here looked really good but the service was horrible. Maybe try somewhere else. People at the bar got food that showed up well after our arrival and order :/

Text: Best Thai food I have ever had. We love this place and the serving sizes are huge. The atmosphere is great and the service is top-notch. My recommendation is the #2 (Drunken Noodles) at a 1 with pork. Also get the pork village rolls if you want a good appetizer.

Text: Our party of eight easily walked from Mizzou  Med into this attractive restaurant shortly after 11 on a Friday morning and received prompt, courteous, and friendly service; a variety of excellent Thai entrees; and upscale beverages -- all at reasonable prices.  The Elderberry Spritzer was thoroughly enjoyed by most of our group; craft beers by others.  The comfortable ambiance was appreciated by all.

Text: I really enjoy the food here, but I do think that the service takes too long even when they are not busy. I also dislike that they don't provide you with a lot of meat with a dish that it is supposed to come with. I always order extra chicken and it still seems like there is hardly any meat and they charge extra for wanting more.
