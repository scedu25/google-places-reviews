Text: Good atmosphere, good food.   I had the fish and chips.    They were obviously make fresh.    Lots of breading, but very good.   My friend enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage.

Text: The service here is pretty good and the kitchen is really quick. I got the big burger last time and it was awesome. It fell apart but it was delicious. The beer menu is also great with tons of unique options from all over. The only bad thing is that it gets incredibly loud inside on the weekends. The last two times I was there I could hardly hear my date. Sitting outside on the small patio is a better idea when the weather is nice.

Text: Great place for comfort food. Love the Irish stew and bangers and mash. Smoke cod dip and pretzel bites are good off the appetizer menu.

Service is sometimes horribly slow, other times top notch. (That's why the rating is a 4/5)

Text: One of my favorite restaurants in downtown Fort Wayne. The staff are always helpful, especially when it comes to picking out one of their many craft beers. The food is phenomenal, and I would highly recommend the Irish Breakfast and/or the Scotch Eggs.
