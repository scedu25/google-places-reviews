Text: My wife and I enjoy this little place and try to get there at least once a month. Their Friday special smoked prime rib is AWESOME. We've been coming here since we moved in just across the river a little over a year ago and have never had a bad meal. Service is good and the owner (who is one of the cooks) almost always makes his way through the dining area to check on everyone at least once while we're there. Prices are reasonable too.

Text: Staff is friendly and not afraid to give opinions on the food. My glass was almost never empty. Portions are huge for the price. Definitely a place to become a regular.

Text: For the most part is was a great time. Great service, good food. Mountain oysters were a little over cooked, but that happens from time to time at any restaurant.
