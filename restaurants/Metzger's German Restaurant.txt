Metzger's German Restaurant

Text: Went there two nights in a row. First night waited 15 minutes at the bar before I was served. A water! Waited another 10 minutes to get served. Two ladies next to me saw my frustration and said the service really isn’t so bad but the food would be worth it. Food was great as was the beer. Went back second night to see if anything changes...sat at bar for 10 minutes before I got a beer. A good 10 minutes passed and I left in frustration. So wanted it to be good because of how great people say it is. Disappointed

Text: Excellent in every way & the best (red) Rueben Ive ever had. Probably the most cozy ambience at a restaurant Ive known too...German clocks and items all over. I love how the booths have drapery for more privacy and sound barrier. Highly recommend.

Text: Good food, Excellent service, very nice decor. First time to visit this place today. Having lived in Germany for several years and enjoyed German food, it was a pleasant surprise to eat at Metzgers right here in Ann Arbor. Had a Zigeuner type Schnitzel with sauteed Onions and Mushrooms on top. Side dish of Beet salad and Potatoes. Food was quite good. Place was packed and if you ignore the 'strip mall' outside, once you get inside it has a European feel to it. Well done. Very friendly and attentive service.

Text: Tried it when visiting for work and couldn't wait to come back. The second time was as good as the first. The service was a little slow but every other thing was great! Great food! Great beer! Great atmosphere!

Text: I had the rouladen.. melts in your mouth with a decadent combination of flavors and textures.  Probably one of the top ten entrees I have ever had in my life.  Simply exquisite!
