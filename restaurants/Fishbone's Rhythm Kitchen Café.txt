Text: I've been to this location many times and never had a problem. I went there yesterday around 2pm for a late lunch with a friend. It wasn't busy and we were seated promptly. The waitress brought us water and said she would be back soon. About 10 minutes later, she comes back with some bread and says she will be right back to take our order. About 15 minutes later, she returns to our table to take our order. My friend had ordered soup to eat before our sushi order was done. We waited over 20 minutes just for a cup of soup!! Could not even find the waitress and had no idea where she was at. Finally, she brought the soup out and didn't even apologize for the long wait. Pretty rude if you ask me. The food also took forever, which was a simple small sushi order. When the waitress finally came running by our table, she didn't even stop to see how we were doing. I had to say excuse me to get her attention to order a drink. Horrible service!! The manager was even running around delivering her food to other tables and helping her out. It wasn't even busy! The food was OK, but could have been better. The sushi rolls were very sloppy and falling apart. I don't think I'll go there again anytime soon. They need to train their staff better and if they see someone struggling to keep up with tables when it's not even busy, give them some more help!! Take care of your customers.

Text: I prefer this location other than the Detroit location. I have never had to wait. Everything I walk in I'm always seated immediately. The staff is always kind. The food everything is so darn good. From their sushi to the gumbo. Nice location. Great place to relax and chill out at.

Text: Love this place. Good go-to place on the "Nautical Mile" (Jefferson between 9 and 10 Mile). Nice indoor bar, outdoor patio, happy hour specials, sushi, keno and big screens. They got it all for small or big gatherings. All kinds of dishes to suit every palette. Great staff and a good vibe keeps me coming back.

Text: Their table service was great as our waitress was very kind and personable. Each of the five people at my table had a different meal and they were ALL extremely delicious. Next time I go to Michigan, I absolutely HAVE to make sure I return here. Trust me, the price is WELL worth the service, quality, taste, and time!
