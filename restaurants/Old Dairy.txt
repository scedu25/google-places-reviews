Text: The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. The outside appearance of the restaurant may dissuade some people, but I urge them to go inside. The indoor atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxed. There are chairs and small tables as well as couches and larger tables for bigger groups. There is a shelf of games to occupy little children . The restaurant is very clean and decor is very nice. I love their omelets and cake deserts and apple cider in the winter!
