Text: I wish there were separate ratings for food and service. Food is yummy, service yucky. I would eat there more often if there service was half as good as the food.

Text: Not sure if this is normal service but this was our first experience: There were three people behind the bar when we walked in and not one of them greeted us or told us wether to seat ourselves. So we just seated ourselves and waited about ten minutes. Still not one employee acknowledged us. I have no problem waiting for good food or good service but an incompetent lack of manners loses my business. Off to Bel-Villa we go.
