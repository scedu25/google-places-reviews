Rating: 5
Text: A little pricey, but Worth every dime,Awesome experience, first time going, and would highly recommend. Reservations are best. Food is Awesome, best steak I've had, if you make reservations and want to watch some horse barrel racing, ask for that area. Very cool place

Text: No more pricey than any steakhouse. I tried the fried pickles. They were ok. The fried mushrooms were not good. The rolls that come with dinner are gross and burnt. The fried okra isn't very good. The green beans are bland. The chicken fried steak is awful. Not only that, the gravy tastes fake, even though the waitress claimed they make it from scratch. Also, they have gross Coke products instead of the much preferred Pepsi products. I might try it again, if I'm with others who want to go. I wouldn't come back on my own decision though. If something else tastes better at that time, I might increase my rating.

Text: My kids loved the fun atmosphere and the food was fantastic! The Bourbon glazed steak is amazing and the portions are awesome for the price, especially for the kiddos. We loved watching the horses. Fun for the whole family.

Text: Best steak house in the area.  Great service.  It does have an arena with animals, may cause allergy/asthma issues for some.  Does not smell like it though.
