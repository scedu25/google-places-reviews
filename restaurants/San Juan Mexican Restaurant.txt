San Juan Mexican Restaurant

Text: Fantastic place around the halfway mark to Denver. I ate there on the way there and the way back. Great salsa, great lunch specials and attentive service. I was most impressed by their "molcajete" dish. Served in the traditional dish and piled high with chorizo, grilled chicken and steak. One of the better entrees I've had at a Mexican restaurant. I loved the feel and the atmosphere. I would eat there often if I lived close.

Text: Came with a family of 16 (including 3 little kids) and they were very nice. The service was incredibly fast. Even faster than a typical restaurant with a small group.

Text: Great food quick service. Perfect late lunch spot, good pick compared to the low variety of restaurants. I had the chicken quesadilla, they had their own style for it!
