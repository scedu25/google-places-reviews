Text: I am rating this as a vegetarian.  I realize that this is a very popular place - it was packed on a Thursday evening.  But, there is almost nothing to eat for vegetarians.  I was with a group and so felt compelled to stay.  I think everyone else in the group was very happy with their meals, so if your are a meat eater, go for it!!  It is dark and noisy.  Lots of TVs for sports fans.
