Text: First time here and we will be back! Our server Abby did a great job running us through all of our options. We get to cook our own steaks! Great cuts to start with and I love to grill, what a great combo. My wife toasted the Texas toast on the grill as well. The everything was GREAT!! I highly recommend this to all travellers looking for "that" place

Text: I came with a business group not knowing what to expect but I was totally impressed with the quality of the beef, I had the porter house steak with mixed mushrooms and onions , I will be back with my family well worth a 5 hour drive the service was great worth every dollar .
