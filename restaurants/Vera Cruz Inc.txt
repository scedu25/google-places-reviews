Vera Cruz Inc

Text: We were pleasantly surprised by the food.  In small towns, restaurant options are. It always the case.  We have been coming to the lake for over 30 years and find very limited selection near our home. We decided to give this restaurant a try when the other Mexican restaurant in sunrise beach was closed.  I think I prefer Vera Cruz to that one and will definitely visit in the future. I had the super chimichanga, my husband had the shrimp cocktail- which he said was pretty spicy. The portions were definitely good for the price.  I liked the cheese dip and my kids appreciated that there were "no chunks" in it.  I also preferred the salsa over the other restaurant.

Text: This is my favorite local restaurant! The chips, dip, and salsa that are served for appetizer are absolutely awesome! My favorite is the fajitas, you can't go wrong with them. Go with a big appetite, portions are huge! Price is very reasonable.
