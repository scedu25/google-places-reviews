Best Burrito's

Text: Probably the best salsa within 50 miles of KC.  Great tacos and combination platters. The drink glasses are large and that is important to me, plus they will give you a to-go cup with a refill (tea/soda).  Fast friendly service and clean dining area.  They offer a buffet on Sunday's and are closed on Monday's.  Try the green hot sauce.  it doesn't seem to get a lot of business so it is usually easy to accommodate large groups of people due to the dining room layout.

Text: Very good tasting food. This is my favorite place to go to for mexican food. I love their salsa and their burritos are the best. They also give you plenty of food. If you leave hungry you must be crazy they give you huge amounts of food.
