Text: I hadn't been here in a few years so seeing the new look was nice. The atmosphere was cool. The food is a bit over priced in comparison to the portion you receive. $12 for the Shrimp Avocado quesadilla which was the size of half a taco was ridiculous. Some how the waitress added a glass of wine to our bill but claimed she didn't know how it got on there. The drinks are great and moderately priced.
