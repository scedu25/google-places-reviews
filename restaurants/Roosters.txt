Text: Savannah was our waitress tonight. She is one of the better waitresses weve had in a long time. And the new manager, Blair is awesome. She went above and beyond to make sure our time here was enjoyable. We may just start coming back here again! Excellent service tonight!

Text: 3 stars for the service we recieved, 4 starts for the decent food and price. I heard some complains about their pet policy. I have pets so not trying to be crued, but we go out to eat food not smell your stinky animal. Keep your pets at home unless it's a service animal.
