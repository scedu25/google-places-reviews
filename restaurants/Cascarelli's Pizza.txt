Text: This may have been the best pizza I've ever had.  Crust was flaky and equally as yummy as the very generous amount of toppings.

Text: Best pizza in West Michigan. Their house salad with their in-house roasted peanuts is fantastic. Awesome tap handles, friendly service, in a laid back setting.
