Text: The fries were room temperature and stale.  Maybe yesterday's leftovers?  Yuk.  

Had to wait to place my order.  Stocking water bottles is more important.   

Received my order, where's my shake?  Ah yes, again, stocking water bottles is more important.

Text: Johnny Rockets always serves food that was cooked previously and by folks who would rather be doing something else. Same experience where ever I go. One of the worst good experiences there is.
