Text: I'm a gluten free person and the food was delicious! I ordered the Greek wrap without the wrap and the Hippie Hash on the side which was wonderful! I love red quinoa. A small town gem. My husband had the Philly cheese steak and said it was delicious.

Text: This was a spontaneous stop on our way back from hiking Rock House in Hocking Hills. We were a large group - four adults and eight children. They were able to accommodate us without difficulty at 1 p.m. on Saturday. The atmosphere was relaxed but charming and the service was excellent.

We sat outside, which I highly recommend. They have a beautiful garden outside and there were climbing vines all over the patio railing. The food was very good, offering typical American fare and some good variations on those but also including several healthier options including a black bean burger. Several choices for kids including fresh fruit. I had the cusabi chicken salad sandwich. We would definitely return the next time we're in the area.

Text: Two words. Hippy Hash. It's truly a culinary masterpiece and so I ordered two. The chicken salad sandwich was tasty as well along with another appetizer that I can't remember right now and I'll come back later to edit in. The decor reminds me of a cozy home and the deck is enormous with plenty of room for outdoor seating. Our waitress was cool and relaxed and I enjoyed every minute. Stop here for lunch on your way out of Hocking and you won't regret it

Text: Convenient location on the edge of the Hocking hills. Have eaten lunch here a few times over the past few years and have always been happy. The Philly steak sandwich is delicious. The Reuben could use a little more meat. Good cheesecake.
