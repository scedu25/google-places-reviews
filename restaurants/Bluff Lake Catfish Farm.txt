Text: There is a wait! If you hate waiting then simply pass this place over and don't leave a nasty review. However, I hate waits, but it IS WORTH THE WAIT, if you know this in advance. We get there early and the wait is minimal. The fish is great! Just don't come if you mind a wait. I'm surprised at the number of people that posted bad reviews because of waiting. Most of the positive reviews mention having to wait. When you walk into a place and it is completely full and there are 40 people or so waiting then you know two things: It is a GOOD place because the number of people there waiting, and there WILL be a wait for you, as well as all of the people in front of you. Quit complaining about waiting. It's a fact. Deal with it.

Text: Catfish on Friday, Haddock on Saturday.  The wait can be long,  but worth the wait! While you wait, there are great views outside, and lots of friendly cats to hang out with.

Text: Been coming here since the early 80s
tonight will be our last visit.
Waited 2 hrs went to hand in our pager and leave and they sat us immediately.
Our waitress was pointed away from our table to wait on 2 other tables after 1st stopping at our table. Service was poor.
I realize they will not miss our business but I have spent my last $$$ at Bluff Lake

Text: Bluff Lake is a family favourite. We go here often and invite as many people to go with us as we can. They have a large indoor and outdoor waiting area and bar. Arrive early or you will have to wait for at least an hour. The special on Saturday is fried haddock and Friday is Chicken and catfish. All the food is good and the price is right. It is a Northeast Iowa institution.

Text: We went on a Sunday afternoon and had good service and didn't have a wait to get seated. The food was good and the scenery was amazing.
