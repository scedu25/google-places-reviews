Text: Love this local fondue restaurant!  The owner was so wonderful- really made it a great experience.  Our server Parker was attentive and friendly.   Portions were a bit small, but we still left feeling full.  Desert was delicious- we scraped the pot clean!

Text: It does cost a pretty penny, but you also get a lot for the money. It's a fun time and the food is delicious, great to go with a small group of friends.

Text: Me and my boyfriend went to try Café Fondue for my birthday and it wasn't a good experience for us at all. When we went inside there was about 2 tables with people and it was fairly empty for a Friday night. The waiter was very kind but the food was awful. They brought out salad for us and it was clearly store bought bagged salad that was clearly old because the edges of the lettuce were brown. The meat they brought out was not clean. They served my chicken and it was coated with flower instead of being clean and fresh. Seemed as if they coated the chicken with flower and put it away. The desert was maybe the best thing they served. I expected a nice experience, to be able to go to a fondue spot that was closer but I could I have went to Gejas in Chicago instead and spent the extra money for the better quality. Café fondue was cheaper but it was a rip off.  It was not worth the money or time.
