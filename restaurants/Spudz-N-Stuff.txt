Text: Today was my first visit to Spudz'N'Stuff. The food was quite tasty, BUT I like to read a book when I eat out and I couldn't do this. It took both hands to keep the container from sliding all over the tray. I don't like it when paying you are asked to tip. I really didn't see that the service warranted a tip. Will I go back? I don't really know. I just don't like having to hold my food container down while trying to eat.

Text: 7/20UPDATE: Ordered 2gyros and 2spuds and it took 2hrs to get it.  They made it right on the check.  Ordered same thing 2 weeks ago and the gyros had cabbage instead of lettuce.  Called and spoke to owner.  He said my acct would be credited the full amnt.  Tried ordering today and was told the credit isn't there.  The employee said she would check w/owner.  She calls me back and said he didn't remember.  I told her to tell him to f@#$ off.

Text: Loves Spudz-N-Stuff! I've been coming here since they first open when I was at USI. Anytime I come through Evansville I stop and pick up a couple buffalo chicken spuds.
