Text: Went with the family to celebrate Mom's birthday. The server was very friendly and accommodating. From the alligator appetizer and bowl of gumbo to the fresh oysters and myriad of fish and shrimp dishes the food was delicious and well prepared. I will definitely go again.

Text: I went for the company. I'm not big on seafood, but for a Saturday night it was great!  Expect a wait. We were told an hour and a half, it only took about 45 mins for a table of 7.  NOT everything will be hot if you have a large party, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to have you leave happy.
