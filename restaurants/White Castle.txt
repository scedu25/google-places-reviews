Text: The dining area almost always looks like a tornado of 5 year olds went through and got to throw and play with whatever they wanted!  The wait is always much longer than i have had at literally any other white castle... Last,  but not least,  i hope you don't get a craving at 3 or 4 am for those overly slimy little burgers... You guessed it,  they are NOT open 24/7 like EVERY other,  typical White Castle!
