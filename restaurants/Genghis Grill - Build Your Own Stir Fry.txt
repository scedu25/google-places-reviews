Text: Free appetizer for my birthday. I picked a new chicken one they offered. It was a meal all by itself! I was very pleasantly surprised when they brought out a BIG bowl filled with about 6-8 huge Bib lettuce leafs and about 1 1/2-2 cups of the chicken vegetable mixture in a sauce that had you begging for more. The waitress talked with me for about 5 minutes or so giving tips. If you go to the east location, Douglas and Rock, ask for Yanni; she is awesome. Going back and bringing my husband.

Text: The food is good overall. Would of given it 5 stars if it had lower prices, a clean buffet floor and to go plates for your leftovers. Unlike other Mongolian restaurants where you pay for a buffet this place is a one time serve by size of plate. Meh ?

Text: Has to be the most unprofessional restaurant i have ever been in, im sure the franchise would be very upset with how they run this place.. We now understand why it was so dead on the busiest hour of the day. 
Was a very awkward feeling the whole time..

Text: I don't understand why people use Mongolian King name and named Mongolian good? I don't see any good from this place and can't even find it. They don't have non of real Mongolian foods at all.i eat real Mongolian food everyday. They never mix noodle and rice hehehe. They better change their name asap.
