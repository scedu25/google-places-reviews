Text: My mom suggested this restaurant after looking on the Trip Advisor website for a place to eat and seeing that it was highly rated. The place doesn't look like much, but don't let that stop you. It was authentic, delicious, and the people are incredibly friendly. It will be our go-to restaurant everytime we are in Marshall now. Highly recommend!
