Text: We love this place. The food is awesome and the service is great. I love sitting at the sushi bar and talking to the server. He does such a wonderful job with the food. We come here at least once a month.

Text: The hibachi grill is awesome.  All the chefs are extremely funny and put on a great show.  Worth the extra money to watch them!

Text: Good food, no wait on a weekend. Really big servings so we were able to share a meal but after we were served we did wait a while before we ever saw our waiter to get our bill

Text: I love going to hibachi restaurants but this was the worst I've ever been to by a lot. The only food I enjoyed was the salad. I absolutely love fried rice but I could only eat like 4 bites of it after drowning it in the mediocre yum yum sauce. The chef we had was very boring and made the food as quick as possible before leaving. Little to no entertainment. I was extremely disappointed with the entire experience
