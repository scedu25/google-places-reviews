Text: Went for Valentines Day last year, will go again.  The food, staff and atmosphere are great.  This is a family owned and operated small town business, not a chain - so they aren't open 7 days a week.  Usually Wed. thru Sat. BUT it's well worth it.  Authentic dishes and Laura's homemade desserts are wonderful!

Text: Place is in serious need of a remodel. Servers are excellent! Food is good as you'll get it Madisonville, not sure if that's a complement or not. Overall if your looking for a decent place to eat and are not willing to travel then give it a go.

Text: This is one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. I'm a big time food snob and not easy to please - I loved this restaurant. It is fantastic, I can't wait to go back when I'm in Madisonville.
