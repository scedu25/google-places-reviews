Text: This place is amazing. Great food for a really reasonable price. Everything is made from scratch and tastes so fresh and flavorful. I don't know how I'm gonna go back to regular Chinese after this.

Text: The best Thai food you can get in town. Emerald, Red and yellow curry is the best. There's one more dish that I can't remember the name, it's something "Pho Kan xyz" which is spicy and good!
If you're trying this restaurant for the first time I would recommend you to go for the lunch special items.
