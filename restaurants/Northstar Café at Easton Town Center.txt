Northstar Café at Easton Town Center

Text: The food is great. the service is good, for the business model (order at a counter and they deliver it to your table. get your own drinks). The 5 star is not given because the prices are Manhattan prices. I live in C-Bus and have been to Manhattan many times. Easton is great, but can't justify Manhattan prices.

Text: This is the Pad Thai - $14 before tax, but they gave me a free meal card, so it was free ? This was - no doubt - the best Pad Thai I have ever had. It makes me feel like the steep price is well warranted! Everything tastes so fresh, healthy, and just....PERFECT! It is a tad spicy, but not too overbearing. I've eaten like 1/4 of the entree before taking this picture... I was not going to leave a review, but this place definitely deserves it.

Text: Great food with lots of healthy options.  Price range for an entree is about $12-$20. They have amazing cookies!

Text: I ordered the mushroom frittata. It had more grease than anything. It was nasty. I usually come for dinner, which is always great. I will be going to Panera a few doors down for breakfast from now on.

Text: After avoiding this place for a year and a half because my friend told me they just had a bunch of girly food, my wife and so finally went, and are glad we did.  We want that year and a half back! The food is just great and we have yet to be disappointed. The Northstar Burger is amazing, as well as the Buddha Bowl, fish Sandwhich, and salads. Portions are fair. The place is always busy, but that is because it is some of the best food at Easton at this price.
