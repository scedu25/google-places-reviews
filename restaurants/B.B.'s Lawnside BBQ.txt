Text: Food is delicious. Music was even better! Amazing entertainment, even on a Sunday evening. Food is slightly overpriced, especially considering it’s all served from plastic or styrofoam cups & containers. Definitely a dive joint worth checking out ??

Text: Here's the thing... I don't have ANYTHING bad to say about this place. The venue is great, the service was great, the food wasn't bad by any means, but it was just... okay. It didn't blow me out of the water or anything. Nothing bad to say about it, and I do recommend it to everyone, but maybe it's just my palate. I'm not dissatisfied at all though!

Text: Great music, great food and a great time!  Drop by on Saturday afternoon for the weekly blues and jazz jam where some of KC's finest musicians will pop in.  Mama Ray will show you a good time while you grab a late lunch and enjoy the music and atmosphere.  Definitely a KC experience you MUST try!

Text: I know everyone has their favorite, but this is my favorite BBQ spot. Great food. Great live music. Great prices. Get the BBQ nachos for an appetizer and the burnt ends platter for dinner.
