Text: Chili is great!  They will give you a sample to make sure it matches your taste. Pork tenderloin is huge and great! Service is outstanding!

Double hot fudge Sunday needs to be shared!

Text: A Chicago area favorite for decades. The Morris location is almost hidden away. We were specifically looking for it and drove past it twice. 
The interior is a great 1950's throwback. The chili is as good as ever and the ice cream is just wonderful. 
I'm just glad to see a Chicago tradition this far out in the suburbs!

Text: Just a good small hometown place. Awesome chili with beef or turkey options. The 'taste of Mexico ' plate, with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, black olives, and the chili, and corn chips surrounding the plate is real good. Decent prices too.

Text: Friendly and the chili was really good. Cheeseburger and hot dog was great as well.  :)

Text: On our way to Iowa, stopped in Morris for gas and lunch... Stopped here based off of Google reviews and were NOT disappointed!! Chili was excellent both alone and on fries, and also had hands-down the best key lime ice cream ever. When we drive back through in a few weeks, I'm coming just for that!
