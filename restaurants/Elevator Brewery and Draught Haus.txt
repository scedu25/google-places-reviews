Elevator Brewery and Draught Haus
Rating: 2
Text: We visited Elevator this weekend.  Reservations were for 6:15pm. We were seated quickly,  ordered beer and our food.  Beer was great,  and the place was beautiful.  My husband ordered the crab cakes and I had the Oscar walleye.  We did not receive our food until 7:10. When it arrived neither of our meals were hot.  One piece of my fish was warmish,  the other room temp at best.  The crab cakes came with broccoli and wild rice.
 The rice was great,  but the broccoli was practically not cooked.  It was so crunchy and not seasoned at all.  We did not have time to send back any of the food as we were seeing a show at 8pm. Our bill was $68. We left feeling disappointed.  I've never spent so much on such mediocre food.  I would return again only to have appetizers and beer.

Text: Meat was okay for the surf and turf. Fun experience "cooking it myself" but I'd beware of the temperature of the stone going down. If you have a sensitive stomach, cook the seafood side by side with the meat. The oils also spray everywhere vs a japanese/Korean barbecue experience. I was only here after a work trip but not sure if I'll choose it again

Text: First of all, their house-brewed beer selection is varied, fresh, and dependably delicious. Their food has been phenomenal every time I've been in here. I just recently had the opportunity to have a full dinner here during restaurant week, and the calamari and beef tenderloin were fantastic. I could eat the calamari all day long. 

Even beyond the food, the space itself is amazing---I love the big semi circular windows and mosaic tile on the way in, and the bar itself inside is done up in all sorts of beautiful detail with wood and marble. The place is deceptively small-looking from the street---it's actually pretty huge on the inside and has a great patio space set off from the sidewalk by a hedge and wall.

Text: My husband and I made reservations at Elevator based on the reviews. Unfortunately,  our experience was quite different from that of those posting reviews.... The place is beautiful.  However,  service and food are mediocre  and the overall experience was not worth the price.  My husband's pork chop was undercooked,  my tenderloin was unimaginative, and the mashed potatoes and asparagus tasteless. Go for drinks, if you are looking for a nice-looking place, but skip the meal.

Text: One of my favorite places to go and have drinks while playing pool.  Older crowd. Place has a lot of history. Awesome food but a tad pricey.
