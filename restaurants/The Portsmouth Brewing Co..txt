Text: Great food and beer and atmosphere. Given its a bar this makes more since but men's room needed cleaning, updating probably would have made it look better,  when I was there. So 3 stars 5 if you don't need to use the bathroom

Text: Excellent food, tasty beers, really cool atmosphere.  This place is awesome.  Good music... outdoor seating.  A very thoughtful remodeling of an obviously historic building.  Just loved it here.

We ordered 2 pizzas and a burger.  One of the pizzas came 15 minutes after the rest of the order came.  Pizzas we're good, but the order should have all come out together.   Burger was well-done, overcooked, and dry.
