Text: Delicious. Clearly among the best places to eat in the area. Traffic was insane, parking next to impossible - thank god for valet... $5 well spent. Wine list is voluminous and beer selection was unspectacular at best. They did have a local IPA which I enjoyed. The food delicious. Bread and oil before my meal was dangerously good. Service was spot on during a crazy busy evening rush. Overall a great experience and meal... As expected for the price.

Text: I thought the food was just okay. We sat outside and the ambiance was very nice. Weather was perfect and there were two guys playing acoustic guitar, providing a very nice environment. The goat cheese cheesecake was excellent, although the filets we're just okay. I'd definitely give them another try but I'll probably go for something else on the menu.

Text: Have never had anything bad here. The shrimp and sausage rigatoni is AMAZING. The brunch is great. Can't think of a better place in downtown Dublin.

Text: I love this place.  Outstanding food.  A really great patio and the service is usually top notch.  A little pricier but you get what you pay for.
