Text: Loved the experience. Had Elephant Ride cocktail. Loved it. 
Recommend the appetizers -
1. Spicy chicken
2. Lamb chops

Burnt garlic rice and Schezwan rice are a must try... Would definitely go all the way to Chicago from Detroit just to taste the rest of the delicacies on their menu. Very friendly and cheerful staff.

Update : still great food but they shouldn't ignore the ambience.ours wasn't the only booth that need attention.
Chipped plates a big turn off
