Text: Always hits the spot! And a great healthier alternative to the crappy fast food east of town. Love her desserts and if you ever have a need for a caterer, Robyn is the bomb!!

Text: Absolutely love The Bistro. I've loved everything I've ever eaten there. The gluten free butter brickle brownies are to die for. Such a cute little restaurant. If you're lucky you'll get to hear owner Robyn play her ukulele while you're there :) Best restaurant in Story City, hands down.

Text: Loved everything about this unique and delightful place. My sandwich was delicious and fresh. I had pasta salad and a butterbrickle brownie for dessert. I was told the brownies are a secret recipe. The owner, robyn is warm and friendly and also played the ukulele for us since I was celebrating my birthday. I will be going back.

Text: Love eating at The Bistro. The atmosphere is quaint and being able to sit outside between the spring and fall months is an added bonus. The food is always fresh and delicious and the desserts are amazing.
