Text: This place was great. Half our party got breakfast and half got lunch. The grilled club was delicious even though we were apprehensive at first. Eggs for breakfast were cooked perfectly, although hash browns weren't that good. Rueben was very good and fried chicken tenders plate was good too. Salad bar was good. Service was good. Would stop here again on our travels.

Text: An unexpected delight in the middle of nowhere! Conveniently located and the breakfast was so delicious. The biscuits are HUGE and fluffy. Eggs cooked exactly to order and the bacon soooo good.
