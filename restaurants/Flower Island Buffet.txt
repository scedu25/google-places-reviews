Flower Island Buffet
Rating: 1
Text: Drove from Omaha for dinner and entertainment on 9/11/17. Food was horrible, service was terrible. It was so bad we didn't tip nor did I eat my food, just paid, left and drove straight back to Omaha. Ended up playing at Ameristar and told one of the hosts at Ameristar and they comped 3 buffets for a future visit just for coming. Flower Island was a complete waste of time and money! I will attempt to post a pictures of our completely cold and undercooked food.

Text: The food was all cold. The food quality was about like a hospital. The best part was the frozen cheesecake. Even the ice cream had no flavor.

Text: We had to wait in line for more than an hour and the food was really salty. Also the tables and dishes weren't very clean. the only good thing was the ice cream.
