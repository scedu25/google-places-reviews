Text: I absolutely loved this place! GREAT fish sandwich with ff! They even have a fried bologna sandwich! Being right on the river with outside seating doesn't get any better. 
This place is family owned and operated! 
Love supporting local family owned places and they make it a joy to do so here. Cant wait to return! :)?

Text: Good job to the staff for handling today's 200+ people group that came in.   The service was pretty good all things considered.  My burger and fries sure was good.

Text: Been to the Dock the last two weekends. Hoping more of you will find out they are open, otherwise I'm going to need a "Trike" to haul my big belly in! I love this place and ride our M/C 140 miles round trip, so we can chill right down on the quiet river front next to the water. PLUS the food is GOOD!
