The Onion Pub & Brewery
Rating: 2
Text: A while back would have given a 4 star rating but the last couple of times it seemed the quality of food and service has diminished. 
It is a nice place, however it seems the ambiance has changed and the food is a bit pricey for the quality. Based on last visit, had better tasting food from local chain establishments for half the price.
Okay beer and wine selection but really nothing unique from other places. Even the appetizer menu changed to contain basic nacho type fare that can be had elsewhere. 
There is optional valet parking but unsure why other than restaurant is in Barrington.
There is nothing wrong with eating here but there are so many other similar establishments that provide better value and equal or greater quality, it might be a while before we go back.

Text: I love this spot! A beautiful way to spend a long afternoon, their deck & views are fabulous, the beer flights were fun, the food was top notch....will return soon for sure. And I love the owner's mission of giving back to the community. Great local, family-owned business to support!
