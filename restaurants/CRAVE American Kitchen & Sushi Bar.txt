CRAVE American Kitchen & Sushi Bar
Rating: 5
Text: The food here was amazing. If you don't know what you want and just want a good meal this is the place. They have pasta, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, sushi, steak, and more. I did not expect the food to be that good because of the vast variety but we were not disappointed. Definitely try Crave!!

Text: We had been to Crave for dinner a few times in the last year, but had not been for Sunday Brunch for a long time. The service, food, and atmosphere were excellent all around. Our server Rodney was friendly, professional, and attentive. From the brunch menu, we had the fried donut holes, Lemon Blueberry Stuffed French Toast, and Creole Scramble. Our order came out quickly, hot and well prepared. 

Highly recommended, especially if you're looking for somewhere to eat in the Midtown Crossing/Mutual of Omaha area.

It's also worth noting the kids eat free all day on Sunday.

Text: Awesome place very honest manager. I praise his honesty. My wife lost her wallet and we called to report it missing to the restaurant. We were called next morning to be informed they got it. Food is great and all waitresses and waiters are very nice. Luv the place

Text: We stopped in for dinner a few nights ago, and it was great! I'm usually the type to see a meal as more of a necessity than a leisure activity, but our server (Rodney) went above and beyond to make sure that we had a good time! He definitely showed us the best service in Omaha, but I'm from a little bit of everywhere and I'd even venture to say that he showed us the best service I've ever seen, anywhere. We will definitely be back as long as he works there! If you stop by, DEFINITELY ask for him!
