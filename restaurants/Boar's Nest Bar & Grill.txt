Boar's Nest Bar & Grill
Rating: 5
Text: Great place for family gathering. We've had a several outing during the last couple of years, management & staff very hospitable and accommodating. Call for reservations, take your choice of large indoor room or outside under a shelter. Boars Nest personnel make your stay wonderful. You will like it, and repeat business. Good variety of food choices, many drink choices (alcoholic/non-alcoholic) and you will not go home hungry (unless you just don't eat, lol).

Text: I had herd decent things about boar's nest. I must say I was impressed with the size of the place. However I was less than impressed with the way the kitchen appeared as I walked past... As though the appliances hadn't been cleaned in months. I did order some food just an appetizer and I found it was frozen food being served nothing with any flavor other than maybe freezer burn. I have a feeling this place could be amazing but not the way it's going now.

Text: Good atmosphere, excellent service, very friendly. Had the fried tenderloin, great taste and nice size portions. If there was a down side to our visit would be the fries, just average. I will visit again.
