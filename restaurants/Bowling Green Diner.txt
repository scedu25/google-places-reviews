Text: I would like to eat at this diner but my family and I never will until they are completely Non-Smoking.  I just completed my annual call to them but unfortunately they still allow smoking.  We cannot risk allergic reactions and other health consequences.

Text: Great place, very good food at an affordable price, and nice atmosphere. Be warned, they only accept cash or check - no cards! Other than that, this place is perfect for a nice breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
