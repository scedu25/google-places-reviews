El Mexicano Restaurant

Text: Entrance foyer gets crowded during lunch people are trying to pay as others are trying to get seated from the same girl. They should push the seating 4 feet back and the entrance would be more welcoming. I ordered a chicken breast  dish which was a butterflied to ensure it is cooked thoroughly. The texture was rubber and I could tell it was the solution injected type. Salt water solution.  Waiter could barely communicate in English and was pushy to get my order. This was my first and last visit.

Text: The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the room itself is fantastic. The high ceilings make it feel so much larger. The food was delicious and there are several options for any type of eater. The lay out when you first walk in is cramped if the restaurant is busy, but manageable. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I would recommend stopping in!

Text: Having grown up in Southern California, I was used to excellent, authentic Mexican food. I've lived in the Midwest for 20 years and eaten at doses of restaurants. This is the only Mexican restaurant that meets my high standards. 
I love the food and the team at El Mexicano!
