Jack's Steak House

Text: Sure is a lot of mixed reviews. My review is 5 ?. Had the best breakfast omlet 2 days ago, and thought I would stop for lunch today. Had the shrimp Alfredo and it was great. They could cut the amount of  sauce down by 1/3 Rd but tasted great. 
Definitely be back in a couple days for breakfast. Thanks

Text: Food was excellent. Don't judge a book by its cover. Outside looks like your average bar, the inside has a diner atmosphere but the food is top notch. Staff very friendly as well. Prices reasonable.

Text: Disgusting. When you read reviews you don't want to believe them, so you ignore it and try it yourself. Believe every bad review on here. Worst dining experience I have ever had. Broad of a waitress was rude and snobby. If you want something you have to flag them down and ask exactly what you want. "Well... yes... if my drink is empty I would like it refilled." 
On top of service and atmosphere... food was disgusting. 
Highly recommend you avoid this restaurant.
