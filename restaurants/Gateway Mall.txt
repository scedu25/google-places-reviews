Gateway Mall
Rating: 4
Text: Overall a good mall. It is completely indoors so good place to shop year round, good food court, and I believe they are finally filling a vacant restaurant space with a wood fired pizza restaurant. Couple good restaurants and shops in the nearby parking lots

Text: I like Gateway mall, it's a good place to tool around and just relax.  I prefer Southpoint if I had to choose between the two mall in town but that's just because I prefer the outdoor venue.  Gateway is a good all indoor mall.

Text: Plenty of stores.  Always some sort of renovations being made.  Decent food court selection with lots of seating.  Good family restroom. Could use more restroom locations throughout the mall.

Text: Fun mall for as far as malls go. It's a single-story building with lots of mainstream shops, nothing unique though. I love going and finding trinkets and things in the mall and then going and find it cheaper somewhere else (Walmart, eBay, Amazon)
