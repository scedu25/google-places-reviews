Text: If I could give zero stars I would! My family and I came here for my birthday and there was no one in the waiting room. And there were plenty of tables but we were told at least a 30
Min wait. I said never mind because it was already late. My dad said let's wait he went in and was told only a few minutes. We got seated quickly somehow even after I was told a 30 minute wait. We sat at the table forever no one acknowledged us 15 mins went by and another person was sat next to us and helped immediately. This place is terribly unorganized and didn't really care that they were losing business. We come here at least once a week and won't be back!!!!

Text: Delicious onion soup. Super yummy Hawaiian pizza on multigrain thin crust. Sweet, funny waitress. Lots of children, and louder music, so on the noisy side. Cute decor.

Text: I really enjoy their food 90% of the time. Every now and then though the food I get delivered is cold or incorrect or obviously hastily or carelessly thrown together. I.E., most of the toppings are on one side of the pizza or the cheese has either slid off a few of the edge pieces or they were not covered with cheese to begin with. The delivery drivers have always been super cool and polite though. Inside the store for dine in purposes I have had a much more mixed results experience as far as wait staff. Probably 70/30 good/ bad on service. Food is a little pricey for what it is as well I feel but I do really like it when it's done right.

Text: We were seated as soon as we arrived. We ordered the spinach rondos for an appetizer. They were awesome! Really cheesy. I got a house salad and a chicken hoagie. The fat free Italian is really good. You can't tell it's fat free. The chicken hoagie wasn't so good. The bun had a cardboard taste to it. I've never eaten cardboard, but I imagine that's how it would taste. My sister had her usual, traditional with extra cheese. She absolutely loves it. I would like to see the quality of the food go up, and not just the prices.

Text: Love the food. Pizza is the best. Service can be a little spotty but over all a good stop.
