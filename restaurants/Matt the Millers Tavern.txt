Text: It's perfectly fine. The shrimp and grits are good. 

Weirdly busy at non-lunch times. Make reservations well in advance of you want brunch (which again is fine but not really worth making reservations for).

Text: Great food and generous portions. Would say they are fairly priced as well. Had the 14oz NY Strip with the garlic butter l and I was very impressed. "The Miller" Burger is MASSIVE so be warned lol.
Good selection of brew as well. We all had a great time and the waitress was awesome! Will be coming back.

Text: The food here is delicious and the restaurant has a cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere. The restaurant is pricey (yet worth it) which I why I have only been here a few times. My most memorable meals were the steak dinner and the pretzel appetizer. SO GOOD. I definitely recommend this restaurant!

Text: Food average. Waitress was a low talker. Could not even hear what she said. Until the bill came. Let just say when you credit card is charged different than bill  no reason to go back . Especially since you talk to them about it and they said they would fix it. I don't care if it only cents . They never did. So now I change my Stars to one. Look at your bank statements people. Because they put in wrong about.
