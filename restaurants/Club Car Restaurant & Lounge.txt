Text: Fresh ingredients and buns along with some of the best (and properly cooked to my taste) burgers in town. 
Intimate and warm atmosphere.
Prices were very reasonable, most entrees and burgers are $10-$13!

Text: Always quick service. Great happy hour. Delicious food. Club Car is that local favorite you just keep going back to. 

I'm a big fan of their burgers. Between the grind and their seasoning - it's a real treat.
