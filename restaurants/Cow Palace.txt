Text: Great food, great ice cream and great service. Definitely two thumbs up for me. I've been going to the Cow Palace since I was a little kid. Great atmosphere and reasonably priced. Hand scooped ice cream for milkshakes, thick and delicious! A must go when in the area.

Text: Great food. Service sucks. They are the slowest I have ever seen in my life. For a restaurant they are very rude! I am so disappointed been coming here for years! Went down hill in the last two years!!!!!

Text: We had a waitress, Andrea, that seems perturbed that we were there. We ordered a chicken sandwich that was full of gristle with tomatoes that were almost white (in peak tomato season) and iceberg lettuce. My daughter is a vegetarian and asked if the black bean soup had meat in it, which Andrea replied, "I don't know" and walked away. It came out about ten minutes later and had meat in it so my daughter just ate fries for lunch.

Text: Ice cream was really good but the hotdog I had was subpar. Old style rustic joint with comfort food and nice staff

Text: Good local place for a bite. They have an excellent selection of hand dipped ice cream and their shake are the best.
