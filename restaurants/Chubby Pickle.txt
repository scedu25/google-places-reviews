Text: Worth a visit!  Not much from the outside but lunch (grilled cheese, corned beef sandwich, side salad, and PIE) was fresh and the staff was friendly.

Text: The food was good. I was slightly sad that I didn't get a whole pickle with my sandwich, considering the name of the restaurant. However, it was really good.
