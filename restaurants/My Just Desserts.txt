Text: Always a good place for sandwich and dessert. This place is crowded and runs out of food but everything they have is delicious.
Menu is on a chalkboard and as food runs out they wipe it off the menu.

Text: Nostalgic! Reminds me of the whistle stop cafe in Fried Green Tomatoes! The Rhubarb cobbler is the best. Your little shop is loved.
