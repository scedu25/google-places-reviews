Text: Coming at 4-4:30pm is ideal. Any time later prepare to wait for about an hour for seating but it is quite worth it. Sandwiches are phenomenal, fries, calamari, fried oysters, are also exquisite. Good wine selection. Overall a great place for either a casual night out or a graduation celebration. If you've got Subpar visual acuity beware because it's dark inside.

Text: This place is like a small Cheers. Everyone is a regular and knows everyone. As a visitor it was fun to watch the interactions and they we're friendly to me. Food was good also. Wish I had a place near me with this kind of atmosphere.

Text: By far the best restaurant in Columbia. I'd say that this place needs to be on one of the food shows, but then it would only get busier than it already is. Prices are unbeatable, great liqueur prices, decent beer selection, live piano, and amazing food. I have tried every dingle item on the menu and can honestly say most of it is the best I have ever had. If you are in the mood for a sandwich, the chicken salad is out of this world, by far the best I have ever had. I did not even order this until about the second year of me going here, but I get it almost ever time now. Green pepper rings and the tuna, pesto, feta are two more that are amazing. Half the other restaurants in Columbia are mimicking Murrays now with their own TPF sandwich, but at double the cost. This honestly is one of three restaurants in the city you need to go to.
