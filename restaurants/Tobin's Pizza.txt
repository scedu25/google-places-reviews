Text: very nice evening out in comfortable family friendly setting.   pizza was excellent.  nice to have a variety of salad dressings and each in its own bottle as we ordered.  salads were good and nice portions.   will be back for fried chicken also, as this is one of few places in area that can be counted on for nice crispy fried chicken.  wait staff attentive and friendly.

Text: I was greeted at the door with a big welcoming smile. This was followed by a delicious plate of homemade spaghetti with a wonderful rich meaty red sauce. I was so impressed with the spaghetti that I decided to try their signature pizza. Mama Mia, just delicious. From the beginning the service was impeccable and the restaurants environment was quiet and charming.

Text: As locals, this is our favorite pizza place in town. Owner, Moe, always comes around to say hello and ask how your meal is. The decor is a little kitschy, but it adds to the ambiance of a local family owned restaurant. Get the large  thin crust "combo" pizza + the small one wrapped up to take home. It's great reheated in the oven the next day.

Text: Very good pizza! The buck stretcher is a great deal with one large pizza at regular price and the same small pizza for one dollar! Recommend!

Text: Chicken is always cooked the same. Very crispy outside and tender inside.  Best ham and pineapple pizza in town!
