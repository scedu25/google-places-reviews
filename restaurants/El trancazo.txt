Text: I had a wonderful lunch with two of my friends. It was Taco Tuesday and the tacos are delicious! We also tried a trio plate that had an enchilada,chili relleno and a tamal. Great prices, really good food and good service! I am looking forward to eating here again.

Text: Drove across town 3 times and not a soul there! Open for 2hrs and door locked all lights on. Wouldn't know if food is good or nasty. Can't even go in during business hours. Once two other couples pulled up and left due to the door being locked!
