Text: I came in about 12:40 am. I'm the only customer. I understand the night crew has to cleanup if there are no customers. The cook was trying to mop or swept the floor. Never bother to wash his hands and made me a barbeque grill chicken sandwich. Probably they don't know anything about cross contamination... Did I eat it? No. I walked back to my truck and put it in the trash, but loves coffee was the best.

Text: Stopped at about 1:30 pm on a Monday, passing through with the truck. Not enough employees, not organized. Order was missing an item,good thing we looked. tried the new spicy chicken tenders. Dreadful, lukewarm. Ate part of them dipped in ranch..Worried that I will regret it.
