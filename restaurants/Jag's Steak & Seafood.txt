Text: Food was fabulous! My husband and I were there to celebrate my husband's birthday. He had requested a table by the fireplace when he called in to place the reservation. When we arrived we were seated where we had to walk though the serving station and was not seated by a fireplace. In fact, there wasn't even a fireplace in that room!  Atmosphere was great until a large party of 10 were seated in that small room. Noise level was deafening. In fact, I believe that several in that party needed hearing aids, because they were screaming at each other. Also, manager came to our table telling us congratulations on our anniversary. We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday!!! Hope they can get there act together!

Text: We ate at Jag's while in the area for vacation.  My son has life threatening food allergies to dairy and nuts, so eating out while away from home is challenging to say the least.  I called ahead to see if they could accommodate our special dietary needs.   The manager got on the phone with me and assured me they could take care of us.  So, we ate there.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience.   Service was extraordinary.   Multiple people were involved in making sure all of my son's foods were free of his allergens.  They gladly reassured him when he questioned them about his food being allergy friendly (he is paranoid about eating out-afraid of having to use the Epi pen and go to the hospital).  He ate everything and had no problems.   Food was delicious!  We ate here every night while in town because of our fabulous experience.   Would recommend Jag's to anyone, especially people with food allergies!

Text: Amazing food and excellent service!  The camalot chicken is it if this world.  The Friday night buffets are a great way to sample the cuisine.
