Text: My husband and I were greeted and seated promptly. Our server, Tracy was friendly. We waited over an hour for our food. We were told there was a bridal party that was causing the delay. My husband's pop was completely flat so I asked to exchange it. It took over 20min to get another. The garlic toast was so overwhelming with the garlic and the second loaf we received was stale and the butter was rock hard. My salad, that didn't come with the extra ranch I asked for, was terrible. The dressing had the consistency of water. My baked potato was small and cold. We both had the prime rib and it was nothing but fat. My entire plate was covered with it. The only edible thing on my plate was the potato salad. Very disappointing! I could've spent $1 on a McDonald's burger instead of $70 & it would have been more enjoyable! We will never go back.

Text: Great prime rib the service was very well done. The server even allowed us to split a prime rib meal with our two sons. Which worked out wonderfully.

Text: We just stopped on our way to Cincinnati. As a waitress at a steakhouse, I have to say the food and service was excellent. Lauren was outstanding and everything was delicious. We will stop next time we are in the area. As for the negative comments about price in other reviews, you get what you pay for and our experience was worth every dime. Thank you again Lauren.

Text: Excellent food! Excellent service! We had Kirsten who was being trained and she did awesome! This place is not a chain restaurant and is in an old barn! Decor is barn and farm related interior lighting is on the darker side! I highly recommend!

Text: We had the prime rib and sea scallops. Both entrees were excellent along with the fresh bread, great salad, relish Susan, and delicious garlic bread.
