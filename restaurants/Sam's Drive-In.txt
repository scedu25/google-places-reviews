Text: Good service and good food with the traditional drive-in feel. The car shows they host occasionally are really cool. The only thing that could use work is the furniture and tables inside have some wear and damage.

Text: Food is slow, bland, and greasy. Come for the ice cream! They have a huge selection of soft ice cream flavors, sundaes, and flurries.

Text: first let me say we arrived here about 5 mins before closing and they still helped us out. you can see the cooks faces in the back saying now they come in, don't they know we are closing. We didn't know they were closing but the cashier was very patient with us and took our order like we had plenty of time. our meals came out on time and was very good. no issues and they stayed over to cook our food. I'm sure they had to stay and cook but they all have lives after work like every other young teenager.

Text: Overpriced everything that takes way too long to get. Wow...and that's if you can even get someone to take your order. Watched some poor guy wait 25 minutes to get 2 tacos. What a joke. Horrible management.
