Text: The food is great, service is good. The manager is fantastic. He’s very much the hustle around, hands on type, which is nice to notice in a restaurant manager.

Text: Our First bad experience at the flat top grill happened tonight, and they messed up our 6 bowls twice. Although mangament did the right thing and gave us a reduced rate, the manger also gave us a bunch of attitude since she reported that she cooked it herself. Since you as a customer select the items yourself to stir fry along, with the specific sauces, you know exactly what yours and what isn't. Your name is on a wood stick even so I don't have an idea how it's even possible to mess it up??? Anyhow, I will be back and hope this was just a bad night at a regularly nice place to eat. Besides it all, our waitress was great and pleasant throughout it all..manager however could take some lessons from the staff on how to treat their customers...signed someone who doesn't usually complain.

Text: Been here often...usually get the seafood protein (shrimp and scallops) made into soup using large quantity of cilantro, peanut sauce and teriyaki sauce with red chili sauce for heat. Dine outside, if possible. Excellent experience. Inside is too loud...
