EdgeWild Restaurant & Winery

Text: Had lunch here with a colleague on Friday .  The food was decent.   I had the special which was a Cajun style pasta.  Portion was decent.  Colleague had a steak.   Portion was tiny.  Luckily I didn't  pay for the meal because it was unnecessarily expensive.  

Worst was the service.  The hosted seemed distracted by our presence and the waitress had the personality of a telephone pole.

I'm all for spending money on a quality meal.  I'd recommend you go elsewhere to find eclecticism that is real, not forced and the help is pleasant and enjoys their job.

Text: We are frequent visitors and have been for years.  From date nights, to girls nights to family dinners, Edgewilde never disappoints!  The kids options are huge and my favorite is the grouper tacos.  Don’t miss their signature French Fries with a fabulous dipping sauce!

Text: I should have written a review a while ago. We have been going to Edgewild for the past 3 years or so, and we have had a great experience every time. Service has been great, food is awesome, and the wine club membership is totally worth it. Not to mention, the fire islands dinners are amazing!

Text: The food was very good. The service was ok. There was a musician during most of our dinner who was terrible. We were expecting a more upscale experience so that was disappointing since we were celebrating our anniversary.
