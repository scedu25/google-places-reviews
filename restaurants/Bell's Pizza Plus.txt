Text: They gotta great deal for sandwiches most nights of the weeks and their pie is a cheese lovers dream. I eat there every time I'm home. They have awesome Wings which I get most Wednesday nights for wing Wednesday. Love this place. I'd take it over chain pizza like pizza hut every time

Text: Found near identical replicas of Indiana Beach tacos here without having to pay for admission! Everything from pizza, catfish, perch, hot dogs and appetizers, to elephant ears and ice cream! Friendly and cozy!

Text: The food is definitely not worth getting off the highway. The tacos were less than average and their cheese pizza was pretty bad too. The staff was nice and friendly though.

Text: May not be as big as pizza hut or Arni's but the have great prices and a lot of food to choose from. Such as wings, ice cream, burgers, hotdogs, and of course pizza. They also sell cinnamon doughballs. Mostly quiet and a nice place to eat and chat with friends and family without the crowd of bigger restaurants. Really nice staff. Amazingly convenient hours. Plenty of seats, including booths. And buffalo cheese pizza. Would recommend that you visit here to have a nice time.
