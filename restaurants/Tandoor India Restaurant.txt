Text: I've been coming here for more than 20 years.  I just enjoyed a dish of Saag Chole.  Yum...  The service is friendly.  Food is great.  Prices are very reasonable.  I have never had a problem.  I love this place! They are the first Indian Restaurant in Cincinnati, too.

Text: Best authentic Indian food anywhere in the Cincinnati area! Delicious buffet with lots of variety, tandoori chicken is tender and juicy, channa masala, mushroom mater, cabbage, and dahl is so flavorful with perfect blends of spices, and hot naan fresh from the oven! The atmosphere is clean, quaint and pleasing, and Varsha and her Family are very nice, friendly people, dedicated to serving their many customers delicious Indian cuisine! Dinner menu is incredibly good as well, with a large variety of appetizers, entrees, breads and sides, all carefully prepared to perfection according to your spice level preference!

Text: Worst restaurant ever went and so the prices. It's an American Indian restaurant don't ever dare to try. If you are a South Indian and love spicy food then this is not it! They dont even know how to make Tandoori ? When it comes to biriyani its just mixed vegetable rice with uncooked chicken!
