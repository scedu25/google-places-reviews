Rancho Grande Mexican Restaurant

Text: Sometimes you've got to forget the food and appreciate the experience. Decent meals are forgotten within a day of eating them. But truly horrific, once in a lifetime bad meals should be cherished. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no culinary master, and I don't claim to have an expert palette, but I know what ketchup tastes like. So imagine my confusion when my bean burrito came out smothered in a mysterious red sauce that I quickly identified as coming directly from a Heinz bottle. Bits of shredded mozorella had been lightly melted via a microwave to complete the Mexican food eating experience that's rivaled only by the concoctions stoned college kids whip up in dorm rooms and regret seconds after tasting it. My wife's experience was slightly better than mine, and she insisted her food wasn't horrific. High praise indeed. My second star is for the service. They were very nice to us, but I suspect their smiles were more devious than kindly. They were Latino after all, and I'm sure they know they're not serving authentic Mexican food. Joke's on me, I guess.

Text: This place is a mess. If you like this place because it serves "Mexican" food you must think Taco Bell comes from the heart of Mexico City. Their beef tacos are hamburger flavoring on store bought taco shells. You could do better by just going to the store and buying "tacos-in-a-box". Just head West about three blocks there is a KFC/TB.
