Rustic Oak Cabin Steakhouse
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed in the hotel next to the Rustic Oak this past week for our honeymoon.  We ate at this place twice!  The food was SO good!  The service was fantastic.  And I must say the people and the overall atmosphere here just felt so homey.  If you are ever in the area, this is a must!! You won't regret it at all!

Text: Always, ALWAYS!! GREAT food, and great service too!! Highly recommended, I drive many miles to eat here. Truly like an old cabin in the woods, with all the critters on the wall.

Text: They were amazing. Let us in when we were a couple minutes after closing. Catfish was delicious. You could make a meal out of the sides. And the soda was huge. Definitely going back as much as possible during our trip!
