Text: My pizza tastes like flour. I flipped it over and the bottom is more flour than crust. my complaint was only with the food. The driver was nice.  I ordered a two topping pizza and the first bites were just cheese. There weren't enough toppings to cover the pizza. The sauce and crust are good and there is potential but the final product was inedible garbage

Text: Shakespeares is a very good Place to get pizza in Columbia.  The wait is kind of long. We waited an hour for two pizzas and people that ordered after us got their pizza before us. I had to pay two quarters for a one quarter credit on the racing game.

Text: Best pizza in town hands down. I'm a pizza snob originally from Chicago. I'm not saying there's pizza I don't like, but I will get political about who's pizza is good or the best. And in my opinion, they wear gold. Service has always been good. In fact great, friendly service. There was a time I asked if they could put a Monday night football game on instead of the blues hockey game that nobody in the restaurant was watching. The bloke told me no he was kinda watching it. No big deal I still had a great dining experience as always.
