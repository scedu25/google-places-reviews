Olive Garden Italian Restaurant

Text: Had a very nice meal.
Our server was exceptional. Unfortunately I didn't get his name.
The food was presented piping hot. When we requested for our soup to be done in a special way, they accommodated the request without issue.
We never were left for too long by ourselves.
The restaurant itself was very clean.
They had a sample of one of their drinks at the front to try.
Would recommend this location.

Text: Practically got pushed out the door. Maybe they need to hire people who can stay til 10 pm that they close. Got here at 8:30, waitress always rushed away before I could ask for anything,  I also underdtand everyone has a life and a family to get to after work, but this was a little much.

Text: Our server last night must have been new and never ate at a restaurant before!  After taking our drink order (water) she wanted to know if we wanted desert...replied we'd like to eat dinner first...placed our order and asked if we wanted salad and bread sticks (thought they both came with dinner)...while eating asked how we were paying...explained with a gift card & cash...still eating she returns asking for gift card......don't understand why this waitress was on her own....definitely needed a lot more training!!!!

Text: It was a Friday night at 7 and they weren't staffed I guess? Our wait wasn't horrible, they said 25minutes,  but it was about 15. Staff was nice, food was typical Olive Garden. Decor was outdated, like 90s Olive Garden warp lol Cranberry Moscow Mule was awesome! The steak gorgonzola linguini was a miss for me!
