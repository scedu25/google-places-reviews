Text: Food was great and she got it out super fast! Came in with my kids and tied my dog up outside. She was very nice to my kids and told us we could put our dog inside the beer garden area and she sent her grandson out with cold water for her. Her grandsons were sorting barrier for her to make jam in the corner and lots of sweet people around. Great atmosphere!
