deSha's American Tavern-Cincinnati

Text: Very disappointing.  Just left one in Cincinnati. Ordered the house burger and fries with lemonade.  Took one bite and burger tasted frozen as did fries. Covered my plate with my napkin. Asked waitress to simply take it off the bill. She stood there and flipped up the napkin off of my plate and whisked it away and said I'll see what I can do. About 10 minutes later she brought back the bill and never said anything. When we looked at the bill she did not taking the burger off of our tab. Again she kept herself busy and we had to wait another 5 to 8 minutes before she came over to the table. I got so frustrated and angry I walked away. My wife apparently confronted her and said we asked  you to please take this off the bill. And she said I couldn't do anything. So my wife said I'm not going to pay for something we didn't eat that's not right I'm going to give you $30 and take off the price of the burger and that's it and walked away. She was extremely rude. We never been treated so poorly...we're very frustrated bcuz we used to go there very often. I would not waste your time. Their food used to be much better than what it is today. Just so disappointing it's average and not worth the cost.
