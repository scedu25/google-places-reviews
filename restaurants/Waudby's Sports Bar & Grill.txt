Text: Waud bys Sports Bar and Grill me and my friend Tom visited here I don't know is like a month or two ago and we ate there and they have a really really good food I really like their fries and I really like their hamburgers and their drinks they also have the good beer on tap and liquor also it is in an older style building so it's like going back into the times you know where I would actually eat at an old Saloon you know an old type of 1900 style building which is really cool the authenticity of the experience is really fun and the people there are really fun to meet so I would highly recommend eating here and drinking here LOL

Text: Used to be much nicer when the bar was circular in shape. Pretty standard small town bar and grill. The owner should visit a few socal/Fla beach pubs to get an idea of what a good bar is all about. Think HB Cali or Daytona Fl.
