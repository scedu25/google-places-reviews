Text: Great service. Huge beer selection. Wings are good, burgers are super, but the pretzels are phenomenal! But, you never let the glass go empty. Huge busy bar, but you always have their attention. Thanks y'all! Happy Halloweenie!

Text: Great place to go with friends to try beers from around the world as well as the country. Very extensive beer list and a pretty decent menu to boot

Text: Food was good, beer was good, atmosphere was good, our service was not. We waited an hour for our food order to not be placed. We ordered a comped appetizer to share that I ended up paying for and had to hunt down the waitress just to pay. We were stuck there for 3 hours, mostly waiting, not a great experience.

Text: Want to wait around for 20 minutes and the closest thing to service you get is be told "I'll be right back" repeatedly? Not even get water? This is the perfect place for you! I'm glad they have a giant selection of beer but it's a pity they don't have the time to let you try them.

Text: Good experience. Had the Marseilles Wallace and was very good. Suprising heat for a Philly cheese. Service was slightly slow but it looked like they were training. Good atmosphere and really enjoyed the music playing.
