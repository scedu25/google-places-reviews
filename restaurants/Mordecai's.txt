Text: My first ever visit was yesterday at lunch for my birthday. We started with a blooming onion (excellent!) Then I had a salad from the bar (also excellent) and the biggest and best frog legs I have ever had, for the main course! We had ALOT of really good food to take home all for $40. We will definitely be back! Plus our server was great!

Text: Food is awesome, atmosphere fantastic, service good, but the owners stiffed a friend of mine who babysat for them for a month ($100 a week for 4 weeks) and never got paid. They wouldn't like a dine and dash at their restaurant but cheated an elderly widow. If you don't care about character, just good food, great place to go.

Text: Visited with a friend. Good, friendly service and great food. I've always been satified there. The buffet looked so good but we weren't that hungry. Next time....
