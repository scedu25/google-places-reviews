Shiloh Steakhouse
Rating: 4
Text: I feel so sorry for those who have bad experiences here. I do not care for the 'roadhouse' atmosphere so head to the back, bar area. I have experienced fantastic burgers but have become a fan of the catfish sandwich.  My wife and I just can not eat the amount of food generally offered at restaurants. We can split and enjoy the catfish sandwich with a generous glass of wine for a reasonable price and go home well satisfied.  This has become a monthly routine. Drink responsibly!.

Text: Decent food and service. Very similar to other roadhouse-style establishments. Great for steaks. Other popular items are the grilled chicken salad and Shiloh burger. Family friendly. Not the best service, but adequate.

We ordered the sirlion tips, they were fair. They don't seem to be as good as they used to be.

They have the best ranch EVER!
