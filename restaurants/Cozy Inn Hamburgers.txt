Text: Good sliders. Seasoned waffle fries were hot and crispy. Wait time was a bit longer than fast food but shorter than sit-down restaurants.  A bit pricey, but (like *buck's), it's about the atmosphere. Adding cheese to your sliders is definitely overpriced at $0.25 per quarter slice, so I would suggest skipping it (I couldn't taste it anyway). We will probably be back (my son who doesn't like burgers that well really liked his sliders), but I will order differently next time.

Text: Great sliders!  Reminded me of Krystal's but with a much cozier feel and without the fast food taste.  They definitely use real meat.  Fresh taste and great onions!

Text: Overpriced, long wait, mediocre burgers, and soggy fries. Probably better to eat from there while inebriated.
