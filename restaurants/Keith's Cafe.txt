Text: Won't take debit cards, cash only. That's not good when you travel. Food is just average. Not much seating and bathroom is horrible.

Text: Great steaks, delicious tenderloins, and their burgers are the best I've ever had. Now, the hand made French fries are without peer. They are art. They are a reason to live. They are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. 
The prices are very reasonable and the staff is pleasant and attentive.

Text: A great place to grab a homemade meal. Even during the lunch rush, I was served quickly and waited on often. Heads up: they DO NOT take credit or debit cards, cash ONLY.
