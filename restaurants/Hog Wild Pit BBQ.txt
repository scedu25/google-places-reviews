Text: Delicious! This location was pretty small. Eating here is more of a messy kind of picnic feel. So if you're wanting crystal plates and candlelight you're in the wrong place! Everything is served on Styrofoam and it really gives it that classic cookout feel.

Text: Solidly average. Stingy with sauce in drive through. Unlimited sauce inside. I swear one day I'm just going to go in and grab a bottle off a table and walk out.
