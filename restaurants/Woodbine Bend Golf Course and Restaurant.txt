Woodbine Bend Golf Course and Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: I admit I was going to give it 4 stars but for this area there's either Woodbine or the Galena Territory and considering how much cheaper Woodbine is I like it!  Sure there's a few other courses. I'll review them later though and personally plan to stick with Woodbine and the Territory.

Text: Beautifully maintained course, and visually awesome. There are several blind shots throughout the course and I would respectfully suggest a more detailed scorecard, especially for fairway and green side bunker locations.
