The Sherman

Text: We stopped by here on our way home from Cindy and it was fabulous!  It was a 150 yr old building that had been remodeled, and they did a beautiful job.  A lot of the original wood work is still there.  The service was great and the food was more than amazing (we got the salmon dinner and kale salad)!  Plus, we were in and out of there in an hour.  We would definitely recommend this place if your driving down 74 looking for a great place to eat!

Text: We were here for the Oktoberfest festival. It was a good time with good food. You could tell it was their first year though so I'm hoping they'll work out the kinks. I would like to come back and try the restaurant proper because I always grew up hearing about The Sherman House and never got to try it.

Text: The food was excellent and the remodel is beautiful.  The service was very slow.  Could have drank four cups of coffee while waiting on the second cup.  Two plates were brought out and waited several minutes before the third was delivered.  This girl definitely needs a retrain.

Text: I tried three times to obtain a copy of my receipt for my stay at The Sherman, including once upon departure, once over the phone with a receptionist, and once over the phone with the manager who I asked for directly. This has delayed my business expense reimbursement. I do not recommend The Sherman for business travel.
