Text: We went in around 5pm so almost all the food was super fresh and it always tastes better that way. The watress was very attentive and made sure are table was always clear of empty plates. For the price it has a pretty good selection of food. Over all it was a good dinning experience.

Text: Food on the buffet lines were cold and dried out, the waitress had to be asked to refill my ice tea e en though she was posted near my table. After being there all of 10 minutes she then brings the check to our table as if to hint to us that it was time for us to go, even though we were still eating so she started to sweep the floor right near our table kicking up dust and trash up on our table. We left unimpressed and hungry!

Text: My favorite local Chinese restaurant. Good food. All you can eat buffet for less than $10. They also have soft serve ice cream and many other desserts included. A great value !!

Text: The food on their all you can eat buffet was hard and you could tell it had been there for awhile.  We got there at 5:15/5:30pm. By the time we were almost done eating and had gotten to dessert,  they had put fresh food out. For a $60-$70 tab for a family of 7... this is not ideal. If I'm going to pay this much for dinner, it had better be worth it. Next time we will go out for steak instead.

Text: I was not very satisfied. When we got there more than an hour before they closed they were almost completely out of food. They told us they would make whatever we wanted and bring it out but the food that they made was not all the way cooked like the onions and broccoli were still raw. The food that was still available on the buffet was not tasty at all. I felt like we were being rushed and like we were an aggravation. Not worth my money and I won't be back.
