Text: We love it here! The staff is always so accommodating and kind and the food is great. We usually go on Sunday afternoon after church. When we first went we didn't know that kids eat free on Sunday when you buy an entree, but the owner let us know about this special before our food got to the table and brought our little one a quesadilla at the same time our food came out! How kind and thoughtful. I highly recommend this place.
