Text: The past few times going there have been absolutely terrible!  Some of the worst service I've had anywhere. Most recent visit we were at the hibachi. Ordered our drinks and food. I ordered a Asahi. Everyone received their drinks except me. After waiting roughly 10mins I decided to get one at the bar , come to find out my beer was just sitting there waiting for our waiter to bring it. Ok next issue I ordered sushi as well. The sushi tasted good but again it sat there at the sushi area for a extended period of time before being brought to us. As for the hibachi food, it's not terrible but I've definitely had much better elsewhere.  Ashame years ago this place use to be pretty good , but has definitely gone way way downhill.  Oh and if you go take a look around at the dust stuck to window ledges and the various other areas that don't appear to ever get cleaned or cleaned well :/
