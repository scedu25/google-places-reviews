Text: After new owners took over we were pleasantly surprised with some great changes to their food, and they now have a full sushi selection!! We returned the next day and tried 4 of their rolls and the yellowtail and eel nigiri.   All was excellent and very fair priced!!! 

Went back again and ordered the sushi party tray.  $40 for an enormous amount of good sushi.  Check out the pic!

Text: These folks have been owners of this restaurant for years, watched their kids grow from toddlers to college graduates. They are wonderful members of our community.

Their food is as good of Chinese as I have ever tasted and I travel quite extensively. They have a daily buffet that seldom changes but that is because those are the choices the locals want to eat. If someone thinks that is boring then just ask them to bring something else out and they will.

Try their seafood noodle soup (not on the menu) for a wonderful warming winter lunch

Never has this place disappointed me

Text: Food was decent. Not the best decorated place. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Family owned in a small town.
