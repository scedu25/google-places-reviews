Text: Love this place. Chicken pad Thai is delicious but there really hasn't been anything that I have ordered that was bad. A little on the pricey side but worth it.

Text: Absurdly good. In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by empty lots and warehouses, we had some of the best Thai food I’ve had in a while (and I eat a lot Thai food. We got house duck, fried rice, ginger tofu, noodle soup, pad Thai, rice pudding, iced coffee, and hot tea. Everything was exquisite. Come eat here.

Text: The food was delicious and the customer service was decent. They filled or glasses and checked on the table. My only complaint is that they seem to over sweeten the food.  This might be done to cut the spice for non- spicy requests. The food was good though.

Text: Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Thank you to the staff for their patient as we struggled to narrow down the choices. Even picking out some choices for us. Great evening.

Text: Best Thai in Bloomington-Normal. Been here a dozen times. We always  try something new and it NEVER disappoints. Their crab lagoon & "chicken on a stick" appetizers are to die for. Very friendly staff too. Makes us want to go to Thailand again.
