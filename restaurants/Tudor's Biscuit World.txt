Text: My guilty pleasure when I'm in West Virginia visiting family.  I was doing genealogy research that day which meant climbing a lot of hills to get to cemeteries.  I needed a good breakfast and I knew Tudor's would deliver.  Good prices for a lot of good food.  A little hard to see from 119, but Google Maps got us there.  Seemed to be a popular place as it was pretty busy.  Just be careful if you park in the space next to the drive-thru!  Look before you get in the passenger side.

Text: The staff are courteous and quick and their food is great.  I always walk in and order my breakfast to go and it never takes more than just a couple of minutes and I am back on the road.
