Wendy's

Text: I mean, we've all eaten at a Wendy's. We've all had fast food and we know what to expect. I have to rate down the middle for that exact reason. This place is good for a Wendy's. To me it just has a better taste than McDonald's or BK. I've had good staff and bad staff here but rarely a bad meal and that's saying a lot for the amount of time I've spent shoving a #1 into my pie hole. Their fish sammy is bar none the best fast food one around. But I get it though, no one wants to work fast food. But just fake it for your shift and go home and do what you do. I can't believe I wrote this much for a Wendy's.

Text: GORRIBLE SERVICE  The workers ignored us once we got our meals. We sat there for 3 minutes after receiving our food saying excuse me trying to get ketchup and were completely ignored. They clearly heard us as The window was open and two wirkers were standing right there.The pregnant one was extremely rude. We will never go back. Very trashy Wendy's. I would have rated a ZERO if that was an option.

Text: This location is very understaffed. And being under staffed equates to sloppy work and unsatisfied customers. Burgers missing toppings and sloppily put together, hair found in food, fries ordered in a large not even amounting to a medium. I've had better from this location,and hopefully it gets back to that

Text: Love the fresh buns they use and the fries are super! I love the chilli because it's not too spicy.
