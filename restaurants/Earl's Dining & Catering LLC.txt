Text: July 28, 2012~~Great decor, linen tablecloths, & quick service!!
There were five adults in our party everyone had a different dish and all were pleased with the portions, flavor and sides.  Deep fried Walleye, Popular Thick-cut Pork Chop (fantastic), Prime Rib King-cut (a bit salty for someone who does not add salt to his foods), Hamburger (large portion and wonderful), & Chicken Sandwich (just perfect).  Coloring book/crayons for our toddler helped to entertain even daddy.    
Weekends ~~ Call ahead for reservations!!
