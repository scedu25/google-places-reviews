Royal International Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: Good food at a very affordable price for the whole family, no matter what the size. If you're looking for a buffet in the area, this is it. All of the staff here are simply awesome. They love to see patrons return often, especially for birthdays. They will make a special desert up for anyone who is celebrating their birthday and sing to them. The cooks and wait staff are very creative.

Text: Very good.  We we're looking for a buffet and these folks did not disappoint! We had the lunch for a very reasonable price.  The value and the faux sushi was great too.

They had lots of options and even American fast food for the folks that get drug along so often.   The Mongolian grill was well stocked and had some interesting things on it.

I didn't get a picture of the place but don't let the outside of the building frightening you off. Large area for groups and even a private dining area for a party etc.

Text: This is for the one in Decatur not mt zion. It was $30 and not worth a penny. There were maybe 5 other customers in there. The food was old and cold and hardly any food out there. Everything tastes funky we didn't finish a plate. I got ice cream and all the ice cream in the deep freezer thing was melted. We talked to the person taking our money and told him how bad it was and he said I'll give you 10% off so he took off ONE drink. He said all buffets are like this....uh empty and with what food they had it was old and cold. Not once did they apologize for the experience. I will never be returning.

Text: Not a personal favorite.  Food is varied....lots of choices. Lots of fried food. There is a choclate fountain that people seem to like.  The good Just doesn't  have allot of flavor like other Asian resturants.
