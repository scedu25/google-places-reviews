Rating: 5
Text: Excellent dinner! The service was good and the portions huge. Lots of space available and no wait. Would definitely visit again.

Text: The food experience was okay. The alcohol experience was ridiculous. Drink elsewhere.  The motel experience was exceptional, out of this world! I highly recommend using the motel. My car broke down and they were more than accommodating on helping me out.

Text: I stay here once or twice a year when i come down for hunting trips.  The rooms have always been clean and that is all i really care about when staying a hotel/motel.  Everything is certainly outdated as far as the decor but i don't care about that at all, i just want a clean place to sleep.  Prices are reasonable and i like the fact that i can park right outside my room.

Text: Wow! It's been a while since I had a steak like that! The food was great and I left full. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. The town almost always has something fun going on!
