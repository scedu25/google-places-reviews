Spruce Ridge Golf Club

Text: Scheduled an outing here for 18 people. I had made contact with the clubhouse 3 times over a two month period and they seemed excited for us to come out. The morning we arrived the staff were extremely rude to us all. "Oh great, no one better bring their own alcohol out here" when we were all dressed to proper attire and very respectful. Other than the unwelcoming staff, the course was fun and worth the $22.

Text: The course is well taken care of for the price ($25) for weekend, come on, so cheap. The greens are in excellent shape ALWAYS. Not too long but a handful of blind greens. They also have excellent hot dogs and brats. Highly recommended

Text: On Monday August 10, 2010 we went to Spruce Ridge to play golf. We have a group that travels around the area & plays the local courses every Monday at 6pm. When we got to the course some of our group was there & found that we couldn't play because the note on the locked door said back at "approximately" 6:30. Some of the guys in our group said that the owner or manager(whatever he is) went out with a foursome to play. They had several carts sitting out ready to go with no keys.
It surprised us that they don't care about 10+ guys spending their hard earned money there! WE went to Diamond Lake Golf course in Cassopolis instead.BY the way..... DLGC is highly recommended! (AND THEY WERE OPEN)
