Text: Such nice people there and the food is amazing! The only thing I don't like are the inconsistent hours. I'd recommend going on their website or calling them to make sure they're open before driving there as they aren't always open during their regular hours. Other than that, Tai Chili is my go-to restaurant. Very generous portions and you leave feeling full but not gross

Text: Outstanding food!  Small and intimate.  One chef, one wok.  Allow lots of time for getting a table and your food.  Well worth the wait.

Text: If you are willing to wait a little while for the food, this is the best Thai food I have eaten this side of the Pacific. It is a one cook, one wok kitchen and it shows in the quality of the dishes. She picks the produce fresh every morning and creates each dish by hand with impeccable care. Nothing is ever reused, each dish is created fresh when ordered. This can cause a wait upwards of two hours, however they are more than happy to accommodate orders that are called ahead for pick up. I highly recommend this lovely restaurant! You will not be disappointed in the food.

Text: Oh my god this place is amazing. Ridiculous fresh delicious food and great service. Just don't go if you're in a hurry because it's a one wok kitchen and she takes her time to develop flavors.
