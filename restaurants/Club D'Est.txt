Club D'Est
Rating: 5
Text: We had reservations for 26 on a Friday night for a family birthday party.  We were ushered to our own room.  Our drinks, appetizers and entrees were all served in a timely manner.  The servers provided prompt drink refills.  At the end of the meal, two complimentary desserts were served to the birthday boys.  It was a great experience, one that Club D'Est seemingly pulled off with ease.

Text: Food was good when we ate there, but the overall quality was not worth the price.
