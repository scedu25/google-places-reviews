Text: Quint little place. Neat building, good prices, good food. Just make sure you get served before 12:30. They close the doors.

Text: Big and great burgers! Hard to find without a map if you have never been, since signs are sparse and very tiny. Almost always crowded, but just take your time moving through the building. Wait times are usually short! Friendly people.
