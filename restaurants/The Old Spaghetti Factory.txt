The Old Spaghetti Factory

Text: Full of good food and nostalgia. The service is great and the atmosphere is very calm. They have options for all food eaters. Veg, Vegan, meat! It is a nice place to sit with someone you want to give your attention to with low noise and little to distract you.

Text: Outstanding food with great decor.  Service was okay asked for hot soup lukewarm at best.  Waitress claimed it had just been made?  Lasagna was excellent!  Ravioli had by my wife was said to be very good by her!  Great atmosphere!

Text: The restaurant is gorgeous and has been a staple of downtown Louisville since I moved here in the late 1990s.  The food, however, is less remarkable.  While I wouldn't consider it bad, it has nothing elevating it beyond an "okay" rating.  Service is hit-and-miss, with some servers more responsive than others.  Given the restaurant is a national chain with chain-style prices, it's perfectly fine place to eat.  Just don't go in expecting something wonderful.

Text: Fantastic location, beautiful building and decor. Food was very tasty and more than just spaghetti and meatballs lol. Staff was dressed upscale but very casual dining environment, even have an old trolley car you can have family gatherings in for a little seclusion amidst the crowd.

Text: Waited less than 5 mins to get seating for two. Great server, amazing food and the best part... ice cream is free! We ordered the Chicken Marsala and the Spinach Tortellini. Cooked to perfection
