Bee Spring Restaurant

Text: We normally love the rural mom and pop restaurants, and this one certainly meets that description, however the food we tried and very slow service are what lowered the stars on this cute place. 
The decor is a rustic rural style, and includes many old black and white pictures of local people, places, and things. It was fish Friday, and we both love good catfish, with the key word being "good", but we were disappointed to receive long thin finger like pieces, which could have used both more seasoning and a bit more time in the fryer. The cole slaw was excellent, but the hush puppies were burnt in both of our baskets. Although we didn't try the desserts, they were all homemade, and looked very good under the classic diner glass covers.  
The service was very friendly, but after our meals arrived, we seldom could catch them, and then it took a reminder and a very long wait to receive our check. 
We'll give it another try if we are in the area again, and hopefully I can raise the stars then.

Text: The food was good and the environment was pleasant. Bee Springs Restaurant has the "rough around the edges" feel that a lot of family own restaurants have. The service was disorganized and we had to wait 40 minutes for a few hamburgers when there was only 4 other people in the restaurant. 

To sum it up, good food okay service.
