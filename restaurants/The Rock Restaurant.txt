Text: The owners are the sweetest men I’ve ever met! Easy on the eyes too... I love the gyro special! Would definitely recommend this place! The Greek chicken salad is also amazing!

Text: Very happy with the food options here - gyros, hummus, falafel, baklava, salads, burgers and more. Some options are possible for those avoiding gluten or meat. Ambience is pleasant - clean, uncluttered, not overly loud.  Staff are helpful and good at their jobs.  Only comments are seeming inconsistency in items (eg first visit, the Philly Cheese Steak was a huge sandwich, and the second time is was half the size with a completely different bun) and a need for a truly good veggie option with the hummus (instead of pita, for those that can't have bread).  We could even suggest a 2lb gyro meat option.  We enjoyed the hummus with gyro meat tremendously.  And the baklava was alright - not as good as mine, but then I didn't have to take a day to make it either.  We will definitely be back.

Text: Great gyros!!! Fast and decent service. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a Chicago style gyro. Price wasn't bad either.

Text: Longtime fan of The Rock!  They have absolutely the best gyros.  The new location has more seating and was very nicely renovated.
