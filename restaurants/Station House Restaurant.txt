Station House Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent food and reasonably priced for the large portions.  I had Station House grilled chicken with mushrooms and swiss.  Large salad with full green onion stalk.  My husband had country fried steak and chicken tortilla soup. We both loved our entrees.  Yeast rolls, oh yes!  Couldn't resist the full plate sized cream puff.  Yummy!

Text: My buddy and I went there today, July 10, 2017 for a late lunch. We were only 2 people there. Waitress was pleasant and friendly. The food is the reason I am giving a low rating. I ordered a Rubin. The meat was tough, bread wasn't rye, very little sauerkraut and even less thousand island dressing. My buddy ordered a hamburger. It was beyond well done. He did like the fries. My plate had home made chips and they were actually OK but a bit over cooked. Was like eating leather with salt added. I had ice tea and my buddy had pepsi. Total cost of meal was $26 and change. Wasn't worth the price we paid.
