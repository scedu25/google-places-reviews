Text: You wouldn’t know it by looking at it, but this is an amazing little restaurant. I thought it would be greasy and sub par at best. I was pleasantly surprised that the menu items were homemade including there chicken strips and strawberry shortcake. Very reasonably price. They had all you can eat rib special for $ 9.99 I will Mark this on my map for places to visit on my road trips!

Text: Classic diner. House chicken is always unlimited and I will always recommend it to everyone. Breakfast options are great. Reasonably priced. Good service, rarely busy.

Text: This is one of those places that has just always been around.  It has been our go to place on many a bike ride.  The food is great and they will accommodate your needs.

I am a pie and soup man and they keep me smiling with what they have.  The kids (& adults) will love their bazillion and one flavors of softserve ice cream. 

The staff and owners are personable, helpful and generally cheerful... and should you get Cindy she will make your day.  She is a treasure. 

So, get off your duffs and go give Brothers a try.

Text: Had the chicken dinner, very good. I was with my grandson and his two children. Very children friendly, good waitress.  Definitely recommend.

Text: Maybe 3 tables here during a slow afternoon. Apparently it takes 20 minutes to get a waitress to bring you a refill on coffee. And any all you can eat refills take 25 minutes to get to your tables. I don't think anyone has 4 hours to waste on average food.
