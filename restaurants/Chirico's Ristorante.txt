Text: Everything was amazing! I hadn't been in a very long time and my wife had never been. The environment is great with Italian music playing. We had spaghetti and the fettuccine Alfredo and it was great and plenty of it. Our server was one of the best ever. I think her name was Cali but not 100%. Either way, she was awesome. Then to beat it all, some amazingly nice customers paid for our entire meal! Thank you whoever you are!

Text: Everything was absolutely amazing! The fettachini Alfredo was perfecto! Our waitress' name was Callie and she was so polite and great at her job. This was our first visit and we will definetly be back. Our meal was also paid for by a random couple who had no idea this was our first anniversary date and our first date since our baby arrived. Thanks you so much to that couple!!  So special ?
