Text: I ordered the black bean and veggie fajita to go, instead I got a extremely burned black bean patty. I only took one bite of it before I spit it out and I still have the taste of ashes in my throat. Very disappointing. The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is Mica the server. She was absolutely fantastic on the phone and in person. Very friendly and helpful. She deserved to be rated with 5 stars.

Hadn't been to Chile's for a long time and I was pleasantly surprised.

Text: The third time I ordered the shredded chicken club and the second time the chicken was not shredded. The first time I ordered this sandwich I loved it. So disappointed I did not check my to go order before leaving. I would have left the sandwich there. Even asked if the chicken would be shredded. First time it was, second time it was cubed chicken. This time it was sliced chicken. At least I have the salad I ordered. Will be a long time before I go back.

Text: Good food. Service was decent enough I guess. But we had ordered guacamole and chips as app. we wanted more chips. Didn't get them and then asked for some chips to take home with the leftover guacamole and barely got  half of a bag. Disappointing but glad we even got them at all.
