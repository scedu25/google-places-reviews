Text: Such a fun little place. What could be better then a bar connected to a Romeo's Pizza?! The food we had was delicious and the drinks poured by, Tami, we're equally as awesome! We will be back!

Text: I have been here for 30 minutes and have not gotten a drink yet.  Wait...finally arrived.  Come here every week, may seriously not ever come back.  Really disappointing since I like the food and atmosphere.
