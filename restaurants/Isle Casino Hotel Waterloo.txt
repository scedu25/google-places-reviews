Isle Casino Hotel Waterloo
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms are spacious as well as the walk in shower and bathroom area. An added plus are the readily available usb outlets on the desk as well as beside the bed for charging. 

Having stayed several times I’ve never been disappointed with any of the rooms. 

I do think that they could upgrade to a better quality mattress .

Text: I visited the Isle and spent about 2 to 3 hours at the casino with some friends. I actually didn't spend any of my own money, but I did sign up for a rewards card and received $5, which I lost immediately. They've got free non alcoholic beverages, which is great. The dealers and staff are friendly and it's a nice and professional looking establishment. Even the approach by car makes the building look pretty impressive. Inside is nice looking, but it could definitely use some cleaning on the gambling floor.

Text: The hotel was very nice....we ate at Otis and Henry's friday night it was fabulous food....the only issues I have is the workers, from the waitresses to the valet workers and the lady working at the club rewards counter, none of them smiled they were not friendly and especially the valet guy Sunday morning, he didn't speak English very well and he was very very rude.  We ate brunch at the buffet Sunday morning and our waitress didn't remove plates until we asked..  I asked for salsa and she pretty much told me to find it myself..  the isle is my favorite casino....the only workers who were enjoyable and acted like they wanted us there were the desk personnel for the hotel

Text: This casino is pretty good being it is off the beaten path. There isn't any shopping close by but you can get access to most things by a five minute car ride. The restaurants on site will keep you satisfied.
