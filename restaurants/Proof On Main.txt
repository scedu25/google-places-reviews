Proof On Main

Text: Unbelievably inventive cocktails and great food in the most hip place in Louisville.

I was so happy my wife and I walked past Proof when we wanted to have a drink. The bartenders have their own concoctions on the menu that are flavorful and inventive that I wanted to try them all.

After going for drinks in the afternoon, we decided we should eat here as well. It was worth it. From the bone marrow starter all the way to the corn pudding, everything was excellent.

I recommend Proof for anyone who likes real drinks, creative dishes and wants to hang out at a hip place.

Text: So impressed by the environment and welcoming people inside. I came here on a date and we were greeted by a nice man at the door named Tyler that informed us about the unique little restraunt and art museum. They seated us in a cozy hip room gave us many recommendations and as we drank our drinks and ate our snacks, we got to walk around and looked at the modern art. It was perfect!
A great date idea and simply a must do!

Text: I could rave on for an hour about the 50 reasons why i always get off in Louisville to grab an opportunity to experience PROOF. The food! The art exhibit in their restaurant you can enjoy while, before or after dining. The lounge scene. The service. The inspiring up and coming area. The Art. The decor. The story. Props to you all

Text: Their smoke ring cocktail is just one more work of art in this place. If you leave KY without visiting, you have a valid excuse to return. Knowledgeable bartenders, great decoration, and amazing drinks made this spot the highlight of my bar hopping.

Text: Eclectic bar inside the 21c hotel. Extensive bourbon, wine, and cocktail list, flashy esoteric ingredients, published bartenders. Touted as one of America's top hotel bars, among other impressive accolades.
