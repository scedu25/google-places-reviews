Text: We'd give it 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. The food was tasty and the portions very generous. I had the pulled pork dinner. The meat was tender and smokey. There were three sauces: spicy, sweet, and Georgia mustard. I've never had Georgia mustard,  but it was my favorite. We sat outside. There was live music and it was too loud inside for our taste. They were enjoyable and talented. We could here them fine outside. My only complaint was that the waitress didn't tell us whether she was going to pick up the payment or if we needed to pay inside. We will go back for sure.

Text: Basic food... Skip the brisket... Was cooked properly (little flavor) but TONS of fat holding the little meat together... Ate two strips and let the food be picked up and ate my side salad... Most expensive side salad I've eaten ever. Fried chicken sandwich was good sized batter was basic, chicken inside of the batter was decent. Basic bar food trying to be good at bbq...

Text: Our 4th visit; it's becoming a regular thing for a Sat lunch, short getaway every so often. Always have the fish .. so very good, seasoned and deep fried to perfection. One day we'll try other menu items ... I would give 5 stars, holding out until okra, hush puppies added as sides ? though onion rings, fries, coleslaw are all excellent, too.
