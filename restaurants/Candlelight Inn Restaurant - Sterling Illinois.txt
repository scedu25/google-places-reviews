Candlelight Inn Restaurant - Sterling Illinois
Rating: 4
Text: This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've never had anything bad. The reason I ranked it a 4 is because of the small portions. You pay close to $15 for each meals and barely get anything. I brought my Mom here for her first time and I was really excited to bring her, she ordered fried chicken and for about $15 she got one piece of chicken and a tiny amount of mashed potatoes. They put it on a super large plate which made the portion look EVEN smaller than it already was. I could see the disappointment in my Mom's face which made me sad. I still like this restaurant, but know the portions are small.
