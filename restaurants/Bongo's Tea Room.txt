Text: I was the only customer ( I got there about  2pm, so the lunch crowd  was over)but the service was slow, and  I had to ask for silverware when my food was served.  I has the lunch special and Italian Beef sandwich with fries which was just okay, the beef was a little tough.  The flavor was just OK nothing bursting with flavor, not bad, but not worth writing home about.  Serving size was good and price was reasonable $7.05 with tax.

Text: Have enjoyed multiple visits. Nice place, great food and service. No tipping here (they say use the extra $$ on your food order) and service has always been excellent.

Text: Good was "OK".  Had to ask for a refill and was brought out a half can of soda and was told I could have it. My boyfriend never did get a refill on his tea. Then the waitress put ticket on the table and said, " Are you ready to leave?"
