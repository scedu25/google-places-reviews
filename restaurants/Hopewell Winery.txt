Text: Great atmosphere, met some awesome folks there.  Bob, I'm sorry I don't remember his wife's name and Richard.  The hostess, sorry I can't remember her name either, was fun and gave us the grand tour.  The blush sweet was our favorite.  We had a glass sitting out under the trees in the front.  Hope everyone enjoys the new drink named a Julie.

Text: The BEST wine I've had at an Illinois Winery!! Staff is knowledgeable and friendly!! Cute inside area that doesn't try to fill it with do-dads to purchase...sadly didn't eat any food, but if like the superb wine...I'm sure it's great!  Try the Bob White!...Bought 4 bottles (which is alot for me!) Soooo wish it was closer to Bloomington/Normal area!
