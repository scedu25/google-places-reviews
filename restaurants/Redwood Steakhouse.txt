Redwood Steakhouse
Rating: 5
Text: We met our son and his family half way between Omaha and Des Moines for dinner. I picked the Redwood. None of us had been there before. I was nervous.
What a great find! The serving was good. The oniin rings were the best ever! Relish tray was amazing. The steaks were prepared perfectly and delicious. The chicken was also awesome! Must have crisp hash browns! It was a great time. Thank you very much!
The restaurant was packed at 7:00 and we were glad we had a reservation.  Anita is so lucky to have the Redwood!

Text: Service was top shelf.   Food was three stars.  I had the steak sandwich  which was a steak and two pieces of Texas toast.  Not quite what I was expecting but very good and a really good value.  The quality of the meat was good and the price very reasonable.  My wife had the tenderloin sandwich. Her gold standard is Johnny's Pork Chop Sandwich in Butte Montana and this one fell short, but it was still good.  Overall, it was a good meal...not the best, but not bad at all.

Text: Very good food! Have had their steaks, chicken and Sea food and all have been very good. With the entre you get an old fashion relish tray.
