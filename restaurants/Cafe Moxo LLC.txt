Text: Awesome deli/cafe in downtown Springfield. Nice selection of sandwiches, salads and coffee. The combo meals are great, they even include a fresh baked cookie! They also take online orders. I will absolutely eat here again!

Text: Their delivery breakfast is so good!!! It's quite affordable for what you get and has become my favorite breakfast in Springfield. I highly recommend.

Text: Pictures online make Moxo's appear to be more upscale than it is. We were expecting a table service restaurant. Food was good but.. faced with very few vegetarian choices...I ordered the 'large' version of the Red Rover Red Rover salad, thinking it would make a full meal. Actual size was about the same as a standard side salad. Server assured me it was the 'large size'.

Text: Sandwich tasted amazing but experience was lacking. Place was chosen because of the menu stating gluten free options. Walked in and sign states gluten free menu available but when I asked for it the guy just said all they had was gluten free bread. So it's just the basic menu with gluten free bread. You're left to guess at the ingredients in the sandwiches, wraps, salads and soups are gluten free. Ordered a soup that I thought was safe, employee informed me it did have gluten. So it was just a guessing game. Employee suggested a sandwich and salad which I thought was a combo turns out he was just suggestion paying for two full priced meals. Ended up ordering half sandwich with gluten free bread, it was literally 1/4 the size of the regular sandwich my boyfriend ordered. Great food, not gluten free friendly.
