The Beef House Restaurant & Dinner Theatre
Rating: 4
Text: I teetered between 3 or 4 stars.  A few years ago, this would be easy 5.  It needs some work (grounds).  Food: It's good stuff, but not great.  Ordered my steak MED, it was kinda tuff.  Overall, not a bad trip, just not as great as we had hoped considering past trips were better.   Still, we'd come again

Text: Nice gem of a restaurant.  They show case all their meats in a cooler when you walk in.  Food was great, needed a little salt for my taste but excellent.  Steaks were great!, pork chops were excellent and chicken fingers were homemade.  Large salad bar and delicious soups.  They bring out fresh Yeast Rolls and bring enough to bring home with bags.  The homemade strawberry jam and apple butter were to die for! We bought two jars to go.  Service was good and fast.  Entree included, a side, soup, salad bar and drinks. We are a family of 6 with young kids and this place had plenty for them to eat.  When driving down this way I would go out of the way to stop there again.

Text: My family and I drove to the Beef House from Indianapolis. It was about an hour away drive. My first time at the Beef House was satisfied. Family Friendly Environment. Food was Hot, Fresh and Delicious.  My family and I greeted by a nice friendly staff. I Absolutely Love their Salad Bar. I'm not a huge fan of salad but I was barely at my table, I kept went for their various salads nonstop. Rolls with Apple Butter, Homemade Fresh Chicken Fingers and JUICY STEAK ! I would love to go back again.

Text: If you're passing by and you're hungry definitely stop. It's been around for 50 years and still family-owned and still very popular.  Meals off the menu are always great, but you can get a very reasonable priced lunch, generous portions, and as always their great salad bar is included.  Did I mention the rolls?

Text: So much awesome in this place!  Let's talk about the rolls first...Hot, buttery, delicious and plentiful.  Add fresh made apple butter and strawberry jam, you could make a meal out of these.  The salad bar and soup come with the dinner meals.  Fresh and good.  The menu is amazing, delicious seafood or Beef - that's what's for dinner.  I always promise myself I'm going to eat in moderation here, it simply can't be done!  Highly recommended.
