Stillwater Grill

Text: We stopped in as first-timers for a light, late evening  meal following a family hospital visit. The  food was fresh and flavorful, although, for a restaurant with several seafood offerings, the fish should have not been fishy. The Caesar dressing, if authentic, should be anchovie-salty, but not fishy, as well. It tasted like it was placed too near raw fish products in the cooler.
The service was polite, at first, and the meal served promptly, but the drink refills were not offered after the entree was served, and the waitperson forgot requests 2 or more times. Her mind was not on her job. Unfortunate.
Well-to-do golfers and tennis players who had no palate and were not in a hurry would love this place. Not for us.

Text: Food was great. Service was a 2. Pretty slow and unfriendly. Prices were a 1. Way too expensive for the portion you receive. Just wanted a quick dinner, not spend $16 on a basket of chicken tenders.

Text: I came in on a Friday night with my family to enjoy a nice dinner however when we got there we ordered an appetizer and one entree per person. The first problem is we didn't get the appetizer at all at fall or waitress for not remembering. Then when they delivered a burger I ordered I told him specifically no onions and when the burger came out there were onions on it. My dad's steak was also way undercooked. Never coming here again.

Text: Excellent food. Excellent staff. My husband and I have lunch/dinner there 4-5 times a week and it's our 'go to' place with clients.

Text: The menu is pretty good and the food tastes alright. I just find Stillwater kinda generic and seems a little overpriced. It's not a chain restaurant, so you could do worse in this area. They have an extensive wine menu and quite a few seafood dishes. They have ipad menus which are kinda neat but also feels impersonal. You could do better but you could do worse.
