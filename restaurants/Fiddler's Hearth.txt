Fiddler's Hearth

Text: This place is one of my all time favorites! The atmosphere is amazing, authentic Irish feel. Live music really adds to the experience. Having to share tables allows you to meet new fun people. Food and beer are fantastic. Haven't had a single thing on the menu I didn't enjoy. Very friendly customer service!

Text: This place was one of our first restaurants we ate at when we first moved here. The communal seating and love entertainment are a plus. Sometimes the wait to be seated, to get your meals, and to get refills can be too much. There isn't enough meat in the steak and Guinness pie. We still love the place since we lived in Ireland one summer, but there are some cons.

Text: One of the most fun places in town. Great Irish food, good beer selection, & great prices. One of my favorite things about Fiddler's is that I can sit at a table with complete strangers and get to know them throughout the course of the evening. This is on my short list of must-do things in South Bend.

Text: The food here, is not your, "standard", Irish pub food: it is next level traditional Irish pub food. The fish and chips are amazing. Trust. 
And the bar is so diverse! Diverse craft beer choices from all over as well as some great whiskies
