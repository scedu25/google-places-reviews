Text: First time here( we did carry out) 
Never had smoke house Bar-B-Que.
I got the burnt ends , with fries and the smoked beans . OH MY GOSH, TASTE BUD ARE IN OVERLOAD!!!! THE BEST Bar-B-Que ever!!!!!!! 
When I went in , and even though the were busy they were kind and helped me. So I got my order and it was right. Definitely the best place to get BBQ.

Text: My server was Ryan today and he was the best ever.  He gave great suggestions and was quite attentive. 

The food was amazing and your order comes out quickly.  I was on a lunch hour and still had plenty of time.  

Thanks Smokehouse for such wonderful service.

Text: We were pleasantly surprised at every turn.  First, they got us in and seated very fast.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  And, the food was fantastic.  There are many great bbq joints in KC and this is one of them.

Text: Good BBQ. Food quality can be questionable at times. I've received both cold and microwaved BBQ there before. When it's good it is great, but when they are off, it is quite poor.

Text: Consistently good all-around. Excellent BBQ and sides; service is always top-notch. Nice atmosphere. A great place to take out-of-towners for an excellent example of Kansas City BBQ. These guys don't get enough attention!
