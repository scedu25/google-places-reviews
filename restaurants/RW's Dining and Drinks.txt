Text: I simply can't say enough great things about RW's.  The food is amazingly delicious!  You must try their ham balls!!  The servers are terrific, but a special shout out to Kima!  She rocks the place!  So happy this place is in Davenport, NE!

Text: Love R W's. They are always meeting the needs of the people.  Such a selection of foods.  Kima is the greatest waitress.  Suzanne on Burger night always gets you what you need.  Others who's names I do not know also do a wonderful job.  God bless Curtis and Suzie.

Text: Nice place to eat in Davenport! 

I just wish they had gravy every day of the week instead of just Friday & Saturday. Chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak are kind of plain without gravy.
