Text: Our bartender was great, the cocktails were made extremely well, and the food was really good! Jerry was our bartender and he really made it an excellent experience. I ordered the fried mushrooms to eat and they were absolutely fantastic. We went over to bowl after getting drinks and had a lot of fun. There were a lot of balls to choose from and it was nice having access to the bar as well. Loved it!

Text: The food is good, but the service is very slow. Also, in the Summer, it's freezing in there.
