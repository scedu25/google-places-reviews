Katzinger's Delicatessen
Rating: 5
Text: I was visiting Columbus and ate at Katzinger's three times. Each time I enjoyed delicious sandwiches and deli items that I have not seen outside of NYC. The giant barrels held the best pickles I've had in years! My sandwiches were a little spendy, but they were delicious and I left without room for another bite. The atmosphere is delightful, with all manner of folks talking and interacting happily. The staff is friendly and genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs and their customers. They made me feel so welcome every time I walked in the door.  I was visiting Columbus and decided to take a bag of deli treats home. They traveled well and were enjoyed by all. I wish I had brought another several sticky buns, as those are simply out of this world. I should have grabbed some of their fabulous rye bread, too. I will come back any time I am ever in Columbus!

Text: Meat piled more than an inch thick is the central piece of this monster sandwich. Load up some sauerkraut and sauce and top it with a toasted bread of your choice--I chose sourdough over rye. This was well worth the wait in line. Two different pickle barrels are waiting for customers to help themselves. My preference was dill over garlic. I'd also recommend the potato salad. Good stuff.

Text: Delicious food. Everything was great here. Service was friendly. Pickles were so good. Wish parking was more plentiful. Less than a block off of I 70.

Text: Delicious sandwiches and potato salad. Choose your own whole dill or garlic pickle from the pickle barrel. The New York cheesecake was good. On a Friday evening around 6 to 7 the place was busy but no wait for a table. Seating available inside or out. The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful. She had a fun New York accent that added to the ambiance of an authentic deli experience.

Text: Katzinger's is an excellent Deli. I have been visiting here for over a decade and I was quite surprised to realize today that I had never given a review. Sandwich selection is vast and the quality is superb. Two large barrels of dill and garlic pickles sit near the register and are included with any sandwich order.

As a great added bonus, they have a cheese shop built right in which offers a variety of American and European cheeses to suit all tastes. They are happy to provide you with tastes of any cheeses so that you know what you may like to buy. Fresh loaves of bread are available. Matzo ball soup is yummy as well. Nice staff and service.
