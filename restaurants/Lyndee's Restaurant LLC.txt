Text: Not the best tasting breakfast. I'm not a coffee snob, but I do like a good tasting coffee and this wasn't it, unfortunately. Very thin and a bit funky. My hash browns also had a strange taste, which may have been from being uncooked.  They were soggy and potato colored - no browning whatsoever. They were essentially raw or perhaps par boiled only. My English Muffin was barely toasted, so specify if you want it more than just warmed up. The country fried steak and scrambled eggs were good. That's the only part I ate.

Text: Don't bother going here unless you like bad service and worse food. We waited 30 minutes before even getting a drink order over an hour to get our food and left hungry because we couldn't eat it was so disgusting. Orange juice tastes like nail polish remover, busciuts and gravy taste like play doh and the toast was old and hard. 2 tables of people came after us and had gotten their food, ate and left before we even received our food. Waste of time and money.

Text: One of the best bacon cheeseburgers you'll ever eat. The pricing is great. And the back room is haunted one might say. Mark Allen psychic medium does readings back there check it out. Life path advisor dotnet

Text: Service wasn't the greatest, my husband even got the wrong order. She sat it down in front of him and then asked if it was ok.
