Text: I've eaten there three times, and each time I thought the food was really good. Almost perfect really. 

They make their own salad dressings, and the one that I tried was amazing. I think it was a fruity vinaigrette. Either way, it was amazing. 

They make their own BBQ sauce as well. Had that on the smokehouse turkey sandwich or it was the Texas sandwich.  That was really good too.

Anyway, three times, three different things, and all was very good!

The only reason I gave four, and not five stars, was simply because I thought the price was a bit high, but I don't know, I'm definitely going back.

P.S., I'd say, people who don't like this place should probably go back to McDonald's where their tastebuds belong, you know, where they serve "real quality food."

Text: I've heard great things about this place so I decided to try it out for lunch. I wasn't feeling great so I went in for the soup and sandwich lunch special. I found out they don't make soup when the weather is warm. It was dissappointing but understandable. I asked if they offered a turkey wrap instead and they did. Great! When I got back to the office to eat I was surprised at the ingredients. Cubed turkey, a lot of shredded carrots, black olives, onions, green and red peppers, shredded cheese, some lettuce and a dressing/mayo. Not what I expected. Next time I'll try something else and know what's in it first. It's a cute place and worth a second try for sure.

Text: Two different deliveries. First one got my soda wrong. Second delivered a hot Pepsi for lunch, denied and left although he was tipped. Not happy with service
