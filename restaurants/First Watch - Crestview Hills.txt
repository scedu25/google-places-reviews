Text: Noticed an "older restaurant" smell as soon as we walked in. Table was sticky. Silverware was new  service was good. Ricotta pancakes were tasty!  But restaurant needs cleaning and updates. Decor is a bit dated but older restaurant smell was worse part.

Text: The food was good, except for the "toast" because it was not toasted at all. Our server Danielle was excellent, but some of the other employees could use some training on better customer service. As I was sitting, I noticed something was hitting my chair, so I scooted in even more thinking I'm in the way. It was one of the persons cleaning the tables, who just kept bumping into me and did not apologize at all. Then the young lady who brought out our food definitely could be nicer to my elderly father who is hard of hearing. She came very close to rolling her eyes twice when my mother asked her kindly for more napkins and the potatoes that did not come out with the order.

Text: I love this location the friendliest staff and the food is to die for as always. Fast, fresh and always perfect. You can never go wrong and check out their new summer items on the sign when you come in.
