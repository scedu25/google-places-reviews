Text: This place gives a 10% discount when you stay at the Holiday Inn at Colby. This place has surprisingly decent variety of food and freshness to their food for a restaurant/truck stop. My husband and I both had steak, KC strip and top sirloin respectively. His was medium and was cooked to order. I had well and as someone who likes their steak cooked well it was definitely dry. And yes, you can get a juicy well steak if you cook it right. So either they didn't want to cook it right or they had it on a timer. But I don't mind bland food so it was good with the homemade mash potatoes and free salad bar. Our waitress was sweet but forgetful. Other than that, a great experience.

Text: This place was so fantastic, fast and friendly. Exactly what we needed after driving all day. Got a great steak that was cooked perfectly and the soup and salad bar was great and very filling. I would drive across Kansas again just to go here.

Text: Service was the worst!!! Food was pretty good. It wasn't as good as mom's! But not too bad. Waitress was a slow, poor service, easily confused, nit wit. But the place was clean and I have not gotten sick yet. No refills you may confuse the waitress.

Text: My husband and I just ate here after traveling 9 1/2 hours. We were under-dressed and our service quality was very poor obviously because of how we were dressed.  Other people have came in an hour after us were served right after us and had placed their order 30 mins after we placed ours.  It's going on 2 hours and we have been waiting on our check 20mins now. I wouldn't recommend anyone eating here.
