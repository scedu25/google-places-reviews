J's Burger Dive
Rating: 5
Text: My friends and I ate at J's on August 21, 2017. It was my first trip to Hamilton and we where there to see the eclipse and visit the quilt shops. It was just by chance that we stopped there to eat. I just have to say that their cheeseburger was the best one I have ever had. The employees were great and working hard to get everyone's order prepared. I will definitely eat there the next time I'm in town.

Text: Fresh made burger and hand cut fries, delicious and less expensive than a fast food chain. Will go again when in the area.
