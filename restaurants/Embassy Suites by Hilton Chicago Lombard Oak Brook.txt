Text: I was there for a college meet and greet. The employees knew exactly where to lead us. The room the greet was in was perfect for a meet and greet. There was even food and drink provided. Very wonderful experience.

Text: Beautiful property. More sleek decor than typical embassy suites properties. Would have given 5 stars but they actually have a lobby/common areas curfew which was a turn off. Wristbands are required for all complimentary activities (evening drinks, pool, breakfast). Waffles but no pancakes or the other way around (can't remember, lol).

Text: We organized an after hours event for the women of our office group. It was a wine and paint event. Tina, the sales manager, was more than accommodating. Our event included a bar that was set up just outside the room for us, as well as hot and cold appetizers. Everything was done to perfection, including service from all the hotel staff. We plan on hosting more events at Embassy Suites Lombard in the near future.

Text: We went in on a Friday night.. room exceptionally clean.  amazed. What i found very pleasant is that all the employees there were extremely helpful and very friendly. I would highly recommend this Embassy suites to anyone.. for most supersedes all the other locations i have stayed at in the past.  Last note the breakfast bar is the best.
