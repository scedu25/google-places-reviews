Text: We recently had diner there and was very impressed with the service and the pizza.  We had the Deluxe and the crust was perfect and the toppings were evenly placed.  They also had a great wine and beer selection.  We had been there before but this time was perfect and they have really stepped up their game.  If you haven't been there in a while, it is worth another visit!!

Text: Great food. Awful service. Took more than 10 minutes to get greeted and another 10 till we got drinks.

Text: Pretty sure there's been another owner swap (3rc one). The patio is gone, TV's gone, the house dressing has changed. Lots of changes. I'll miss the patio but most of all the house dressing was previously grand! A creamy zesty Italian that was simply to die for, the new version is much milder not back but not memorable either.   Service wasn't horrid but not not great either, staff was indifferent. Sat down at a dirty table, it needed wiped off.  Saw server once to take order, then a food runner took over.

Text: Delicious pizza and bread sticks! We had the garden deluxe pizza, very flavorful and perfectly baked with a crunchy thin crust. Lovely atmosphere and friendly wait staff make this a definite restaurant to visit.

Text: The food was very good - the gluten free pizza crust was exceptional compared to most local offerings. Service was very polite and timely. Location is convenient to west siders. However, there was no beer available for sale during our visit, and that's something classically consumed with pizza. Also, the seating area and tables are small and remind me of a cafe. I wouldn't go here in a group or more than 4. But I would go back.
