Text: It's taco John's. I love the potato oles.  The steak street taco is also good but small and not as spicy as advertised.

Text: A few visits have resulted with this review. Over priced Tex-Mex restaurant. Employees were more concerned with visiting with each other. Manager (older man) was rude to staff infront of customers.
