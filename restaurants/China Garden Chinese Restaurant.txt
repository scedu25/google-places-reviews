Text: Currently under new management. Food and lunches are great. Place has been repainted and cleaned up after the disaster of the prior owners who left the place filthy. The new management seems to be on top of things. The bathrooms could still use some updating and better lighting. Prices are very reasonable'

Text: Never have I ever had chicken fried rice where the chicken is breaded and fried. Disgusting. And the beef and broccoli tasted like heated leftovers the day after.  So disappointing. The rice was hard in spots like it also was leftovers.
