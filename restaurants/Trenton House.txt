Text: I had the grilled scallops and my husband had the prime rib. This was our first time eating here and it was the best meal we have had in a while. Everything was delicious, seasoned perfectly, and served promptly. We would highly recommend dining at Trenton House.

Text: Be prepared to wait for over an hour for your food and it comes out wrong 90% of the time (either not how you asked it to be cooked or wrong items). My family and I have been here multiple times and it has never been a good experience.
