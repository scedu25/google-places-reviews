Text: Food is excellent.  Service is friendly.  Atmosphere is quiet.  Restaurant could use some updating but I will always come to eat there.

Text: Had the Mongolian beef which was pretty good.  The dumplings were not what we expected; really heavy and quite a bit of dough so just be prepared for that if you order it. Good, centralized location in downtown St. Joe.

Text: My favor to go-to place for Chinese food in the area. The food is flavorful and so tasty! Best Chinese food I have had so far in the US.

Text: We walked passed this stupid Chinese restaurant on the way for dinner and saw the sign for bubble tea. Went in and only one person worked in the restaurant we ordered 2 bubble teas.  The lady told us it took 10 minutes for 2 glasss of tea after we paid.  Unacceptable.  Doesn't know how to prioritize the work.  She went to help everyone in the restaurant instead of get us our tea. Don't come in here if you only need jut couple glasses of tea. It's Ridiculous and pathetic, the teas have five bubbles in it and its taste terrible and super sweet.  Hiring more people if you are behind.

Text: We were here for a late lunch on a weekday. The food was rather bland and seemed strangely old or not fresh. We were the only guests at the time, and the employees were having a loud, extended conversation across the dining room for a good portion of our time there.
