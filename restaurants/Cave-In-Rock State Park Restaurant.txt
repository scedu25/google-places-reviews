Text: I have never had bad food from here and absolutely love their friend chicken!!! They are always busy! Which means that people love this place! Better fish than the fish dock in Elizabethtown. And their Sunday buffet is the bomb?

Text: The food was great and had a great view of the river from a high bluff where the restaurant was located, the services were excellent, just a bit pricey for what you were getting.

Text: We stayed in the cabins the 22-23 of may this year 2017 and ate at this restaurant just once because it was very possibly the worst meal I have ever had.  My advice is to eat at Rose Kountry Kitchen but don't order the horseshoe from here because they have no idea how to make one. The best local place in this area to eat a quick bite is across the river in Marion called 88dip now that the Marion cafe is closed.

Text: If you don't go here, enjoy the local 'deliverance' of non-State/Federal standards... Sentors, Reps and Gov's eat frequent this jewel. 

risk montezooma's revenge-unless you drive 76.3 miles to Carbondale, or 75.7 miles to Evansville.
