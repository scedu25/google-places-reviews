Bluebird Diner

Text: Ordered for four on Wednesday after work...food was done in about 20 min.  I added the real menu from the Iowa City location...the online one was wrong when I looked. The food was delicious. The staff is super nice, friendly, and patient. Would definitely go to again and would definitely recommend.

Text: LOVE Bluebird! It’s my go-to place when friends and family visit. Don’t remember the name, but the breakfast entree with the polenta, beef, and over-easy egg is to die for!

Text: We simply loved the food at Bluebird Diner. Though we weren't especially enamored with the environment, it is a diner, after all. The gluten free pancakes were out of this world and all of our Iowa friends (Friends Reunion) really enjoyed. We'll be going there when we next come into Iowa City...Bernie

Text: We really enjoyed the atmosphere here, with lots of fun kitsch throughout.  We had lunch.  The food was pretty decent and the staff was friendly and helpful.

Text: My husband and I went there a while back.  We have been to the one on North Liberty.  Service there is always Wonderful!  I would not recommend the one downtown.  We didn't even go on a busy time and yet we sat for 20 minutes.   Staff walked all around us, never brought water, never took order, never acknowledged we were even there.  Several others came in and placed orders AFTER we had come in.  I took the menues, which was the only thing we got, placed it on the counter in front of three staff.   Loudly explained the situation-as nicely as I could at that moment and we left.   One staff member followed us apologizing,  however it was too little too late.  We never got to taste the food.  I will always recommend North Liberty.  Even when they are busy, you feel welcome.
