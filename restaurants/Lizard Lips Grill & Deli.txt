Text: We ordered 2 large pizzas both of which were excellent and the price was more than reasonable. The staff/owners were very friendly and welcoming. Couldn't have had a better experience. We would definitely recommend and plan on returning as soon as possible. Thanks for a wonderful meal and the conversation. Cheers.
