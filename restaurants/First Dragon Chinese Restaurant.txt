Text: The people here are very rude. They welcome you by just saying "what do you want". I don't care if you can't speak English well, at least be polite. Then they ignore you until you get your food. The only thing unique about their food is that you get an abundance of it. Then if you are waiting for change to get for a tip, they automatically take money out of your change instead. Bad service, bad quality, overall bad experience.

Text: Family oriented business, owned by a local family. About a 10 min takeout wait but a lot of food for what you pa . The fried dumplings and walnut chicken are my favorite!

Text: A fun place, and the Mongolian Beef was appropriately spicy. I'd eat here again any time.
