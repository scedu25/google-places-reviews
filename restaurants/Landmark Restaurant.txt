Landmark Restaurant

Text: I have eaten here several times. The food is usually very good and the service excellent.  However today was different.  We have been waiting for our food for over 45 minutes.  When we finally got our waitress to come by,  we were told it probably will be another 10 or 15 minutes.  That makes our wait at least an hour. I might understand if the place was packed but that is not the case today. It isn't even half full. Not sure what has changed here but I guess I will look for another restaurant. Very sad!

Text: Every time I come to this area from TN, I have to go to the Landmark.  The food is excellent, service is great and everyone, (especially me), just flat out loves Savannah.  She makes me want to come back over and over.  Best place to eat around Cedar and St Clair county Missouri.
