Text: A good buffet,  service is okay,  the seats are pretty worn(my seat was like a sinkhole in the middle of it),its a good place to eat.

The booth seats are getting worse almost every visit, some have tears that have duct tapes or have weird alignment.  Wish they would update the seats. Slowly becoming dated

Text: Not sure how this place stays in buseness. Buffet chicken is like jerkey so over done and dryed out you need to grind it first and soak it in milk so you can get it down.
