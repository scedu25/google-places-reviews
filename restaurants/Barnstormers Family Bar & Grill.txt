Text: Great food and excellent service from our server Tim.  Ate lunch with my family, my brother and dad. All seven of us had great meals and enjoyed a nice family lunch. The atmosphere is fantastic and the bar is decorated with neat automotive and avaiation decor. Very neat and I highly recommend.

Text: Landed at the Norfolk Airport (KOFK) around dinner time.  Heard about Barnstormers Restaurant on the field from some friends who have eaten there after the new ownership and thought I'd give it a whirl.  I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!  Some people judge a restaurant by their burgers, for me, it's a Reuben.  I have had A LOT of Reuben sandwiches over the years and the one I had at Barnstormers was in the top 3 I've ever had.  Darius - our server was super friendly, the food came out fast and hot, restaurant is clean and family friendly.  Looked busy for Thursday night.  Ice Tea was never empty.  If you're driving or flying through Norfolk, NE, give this place a whirl.  You'll love it!!  I'll be a repeat customer!!
