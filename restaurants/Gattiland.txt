Text: If I could give zero stars I would! I will never go back. The pizza sauce had an after taste that stay with you long after eat the pizza from the buffet.  I was so upset that we did not even play games! It was disappointing my kids just wanted to eat the garlic bread with was the only thing good! So it was over priced for garlic bread!

Text: Ordered a pizza for pickup before going shopping into the Kroger next door. About twenty minutes after placing our order, we finish up shopping, so right on time to get a fresh pizza. The pizza was not fresh at all. The box they handed us had splattered sauce on the top and looked like it had been handled quite a bit. When we got home (just a few blocks away), the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours. It wasn't hot. I think they gave us a pizza that someone had ordered, but never picked up. Disgusting.

Text: This place is trash. I went there for some fun and enjoyment. The food was absolute garbage. When trying to cash in tickets a man who worked there yelled at me. And had to leave without getting anything. Worst trip ever.

Text: Great buffet, fun for the kids, and the dessert pizza with ice cream is incredible!
