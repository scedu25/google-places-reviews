Text: We googled for a cafe and another cafe and this place came up.  This place was 1.5 miles further and boy howdy was it worth it. Her special today was hot roast beef with mashed potatoes and corn.  FABULOUS.    take the cpl of minutes extra drive and show this lady some love.  She does not order her ingredients from a supplier, she drives 55 miles to grocery shop on her own. She bakes homemade pies and hopefully you catch her with pie on hand as she runs out quickly. She makes everything from scratch. Go and enjoy.

Text: My husband and I were looking for a place to stay for our first night on our honeymoon. We came across this as an option however ended up staying in julesburg. The next morning we stopped here at the cafe and toured the rooms and immediately regretted not staying here. Great food, unique style, and very friendly. Don't regret passing up this experience like we did!

Text: How charming!  Good food and people.  I know they don't like the piano in the dining area but it needs to stay.  It is the icing on the cake!
