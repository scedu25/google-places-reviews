Al Bawadi Grill

Text: Overall this restaurant is one of the best in the Bridgeview area or maybe the top rated on number 1 in Chicago. I've noticed that with any restaurants if you need or expecting a great service then go during less busiest hours. Now there prices of their menu is quite outrageous. 

One last thing about their bathroom is there water pressure runs too slow and also it's very freezing cold water. They need to fix that problem. At least have warm water in the bathroom. Last time I was there, they finally fixed it ?.

Text: Can never go wrong with Bawadi. Authentic flavors with all the spices and herbs. Grilled meats for all of your tastebuds, whether my favorite meat, or chicken and seafood. Very nice and cozy inside, service is consistent and the best Middle Eastern/Arabic food in the area, if not all of Chicagoland. Perfect to take your friends or family to dine in and still hits the spot if you take it to go. They can get very busy so plan ahead.
