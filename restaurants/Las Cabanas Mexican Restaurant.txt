Text: Pretty decent place to eat. Local and not a chain. Chips and salsa were great, chips delivered hot and kept full as we ate. Food and service was pretty good as well.

Text: Absolutely wonderful food and great service. The enchilada sauce was full of flavor. The entire restaurant is inside of a beautiful craftsman home. What a perfect experience and hidden gem.
