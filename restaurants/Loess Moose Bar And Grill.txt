Text: So far everything is top flight! We always love smaller places the best!! This qualifies. Great service. Great food as well. Wow is the best words for everything! Then we got the bill! Came back to edit in a five star rating! I had the hand breaded pork tenderloin sandwich and my wife had the Italian beef. We both loved and shared our sandwiches with eacn other. Mark the place on Google maps for a return visit sometime.

Text: Had the bbq chicken Sunday special. Wonderful. I would order it again if I lived here. Excellent cooks in that kitchen. Fantastic service staff out front. I sat at the bar. They knew most of the people who came up to order something by name, and knew most of what they wanted to order. A wonderful local crowd, most of who were there to play a Trivia gamed hosted by an employee at the library on the last Sunday of the month. A great roadside experience for my visit to Iowa. I would recommend the Loess Moose to anyone.

Text: Had a pretty good breakfast.  Steak, eggs, hash browns and toast.  They have specials every night.  Definitely worth stopping in and checking them out.
