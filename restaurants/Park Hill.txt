Text: Great place for a sit down meal in Atwood! They are known for their Mexican food - and I love their Chicken Quesadillas and Beef & Cheese Sopapillas - and you can't go wrong one of those!  However my very favorite meal there is their Ribeye sandwich!  So I have to eat there at least twice whenever I'm in town!
