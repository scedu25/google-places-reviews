Text: Great food. Great service. The bacon wrapped fried jalapeño poppers were incredible served with a sweet dipping sauce, very unique. All the beers we tried were delicious as well even bought a growler to go. Definitely be visiting again.

Text: Good food but nothing special or incredible about it. It’s great to take your relatives to when they come to town but for a date night I’d pick somewhere else. The service is good and I have no problems there. Overall not a bad place.

Text: Rock Bottom's a cozy, primarily-meat-and-potatoes joint that I can't really not recommend if you're not feeling adventurous.

Things are limited here. There's not a vastly expansive menu and there's not a mile-long beer list; you're stuck with Americana and that ain't so bad here. It won't take you long to decide, seeing as you're not mired in an array of choices.

Good burgers, I've been several times and always cooked just right. The house drafts are all good and they offer pairing suggestions if you're into that. The staff are a friendly bunch and that's always appreciated. Prices are reasonable for what you'll see downtown.

No frills, solid as the goddamn Midwestern soil in the depths of winter.

Text: We ate lunch there 9/13/2017, I had the cheddar cheese burger and onion rings my wife had cod fish and chips.
Food was delicious. Service was good overall a pleasant surprise. Would highly recommend.

Text: Bourbon burger was average, though cooked properly.  Bar service was poor, not just for myself, but others felt the same, and during not prime-time.  Plenty of other options in the area.
