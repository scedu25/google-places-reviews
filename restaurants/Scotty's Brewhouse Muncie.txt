Text: Things seems better at Scotty's! We stopped going for a while, because the food was just okay, but this last couple of times the food and service were great. We recommend going a little bit before lunch time or dinner time to get better service, they aren't swamped and can be more attentive. It's definitely a place to go if you want some burgers and beer!

Text: Fine place decent menu.  No tater tots anymore though. Once it took forever to get my meal to me on a slow afternoon. But last time I was there they at least had the Steelers game on which is more than I could say for other establishments.  Fun sports bar vibe.

Text: Just sad to see the decline of such a local icon.  It's been going downhill for years now with consistency issues and poor food.  The latest menu changes complete its journey.  Doubt I'll be headed back.  At least the service was good, not always a guarantee there any more.

Text: Came to the Muncie location, it took 42 minutes for a server to come to the table after the hostess seated us.  We then ordered drinks and food at the same time, we had plenty of time to decide.  We ordered beers, food, and waters.  The beers came and tasted fine.  The food was right behind.  We were surprised that the food came so fast until we took a bite.  We then were not surprised, because it was possibly made yesterday.  It was almost room temperature.  We left about half of our meals.  We paid our bill of 36$.  All in all, worst restaurant experience possibly I have ever had.  Won't be back.
