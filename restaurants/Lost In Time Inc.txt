Text: The ambiance, decor, waitstaff and food is amazing.  Both breakfast and lunch were yummy and spot on.  Very reasonable, good portions, and home cooking.  And then you add in the bakery items and desserts, not enough words to describe how good they were.  We will be back again and again...... So well worth the 92 miles round trip.

Text: The food here was great. I just happened by chance and was not disappointed in the least. Had the beef brisket? special and a dessert. Definitely save room for dessert if you go here.
