Text: Got kicked out because they smelled alcohol on me :/  and they serve alcohol.  Rude staff.  Expensive.  I would advise to go somewhere else.

Text: The salami and ham on my sandwich was a bit over cooked and it was kinda stringy around the edge making it just ok. My husband and daughter both said their lasagna and chicken Alfredo meals were great. They were busy we waited 10 minutes longer than online ordering  said it would.
