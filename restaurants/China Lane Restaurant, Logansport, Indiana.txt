Text: China Lane,
My husbands and my first time at China Lane. We ordered the "Triple Deluxe" veggies & beef in sauce.  Approximately $8.99 per plate and of course two can share 1plate of fried rice, though we were interested in taking home extra.(We ordered 2 dishes of fried rice).
Menu did not list a 2 meat entree w/vegetable, and choice of white or fried rice. If your taste is for fried rice?
You must order a plate of fried rice (served with a steel/medal lid so it remains steamed and doesn't become dry). Every dish is designed to present white rice. Setting: It is a booth seating area which was comfortable;(not a buffet). Waiter was amazing he remembered everything w/out writing it down, and served dishes to each patron at our table without hesitation. Waiter had a good sense of humor too! Atmosphere was pleasant with soft Asian music playing low. 
Close to our home. 
Would return.

Text: One of the eatery staples of Logansport! I have been eating at China Lane for the past 8 years and have NEVER been disappointed! The staff is super helpful and friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. No other Chinese food establishment comes close to the taste/quality of China Lane.

Text: Ignore the crybaby who gave it 2*s they were right about 1 thing though and Lauren is pretty awesome. 
Food was good, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large. I'm a larger sized guy and am always hungry and typically eat a lot. I ordered 1 dish and ate a little under half and am stuffed. This was a very nice experience and I will definitely come back given the opportunity.
Also I am vegetarian and they had good options and Tofu
