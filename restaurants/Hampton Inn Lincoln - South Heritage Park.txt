Text: The staff is excellent and the rooms are really clean and well kept. My room upon checkin was warm, there was a problem with the A/C, and the staff swapped me into another room with no queations asked. The breakfast is the typical waffle, fruit, pastry type. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms spacious.
