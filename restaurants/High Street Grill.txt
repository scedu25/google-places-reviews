High Street Grill
Rating: 2
Text: Given the cost (admittedly, there were a number of drinks ordered), there are many better options to dine. Our problem was that we were attending the Columbus Jazz Orchestra concert and there simply are not many dining options near enough to the Southern Theater. As a result, this restaurant has a captive audience. Nonetheless, it was sparcely populated. Probably because the food and service are not very good - the beef tenderloin was overcooked and rather than ask whether I had a rum preference, I was brought Captain Morgan spiced. I assure you, I will not return, despite any convenience.
