Text: I really enjoy stir crazy! I love that you get to choose your own ingredients. You even get to watch them cook the food. Great service!

Text: It's really a cool place for someone who like Asian fusion food! The dining room is beautiful with Asian style. Service is great and quit! I like to hangout with friends here. Drinks and food is kinda pricey. I love Thai iced tea here :)

Text: I liked this stir fry place. Great staff and spacious seating arrangement. The only reason to take away 2 stars is finding White moldy snowbeans in vegetable counter. However they replaced it immediately once notified. Hope they will take care of it in future.

Text: I used to love this place. After two years of living in Pittsburgh, I was excited have lunch at Stir Crazy while visiting St. Louis this week. During my visit today I saw that the menu has changed significantly and this restaurant now has fewer options. I found the food to be very bland (especially compared to how it used to be) and the chicken meat in my entree had the texture of what one might find in a frozen dinner. It wasn't worth the price and I'm not coming back.
