Text: The best part is the comfy table seating with local historical documents embedded in the table tops.  Learn fun facts while you eat.
Otherwise, a typical hometown ice cream and snack shop. Plenty of ice cream choices and greasy spoon type food like burgers and fries.   Okay service, but servers get very confused during the rare times it gets crowded.  4 1/2 stars

Text: This is everything I miss about getting ice cream as a kid. It's got the 50s look, quick and friendly staff, and pretty cheap prices. Great selection of ice cream treats. Great atmosphere. Great place to take your kids to get a break from the heat. It's enclosed, so no melting cone! I love it!

Text: We stopped here on a busy afternoon running errands. Yes, there are young people working here and it's possibly their first jobs. I can appreciate that. We all had a first hob and we were all young and learning once. I am sure I wasn't the best waitress Wingas cafe ever saw, 43 years ago.

 But, the service here was fine and they were clean and very friendly. The food exceeded our expectations. The decor is fun as well. I will stop back for sure.

Text: THEY CHARGED ME $3.80 FOR. $1.10 WAFFLE BOWL. and I did not get three waffle bowls like I was expecting for that price. There is flies all over me as I write this and I am very upset about the 300% more waffle bowl than what I expected. And for that matter... WHAT THE SIGN SAYS.

Text: Servers are great, but my food is always under cooked! Grilled cheese, pulled pork, & Bosco sticks are a variety of things I order.. Don't think anything I have ever ordered has been thoroughly heated! They seem rushed.
