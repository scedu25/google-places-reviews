Text: A group went there after a "calling" in Fremont.  We were put in a corner booth that was an odd shape and the lady with us had a hard time with it and so did we. The waitress was attentive at first so no complaints in this regard. The special, Catfish, was $18 so I deferred to the hamburger, which was a bit better than a Whopper, with Yam fries. Price was about $8. We did not have alcohol but it is available in most varieties. We think this place needs a bit of upgrading but we go there from time to time in the summer.

Text:    Located in a nice quiet country area.  They  have front porch outdoor dinning, and a cozy indoor atmosphere with booth and table seating.  This place even has a semi separate bar area with stools.
   Good peach sangria , sweet potato fries, and a great ribeye steak,  YUM .  
   Really good service.  Friendly, quick, and  pretty cute ta boot.  
   Could not be more happy and satisfied.   Prices are reasonable for what you get.  $$???

Text: Went based on previous reviews and it is obvious that people do not know what good food really tastes like. The fish sandwich was greasy and all bread. The two fish filets on the sandwich were about 3" long, 1" wide and 1/4" thick and cost $8.99 and not much flavor. I should have returned it. The facility was cute, service was good but food, not good.
