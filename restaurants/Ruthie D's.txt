Text: My wife and I had the fish bite appetizers, some wine with salads and we split the Surf and Turf dinner. The food was excellent and the service was top notch! The owner came by our table and we had a great conversation. The restaurant also has a good view of the lake. We will be coming back for sure!

Text: Excellent service. Average food. Prime rib finished on a flattop was kinda weird. Prices are what you expect at a lake resort town, $25 per person without drinks.

Text: The chicken piccata is the BEST I've ever had -- delicious! Service is always excellent, as well. Christoph and Kendra in the bar area always take great care of us.
