Text: Good food. When a restaurant is busy, you know it's good! Food delivered within 10 minutes after ordering.

Text: I've been here a few times in the service and the value was great but I ended up in Ottumwa Iowa where this restaurant is for 2 days and twice when I ate there the service was poor and the food was horrible... over easy eggs were over hard hash browns were burnt and my ground beef patty was well done instead of medium rare.. when I ordered a gyro sandwich the pita was stale and the french fries were cold and the waitress just said do you want some more fries and I said no and I handed the plate back to the Cook paid my bill and walked out...

Text: My one complaint is they put imitation cheese on my burger. A slice of real cheddar would have made it just right. Everything else was good, friendly staff and decent food.

Text: My mom and I eat here often and have yet to be dissapointed! Highly reccomend the skillets for breakfast or the Bacon and Cheese chicken. A family favorite for sure!
