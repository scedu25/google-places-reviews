Text: My husband and I went to Prison Brews for the first time today with the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association. We were very very pleased with everything there. The unique decor and atmosphere is very fun and intriguing. Everything was clean and well kept. The waitress Allison was friendly, pleasant and good at her job. The manager, Cliff was friendly and professional, easy to talk with. We ordered a supreme pizza which was very good..well cooked, and tasty. We will definitely be there again and recommend it to friends.

Text: Visited for lunch on a Sunday on my way home from Ozarks. Their menu was full of delicious sounding options! I went for the Club and it was pretty good. I could tell that it was a very well loved spot by the locals. I want to go back in the summer and enjoy the outdoor seating options! Good stuff!

Text: My husband and I like to go on Saturday evenings. They have BBQ Ribs for their special, and they are sooo good. The side salad is excellent, I always get their fries also. They top it off with an awesome dessert crisp, which is homemade. I highly recommend that anyone who likes BBQ Ribs  check it out.

Text: I visit prison Brews regularly when in town as its my favorite local restaurant. the staff is great there always but I wanted it to be noted that the new bartender was excellent. She was friendly, efficient, accurate, and was always busy wiping down behind the bar and doing it with a smile!  She is refreshing ! Looking forward to seeing her again!

Text: Fun decor, especially after touring the Missouri State Penn, which I recommend. Decent bar food and beer. Strangely fast, but friendly service. Management was keen to ensure everything was good.
