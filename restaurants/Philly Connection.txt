Text: Found this place on Google maps as I was passing through and the good reviews convinced me to try it out. I kept it simple and got the 7-in philly combo w/o onions...Both the sandwich and fries were good but I was disappointed with the proportions. There was not much meat and the provolone was a very thin slice that could only be tasted if other ingredients weren't included in your bite. Also, the combo comes with medium fries but it would have been a surprise if it would've filled up a small container from Wendy's. However, I still give them 4 stars because even though the portions were small, they tasted fresh and delicious. If for some reason I decide to stop by again, I will opt for a different item.

Text: I was surprised at how good the cheesesteak sandwich was. Everything was hot & the funnel fries were delicious.

Text: Good, hot, fresh food. Now serving fried green tomatoes and the deep fried mushrooms are the bomb!

Text: I love their subs. I always get a 7 in. my cheese steak w/ American and provolone, light lettuce, mushrooms, pepperoni, banana peppers, A1, mayo and grilled onions. I always get fries and a drink. Great price for the amount of food you get. Service is always great. I have never had a bad experience.
