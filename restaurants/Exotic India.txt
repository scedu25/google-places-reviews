Exotic India

Text: This is the best Indian food in Iowa city and rivals many of the places I went to in India. The staff are very friendly and quick. The food selections are broad with many vegetarian options. They also have a lunch buffet that is all-you-care-to-eat, and trust me you will want to eat a lot. I recommend this to anyone who loves Indian food and the buffet for those who want to try Indian for the first time.

Text: This is the best Indian food in the area. At the other restaurants, every dish tastes the same. Here the flavors are rich and subtle and varied, and you can taste every ingredient. Service is friendly.
