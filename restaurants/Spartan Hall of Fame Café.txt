Text: Good food, decent service. Nice atmosphere. Been here many times. However, I find it strange for a sportsbar to not allow the sound from a game being shown on 8 of the 13 TVs in the bar. Instead they play music in the "sports" bar area.

Text: On a not busy night we walked in and were seated by the hostess, then no one stopped by for 15 minutes. At least 3 different servers walked by without a glance. Hostess behind us was busy on the phone the entire time. Finally I asked to speak to the manager, he said he would take care of us and was very apologetic. Waitress finally came over and took our beer order, and the manager delivered it. Then...10 more minutes of waiting and no one stopped by, so we just left. Absolutely pathetic lack of attentiveness. I'm not even mad, I just won't ever go back.

Text: Great atmosphere, food and service. Outstanding prime rib! Love all the MSU memorabilia too! Especially fun Friday evenings before a home football game. Go green!

Text: Great food, great atmosphere. Docking it one star because the booths are way too packed in. Most of us couldn't breathe and we had to be moved to the high chair area.

Text: Good food, good service, cold beer, frosted mugs, they were busy and still we were waited on in timely manner. I have been there a few times and every time it has been good.
