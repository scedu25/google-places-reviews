Happy Wok

Text: I'm seriously going to give the Happy 4 stars right now. I feel like they've stepped up their game the past couple years in quality of food surpassing Wong Wong and Lung Fung. It's really solid, definitely not the best Chinese you've had, but super affordable with big portions and solid taste. Stick to take-out/drive-through because the inside restaurant is a total dumpster fire.

Text: Down and dirty Chinese food when you're in a hurry. The staff is good and accommodating. It is a go-to place when you're indecisive, hungry, and in don't have a load of time or money. Once again, they have good help. They get a star unto themselves.

Text: Took almost two hours for delivery. No apology. No credit. Nothing. Plus the people answering the phones are like 10 year olds.

Text: What happened to this location? We go out of our way to this location because it used to be the best. Now it's frozen peas and carrots with dried out chicken and stale cashews. You were our last try for Happy Wok. Also when you go in look back at the kitchen and pray!!

Text: We've been to a few Happy Wok restaurants, this one had great food too. I was impressed that this location has 64 oz size super family dinners.
