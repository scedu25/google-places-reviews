The service is good and the food is great. I don't go here a lot, but every time me my wife and our 3 small kids go we have a good time and leave satisfied.

Text: It's an Irish pub. What you should know is that a quesadilla or a bowl of chili is something different here but what it is is excellent. They have great Irish mainstays like Shepard pie but I haven't tried one thing that didn't surprise me with it's flavor or approach. We even thought the kids chicken fingers taste better.
