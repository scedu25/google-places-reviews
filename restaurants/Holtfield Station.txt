Text: Truthfully I haven't tried enough to be accurate on overall quality, but 24/7 hours with a surprising menu and the best selection of cheese cakes which are addictive.
It is a busy place and not easy to get in and out during most daylight hours, but better than going to horribly small Speedway with microwavable food. 
Only one grade of gas I believe.

Text: Always pleasant! Everyone there is always so nice. When our extended family is in town we always order blts for everyone from their kitchen. Not only is it delicious but they can actually make the 16 different sandwiches right. Always with a smile too!
