Back Forty Bar & Grill

Text: The food here in my opinion has gone downhill.   I really looked forward to a burger but what I received was NOT what I expected.   The waitress didn't even bother to ask how our food was and that was disappointing... They would of had a chance for a better review.  My youngest wasn't happy with her wings as they seemed to be undercooked .  I do like the atmosphere but we would definitely think twice about going here again.   I always used to recommend the Back Forty but not sure I will be making that recommendation anytime soon.  To bad as I prefer to support local businesses.

Text: If you like Home cooked meals, this is the place to go! I've tried several dishes and was never disappointed. We live in Omaha, and will continue to keep going out of the way to enjoy good food. P.S., I'm picky about my food and having good flavor.

Text: Awesome little bar and grill. The food is great and they always given you plenty. The specials are always good as well. The bar is nice and rustic inside with a fireplace. We like to go here on the bikes. It's a nice scenic route to get here and we know the beer is cold.
