Hollywood Casino & Hotel Joliet
Rating: 4
Text: It has been quite awhile since I've been to Hollywood Casino.  I love that there is no more smoking here.  Waitstaff was attentive, and dealers we pretty friendly.  It appears that the business may have slowed in recent years, as it was easy to play any table on a Saturday night.  Lost money, but had fun.

Text: Used to be good.  The machines are tight.  They cut back on the quality of food in the VIP Lounge.  Room filled with dirty tables with food left from previous guest.

Text: It isn't very big, but the game variety is nice. For the most part it is clean, and there are usually games available even on busy nights. The snack center on the lower level has a particularly cranky woman who usually works Friday evenings. Watch out for her.

Text: I don't even want to give any star to this place.people are just racist.! Especially, Roulette dealer.They just clean your pockets out??!!We all know that table are controlled. But at least in Harrahs Casino makes you win!!? So, you still come back and enjoy returning. The dealer are friendlier.
