Mancy's Steakhouse

Text: Food is awesome. Ambient is great. Stuff is nice. But to get 5*, they need to work on the silver ware: that's rusty and good for a 5$ dinner. But not for such a restaurant

Text: Love the ambiance and decor of Mancy's. This used to be a late relatives favorite spot. I can totally see why.  Great food, great service, and really fun atmosphere.  

A word of caution on how you like your steaks. One of the most frustrating things for me is the inconsistency you get from place to place. I normally order a steak medium rare because it tends to be over cooked most places. Not here, Mancy's cooks their stakes the way they should be.  So if you like a medium rare steak most places, you're probably better off with a medium.  

We will be making the hour drive back soon!

Text: This place has the BEST ribeye I have ever eaten! My husband and I had just got into to town. We were moving clothes... (not dressed for going in somewhere to eat) we pulled up. And everyone going in was dressed up. I didn't want to go in. My husband made and I'm glad he did! They didn't look at us weird or anything! They welcomed us and treated us like everyone one else! AWESOME PLACE!

Text: Good food and service. Steaks are the specialty here, and they're worth driving to North Toledo for. The inside of the restaurant is dark--perhaps a bit too dark. I sometimes wonder how the ceiling and floor would look in the light. But the food is excellent.

Text: The steak is absolutely incredible! Their New York Strip steak is seasoned to absolute PERFECTION! Prices are high, but it's worth every penny. Great for special occasions
