Text: Great Texas Style BBQ! Love the pulled pork and the turkey. Sliced brisket is good just not my fave since they remove bark and fat cap which makes it dry. All employees are  very friendly and helpful.

Text: It's good.  Better than most. Get there early. It tends to dry out. Burnt ends are beef. A bit tough.  Pork is better.

Text: Food was dry and cost was $48.00 for 2. For this cost, you're much better off going to Outback steak house or Texas road steak house. Plates are plastic. Ugh, bad place to eat. Didn't like it at all. My honest opinion here.
