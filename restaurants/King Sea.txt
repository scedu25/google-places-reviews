Text: Just tried to order my meal and asked for sauce on the side since I don't live  in town and would like not to have my meal be soggy by the time I go back to Sioux Falls. I was rudely informed by the cook that he can't do that anymore despite the fact that's how I've always ordered it. I asked how hard it was just to not include the sauce in my fried chicken and he said he won't do it anymore and told me to go somewhere else. Gladly, you will no longer get my service!

Text: Its actually a lil drive thru like building that is quick to make a order by walking up to walk up order window or drive thru window. Its pretty well good with service time but is more than easier to have it ordered for delivery then waiting for your order in the heat on hot summer days we may have gotten or has gotten up to for the high temps. If you feel like waiting for your order for pick up in the coldest days during the winters. That would actually depend on temperature it may get up/down to and how much snow we've received if a winter storm has or beginning to hit us.

Text: I ordered from here, the crab rangoon smelled and tasted like sour milk. I called to see about getting different ones, the lady got on and refused different ones and said they were made fresh daily. They had to be sitting out all day or they weren't made fresh!! she was very rude and refused to do anything about it. I will not be ordering from here again. P.s. this was my favorite place to order when I was a kid!!!

Text: it used  to be good when it was downtown, but since they have moved it is absolutely horrible food,  the food got me sick! and I only ate a little bit of it because it did not taste good or fresh, they must use old oil to fry in because that is how it tasted
