Text: Pork was so hard you couldnt cut threw it, then when I went to pay and told the lady she didn't even think to say sorry or anything. Needless to say I won't be back there!!!!

Text: The chicken fried rice was horrible, both it and the sweet and sour chicken was very low quality dark meat. The sweet and sour sauce was not sweet and sour sauce, it was plum sauce. We are being very generous giving two stars. ?

Text: My family and I frequent this restauraunt when we are in the area.  I have always been very pleased with the service and quality of food they have.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a change from the average Oriental food.  Tender Sliced Pork and Almond chicken a Must try!!

Text: When you buy a 99 cent chicken Fry at the store I can see how they charge 8 dollars for it. I will never eat there again.
