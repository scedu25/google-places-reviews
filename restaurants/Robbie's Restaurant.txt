Text: Grumpy waitress told us to find a seat. It was dark and dingy, but we had a seat. As we started to settle in and our eyes became accustomed to the dimness, we saw that our table was dirty. We got up and left. No lunch is good enough to put up with that.

Text: This place is about as lifeless as Lincoln's corpse. Enjoy waiting for 40 minutes and pondering whether you should just pull a Lincoln yourself and put a bullet in the back of your head. Not recommended unless you are a fan of 1970s placemats or enjoy talking to people who think "wifi" is a rare European disease.

Text: They have some great music on early Friday evenings.  However, we have tried several items from their dinner menu and the food is average at best.

Text: Food decent. Had tuna/salad combo for about $8. Hostess, Carol, was very nice. Laid back, cool ambience, smooth jazz playing...overall good experience.
