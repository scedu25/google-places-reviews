Lazlo's Brewery & Grill - South

Text: I would have to say probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in Lincoln. 
Food was horrible!!!
Enchiladas tasted like they poured can ravioli sauce on top (only ordered because waitress recommended them)
Drinks were made poorly!!
The fresh caught fish my husband ordered was bland and undercooked (regardless of what management said).
Honestly don't know how this place stays in business. 
And $80 later. 
Waste of my time coming here.
At least the staff was very nice and welcoming. Couldn't imagine if that was terrible as well. Ugh!

Text: My wife, daughter, and I ate here, and there was gravy on a meal ordered without gravy. Not a big deal. They took it back made a new one and did not charge for it. That was great. Always a super place to eat, gracious staff and management. I would have paid for it. I'm more of a fast food/chain restaurant guy so I appreciate the experience at Lazlo's.

Text: Always a great standby. Great service. Had the swordfish special which was excellent. Not often that you can say you had  excellent swordfish in Nebraska. Food is always above par and great beers.

Text: We sat on the patio and I enjoyed a glass beer, cup of tomato basil soup, and split a pub-club with my wife. Lazslo's runs a team wait-staff which means everyone who passes your table takes care of issues. We're regulars and I don't see that changing. This restaurant is a great combination of well managed and good menu.

Text: Nice weight staff but our water was never refilled. And my silverware had gunk on it. Lastly, while my salad was okay...why do U serve poor pieces hidden away. Margarita was good.
