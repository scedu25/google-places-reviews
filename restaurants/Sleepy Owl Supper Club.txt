Text: Prime Rib to die for. Love eating on their patio. Relaxing. Good food and service.

UPDATE!!: 
After four great experiences at Sleepy Owl, I have to report a poor experience last night (Halloween). I ordered one of the nughts specials, "stir fry". I was told it was a "steak stir fry." Well, there were a few shards of some sort of beef in the stir fry, but mostly, it consisted of over-coojed peas, broccolli and some flavored rice. Pretty awful. If I'd been in my right mind, I would have refused it. At least my wife had some good soup with the all you can ea, salad. I wish I had ordered differently. 

I am taking a star off my review of Sleepy Owl. I won't stray from their main menu again.

Text: Food was great. Service is good.Go early so you don't get the bums rush. I like to sit and enjoy salad then dinner not get everything at once then check and bye. That's not my cup of tea. I like to go slow and enjoy..
