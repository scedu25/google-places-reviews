Heroes Restaurant & Pub
Rating: 5
Text: I've been going to Heroes since I was 10 years old and the cheese fries are as good now as they were then. And the Unknown Heroes never disappoint (not that I drank them when I was 10... just to clarify :) . My favorite restaurant... not just in Warrensburg, MO, but anywhere.

Text: Excellent local family restaurant. A fully stocked bar and some of the best burgers in town, plus a welcoming, old fashioned atmosphere. The employees hold themselves to a very high standard and it shows.

Text: Food is ok. Prices were a bit high. No cheese on nachos. They do offer a bun less burger but unlike the other burgers it doesn't come with fries  by the time you pay for fries it is the same price as the other burgers with buns. Also the sandwiches are approx the same price as the burgers but they don't come with any sides.  And I emailed them regarding their menu and seeing about gluten free options. However never received a reply.  Our waitress forgot to take our drink order but overall she was pretty good. Bathrooms were clean.

Text: I've been to Heroes at  least 15 times. I love this place. I always tell people how good their B-2 burger is. This is easily my favorite burger I can get anywhere around here. They also have the fresh home fries which to me is a must. If I'm going to have fries I want them to be fresh not frozen. I've also had the pork tenderloin sandwich and its really good as well. I highly recommend this restaurant.
