Text: Me and my wife went here to have the dinner and it was around 10:15pm when we got our check . I forgot my wallet and i don't have cash to pay the bill. I checked with them if they accept apple pay and they do not. I even asked if I can pay by online transfer but it's not possible for them to accept through online transfer. The manager wanted me to leave my wife in the restaurant (@10:30pm) and go home and pick up my wallet. It would take 20minutes for me to drive home and another 20minutes to drive back. I was not willing to leave my wife at that late night in that restaurant but I had no other choice. Actually it was my mistake to forget the wallet but atleast the manager should have showed some courtesy and should have asked me to pay next day and taken my number. Then I got out of restaurant to get my wallet and then my wife called asking if I have VISA CARD number by any chance. I ended up paying using the card number.  I felt the manager is not friendly and didn't handle the situation well.

Text: Great experience. I got a kebab sampler and the babagonoush appetizer. Pretty good, I typically would not seek out Mediterranean style food but having tried this out I would definitely give it another go!
