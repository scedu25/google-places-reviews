Text: Absolutely 5 stars! The staff were very friendly and welcoming. And the food was phenomenal! I ordered a dinner plate with 2 meats and 2 sides. I chose the brisket which was so tender and perfectly smoked. The smoked sausage was amazing as well! Very hard to find brisket that is smoked just right. I ordered fries and baked beans for the sides. The baked beans were amazing as well. Everything very tasty. That guy who left a bad review was probably on drugs or something because he sure wasn’t talking about this place. I say, go for it! You WILL NOT be disappointed! ?

Text: Very delicious BBQ. Somewhat frustrating operation hours when I tried to get dinner on Sunday and they were closed. A very small dinning room that felt a bit cramped at times. Still, the food was still very good!
