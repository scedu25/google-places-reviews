Text: Best restaurant in town. Although their drive thru is always wrapped around the building, they work like a well oiled machine and get customers orders out swiftly and accurately. The staff is very pleasant.

Text: I understand that this place is a local icon, it was busy at 9pm but for the life of me I don't know why. I can describe the food quality in one word..... HORRID! The onion rings were average at best and the cheese burger was simply NASTY. It was a frozen processed patty that tasted like grease and salt. I have had better food in a school cafeteria in a third world country. But if you can not fight the urge and the ravings of those whose taste buds are calibrated differently than mine the banana shake was tasty.

Text: This burger stand is basically a drive thru and a walk up window. There are only a couple of tables outside.  But they are some of the best burgers in town

Text: The Big Dipper. According to Owensboroan's, there is no finer place. The gems are the best (tater tots for y'all outsiders) are greasy and good. The burgers are fresh, covered in mayo, and good. (Mayo is the burger sauce of choice in Owensboro, FYI.) Their chili is amazing, and PLEASE try the pigs-in-a-blanket. Holy moly. (You have to know to ask for this prize.) And, of course, the ice cream. The same place since it opened back in the 50s.

Cash only location. Hence why the prices are low. 

Another note - getting into Big Dipper can be a challenge. It is right next to  Moonlight BBQ, and the line for Big Dipper is often confused for Moonlights. You need to force your way into Big Dipper - a bit of aggression is required.
