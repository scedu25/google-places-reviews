Text: Once again, a delicious range of entrées for our party of 5. They have a very original lineup of dishes, great presentations and friendly wait staff.

Text: Fantastic food and great service.  If you have a special dietary need or special request they will always try to accommodate. The owners are super friendly and will know you by name if you're a regular. Fresh ingredients,  mostly sourced locally make for a great food experience here.

Text: The service can depend wildly on who is on staff, and the restaurant can get a bit cramped at times. While the food is good enough, I honestly prefer Prairie Canary most days. 

It is a much more intimate setting, so if you're in town with family or a small group it's a good pick.

Text: Food was cheap and good, staff was friendly and attentive. People running the place came to talk with each table. I think this shows they care about doing a good job.
