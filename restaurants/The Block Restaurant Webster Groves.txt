The Block Restaurant Webster Groves
Rating: 4
Text: We had a very nice family dinner tonight - requested by my son for his birthday.  Immediate seating as promised.  Imaginative food that was reasonably priced given the quality.  Burger, steak, and trout were all well prepared and satisfying.  Entrees were a little bit salty for my taste but seasonings and sides were artful.  Melon basil sorbet was delightful.  Very comfortable dining room.  Extremely pleasant staff.  Recommend.

Text: Really liked the atmosphere of the place and the unique specials. Seasonal cocktails we're great and if you like the cut off meat you had, you can take it home with you from the butcher shop.
