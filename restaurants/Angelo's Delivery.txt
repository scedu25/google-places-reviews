Text: Food is pretty good. Their spaghetti and meatballs are great!  Pizza is great, especially the spaghetti pizza personally, and their Italian loaf bread is amazing!
Eating in the restaurant is a rip off though as the drinks are outrageous and then they seem to usually get them wrong and the service is not very good...  Some of the wait staff are pretty unprofessional and make too many mistakes and don't come around enough.
This is why the three stars.  Food alone would get 5 but this is a review of eating in the actual restaurant so yeah... Not great.

Text: ? 7/4/17  1:20pm- No to go menu online, also I was as told by the host they do not have to go menu's and we couldn't bring a menu to the car to order. He was rude and when I called the manager they never addressed the problem because they never came to the phone as I waited 5 min. 
Just look at the reviews all around bad customer service.

I don't recommend
