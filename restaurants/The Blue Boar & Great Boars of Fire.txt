Text: Great food but the waitress wanted to play around with her friends at the bar. Everything we asked for we had to ask 3 times. Took 30 or more minutes for cheese sticks that were an appetizer. All this went on while the owner sitting at the bar. This was the second time we had bad service and we be back.

Text: Loved the atmosphere!! The gumbo was delicious, but the Cajun pasta we both got was sub par. The Alfredo tasted so bland definitely not homemade. But the service was great!
