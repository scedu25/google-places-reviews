club 60 steakhouse

Text: This place was by far the best meal I've had since leaving Seattle.

The loss of a star though is due to price. I should NOT be paying Top of the Needle prices for a rural Missouri steakhouse.

2 appetizers, 2 meals and two sodas with tip (which should have been better but I was tapped out) should not run me $100

Servings are generous, the Portobello fries and a house salad would be a meal. Food was great.

Text: Not too bad a place, but pretty expensive.  It seems either the service and/or the food is lacking .  We still eat here on occasion.
