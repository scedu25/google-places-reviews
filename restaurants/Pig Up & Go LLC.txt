Text: For a pick up and go i was disappointed read great reviews. The food was okay but the service leaves something to be desired. I ordered a pulled pork plate and sandwhich and got 2 sandwhichs which isnt the worst. But when i called they said "You didnt check before you left?" I didnt think i had to? Then i was told "cant you just scrape it off the bread" the portions arnt the same. Ill be eating at piggys from now on.

Text: Delicious!

It's not fancy - they're open (as of now) limited hours, the building has no sign out front and it's not on restaurant row, but it's delicious.

It's a metal building but very clean on the inside - food is served on disposable plates, just so you can know what to expect.

I've been there a dozen or so times and love the pulled pork stuffed baked potato.  You have to try it; it's that good.

I don't hand out 5 stars unless it's deserved, and these guys get it.
