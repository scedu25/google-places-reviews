Text: Besides the incorrect order, and the drug addict/selling employees the owner or the manager whoever he does not know how to run a business. Need to get your customer service priorities straight and learn how to take orders over the phone correctly, so no one is waiting for 1 1/2 for there order with limited lunch time.
