Went back tonight with my brother in law and some more friends, our waitress was was on her 2nd day and was a little slow but was very attatinetive and did a good job. Food was excellent again, everyone was commenting on the food being really good.  We will be back!!

Text: The fried mushrooms are a meal in themselves! Visit on Thursdays for 75¢ wings and split the mushrooms with the table. Or, go the traditional route with a breaded Tenderloin.... magnificent! Plus, the garlic butter brushed bun was a fantastic bonus :)

We'll be back, and we're bringing friends!
