Text: I will never spend my money here again..I sent my daughter to pick up an order when she returned the order was wrong. I called in to attempt to get the order replaced and not only was the person who answered the phone rude the owner was just as rude. I told her I have never dealt with a business owner so rude and that I wanted a full refund. When I went in to get my refund the owner's attitude was disgusting she implied that I just wanted free food I told her I didn't want anything free I was willing to pay but because of her poor customer service I will never patronise her business again. Wow!!
