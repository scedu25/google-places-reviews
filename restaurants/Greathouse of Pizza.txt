Text: I'm 53 years old and have been all over the U.S. and Europe, this is the best pizza I have ever had! I got the Chi-town combo which usually comes with a thick crust but I prefer thin so I got thin. I also got a side of Giardinera peppers to add myself, it was phenomenal. Even without the Giardinera peppers it was the best I've ever had but adding just a little of the peppers made it better. I highly recommend.
