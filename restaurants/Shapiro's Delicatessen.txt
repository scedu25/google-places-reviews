Shapiro's Delicatessen
Rating: 5
Text: Shapiro deli is such a great place to have dinner or lunch.  The food is delicious. The service is great too. I like the corned beef on sour dough but their pastrami is very good too. Their Mac & cheese is delicious. Very unique flavor. Their desserts are very good, especially the canoli and Boston cream pie. You must try it if you haven't tried it yet.

Text: I love near Corydon IN and I go to Shapiro's when I am in Indianapolis. I know they are known for their deli sandwiches but I usually get meatloaf, baked chicken or whatever is the daily offering. Everything is good and I have never been disappointed. I have had people say to me that they are high priced. Well, you get what you pay for and what you get at Shapiro's is good food and generous portions. Well worth the price. I look forward to going when I am in Indy.

Text: Are you kidding me?!  This place is a great New York deli in downtown Indianapolis. I got the pastrami on rye. There was so much meat on it was hard to get my mouth around it. And... I couldn’t finish it.

Text: Cafeteria style with plentiful seating that gets very crowded at lunchtime. 

Try stopping for breakfast, which is cooked to order and includes corned beef hash with two eggs and toast for $5.25! A great deal compared to their $15 sandwich.  Not busy at all before 11 AM.

Great selection. Today I had the rate roast beef sandwich. Just fabulous. I stop here as often as I can.
