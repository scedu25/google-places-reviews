Text: You are lucky if you get Stephanie as your server.  She'll make your meal a time to remember with her sense of humor, and positive vibe. The food is amazing, the music ideal, and the cocktails are awesome.  I met two new "girlfriends," Artemis and Athena.

Text: Great place. A little out of the way in the city, but worth finding.  Very clean and relaxed atmosphere inside the restaurant.  The food and the drinks were incredible, and the service was fantastic.  One of the best Greek/Mediterranean restaurants we have experienced.

Text: Momo's is a great place; whether you're just stopping in for a drink or looking to eat a great meal. The decor is really cool but it's still very comfortable. Monika is fantastic!

Text: One of my favorite places. Though options are slim since going vegan, I still ate well. Entertainment is nice as is the ambiance.
