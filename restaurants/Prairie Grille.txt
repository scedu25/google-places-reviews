Text: We were at a reunion for my National Guard unit. Food was good and service staff friendly and always kept drinks full. Sunday Buffet was excellent.  Many choices. My omelet was perfection.

Text: We had ordered our dinner and it came with soup and I had ordered a salad to go along with dinner. We had gotten our dinner and salad at the same time still no soup I had asked the waiter for our soup took him about 8 minutes to get and then he leaves and still no soup spoons had to asked for spoons. Then I  had ordered another glass of wine it took him 10 minutes to get. Finally I told him I wanted to talk to the manager I was pissed and in between he wasn't paying any attention to us he had came by the table twice and that was it.

Text: Ordered room service. The service was great, the food was good with the exception of the chicken having a few really tough spots. Otherwise it was awesome

Text: More than a hotel restaurant. Legendary fish fry and fried chicken. Homemade foods that are made from scratch. Don't let the restaurant in a hotel scare you off. Let me explain, I feel most hotel restaurants serve their hotels guests as a captive audience where customer service and pricing is not a focus. This place offers great food at great pricing with friendly, professional staff. I was greeted with a smile as I walked in for dinner.

Text: Standard breakfast buffet offerings but good nonetheless. Only 1 waffle maker though so you may not get lucky in the rush.
