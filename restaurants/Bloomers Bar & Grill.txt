Text: I feel comfortable in your establishment. The food is hot and good. The service is friendly. I think you have a turn over problem. I am single and come in and always feel comfortable

Text: Good staff and friendly service. Not bad price for the food. Salad chunks were three times the normal bite size. No tortias in the tortia soup and have had better. The ice tea and beer were good. Clean restrooms.

Text: Food is always excellent.  Last couple visits service left a little to be desired. Fair price for food and great viewing to watch sports. Always stop here when visiting Harley Davidson across the street.
