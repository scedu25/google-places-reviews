Text: My wife and i ate here today for the first time and i must say i was very impressed. Truly the best burger ive ever eatin in my life and i ate half of my wifes steak as well and it was even better. We arrived at 330 not realizing the resteraunts didnt open until 430 and as we were about to drive away owner noticed us and welcomed us in early. Truly very good food and the friendliest service ive seen in a long time. People and friends if u havent tried this place i highly recommend it.
