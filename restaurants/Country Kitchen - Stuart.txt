Country Kitchen - Stuart
Rating: 3
Text: Adequate and acceptable.  The food was served in a timely manner.  The price was reasonable and fair.  However, the service we received was not warm and friendly but rather nonchalant.  The taste of the food was more institutional than home cooked.  Nothing was bad - not at all.  However, nothing about our experience here made us wish to return next time we pass through the area unless we have limited restaurant choices.

Text: Cool restaurant. I like this kind of restaurant.
Will be super cool if Country Kitchen could be placed close to interstate and to a lot of them.
Thousand of truckers will say " Big thanks ".
We can't eat any more unhealthy food like fast-food .

Text: Food is good, but sometimes the service is really lacking. Went in on a Sunday morning and was seated by the hostess. And then that was it. Server never came around. I helped myself to the buffet. Twice. No water, no coffee, nothing. That was the worst. Sometimes you can't get your drink refilled. Sometimes you're done eating and you can't get your check.  But that's ok. It gives me a chance to type up a review while I'm waiting, right?
