Text: Sometimes it's the little things that make or break a dining experience. Friendly service? Yep, found it here. Decent food? Check #2. Jesus music blaring throughout the place? BUZZER!!!!.  I've always wanted to eat at this chain because who doesn't want breakfast food, but hopefully the feeling of having to  give 10% of my income as a tithe doesn't carry over to other locations. Briefly looking over the website didn't point to having a religious experience with your pancakes, so maybe it's just this location. At any rate I won't be coming back to the Lancaster restaurant. May sound petty, but little things.....

Text: One would think a place called Scramblers would make good eggs.  Not the case, unless you like a rubbery texture.  Everything else on the plate straight out of a can.  Will not return.

Text: Top quality food, good selection of breakfast and lunch items.  If you go, you HAVE to try their toast, it's the best toast I have ever had!  I have never seen the dining area cluttered or dirty.  Good wait staff, even when they are extremely busy.  There is a private glass walled dining area to hold lunch meetings and such.  Only wish they would be open for dinner.
