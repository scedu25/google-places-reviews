Text: Best food in town, this is the place we always pick when going out to eat  The owner is very family oriented & creates a friendly atmosphere for customers.  Food is homemade & always great quality.   Their Hawaiian pizza is the best!  We have always had great servers who are personable & know us by name.  Thank you for having a great atmosphere & reasonable prices for families!

Text: Ordered the salmon and lasagna and it took 45 minutes to get our food. When I asked the server about it, she said, "I don't know. I'm just a waitress." She never came back to check on us after our food came. The lasagna was greasy and kind of gross. The salmon was pretty good. We never got our check so just went to the register and asked for it. The owner told me the server was busy and that it took a long time to get our food because the salmon and lasagna take a long time to cook. No apologies. Just excuses. Will not be going back. The people at the table behind us seemed pretty annoyed too with how long it was taking to even get drinks.
