Cimino's Little Italy

Text: Please ignore the hater that posted against this establishment. Cimino's  is absolutely the best Italian in the area- seriously, you have to go to Madison to find better food, selection and service. Not kidding. We have found that if you're going out to eat in FPT, Cimino's is the only palatable choice for miles.

Text: Have eaten here many times, I have always had very good service and food. Tonight was a exception.  We came in for take out. They said it would be 20 min . We sat in the bar waiting for the pizza 30 minutes went by nothing ready yet , went up to ask and they came out with it . It tasted like it was under  a heat lamp . Artichoke dip was good but the chips and the bread that were served with it separately or soggy. We were not even asked if we would like another drink. Very disappointed

Text: Hands down, the best Easter and Mother's Day buffet around. Do make reservations as they fill up quick. Very nice atmosphere and the food is great (not just on holidays)
The owner and staff really seem to care about the customers.

Text: If I could give negative stars I would. First and for most, train the staff better. Appetizers come before a meal. Not with. Not after your main course. Oh, and how about bring a main course when you order it. People usually don't come to a restaurant to watch everyone else eat. When I asked to speak to a manager the response was "there isn't one here". Umm are  you kidding me. I have been waiting  now 10 mins to speak to someone. The person that did come speak to me, was kind and apologetic. Gave my friend that was with me half off of her bill. That's not what we were seeking (very kind gesture) did her all to try and correct the horrible service we received. It was appreciated
