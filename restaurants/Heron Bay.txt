Text: Enjoyed our stop here during a Saturday ride. Bloody Mary's were excellent, even though somewhat expensive ($8).  Beer was cheap, $3.50 for a bottle of domestic.  

We were there when there wasn't many people there, but we were told it does get quite busy.

It's a dive bar, don't expect anything fancy and you won't be disappointed. Bathrooms are clean and the patio is big with a relaxing view.

*Edit*
Eaten here twice now. I have found the food to be average at best. The patty melt was bad, the patty was dry and flat like it was pressed down on the drill a bunch. Chicken wrap was good but lettuce was soggy.  The fried mushrooms and jalapeno poppers were good but they seemed like they're just dropped in a fryer.

Text: Words can't express what a fantastic spot this is. First time I met the owner, Smitty, I felt like I was with family. They have really tasty food. I had the cheeseburger and tatertots. It was delicious. The waitress, Dawn, was funny, cute and efficient.  The aesthetics, it's  as close to being on the river without being in the River. Try it out!!!! You 2 will love it.

Text: Great patio on the river. Food was also pretty decent. The kitchen was pretty slow so it took some time between ordering and having food served even though it wasn't busy.

Text: What a delightful riverside diner and bar! My sister, her husband, and I had a delightful time sitting outside, enjoying the views of the Platte River and of the trains going by on the opposite shore. The food was delicious and the wait staff efficient and helpful! Great choice for a pre-Memorial Day outing!

Text: pretty sure this is the jankiest bar I've ever been to BUT sitting outside on the patio by the river in silence was REALLY nice.  Nicer than the bartender haha
