Text: This place was so great! Great restaurant layout...not crammed or anything. My only critique would be that I felt like I was about to have a seizure while reading the menu...strange lighting/ceiling fan set up. But we quickly got over it when the spinach artichoke dip came out. YUM YUM YUM. I'll drive through Fulton again just for that. Really, really like this place. Absolutely recommend.

Text: I don't  choose 5 stars lightly. This place is AMAZING! From the atmosphere and greeter as soon as you step through the door, to the delicious cheesecake for dessert, and friendly staff, you will definitely be impressed! I highly recommend the Parmesan artichoke dip, and the smoked turkey croissant with garlic aioli is delicious! Have never been disappointed at Beks. Will continue to look forward to each visit!
