Text: Mark and I ate their twice while in Salem. The waitress is really sweet, thoughtful and on her game. She has three teen daughters to raise so tip her well. Now for the food, my Denver omelet was fluffy filled with good healthy food  and tasted delicious. I could only eat half of.my meal it was so big. It comes with hash browns and toast. The next morning I had the French toast and a single scrambled egg. I can not praise this place enough. Go run now you will never regret it!
