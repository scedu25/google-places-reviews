Text: First time eating at Bills last night. Pretty good, not exceptional. Great service but a little over priced for what they serve. I don't mind paying a little extra for extra quality but in my experience, the meal fell a little short. I had the scallops and they were decent, but served on a bed of mashed potatoes with frozen peas... not so great. I will probably eat here again sometime in the future and try a different  entrée.

Text: Bill's Restaurant is the BEST place to eat in Owensboro hands down. From his amazing menus prepared new daily with new ideas and experiences for the pallet. His staff is amazing, they have knowledge of every dish being prepared and keep in mind this changes daily. They have knowledge of wines and pairings , beers and mixed drinks alike. Friendly and full of energy they work hard to bring fine a dining experience and never fails to do so. They have high standards in quality of sustainable foods and local in season delectables that never disappoint. We have eaten there for a few years and time after time this is where we want to go experience amazing fine dining and spend our hard working dollars. With all that said I have never eaten the same thing twice for dinner at Bill's, and that's because of his amazing knowledge and love of what he conjures in the kitchen. I personally want to thank Bill and all his wonderful staff that bring this to our town if Owensboro.
Cheers?
