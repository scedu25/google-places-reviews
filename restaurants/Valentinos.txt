Text: The quality of food is outstanding. Some of the best Italian I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The building is small and could be overlooked by anyone not local. Keep your eyes out for this AMAZING little gem.

Text: Good food, but expect it to take 2 to 3 hours to eat as the owner does it all by himself.

Text: Service is  polite, nice and it is a quiet place to dine. The menu is extensive... a large array of soups, pastas, pizzas, salads, steaks, I mean a lot of stuff. 
This place is small, but the music is well balanced and tasteful as the food: jazzy, classical, and ambient. Decor is humble, but nice and bright.
I'm still amazed how they can provide such a diverse menu, and keep everything fresh to serve. Be prepared with cash to pay, and with patience while the food is made.
