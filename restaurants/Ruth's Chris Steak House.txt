Ruth's Chris Steak House
Rating: 4
Text: It would be a five star if not for the price. The food is consistent and the steak is always done to perfection. Side dishes are somewhat overpriced though although the portions are awesome. Give me a reasonable portion for half the price. Great place to go for the "money is no object" dinner though. You will not be disappointed.

Text: Stopped in after ND beat NC State before going home. I often think I'm going to try something new but the bone-in filet often gets the nod.  Lindsey at the bar took great care of us and made sure we had drinks and the food was once again really really good

Text: Food was good .  not really spectacular for the price.  Hashbrown casserole and crab stack best part of meal.  Large chunks of crab.

Text: Best corporate-run steakhouse I know of. It comes at a hefty price, but well-worth it for a special occasion or romantic night out. High-class, all-around.

Text: The steak was excellent. There was a problem with the workers refusing to say where a particular seminar was being held in the building. But that problem was resolved fairly quickly.
