Text: Breakfast served all day. Good food, casual family atmosphere. Reasonably priced food items as complete dinners or ale carte items. Delicious food cooked to you taste. Much better than those fast food joints.

Text: The food was actually really good but the service was really poor. I walked in with my one year old pushing her in her stroller. I waited by the front but no one came over or acknowledged our existence. A family came in shortly after us. So we were all infront of the door waiting. Finally, a server was walked past and saw us and she said we can step forward. I had already taken my daughter out of her stroller at this point so I had her in one hand and was pushing the stroller with the other. The rude ass family behind us walked infront of us and stood where the waitress said we could step up at. So they were seated first and was given the last high chair! I was so pissed about this. No one apologized for the wait. The service is absolutely grade A 1 star but because the food was really good I'm giving them 2 stars.
