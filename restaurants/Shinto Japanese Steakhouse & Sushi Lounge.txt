Text: Great spot for dinner!  We found a seat at the bar right away and decided to just stay there for the night. We were able to order dinner and drinks.  We went on a Monday so all specialty rolls (the big $12 & $15 rolls) were half off! Great deal. For the two of us we ordered 4 and it was plenty.  I had a wine and the bf got a $4 U Call It.  Our total bill was $40... about $25 off from what it would have been so a great bargain.  

They have specials every night pretty much and even half off sushi on Sat from 2-5pm.  We didn't do Hibachi tonight but that's always an option and on Tues it's like $12 per person! 

Service was great, food was awesome. We left happy and full. I would highly recommend. (Bonus: sometimes they're listed on Groupon so search there 1st).

Text: My boyfriend and I went last night for his birthday and our server was Jacquelin! She was absolutely stellar (even though she said she was fairly new, I don't believe her! ;) ) I had the steak and chicken hibachi and he had the triple hibachi and we also shared the teriyaki calamari and the crispy spicy tuna roll (HIGHLY RECOMMEND). It was all so good and fresh. We are from the south suburbs but will be returning for sure. Such a great place, I will gladly pass all other Japanese steakhouses to return to Shinto.

Text: I came here for dinner on a business trip. The restaurant looked modern and nice. I ordered pan-seared scallops and spider rolls (soft shell crab, avocado, and cucumber). They both tasted really good. I will come back next time I'm in town.

Text: Sushi is fresh. Delicious variety of rolls and apps to choose from. Happy hour is a fantastic way to try specialty rolls at half price. Definitely a frequent flyer at this place.

Text: We always have a good time in the hibachi section. Chefs are easy going and entertaining. Love the veggies with yum yum sauce.
