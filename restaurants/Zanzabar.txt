Text: Love the food and the over all atmosphere. They have a bunch of old school video and pinball games. The staff is excellent. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home. My favorite bar in Louisville.

Text: Strong drinks, not bad prices, arcade games and good food. On One hand I like the bigger dance floor/venue, but I don't like how crowded it is outside now because of that. Place is really cool for shows though since it IS so small. Makes any show pretty intimate. Even if it is crowded.

Text: Great place for shows that won't break the bank and decent lineup of bands you've haven't heard of but should check out. The food is surprisingly good for bar grub. Friendly staff.

Text: Tank and the Bangas was playing there.  Food was great, concert was amazing, the owners were awesome.  The new concert hall is standing room only, but if you have a physical disability (like me...) they will make a space for you to sit down.    I truly appreciated all they did to make me comfortable so I could enjoy the show too.

Text: Good beer list, pleasant atmosphere especially outside. Music gets too loud and the space echoes. Owners and managers are fun and occasionally do things like ordering pizza for everyone late at night. Outdoors is dog-friendly.
