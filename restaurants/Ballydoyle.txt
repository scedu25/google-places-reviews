Text: I highly recommend trying the whiskey bar. Good scotch selection. I had a burger and it was amazing. Cooked exactly as ordered. The bartender was attentive even though it was busy.

Text: Love the decor.  Feels like good a good?  mix of old Irish and modern life. You should come down for half price drafts. Didn't really have food but the Mac and Cheese bites were really good. Plain but tasty the way they should be. Bravo guys. Will definitely be back. Hope this helps if your thinking of coming down.  Also Gabby is awesome and our bartender Erin was the best

Text: Loved the atmosphere! Food was good and the drink selection was even better.  Loved the live music entertainment. Very skilled individuals.  
 The service was a bit slow and it wasn't even that busy.  That would be something they could work on however,  I'd still love to go back!!

Text: Great food, old Irish pub atmosphere, parking not so good, but is close to Paramount Theater. Great place to get something to eat before the show within walking distance in nice weather.
