Text: Friends took husband and I here claiming everything was amazing. They were right! Super awesome place. I loved the decor, old playbills and theater props. We went on a Wednesday night and they were packed, but we never had to worry about refills... server was ON IT. The potato beer cheese soup was delicious. I had the adult mac and cheese and my God... that was friggin incredible. And they serve RC cola! Totally awesome place.

Text: My girlfriend took me here because I said I wanted meatloaf. Good atmosphere. Love the ambiance and the decor. Food was amazing. It is real chill and you would expect mediocre food but it was phenomenal. Come here. Eat.

Text: We were exploring Columbus for the day. We went to the brewery district expecting to find food for lunch there but there wasn't much. A guy walking down the street recommended Tip top and we were very satisfied! Very friendly wait staff and food came quick!

Text: Rock-solid dive.  Cozy booths, intimate bar, busy patio. Great prices on beers, fair for spirits.  Food ranges from "eh" to "Great" but the variety and prices are killer. Absolutely jammed most weekends. 
  Bonus,  full kitchen up until 2AM (okay,  get your order in by 145)

Text: Big and delicious breakfast! They keep filling up your cofee cup while you eat and even ask you if you want some to go. It's a small but lively place with an old time flavor. Loved those spicy homefries!
