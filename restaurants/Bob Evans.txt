Text: Whether it's a heavy meal or a light snack this is the place to eat.  The food tastes wonderful every time we choose to eat there, morning, noon or night.  Food allergies are no problem as substutions or additions are handled pleasantly by all employees.  Our first choice when desiring food tasting like mother used to make.

Text: What an experience!  Slow to get refills, food was under warming light before salads were served. Food was decent, ordered chicken cobb salad to go, it sat under warming light for 10 minutes before I asked to have it taken out.  They made a new one and put ham on it instead of grilled chicken and told us that is what chefs do when they run out of chicken...7:30 pm on a friday night and they close at 9 pm...they were too worried about clean up to close. 

This was a return visit as the time before at this location we waited 15 minutes for a drink order to be taken and then no one returned to take food order, we walked out!  Will not return to this location.

Text: Great service from Anthony! Food was excellent.  Prices are a bit high but not too bad.
