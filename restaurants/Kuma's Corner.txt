Kuma's Corner

Text: Really good burgers and craft beer.  Always a crowd here so expect a wait and the constant heavy metal can be a bit much but it’s not that loud, just a constant in the background.  There’s a diverse crowd and everyone is welcomed so don’t worry if you don’t have any tats or piercings.

Text: This restaurant is more of a novelty for XL meals and unique setting than for "fine dining" type burgers. It is a great place to have a burger & beer to metal music. Optionally you can choose to only have beer at the bar. Burger meat is thick and juicy but the buns feel too heavy.  I tried it once and am greatful for the experience but someone as small as me to pay average 14 for a burger I will only eat half of isn't worth the frequency.

Text: Great burgers and, if your into metal, great music. Their beer list is always well updated and changes frequently with a few solid staples. They support local as hard as one can. The only downside is the wait. It's a smaller place and, for how popular they are, the wait can be well over an hour at dinner time. So, go early! If you have brunch around 10, hitting up Kuma's around 4 makes for a great day.

Text: The original Kuma's has always been my favorite burger place in Chicago, but sadly that is changing. The service was terrible. They barely checked on us every half hour. When our burgers we're cooked well done instead of medium rare, we told our waitress and they gave us a discount on one of them. I will not be returning to this location. Kuma's Too is much better these days.

Text: Plenty of beer to choose from. Food was amazing, I ordered the SLAYER (pictured) and the best fried pickles I've ever had. Sat at the bar to avoid waiting 15 mins for a table and the service was awesome.  I love this place.
