Text: Great food,  Nebraska beef cut by the owner,  The decor is country feel.   The owners are  personally involved in the day to day work and they are both great cooks.   You will not be disappointed.

Text: Had the Outrigger appetizer and a Philly steak sandwich. Both tasted amazing. Looks like they are in the middle of some remodeling, but it was clean and relaxing after a long day of driving. Highly recommend this place.

Text: My husband and I had dinner here. The chicken fried steak was amazing and I loved how they fixed their corn. My husband had the chopped steak. They grind the meat there at the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Text: Great food good atmosphere and service.  Dining hall closes too early causing you to HAVE to eat in the bar where they allow smoking.
