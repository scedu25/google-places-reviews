Text: This is a great place to go eat. Their food is great and the service has been also. They tend to get fairly busy during the weekends around dinner time.

Text: In town for business this week and had a hard time finding a good meal... until I came to this place! Owners are very friendly, the service was great and the food is amazing. I liked it so much that I'll be back for lunch tomorrow and the next time I'm in the area.
