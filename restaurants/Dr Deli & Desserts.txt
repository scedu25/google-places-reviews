Text: Absolutely LOVE  their food! Super good and fraud. Best food inside of Valley west mall. I love the club and the corned beef cream cheese.  Always speedy and excellent service! I eat here weekly because of it. Also great prices and their stand at the iowa state fair is amazing!

Text: I have been a customer for 10 plus years and I can honestly say I look forward to eating lunch there a few times a week. The food is great and if you're like me and need something sweet for dessert, they have the best homemade desserts! I appreciate the cleanliness of the business as well, and I would highly recommend eating there! It's just good quality!

Text: I know it's mall good court... So I had low expectations... But this place still managed to disappoint. Slow service, cafeteria quality food, and they close several hours before everything else at the mall.

Text: I stood up front at 5pm today for  almost 10 minutes. I even called the phones twice as I was standing there. No one came, no one answered. Thanks for the help.
