Text: Looking for a delicious, affordable caterer that will have your wedding guests talking? Ricky’s Café is your answer.

Ricky’s Café catered our wedding at the Apothecary Lofts in Lincoln, and we couldn’t have been happier with the service and buffet selections provided. And the food? Amazing!!

Every guest we talked to raved about the variety of meats and side dishes to choose from, and how good it was. It wasn’t uncommon to see people devouring two plates (or going back for seconds) because you wanted to sample it all!

Their staff is professional, timely and very friendly and accommodating. They even brought an extra meat selection. You can’t beat the value Ricky’s Café provides!
