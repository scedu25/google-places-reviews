Text: Went there today around 8:30, had a decent experience until I got home, counted my change, realized that not only was I shorted $10, I conveniently wasn't given a receipt. I will no longer be going to this location, instead I'll go to stores with cashiers that can count. I am one myself, it isn't that difficult.

Text: Ordered the chicken Philly and got nasty ass Roman burger. If the damn cook was paying attention to his orders instead of some bop I would have gotten my food I paid for.
