Text: The food was good and the service was good.  I was irritated when a mom allowed her son to play with the jello and didn't scold him or bother to tell serve.  Price was good for what you got.

Text: I can't believe Clay Center has their very own Asian Cuisine. It was very good and reasonably priced.

Text: I would have no stars but wasn't an option. One of the worst buffets I've been too.. They asked what would you like us to bring out, due to it being completely empty and what we asked for was brought out one at a time and not enough for three plates so we got one plate and shared everything. Or it was not brought out at all. Then they wanted to charge 31+$ for three people at 8.50 a piece.(drinks are not included). We spent our whole time waiting for the food. Plus there was another table of two that was doing the same thing. Atleaat the other customer got a good chuckle when I paid, cuz I sure as hell wasnt paying that much. Then I was told to come back tomorrow to speak with manager, um no, I live an hour away! The guy finally gave one meal free, I settled for that. But still don't agree.

Text: Dragon house is really good. The taste here is in fact a lot better than places in the cities or other small towns. The waiting staff should be more professional and friendly
