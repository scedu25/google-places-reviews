Palace Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: I had one of the specials this past Sunday.  Chicken fried chicken.  More fried breading than chicken, portion was small, and potatoes were instant.  Not bad diner fair, but the reviews had me believing it would be better.  Not worth a special trip to check out on it's own IMHO.

Text: Always great. Service is fine and friendly. Atmosphere is as comfortable as one can get. Food is what keeps me from an unnecessary trip to Columbia.

Text: A family-owned restaurant. It is small, but the food is excellent. They have a nice salad bar, and their steaks are the best in town. The Greek salad dressing is delicious.

Text: Your typical "Greek" restaurant in Missouri but it doe's taste good and it won't break your wallet.  Deanna is probably one of the best waitresses I've ever seen, she's worth a 5 star rating by herself!
