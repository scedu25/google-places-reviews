Text: Yummy! Enjoyed a great evening out with friends & family celebrating a birthday here.  This was my first time & it was well worth the trip. Lots of meats, chicken and fish served to you on skewers. You WILL want to try EVERYTHING! The salad/food bar should be as imaginative as the meats! More Brazilian side dishes would have been a treat. I will be back!

Text: Very novel idea of the sides being self serve and the meats brought to the table by servers. The side bar has a wide variety of choice and the food is well kept at their proper temperatures. The   servers are quick to notice your signal (a color coded device on the table) and are very attentive. The constant rotation of various main potions are always fresh and hot. The atmosphere is festive and upbeat and the staff is courteous, friendly and engaging.

Text: Keto Friendly! First, let me say that Sara was amazing! She made our experience smooth and delicious. Carlos also helped with making sure my crew had consistent food the entire time. Liz's customer service was truly helpful and she entertained our table. I would recommend people visit this restaurant. YOU WILL GET FULL...and also have the meat sweats.
