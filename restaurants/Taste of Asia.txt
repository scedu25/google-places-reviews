Taste of Asia
Rating: 4
Text: The nicest Asia restaurant in town! The Chinese food and sushi are excellent and made with quality good. The Hibachi/Japanese is about standard for this type of restaurant and more expensive than the Chinese fare. The lunches are reasonably priced and the dinner meals are generous. The sushi uses fresh, quality ingredients and is the best I've had anywhere in this area. I highly recommend it.

Text: Choose from a variety of Asian fare at this popular downtown Huntington restaurant.  Taste of Asia offers hibachi style dining, Chinese, Thai, and freshly made sushi.  You can sit at the full bar, at the sushi bar, at the hibachi grill, or at traditional restaurant tables.  Family friendly and crowded when there are events going on in Huntington.  Service has always been excellent.
