Montgomery Inn-Ribs King
Rating: 5
Text: I rarely give 5 stars for anything but Montgomery inn deserves it.  Best ribs period.  Been going there for 35 years.  Service was outstanding.  Overall great experience.  We'll be back in another 5 or 10 years :) (from Indianapolis).

Text: This is my favorite BBQ place in Cincinnati but don't bucket it this way they have a lot of choices.  If you are a fan of ribs you for sure want to go here the ribs are fall of the bone.  We also had the onion straws the portion was huge and they gave us two good portions of BBQ with it.  They had two specials the night we went.  I was a 2 for 22 special which was a good appetizer and the regular order of rib.  The other special was 3 for 33 an appetizer, dinner and dessert.  The service was good and the food was excellent.  

Good:
Ribs fall off the bone and sauce is excellent
Huge menu you will find something you like
Excellant environment

Bad:
Parking can be tough
don't go during the all you can eat rib specials

Text: Our fav rib place to eat ... most definitely worth the drive.  The meat is so tender out falls off the bone. The homemade chips are really good.  This last time was the first time I got their brisket due to dietary changes and it was SO good!!
