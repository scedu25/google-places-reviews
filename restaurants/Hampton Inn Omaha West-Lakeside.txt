Hampton Inn Omaha West-Lakeside
Rating: 5
Text: Quiet location, clean room, provides all the standard amenities that one would expect at a Hampton Inn. Located behind a shopping complex off of a driving circle, nothing that Google maps can't guide you around. For this stay, I used the Hilton Honors app to check in, select a room, and get my digital key delivered to my phone. Haven't needed to stop at the front desk once, and no worrying about losing the room key!

Text: This turned out to be a fantastic hotel. I always associated Hampton Inn as being a cheaper hotel but the quality was anything but. My room was very cozy and the bed extremely comfortable. The shower was also really big and had great water pressure and there were no issues with the water staying hot. Also excellent AC. I would definitely return.

Text: The room was well laid out and spacious. Staff was courteous and there were no issues. Breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts in the area. Bed was comfortable giving me one of the best hotel sleeps I've ever had. If you are in the area I recommend this hotel.
