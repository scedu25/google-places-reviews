Text: The place sucks..   over priced  small portions...  when you get done eating ...  you are. still hungry  .  Got to North shore or beths bar in benkelman. it's cheaper and you get a none Frozen hamburger  and you actually get full  .

Text: Slow service and under cooked frozen  food .  Price's are a little bit much . you would be better off going somewhere else  but if you are desperate I guess it will do  . my friend bought 3 hamburger's  and fries  it was over  $35 he was not happy and will not be going back  hamburger's are tough chewing . Fries are OK nothing to write home about. ..
