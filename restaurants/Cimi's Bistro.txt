Text: We recently moved to the Grove City area and decided to get lunch here on my boyfriends birthday. It was a great experience we sat outside on the patio and they had nice shade umbrellas which made it more pleasant to watch the golfers, food was excellent and service was quick and polite. Not even kidding the steak that was on my salad ranks as some of the best I've had. We will be back!
