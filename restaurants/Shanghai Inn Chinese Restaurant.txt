Text: Delicious food... I have been going here for years (since they opened). It is the best of the two Chinese restaurants in town, hands down! Wonderful staff. The owner is so pleasant and always remembers you. Family oriented. Large menu of choices, including vegetarian and American cuisine. Food prepared to your specific preferences. Excellent prices and lunch and daily specials. Excellent service. Two big thumbs up!!! ??

Text: My husband and I recently moved back to Nebraska from Virginia and I was very excited that Shanghai in was still here because I used to get wonderful Hunan beef there. Recently I went in there and ordered the same Hunan beef and it was dry and tasteless basically. Definitely not what I had expected from Shanghai. So I went in a couple of weeks later and ordered the same Hunan beef with the same results. This time it was greasy and the meat was dry. Won't be eating there again.

Text: Most of the time I go in here I have a large separated order because I'm getting food for the company I work for. This is one of the few places I ever trust to not even look at the order and know that they packaged it correct. Very helpful and patient even though I have so many transactions to pay for. Also the food is always great!
