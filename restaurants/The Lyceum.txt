Text: Yes, The Lyceum is really open again as of May 16, 2017! 
The menu is limited, as it was a year ago, and changes daily, but this is the only restaurant in town. Brownville is such a beautiful and historical place, we need to support all efforts to help keep this community alive and vibrant.
The Lyceum is quirky and unexpected but good food and good service. Also, new art displayed often, and it's all available for sale!
