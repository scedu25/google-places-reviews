Text: The place has such great potential. Nice outdoor seating in the summer and the restaurant looks out to a beautiful field BUT that’s where the positives end. We stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. They were serving the dinner menu at noon on Saturday, no lunch menu. It was 50 degrees outside and probably 55 degrees inside. There were three of us. We had the All American Burger, BBQ pizza and spinach artichoke dip. It was alright, not worth $43 though.

Text: This place is amazing, we just went for drinks and appetizers, we sat at the bar and I was impressed that when my husband ordered a beer the bartender pour it into a glass, looked at it, then took a small glass to taste the beer, and told my husband that he could not serve him that, it seems as if it was the bottom of the barrel. What attention to detail. So my husband order a bourbon or a whiskey instead. We ordered stuffed mushrooms ( they needed seasoning) we also ordered chicken flatbread which was delicious, except for the asparagus which were totally dehydrated, they were basically pieces of dry wood. But this is the first time we have had any issues with the food, this is why, they still get 5 stars.

Text: We had an excellent meal!  The best in many years. We didn't order off the menu we just allowed the Chef to cook our party what he thought we would enjoy and did we ever!  Amazing tuna and lobster roll, walleye with spicy sweet potatoes, steak with blue cheese butter in a Guinness stout sauce with brussels sprouts and carmelized onions. Waves of meticulously prepared food. 

The place to dine!
