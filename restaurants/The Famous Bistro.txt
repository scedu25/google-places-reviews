Text: Very unassuming looking place but dinner was so delicious!  We ended up here after watching the Eclipse...knew nothing about the area...and all 5 of us ended up being very impressed with our food.  Large proportions, beautiful presentation, great variety of food.

Text: This place used to be awesome but service has really declined. The food is always wonderful and the owner is nice which are the only reasons we give them another go every once in awhile but really why is it every time we go here the service is terrible?

Text: In addition to beautiful presentation of the meal, the food was amazing.  It was fresh and cooked to order and to top it off the service was superb!  A must if you are in the Owensboro area!.

Text: So many good places to eat in Owensboro, but you will always feel like family here. Fantastic staff and wonderful food from Chef Jared. If you are visiting, this is a must go! Call and make a reservation.
