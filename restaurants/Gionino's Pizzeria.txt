Text: Ordered pizza and chicken over the phone. Not being too familiar with this area being from Florida, we went to the wrong location in Mansfield Oh. Upon arriving to the 4th st location, I was told that the order was placed at the other location in Mansfield. Roger from the 4th St location offed a resolution that I never saw coming. He offered to escort us to the location where the order was placed out of the kindness of his heart. The food was delicious as promised and give only but the highest rating in food taste, quality and last but not least is the superior customer service. Thanks Roger and crew

Text: Customer service was terrible. My cashier rushed me my food and took off. When I noticed he forgot my Cole slaw, he only gave me a small when my order was for a large and rushed off again before I could tell him his mistake. When I looked at my food, my potato wedges were under cooked and my chicken was over cooked and the pieces were very small. I used to enjoy getting food from here, but after this recent experience, I will not be returning.

Text: Flavor was ok. Fast delivery. The dough was extremely raw though. Not a great pizza.  Maybe that's why delivery was so fast
