Text: I like minskys, Pizza Hut is ok. But if you like thin and crispy style pizza and your on I-35 going through north Missouri, Take exit 106 at Eagleville Mo. Head west on n for half a mile or so to 12th street and go north one block and get yourself one of the best pizza's your ever gonna find! No joke, Firehouse 54 has the best I've had! Made fresh and quick, you will be glad you did. I'm picky and that pizza is so good! Try it once and you'll be wanting to come back for more!
