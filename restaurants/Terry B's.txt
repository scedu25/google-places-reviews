Terry B's

Text: New ownership, bad food. We have been going to Terry B's in Dexter the last 10 years and always enjoyed it. We heard  the restaurant changed ownership about a month ago so we thought we would give it a try. The menu was very limited and was more like bad diner food. I ordered the $19 fish & chips. That's right, $19 for fish & chips. I figured what the heck, it must be really good fish & chips. What I got was a plate full of french fries and one small piece of bad deep fried fish which I could not even  eat. Tasted like old grease and dish soap. My wife had the $22 Risotto which was also terrible. We sent the fish back to the kitchen and did not bother to reorder since both of our entrees were nasty. We paid for the Risotto just to be nice and did not want to "pile on" our disappointment. I would like to say the service was good but it was just as bad as the food. They offered to comp a dessert but we declined and went elsewhere for dinner. We will not go back.

Text: Incredibly over priced and limited menu. $5 to split a dish that was small already.  Left hungry. Note: don't order the stale popcorn.

Text: Great service and food. Just don't pay by credit card or this "how do you rate us" keeps popping up on your phone. I came back to bury my dad and the ONLY way to get this pop up off my phone (hopefully) is by responding. As good as the food was i do not plan on EVER returning. How dare you spam me just because I paid with a credit card.

Text: This used to be our favorite place. Went in last night to discover things have changed. Very disappointed in the new menu. It is very limited; my risotto was bland. My husbands salmon was good and the scallop appetizer was delicious but if it's going to be a basic restaurant now they should lower their prices to match.
