Text: I've always had a good experience here whether it's a lunch, small conference, or event at the bar. The outdoor eating area is a great addition and you can go for a stroll on the RiverWalk afterwards.

Text: I had the salmon, bacon club for lunch. It was excellent! Not huge, just the right amount of food and nicely done. I enjoyed a glass of Selbach Riesling with it.. a perfect match! The wine list is very good with some German and Michigan wines that pair well with the menu.
