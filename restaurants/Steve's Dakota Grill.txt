Text: Soup and salad $5.99 all you care to eat. Sounds good. Didn't have my preferred salad dressing, thousand island. Got Italian and it was very salty. The soup was beef tip vegetable. It had a spice that dominated the taste. Not good. Wife had chopped steak and was very good. Mashed potatoes had way too much garlic, and had a broccoli taste.? Good server?

Text: Waitress was very nice and on point. The food on the other hand the crab stuffed mushrooms don't waste your money its like mush with cheese on top. They burnt one side of my fish and put the marmalade on top of it to cover it up. My father-in-law asked for a rare steak and it was done well. This place has really gone down hill. I will drive to polaris from now on.

Text: +A wonderful dining experience.  Our visit was to celebrate our 48th wedding anniversary. The lobster dinner that my husband got was far greater than Red Lobster's. I got the Rotisserie Chicken Dinner which was so tender that it was falling off the bone.  We also had a great waiter,  Wes, who helped make our visit exceptional. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great meal with outstanding staff.
