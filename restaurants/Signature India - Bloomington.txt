Text: We were seated at our table and waited for 15 minutes but nobody came to take our order. The restaurant was not at all crowded. Some other people with the bigger group came 10 minutes after us. Their order was taken and we were still waiting. Felt insulted. Left. 
Not a good experience.

Text: The food was very tasty and the go I Manchurian was the best but it took long time for the waiter to come to our table.

Text: Best saag paneer I've ever tasted. Unfortunately, out of the 5 times I've called to order it, they've been out of the dish 4 times. Perhaps I'll get to try it again someday..

Text: I visited on Oct 14th for lunch and the food was very bad. You don't get naan's or dosas if you go at 2pm while restaurant closes at 3pm. Ambience and service are horrible. Needs a lot of improvement.

Text: Food was always tasty but it is under staffed at all the times. Recently at the buffet on Saturday 14th OCT noon, Naans and dosas didn't come at all to our table. Nobody cared and the guy whom i spoke to says sorry for just this time!!  What an excuse.
