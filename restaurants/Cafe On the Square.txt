Text: Quaint place.   Been here 8 or 10 times over the last 5 years and have only been disappointed once.  Nice servers and adequate menu.

Text: Amazing food and reasonable prices for kids' meals. Only thing is...They need more than one person on waitstaff or a dedicated host. It took about 5 minutes before we even saw a staff member once we entered, and then he served the couple who came in after us before coming to our table. I highly recommend the Reuben and slaw...Wonderful.

Text: Good breakfast, only breakfast place in town, except coffee shop, just down street. Had to try it out, while in town. Portion to price, could be better. Overall still good.

Text: Great food. Decent service. I found it odd they tried to limit syrup.... they only give you small condiment cups of syrup.

Text: Great breakfast in a cozy little cafe. Love the corner breakfast and the biscuits and gravy. My wife and I have been coming here on the 4th of July since 2010 and don't plan on stopping that tradition anytime soon!
