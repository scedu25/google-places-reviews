McNally's
Rating: 5
Text: The description couldn't be more accurate; McNally's is indeed an unpretentious tavern. That's not a bad thing though. There are plenty of bars and taverns out there that shoot for your classic "Irish tavern" aesthetic and it seems like every aspect was focus-tested and designed to give you that feel to the max. McNally's though, they are who they are and aren't putting any false pretenses up. They have a good selection of drinks, great selection of food, and the jukebox is packed with good tunes. The staff are all nice and genuinely fun people, the prices are great for what you get, and it's a relaxing place to just hang out and have fun with friends.

Text: I haven't been to McNally's in probably about 5 years. But it was still the warm welcoming little Irish Pub then I remember. Service was still good fast friendly and the overall atmosphere as far as other people that were there is a nice friendly atmosphere probably helps that it's right across the street from CPD but nonetheless still a good bar to go to they also have some pretty good food that's not very expensive.

Text: McNallys is the best bar in Columbia. The atmosphere is laid back, it's cozy, and the amazing staff will know your drink for every day of the week. A great place to hang out and get some work done or just drink with friends or meet new people. McNallys is a home away from home, a gem, a treasure, an inspiration.
