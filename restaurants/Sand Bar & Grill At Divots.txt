Text: I've been here twice now. I can't get away from the prime rib or the prime rib sandwich! I feel like something is missing from the menu, but love the place. Their Beer is awesome try the Honey Wheat!

Text: Service is definitely hit-or-miss here. Can be decent usually it's very slow. Food is good regular bar food. Not always open, which is weird.
