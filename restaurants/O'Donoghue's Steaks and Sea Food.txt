Text: Really pleasant lunch experience! Lunch prices are quite reasonable; $7-8 sandwiches that are far better than you'd get most places. The server told me they make nearly everything from scratch!  Went around 1pm on a Friday and it was empty but they served me cheerfully and it was a really nice and quiet atmosphere. I'll be going back.
