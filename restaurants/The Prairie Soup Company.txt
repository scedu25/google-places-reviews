Text: Good food, great staff and service, but some menu items (pannini) can be slow during the lunch rush.

I had a half Turkey bacon pannini with a medium bowl of chicken tortilla soup to go. The food was great, the service was excellent.

They keep a strong serving pace, so the line moves surprisingly quickly.

Text: Excellent soups and sandwiches, great prices! If you're in downtown CR, you have to check them out.

Text: Food is pretty good but it's a cluster getting through the line every time. If you order a panini it will take about 15-20 minutes. If you don't like your salad completely drenched in dressing ask for them to put it on the side.

Text: Delicious soups and salads. Sometimes a long lunch line but always plenty of seating.

Text: Not a good experience at all. Took over 10 min for a latte which in turn made me miss my bus. I was the only customer. 2nd bad experience and there will not be a 3rd! I will not recommend to anyone and will tell people of my experience.
