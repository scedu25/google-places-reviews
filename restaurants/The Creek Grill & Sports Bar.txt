The Creek Grill & Sports Bar

Text: I was with a group of 7 friends on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly. Waitress was friendly and informative. I ordered the mushroom burger and it was fantabulous. There was an issue with one of the orders and it was a special order that they probably didn't have a button for. The issue was corrected with a smile. The restaurant was clean and prices were decent. I recommend a visit.

Text: Not bad. I got the salad in a wrap form and it was quite good. The homemade chips were good. Some needed to be cooked fully but I do like the homemade chips. Wish they had a better beer selection. There are too many breweries around here for them to not have more than the old bar basics. May explain why the "sports" bar was empty on a final four, Saturday night? But if you're gonna BE a sports bar, you need bigger and more TVs. I shouldn't have to squint.

Text: Our 1/2lb burgers weren't done all the way but our server talked to the manager and they took care of us so I can't complain. My chicken wrap was delicious.
