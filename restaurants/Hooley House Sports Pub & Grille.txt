Text: The food is almost always good. Attention to detail/special requests/service not so much. Consistency is also a problem. If you get the same thing 3 different times you will have 3 different portion sizes and two of the times will taste slightly different than the third. Generally the food is still good though they just need to really work on service quality and consistency.

Text: Food is okay for bar food.  Service is good.  Screens are huge for sports fans.  Nice place to hang out with friends.  Pretty noisy.

Text: I had fish and chips but substituted sweet potato fries which were awesome as they were sprinkled with cinnamon.   The fish was just okay.  The Irish sliders were good too.
