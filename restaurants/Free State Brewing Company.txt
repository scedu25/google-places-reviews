Free State Brewing Company
Rating: 5
Text: Free State is definitely one of the "must eat" places in Lawrence. The local beers are amazing, the staff is always friendly, and the food is delicious (and so reasonable to boot!). It can get a little louder during peak times (and the wait time could be long), but the food is great and we're loyal customers. 

My personal favorites are the turkey bacon foccacia sandwich. the shrimp pasta and the beer cheese soup. My husband loves their chicken tenders.

Text: Free State Chopped Verde Salad is too die for. Shared this salad with my Mother the other day at Brandon Woods which earned the salad two more thumbs up.

My wife really likes the Beet salad.

Black Bean Quesadillas is damn good as well. 

Once I got served Free State Copperhead all other other beer took a back seat. Boulevard Wheat and Fat Tire can hold their own however Free State Beer is unique and a wonderful experience.

Text: Great selection of food and beer. Our server Derek was fantastic. Can be loud on the weekends, but worth it.
