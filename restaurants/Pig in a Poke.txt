Text: This place has great BBQ!. It has a laid back home feel to it. Perfect place to just grab a bite to relax and enjoy good BBQ, and they have good prices.

Plus, our server Autumn was just phenomenal. She was very attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu, and made sure everything about our experience was great.

Will definitely be back and will be recommending.

Text: Love the food, Normally go about 2 X month. However the service has been a little on the lax side lately. I think they need to hire a little more help.

Text: This is now my favorite BBQ place, which is already my favorite kind of food (sorry, Sonny's...).  The service was amazing and super quick; it's a really laid back atmosphere and wasn't crazy hectic or anything when I was here; and the pulled pork sandwich I had literally made several mind-numbing hours of pointless, two-day job training that brought me to Prestonsburg two hours out of my way from home totally and completely worth it.  It was $9.25 for a drink, sandwich, and chips, which is about what you might expect.  But I was so happy with my lunch here that I left a $10.75 tip, if that says anything.  Definitely making this my new go-to anytime I come to Prestonsburg now!
