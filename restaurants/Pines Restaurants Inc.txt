Text: Food is okay but, pricey for this type of buffet.  My bill for one, with tax and tip was over $20.00  Restaurant is very, very dated and a little dirty around the edges.

Text: This is a pleasant family restaurant that's been challenged by the tests of time and is well liked. Many in the community are regular patrons, while the fare is good, is reasonably priced, and has a 'home cooked' quality about it. The established hot bar boasts such  items as ham, prime rib, pork, fried chicken, bbq, seafood items, baked maccaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes w/ marshmallows, and various other dishes dependant upon which day you choose to visit. There's also a small salad bar with family favorites like broccoli salad, pimento spread, sandwich spread, and a variety of fruit salads, crackers and such, along with a soup and dessert bar, as well. My only advice is to CHECK their scheduled HOURS of OPERATION before visiting, or call them for their scheduled days for particular meat/ entrees. If memory serves me correctly, Friday, is bbq themed, Saturday, is prime rib, and Sunday, is family night, at this time. 

Additionally, this establishment also does catering.
