Text: I visited this location on Saturday for dinner. We ordered a half gallon of spaghetti and garlic bread. The food is amazing! I also love the salads, especially the Asian Chicken Salad. However, the person working the counter could have used a little more help and it seems like the restaurant could have been set up a little more efficiently to serve customers faster. It seemed like there was a few people working, but the girl at the counter was running around between the back to check on orders, the front counter to take orders and the drive thru.
