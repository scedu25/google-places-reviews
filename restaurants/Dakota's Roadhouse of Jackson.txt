Text: Mediocre at best.  Not bad, but not impressive.  Service was lacking a little.  Slow with getting some of the drinks, slow with getting refills, had to ask twice for more bread, and dishes stayed piled up on table. Food was good, but not great.

Text: Came here cause we craved for steak and this place made me want to drive 30 miles to Texas Roadhouse. It wasn't bad at all but I was just hoping to get a Texas size and quality Ribeye...

Text: Ok service.  Pet peeve of mine is a bartender who pays attention to a select few at their bar instead of enraging with everyone at the bar. When patrons have to be asked to be served, then the bartender isn't paying attention.  Food was ok. Ask for a filet medium and it came out close to well done.  2nd time was better but not hot.  Will probably be back as it is the only place in Jackson with food that isn't all fried.
