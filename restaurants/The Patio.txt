The Patio
Rating: 2
Text: I went to the patio for the first and last time this past Sunday.  My sister raved about the delicious ribs.  So the four of us went there for lunch.  The ribs were good by the servers/staff not so good.  We asked for more butter for our bread and were given one pat for four people.  And when we went or our free ice cream, I wanted mine in a cup instead for a cone.  I was shocked when the server gave me a small container similar to the ones used for cheese or sauce, with a teaspoon size serving.  When I questioned the size, inferred that she was doing me a favor because she was not authorized to serve the ice cream in a cup. She could have told me that in the beginning, and I would have avoided all the grief, and they could have kept a new customer.

Text: Love their chicken. Not a fan of their BBQ sauce. Open area. Feels like a bbq party inside wish it could be cozier most of the time is cold. Staff is super nice.

Text: It has become over priced like most places paying for Illinois tax problems. Mediterranean chicken pita, fries and pop $14 for lunch! I can think of better places for $10.
