Text: Honestly...I was not impressed. We were greeted as soon as we walked up to the door, but the staff seemed more interested in greeting another customer who had walked in just before us than they were in seating us. We stood at the "please wait to be seated"" sign for about 3 very awkward minutes watching staff greet her and walk by us before someone came over to tell us to seat ourselves. It was about another 5 or so minute wait before menus were brought. I ordered the soup and grilled cheese special. The soup was exceedingly salty and acidic...so much so that I did not finish it...and the grilled cheese was barely warmed through. My kids' food was okay, but very generic and overpriced.

Text: Ordered the brisket "Platter", got a small pile of overcooked greasy meat, over-spiced potatoes, both of which were smothered in a bland brown gelatinous substance and a cup of cold, hard, bitter green beans. 
The waitress hovered and was actually annoyingly intrusive. Not to mention it was so loud that I could not hear the person next to me. 
Probably nice if you want to get drunk and party, but I won't eat there again.

Text: Great place, food and staff but could use more lighting in the bar side.
