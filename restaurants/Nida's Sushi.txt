Nida's Sushi
Rating: 5
Text: We were headed to another local sushi place, but they were closed.  We searched for sushi and found Nida's.  I'm really glad we did.  Let me start by saying this is not a normal sit down restaurant sushi experience.  This is a small vendor inside the North Market.  There are only about 5 seats right at their bar, but there is public seating upstairs if that's full.   They don't serve beer or sake, just soft drinks, tea, water, etc.  They have a decent selection of sushi, but you need to order from the menu.  One of our party tried to place a custom order and they discouraged it.    However, the four of us really enjoyed our selections.  They were all prepared after we ordered -- nothing was already prepared.  Three of us had sushi combo #1 (we all added spicy) and one had the Salmon Lovers combo.  I was shocked at how good everything was.  One of the best sushi experiences I've had in Columbus.

Text: Not good.  Ordered a tofu curry which you can never go wrong with no matter the restaurant but they went very wrong.

Text: One of the places I regularly go when I'm in town for Origins. Always good no matter what I order, and at reasonable prices. So far I've had the Pad Thai and a variety of sushi, but I'm going to try the poke bowl next. Great selection of Pocky and Asian drinks.

Text: Ultra expensive with so little at a VERY POOR quality. So poor that your local supermarket's sushi was better then this place. I went here once and will never go back. Plus a very poor service manner; do not appreciate your patronage.

Text: Run of the mill sushi with bad service. The cashier heard me wrong when I ordered tomago (she thought I said tako) and when I asked for it to be corrected she told me I told her wrong! Not good customer service. The restaurant in the short north is good but this does not do it justice!
