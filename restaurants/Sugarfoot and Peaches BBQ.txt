Text: Good place to eat but I'm sharing that it had a fire this past Friday and it's nearly burned down. Don't know what the future holds for this place right now, sadly. No one was hurt. Stay tuned for more news.

Text: Great BBQ but the hidden secret is the BBQ nachos. That sounded gross when I heard about it. The fact is, I'll drive the extra 30 minutes just for them. You're going to thank me if you try them.

Text: Super delicious,  amazingly tender brisket... loved it so much,  bought a pound of meat and their signature sauce to go.   We'll definitely be back!

Text: We stumbled upon Sugarfoot and Peaches while driving through and stopped to check out the BBQ.  So glad we did because it was fantastic!  Loved the atmosphere as well as the very kind waitress for excellent service.  If you are in town and looking for some quality BBQ, this is the place!

Text: We arrived for a late lunch.  They had an earlier run and only had a few plates left because their supply truck had not come in as scheduled.  The food we had was good.  The service was not very good considering the few customers.  The atmosphere was unique and cozy.
