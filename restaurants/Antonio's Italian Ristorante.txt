Antonio's Italian Ristorante

Text: This is a great place for some great Italian! There's usually a wait here, but that's because it's so popular, and it is totally worth the wait. Their food is to die for, the staff are amazing, and the service is top of the line! They also have one of the best meeting rooms for a private or corporate gathering like a company Christmas party. No matter what the occasion, this is always a great place to visit.

Text: My family and I went here for Father's Day and we are tremendously impressed. I think this is the best Italian restaurant we have ever gone to. The Italian Stallion pizza is quite literally the best pizza of its kind. The staff is absolutely wonderful and the owner is very kind. I think we will name this place our favorite Italian restaurant :)
