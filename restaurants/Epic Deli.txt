Text: Love the food here! The location is interesting and what you would expect from the name. When you eat here you have to try the Viking Quest. Its the best sandwich! I haven't tried the poutine yet but am excited that somewhere nearby sells it. The menu is massive and can take a while to decide what you want so brace yourself to be overwhelmed with options. I love that I can eat here everyday and not run out of new things for months.

Text: Casual place with a HUGE menu.  Food is always good, and there sides are excellent.  There is usually a line, unless you go at off hours.  If you can't find something on the menu, your not hungry.

Text: The new location is so much nicer than the old one. However, there food would be among the best if they made there own bread. It seemed kind of stake in an otherwise great sandwich
