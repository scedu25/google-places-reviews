Dewey's Pizza

Text: My taste buds fell in love with this place. The price is great and size of the pies are enormous! The feel is nice with you being able to see them toss the crust and make your pizza as well. However, it is quite crowded at time, but I suppose that means good business (but also crowded just walking through tables to the bathroom - arm room for eating a luxury when tables are cramped with these large pies). Nonetheless, the staff are nice enough and I did enjoy my time there.

Text: Best pizza and amazing salads. The creative combos and phenomenal crust. Live in Maui but when going back next year to visit again and this will be top of our list - wish you could ship

Text: Our family's favorite pizza place in St. Louis. Too many reasons to list but a few are the pizza crust and flavor of the sauce, it is so delicious. They also have a great beer selection of local favorites and national brands.

Text: As always the food was delicious. Their seasonal offerings are always interesting, but for us it's hard to improve on our traditional favorites. Some say "stuck in a rut", we say why tamper with success! The Killer Veggie can't be beat. I could live on the house salad! The service at the Kirkwood location goes above and beyond, and the Webster location is also excellent if you're over that way. :)
