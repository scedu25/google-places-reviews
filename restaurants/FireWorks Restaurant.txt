Text: Pleasantly surprised! Service was unbelievable. Super nice and knowledgeable waiters and waitresses. The menu has so many options that everyone in your party will be able to find something they like. Kids menu selection and prices, one of the best in town. Food taste was out of this world. I cut my steak with my fork.... literally. I got a free large piece of dessert for my birthday. Devine!!!! The only downside that I could find that maybe other steakhouses offer: they don't bring a basket of rolls or any kind of bread. I was craving some yeast rolls with cinnamon butter as I ate my steak. Otherwise, the best place I've eaten in a long time. Will definitely be back!!!

Text: Way better than we expected. Amazing service & incredible steak. We asked friend's for recommendations but unfortunately no one mentioned this place! We tried it on a whim and we love it! New favorite restaurant in Lincoln!

Text: The food was very smokey... And i usually loved smoked meat. Ordered my hamburger medium and it came out well done. Service was good, but the building needs better acoustics it was hard to hear the people sitting across from me at a round table that seats 6 or 8.
