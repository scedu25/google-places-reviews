Country Kitchen - Warrensburg
Rating: 3
Text: Menu is seriously faded.  Hard to read part of it.  Food: Most of the menu is horrible for you calorie wise.  I could look over this when in high school/college but now it hits me in the gut. My meal was a compromise to trying to not eat my days calories in one meal and then some and trying to make some of it be better sources.  Some chicken ranch item on a flat bread which I believe had some avocado on it.  Service:  Waiter was more interruptive then helpful on his checkups. That's more of a fair vs great waiter comparison because you don't want them to abandon you and it's not the amount he checked on us but the lack of tact when doing so.  Overall I'll be back because my company liked it and it's the only late night sit down option.  I prefer more ethnic options or more true local businesses.

Text: The food is good or great, depending on the day. The waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and personable and will work with anything you throw at them. A great place for breakfast, especially on Sunday morning. If you bring in your Church service pamphlet, you get 10% off.

Text: I really wish there were more Country Kitchen restaurants around America. This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. They serve breakfast all day and have tons of options. One of the very few places that offer skillet dinners, which always taste way better. Service is always on-par, and the prices aren't bad.
