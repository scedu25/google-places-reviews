Waffle House

Text: This is a frequent stop for us when going between Springfield and St. Louis. Today was particularly busy and it was still quick and friendly service. Yes, it's a Waffle House, but it's always consistently great.

Text: Delicious food, fast service, and friendly staff. I was amazed at how well they all worked together. We walked in and everyone greeted us with a good morning. Denise was our server and she was awesome with a very positive upbeat attitude. We will definitely return here on our next visit to Rolla.

Text: This has become a must stop eating place when traveling between St. Louis snd the Branson and Springfield areas. I think I eat at this Waffle House more than the one in my own town.  Friendly staff.
