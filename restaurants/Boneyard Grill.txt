Text: Great sit down place to go with a group or by yourself. Food was reasonably priced. Great sandwiches, probably better than most “sandwich places” that I’ve ever been to. Fries were amazing and tasted somewhat like Rallys fries. Overall, our waitress was amazing and our drinks never ran dry. My only complaint was that it was kind of loud which is understandable.

Text: New ownership came on recently. Menu is essentially the same and food tastes about the same, which I would rate slightly above average. However, service was really lacking. It took 45 minutes to get a burger and a chicken tenderloin. It was a little after 2 pm on a Monday afternoon so it's not like they had a lot of orders piled up ahead of us. I think there was one order ahead of ours. About 5 minutes before the food finally came out, they decided to offer us some chips to snack on.  That's great, but maybe next time don't wait 40 minutes? Also, it was pretty annoying to hear the cook loudly yelling the waitress' name (often more than once) when an order was ready. Have they never heard of a bell?

Text: Went there for a reunion. Food was delicious. Wish there was more than a single toilet for the event side of the restaurant.

Text: Waited 45 minutes for a burnt cold burger with unmelted cheese and the smallest portion of cold fries I've ever had. Asked for a new burger, they brought back the same one 30 seconds later. Service, food, and atmosphere was the worst I've been to. Never coming back.
