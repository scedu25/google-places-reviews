New China King Buffet

Text: Not to mention the server tuesday was on her phone while my glass sat empty. I definitely can say that the dark medium haired girl they had a few weeks ago was by far a greater server. I believe her name was Sheryl.

Text: The buffet was decent but very little of everything.  The server was horrible.  We were a party of two and ate 2 plates each.  Our dirty plates and both of our glasses sat empty on the edge of the table waiting to be refilled for over 20 minutes.  If she were busy it would have been understandable but there was only one other family in there eating.  When we got up to pay the bill, she was standing around the corner with her phone in her hand on facebook.
