Text: Lacking. When we arrived we were seated in a corner by the ATM, while others were given a choice of seating, we were not.  Our waitress apologized for not waiting on us as she passed our table.  We never received water.  At one point she took my bf pop to refill it and 5 min later we had to ask another server to bring it back.  Our waitress returned 10 min later and apologized for not bringing the pop back. We never received our bill, while tables around us did.  We finally walked to the register where no one was manning till.  We waited another 10 min to check out, we could have easily left without paying.  We won't be back.
