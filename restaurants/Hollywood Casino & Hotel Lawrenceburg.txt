Hollywood Casino & Hotel Lawrenceburg
Rating: 5
Text: Loved the casino and Boogie Night was around 4 to 4.5 stars. Love the music and atmosphere but hard to get drinks at the bar and hard to move around and dance. Nothing special going on tonight, just a normal Saturday night at the dance club. It really wasn't all that crowded. The bartenders are awesome. The customers can be rude and won't move out of your way. Drinks are a little over priced but in the atmosphere you are expected to pay it. Once again love the music and DJ.

Text: Food is a 4 star...it is aways good there.  Yummy crab legs on Friday in buffet.  Skip the casino experience....very little hitting in that area.  Just look around you hardly ever see anyone's jackpot light going off and customer's have no money on their slot machines.  6 of us go once monthly and none of us have ever won a thing in 8 months.  Travel to Jack's in Cincinnati after you eat for a better gaming experience.

Text: This is a fun place to go with a very comfortable atmosphere. Hotel is reasonably priced and connected to the casino by a inside walkway. Nothing fancy, but nice enough and clean. Check out "Boogie Nights" nightclub for a throwback to the 80's night of the kind of fun you would have at the last wedding reception everyone let their hair down and had a great time!

Text: Came here for the Boogie Nights club and had a blast on the light up dancefloor. It's a pretty eclectic crowd and you'll leave smelling like smoke but it's a good time. As far as gambling goes the dealers are a lot of fun especially in the celebrity section.

Text: Mostly electronic games that are made up games for a quick Buck. Give a deck of cards anytime over the lights and bells and whistles. For every big winner you have a thousand losers that lose more than the big winner wins. The house always wins. Better to play home poker and enjoy the company.
