Text: This little "hole in the wall" was well worth the stop! Had to have a hamburger in Hamburg!!! Stopped in on our family trip and Karen took great care of us, locals welcomed us back! Hope to see this charming little town again!

Text: The Blue Moon Bar & Grill is your typical small town bar. They have a decent selection of bar food that is delicious and reasonably priced, with a few local favorites on the menu. I would recommend the Haystack fries and the Flying Hog (grilled pork tenderloin smothered in grilled onions and A-1 sauce, served on a bun. Delicious!) They also have a large banquet hall available to rent for special occasions or large gatherings.
