Text: This is my favorite place in Fort Wayne. Cozy, peaceful, and most importantly, enjoy the outdoor bar by the river called the ' Deck '. Great place to eat or just have a drink. Weekends are very busy.  Best bartender ever- they mixed your drinks just the way u want it. Love this place

Text: Got right in on a Friday night. Service was excellent. Food was good but not outstanding. Gumbo had 1 small shrimp and celery. Where is the rice, saugage, etc. Jumbalya was good, but had lots of vegetables that weren't listed on menu (not big on veggies). Taste was very good. Huge portions. Overall good but not great.

Text: Good wide choice of food. Prices are good. It's a nice casual place to have dinner but not break the bank. Good bar too!

Text: Went there for a luncheon. The Tilapia was good. They should be embarrassed by their gumbo - aweful is an overrating. No one could find any seafood or andouille sausage in the gumbo - just rice and bouillon. Service was great although we shouldn't have to ask for the kitchen staff to turn down their music. We were close to the kitchen but that is still no excuse. Would be 4 stars but they lose one each for their poor imitation of gumbo and the horrible music blaring in the kitchen.
