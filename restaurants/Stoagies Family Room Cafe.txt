Text: We are traveling from Ohio for the holiday weekend. We found this restaurant by "googling" local restaurants...this had great ratings so we decided to try it. Great friendly service..food was tasty & fresh...a little on the pricey side for lunch. For a family of 4, we had 2 sandwich/fries orders and 2 lg. salads...bill was $42.00, before tip.  We enjoyed the ambiance of the house..beautiful woodwork, comfortable and clean. Friendly staff. We will definitely be back!

Text: Food was bland. Expensive  for  what  you get. Kids meal cost  what an adult meal would cost some place else.  Breakfast  shouldn't cost  more than what I would pay for a good dinner  on a night out. The only nice thing is that it is a cozy farm house. Will never go to this place again! Drive the extra mile and go to Bob Evans.
