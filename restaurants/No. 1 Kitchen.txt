No. 1 Kitchen

Text: My all time favorite chinese restaurant! Haven't been able to find another that quite compares. However on more than one occasion they have given me the wrong kind of rice with my meal (pork fried rice instead of white is not a nice surprise when you are a vegetarian!)

Text: If I could give this restaurant a 10 star rating, I would.  Best freaking Chinese food I've ever eaten.  I get the moo goo gui pan combo platter with added broccoli, and sometimes the pork egg foo yung.  I miss seeing the old owner there.  He knew people by name and was always so happy.

Text: Hidden gem. 11am to 4pm lunch buffet is great. No more then a dozen items but the food is always fresh and hot.

Text: One of my favorite chinese takeouts in the area. But that is just it, takeout. I would definately rate higher if delivery was available.

Text: If you are in Elyria for lunch this is the place.  You get a pop and buffet for around $6.  Can't really beat that.  The people who own it are nice.  Totally recommend.
