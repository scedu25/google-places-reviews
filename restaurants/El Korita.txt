Text: If food is good in this restaurant i wouldnt know, the waiter was quick on her feet to serve the men that came in after me. I wasn't even given water while i watched her , then 15 mins later...At that point i told her to forget it  i was leaving..she didnt even apologize.
Guess if your a man your ok...

Text: THE best food for the best value!! The inside is super cute and wonderfully and colorfully decorated. The buffet was small, but it was packed with a huge assortment. My husband and I could not believe how amazing everything tasted. We will be back before our visit here is over!!
