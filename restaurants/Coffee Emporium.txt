Coffee Emporium

Text: • Great location, neat seating outdoors, cramped inside, decent coffee

• This place is in a cool location and offers great seating outside - in front of the shop, on the side and a large seating area behind the "house." The area behind is probably the coolest, it's underneath a tree, so even in hot days you get a little bit of shade.
That being said, it's not a place to come when it gets cold, I would think. The inside of the store has both a counter where you order, then a shelf with plastic containers with beans and a grinder if you want to take some home, but it is cramped. If you come in a busier time and there are more than 2 people there, it gets cramped. Can't imagine trying to stand there to enjoy my coffee on a cold day (when you don't want to be outside). Their downtown location has larger seating.

• Coffee quality was pretty good. Wasn't the best macchiato I've had in my life, but it definitely was in line with a "specialty" shop quality that is not a chain.
Most likely will be back for the atmosphere, rather than the coffee taste (which again is good).

Text: Incredible tea, specifically their chai tea latte, it's incredible. Not to mention the way the cafe is set up is like stepping into my grandmother's house. It's so cozy, makes for a perfect winter day, going there and drinking some tea, looking out at the beautiful surroundings.
