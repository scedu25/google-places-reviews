Text: This intimate little restaurant had an impressive menu from which to choose. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and his suggestions were right on point. I don't think you could have gone wrong with any of the dishes. After a difficult dessert menu debate, we ended our meal with a fluffy cheesecake topped with caramel and cinnamon sauce. I loved everything.

Text: Sweet surprise in Hannibal MO! Great menu, fantastic staff and atmosphere! A taste of early America and Europe combined! I just might return to Hannibal to visit this restaurant again! The French lamb chops are fantastic!

Text: One of the best meals we've ever had. This place came recommended from the winery we were at in the afternoon and also the owner of our B&B, and they were both totally right. This place is awesome. The food is incredible and it's very unique. Keep in mind that it is small, so there will be a wait. But there is a bar and patio area attached where they will find you when your table is ready.

Text: Exquisite food. Simply wonderful. One of the best meals I have had in northern Missouri, or in all of Missouri.

I had excellently prepared salmon, well seasoned. Turkish coffee - something not easily prepared. The house dressing, a maple vinaigrette, was a surprise and a real treat on the house salad.

I will be heading back.
