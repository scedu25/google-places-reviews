Text: We go to Circle's every year to buy pecans in the shell already cracked. While we're there we also have one of their great sandwiches with German potato salad. Of course we can never leave without buy some jams and apple butter.

Text: The best place to buy a pie in the four-state area. They. are. the. best! They obviously sell pecans and they also have a little restaurant there. If you're driving 400 and have thought you should stop in one day - do it! You won't be disappointed!
