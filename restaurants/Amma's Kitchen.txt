Amma's Kitchen

Text: I took my wife and daughter to lunch yesterday and we all got the buffet. I loved everything I tasted there (and probably ate more than I should have (my waistline didn't appreciate it.) The food is super tasty and favorable. I like spicy and I ate all the spicy items on the menu and delighted in them all. Its kosher and the manager was super pleasant helpful and friendly. The only shortcoming is, its 40 minutes away from where I work, so I cant go there for lunch every day. The three of us ate the all you can eat buffet and it was around 10 dollars a person. Very reasonable priced and worth it.

Text: Food was really good. Also was nice that they offer complimentary Dose with buffet. Really nice staff too. Wanted to give 5 stars. Giving 4 because location is in a shady neighborhood.

Text: Stopped in on a trip to Cincy because our first choice restaurant was closed on Monday. The buffet has a variety of choices. While it was spicier than our normal Indian restaurant at home,it was tasty and I loved that they have vegetarian dishes. Wednesday is vegan buffet day! 

The staff was super friendly and even packed up some extras for us to take home without us requesting it. They also mentioned that more locations are in the works for Louisville and Indiana!

Text: We love Amma's! I've been to southern India a couple of times and the flavors I tasted there are much like what you find at Amma's. The Channa Masala and vegetable biryani are two of our favorite dishes. We also HAVE to get the garlic naan every time we go.
