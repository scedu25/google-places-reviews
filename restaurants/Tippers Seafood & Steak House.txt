Tippers Seafood & Steak House
Rating: 5
Text: On a busy weekend we were driving around trying to find SOMEPLACE to eat.....WISH this place would advertise on their sign better but we went in and asked to look at the menu to see if we wanted to stay. SOOO glad that we did....the food was amazing, the waiter was extremely friendly. We had the ribs, steak, and buffalo chicken sandwich-everyone in our group LOVED their food and the presentation of the food was like things you'd see in a ritzy restaurant. The only downside of this place is the stale decor but hey some of the best food is ate/found in dives and this food was worth taking the chance!!!

Text: Warm atmosphere, neat and friendly. Food however,  was really  bad. Everything had been frozen and was rubbery. Tomato bisque was cold. Crackers stale. Garlic bread to go with soup was delivered at the end of the meal. Salsa and chips were obviously from a grocery store. Everything was just bad. We observed only 2 servers, who worked very hard. Probably the worst food we ever had, not to mention the blaring music from the place next door. So disappointing!

Text: Buffet is a bit pricey for what you get, and the food is only just ok. Drinks and the service is good though.

Text: The staff did not know what gluten free meant. Dirty. Not at all like the old Tippers. That was more upscale.
