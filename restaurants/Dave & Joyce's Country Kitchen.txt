Text: Some of the nicest people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. We stopped there on the day of the total solar eclipse and they warmly welcomed us & didn't even charge us for watching it from their parking lot. The food there was excellent too!

Text: I went through Red Bud on my way to observe the solar eclipse. This is a small country diner, my favorite kind of place to eat breakfast. They were slammed that morning and the server was overwhelmed which is why they only get 4 stars. But the food was good, and the prices were incredible compared to where I live.
