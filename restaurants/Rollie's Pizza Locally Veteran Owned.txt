Rollie's Pizza Locally Veteran Owned

Text: Salad bar was fresh & good. The pizza tasted pretty good but they don't use heat lamps just devorative lights & the pizza was barely warm. They did bring out 2 fresh pizzas while we were there. Lastly, they charge for a to-go cup after charging $10.95 for the buffet & drink. Won't be going back.

Text: Rollies Pizza on South 7th street. 

Tried to order online.  Website very confusing and ingredients aren't listed for sandwiches.  Went to just order a pepperoni pizza to be on the safe side and was going to have it delivered.  I work less than a half of a mile from Rollie's and the website stated I'm not in their delivery area.  So, do I have to be in walking distance or what?  Then called to place an order and was told there will be no delivery tonight because the driver called off of work. Why advertise delivery if you're not equipped when one employee calls in? This negative review started with the website being complicated but I'm disappointed that they don't  have the staff to deliver.
