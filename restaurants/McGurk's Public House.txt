McGurk's Public House

Text: The food is always excellent and the drink selection is very good as well. The outdoor seating is great when the weather is cooperative. However, when it starts cooling off, they have the outside seating enclosed and heated, so even in the winter months it is comfortable. Indoors is warm and homey.  Very nice, comfortable place for dinner and/or drinks.

Text: Love McGurk's atmosphere especially the outdoor area. On that note PLEASE take down the Christmas lights with the ugly contrasting white cords in the bar area. They completely ruin the look, there are so many other attractive options  available. Waitress last night was very attentive, we really appreciate a good server, thank you Iska. She made up for the inattentive bartenders that took 15 minutes and a loud "HEY" to get their attention just to order a couple of drinks. We ordered the Ruben which is always great and the bacon wrapped shrimp from the appetizer section. For me it's a perfect sized meal.

Text: What a fantastic place! We hosted an event here on Saturday and Taylor, the event planner was phenomenal! We had to change locations the day before the event due to unforeseen circumstances and Taylor helped us with every detail! The party was a huge success and the food and service was fantastic! Everyone had a great time!  They have a beautiful outside area and the inside is a fun Irish atmosphere. We can't say enough great things about the food, service and atmospher! Every employee thanked us for our patronage including the bartenders! Awesome place!

Text: Went to McGurk's during a break at the Fort Zumwalt North Band Competition. Server was friendly, drinks were refreshing and the food was good.  I had the fish and chips.  Fish was nice and flaky.  Gin and tonic was very refreshing as well on the hot fall Saturday.
