Text: The employees stood around a lot, the dining are was dirty and the sauces had dried up old sauce on the tops. The employees made peoples side dish without gloves, I saw an employee wipe her hands on her pants, then went back to make someones food. Nasty!

Text: All the food I've had was awesome- my dad does Bbq so I'm picky, but their stuff is very impressive. And they have the best sweet tea I've ever had from a restaurant. Their rewards program is pretty cool too. Definitely a favorite restaurant for our family.
