Text: Outstanding coffee house and much more. The espresso based drinks are correctly prepared.  Breakfast and lunch are served.  There is a convenient drive-up window.  Large selection of baked goods and chocolates.  Items such as quiche and a bacon and smoked gouda croissant are offered.  Large selection of single origin and blended coffee beans as well as quality loose leaf teas.  One of the few places in Central Illinois where you can find the Japanese green tea Sencha.  Innkeepers offers a wide variety of accessories for brewing and storing coffee and tea.  Coffee beans are roasted in house.  Innkeepers is a great addition to Galesbug's historic Seminary Street.

Text: Great coffee  choices. We had cranberry creme. Oh so good. Too many snacks to choose from! We settled on a giant cookie.

Text: Nice selection of pastries. Disappointed they had no medium roast coffee. Can use wifi limited hours (before 11am and 2-5pm). So not during lunch. I guess limited is better than nothing. Overall, good experience. 

Music is a little loud for this to be a spot to study or focus on work but I think folks mainly come here to chat and sip.
