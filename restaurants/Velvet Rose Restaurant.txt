Text: Decided to stop at this restaurant while in Superior, NE last weekend. It's absolutely great country cooking! Their chicken fried steak with gravy s delicious and they also have a Sunday buffet with terrific fried chicken!  The internet said it was closed on Sundays, but its OPEN 7 days a week.  Great service.
