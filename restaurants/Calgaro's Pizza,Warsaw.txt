Text: Great pizza! I forgot to take a picture of the whole pizza we were so hungry after a day of riding. We enjoyed watching the Chiefs game while we ate.

Text: My wife and I get pizza here every time were in Warsaw. The pizza is very good! We usually get alfredo sauce and jalapeños but have tried other ingredients and have been really happy with everything.

Text: We stayed at Sterret Creek Marina hotel this past weekend and had a pizza craving. Called around and nobody delivered there. I called Calgaros pizza expecting the same answer, instead they said they don't typically deliver there but would make an exception. Sure enough, 45 minutes later we had an all meat pizza, poppers, and fried mushrooms delivered to our room. Turns out, the owner himself made the delivery since they were short staffed. We dug in and it was fantastic. One of the better thin crust pizzas we have had. We will definitely be visiting their restaurant next time we are in town. Great service and even better food. Yes it's a bit pricier than let's say...Pizza Hut...but between the service and quality and deliciousness....100% worth it. Shout out to the owner who stepped it up and delivered.
