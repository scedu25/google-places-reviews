Text: I'll start with the less exciting news - the service was mixed. I came on Easter Sunday a little after 9a and because I was by myself and there was no wait. My waiter was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable and once I ordered my food it came quickly. But he wasn't great at remembering smaller requests like lemons, butter, to-go containers.
However, on my way out I was thanked for coming in and wished a good day!

Now, on to the food. I ordered the Ricotta Stuffed French Toast with bacon-infused maple syrup and a side of fruit. I don't think I've had french toast in at least two years, so this tasted particularly amazing to me! It's two thick slices of toast with a layer of sweetened ricotta in between and more than a dusting of brown sugar on top! The texture was perfect! And the ricotta in the center made the consistency similar to a custard-y bread pudding! The maple syrup was a nice touch - the bacon flavor wasn't overwhelming, but it was fun that there were actual chunks of bacon.

I took a slice of carrot cake to go and enjoyed that was pretty good. The was very dense and moist - just the way I like it. The icing was different - definitely a beautiful buttery icing, not the strong cream cheese that I expected. I'm a big icing fan, so I would've liked a much thicker layer. But I certainly appreciated the very large portion size!

Text: So they claim they're famous for omelets, but I've had better at the Waffle House. Ordered one with bacon, tomato and cheddar. Bacon was burn to a crisp, cheddar was sparse and not melted, and the eggs were cooked into a patty shape and then rolled up like a burrito, which makes the fact that they used eggs suspect. I think the only reason this place has the reputation it does is because people like to brag that they've eaten there.

Text: Excellent service and awesome food. Coffee is self serve which is genius. No more waitresses topping off your coffee when you already have the perfect cream to coffee ratio. Just get it when you want it. Even one to go. Will definitely return

Text: Delicious brunch place in the heart of Indy.  It is in a super convenient location for going to the convention center, and has great food.  They have a lot of delicious food options as well as drinks, such as mimosas.  The omelet I had was very good, the service was good, and my coffee mug was never empty.  I would recommend this brunch place to anyone that is in the area.
