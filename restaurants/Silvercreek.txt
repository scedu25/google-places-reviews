Text: We chose Silvercreek for a special family celebration & it was wonderful! The Sunday buffet  offered  a wide selection with most items deliciously & expertly prepared. The staff and management went over and beyond in making our family gathering so special. Definitely one of the few exceptional restaurants in C-U.

Text: Higher end. Verify friendly staff and great atmosphere. A little higher prices for portions of food. The shrimp stir fry was heavy on the sauces, but the veal meatloaf was spot on.
