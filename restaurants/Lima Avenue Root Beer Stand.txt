Lima Avenue Root Beer Stand

Text: Burger over cooked and bland. Mushrooms were fantastic. Only one worker and very busy.  Root beer was frosty and cold. We had to bus our own window. Took over an hour and I had to get to work. Decent place to go if you have the time.

Text: I'm 54, have been eating there since I was a kid. The last few years their food has gone down hill. Yesterday I had my usual, 2 Spanish and a large root beer. There was almost no flavor in their chilli or ( Spanish ) sauce. The hot dogs did not taste very good ether. The root beer was good though. For  $2.25 apiece, I don't think they are worth it anymore. I can not speak to the other items on their menu as I have not had anything else  to eat there  ( only the Spanish hot dogs ) for several years. Hope it gets better!

Text: Good old time fun. They come and put your food on a tray that hangs on your cars window.

Text: The servers were nice, but the Coney dogs were kind of just OK. Edible, but not worth another trip there on purpose.
