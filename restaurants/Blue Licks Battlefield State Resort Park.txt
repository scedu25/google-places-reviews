Blue Licks Battlefield State Resort Park
Rating: 4
Text: Second time stayed at Blue Licks (more than 4 days each visit). Good price and with large rooms and bath area. Tile and grout need good cleaning. More than just a place to sleep, pool area nice with pivilion's in park. Nice secluded area with relaxing activities. Really really really need small refrigerator and microwave in each room, trust me there is plenty of room for it. A nice 55" TV mounted on the wall would be very nice too, would pay $100 a night if added, would definitely be worth it!

Text: Nice campgrounds. It's not to big. Plenty of sites with electric and water. They also have some tent sites with no amenities. The guy at the check in was great. There's bathrooms, showers, and laundry facilities. The park has a museum, pool, lodge, resturant, and giftshop not to mention a history lesson from 1782. The resturant was good. Food was good, the service was slow but very friendly. Just relax and enjoy. The hot brown was very tasty, I enjoyed every bite.
