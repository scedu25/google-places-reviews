Text: I'm done with this place.  The food is mediocre at best, but it's better than chain pizza, that's for sure.  What's worse is their service.  It's not like I've eaten here just once and on more than one occasion my order has been wrong.  Tonight was the last straw.  After an hour, I still did not receive my delivery.  I called and was told there was a problem with the order and they needed to remake my pizza.  Ok, not a big deal, things happen, I get that.  What I don't get is why didn't they contact me.  Also, I've worked in the industry, the second thing you do after letting the customer know, is to take care of the customer, give them something for the trouble.  Nope, nothing offered, but I was assured that my order was ready and I was the first stop, just down the road from their restaurant.  Nearly another hour later, the pizza finally arrived and low and behold....they forgot my dipping sauces for an appetizer and again, nothing was offered for the my order arriving nearly 2 hours after I placed the order.  No more!
