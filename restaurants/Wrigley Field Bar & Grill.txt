Text: Food is pretty good for a bar. The grilled wings are the best ever. The buffet on Friday nights is awesome for the price. They have a lot of different kinds of entertainment and a whole bunch MTV so there is no lack of things to do. The TV so there is no lack of things to do. All in all the great place to go

Text: It's a sports bar with quite a lot of screens. Have been here to watch 2 fights in last months. Bar is sub Par with decent to rude servers. Bartenders are nice. Place is average with run down chairs and tables. Good thing is it doesn't try to pretend what it's not. It's a low key sports bar with awesome screens and gets the job done.

Text: Good beer specials, great prices on food, and we ended up getting a couple free shots. Went for karaoke night and ended up winning a raffle for party with free food and drinks. The Host didn't have a song I wanted initially, but was able to get it for me.  Overall, great time. Will return.
