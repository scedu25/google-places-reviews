Scorcher's Casual Eatery & Draft House
Rating: 5
Text: The atmosphere was great and like it says in its name, casual.  Customers were friendly, and so was the barmaid, and she did her job fast.  The food was awesome and the menu has a good variety to choose from along with good prices.  The beer on tap was at perfection temperature and they had 24 different taps going.  we ate our food,  had 2 drinks and were out of there in 30 minutes and never felt rushed.  Haven't had a great dining experience like that in a long time, and I go to many places.  The only problem was they were Browns fans....lol.  To top it off the barmaid was easy on the eyes dressed nice and was nice and knew her profession well.  Will 100 percent return even tho I have a long drive to get there, well worth the trip, and highly suggest you visit this place, you will not be disappointed.
