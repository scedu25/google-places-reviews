Clementines Too
Rating: 5
Text: Been sharing my time between Clementine's 
Too in St. Joe and Clementine's in South Haven for 20 plus years. 
St. Joe location has such a positive attitude
upon entering the restaurant. 
Our waitress today-Amanda-did an excellent job and anticipated our needs before we knew we needed anything! 
The Mess of Lake Perch is a definite 5 star
meal. Love the onion rings and the ranch dressing is a favorite of ours. 
Bonus are the seasonal drink specials-always unique mixes with excellent tastes!

Text: Twenty five years ago on a trip back from Chicago we stopped in here for dinner. Happy to report it is still the same. Great food and friendly staff. Best seafood in the area!

Text: High-quality American menu. Had a Ruben with great corned beef! Onion rings are beautifully battered and perfectly deep-fried. Not too heavy - that's the secret! Nice view of the marina.

Text: Fiesta taco salad was very good. Half a Corner Deli ruben was good.  A Stack of onion rings is a great appetizer to share with friends. It's a busy place and they do not take reservations. Plenty of menu options for everyone.

Text: Everyone liked their food and the restaurant is very spacious with an enjoyable atmosphere.  The salmon ceaser salad was great... It has noodles in it!!  The only problem was that the waitress decided to add more water to my 2/3rds full glass and leaned over me without warning and spilled water all over my phone.  Maybe the wait staff could ASK if customers want more water!?!?
