Wasabi Express

Text: I have no idea as to why some people have rated this restaurant as low as they did; this place is lovely! I come from a different town, and Wasabi Express was a pleasant surprise. Because location is important— I would like to clarify that the Southtown location was the one I had attended. The prices were INCREDIBLE. I had two sushi rolls (California and Spider), as well as an order of crab fried rice— I spent $13. Where I'm from, one roll costs that much, and tastes half as good. Wasabi Express is cheap and affordable. I would definitely eat here again. The server was a little less-than-desirable, but the food and prices made up for it. I wouldn't call this a five star restaurant, but it's perfect for a quick lunch/dinner.

Text: You defiantly get your moneys worth here. We always take left overs home if we don't share the entree. Hot and fresh and the staff is friendly

Text: I have no idea as to why some people have rated this restaurant as high as they did; this place is awful! I have eaten here twice. Both times I have felt unbelievably sick and both times I have vomited. Mmm yummy.

As far as taste, the food isn't that good. It is mediocre at best. I don't know what kind of special love they give their yum yum sauce but my god. No. This is americanized japanese gone wrong.
