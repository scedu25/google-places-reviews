Text: Best wedding venue Missouri has to offer! If you're looking for the best wedding venues in St. Louis this one should be on your list! Gorgeous views, beautiful state-of-the-art rustic barn and a historic western town. Cedar Creek is like going to a destination wedding, but only an hour outside of the city! They have everything, from great staff, delicious food, a golf course, tennis courts and a salt water pool! Plus the accommodations for lodging are endless! They have brand new cottages, a gorgeous historic white plantation style home a lodge with multiple hotel style rooms and multiple other homes on the property you can rent out. Cedar Creek is a hidden gem! I definitely recommend anyone looking for a weekend away, planning their wedding or next big event to check this place out.

Text: I can't say enough nice things about the wonderful job the staff at Cedar Creek did for my daughter's wedding reception last weekend.  From the very beginning meeting with Lindsey in sales it was evident that we were going to be well taken care of on the big day!  We sat down with Melissa a few weeks before the wedding to go over the details.  I don't remember her saying no to a single request, and she even offered some great ideas that were incorporated in the reception.  What a relief it was to hear her say "we can take care of that" multiple times in that meeting.  The day before and the day of both Hannah and Melissa were the "wedding coordinators" from heaven, attentive to our every need, as well as those of our guests.  We heard nothing but positive comments from everyone as to how wonderful this venue was.  Anna at the hotel front desk deserves special thanks!  She handled a problem with rooms (due to prior guest not checking out on time) with professionalism and kindness, offering an upgrade and discount to our guests staying on the property.  Oh, and the food!  The chef was kind enough to do a private tasting on our schedule since the bride and groom both live out of town.  He offered us some wonderful choices and guided us through choosing what turned out to be a delicious menu!  The wait staff and bartenders were very attentive and friendly to our guests.  All in all, it was a joyful day, due in a big part to the great  staff at Cedar Creek.  I would not hesitate to recommend this venue for a wedding or any other event.

Text: All the hotels in Washington were booked so I called Cedar Creek. They had a cabin available. I arrived very late due to flight delays, 2:15am. I was welcomed and was walked to my cabin. It's spotless with a nice sunroom attached that has a ceiling fan and nice lighting. I travel all over the US for work. Staying in different hotels every week. This is by far the friendliest staff I've ever dealt with. Always asking if I need anything and not to hesitate to ask. For the same price as a small hotel room, you feel like your actually at a resort and treated as such. Friendly staff, good food and drinks at the Town Hall and a great room for the price will keep me coming back here instead of a usual hotel. A+!
