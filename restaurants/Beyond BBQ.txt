Beyond BBQ

Text: I really like this place, it's never busy because they do most of their business through catering but their food is great and the owners are really nice! I've tried several things on the menu but my favorite is the Italian Sub Sandwich. They make everything from scratch and they have a little bit of everything, great BBQ, Asian and American food!

Text: They catered my wedding (150 people) and it was incredible! Everyone was raving about the food and asking where it was from. We were impressed by both the quality and affordability. 

After our experience, I'd recommend Beyond BBQ to anyone and everyone!

Text: Went with a group of friends to eat lunch here. I'd have to say, Beyond BBQ is probably the worst BBQ joint I have ever been to! The waitress took a long time to come take our order long after we were seated. Long enough that we had enough time to figure out what we wanted to order but only took our drink order after the long wait. Maybe after 10 minutes later, we got our drinks then did she actually took our order. After waiting quite sometime to get our food I got up and asked where our food was and she got rude with me! She sneered and said to me to "take a seat it'll be a just a minute"!  Not only was the meat on my sandwich very dry and seemingly old, but it was cold as well with my fries! I'm assuming probably because our order sat up there getting cold while she chatted up what looked like her friends visiting her. She finally looked over and saw us staring at her, so she rolled her eyes and grabbed our food. Put it on our table and walked away without saying a word! She didn't come back until it was time for us to pay our check.  Not a," how's everything?"or a drink refill --nothing! We had to ask someone else for a to go box for one of my friends eating with us. In my opinion, my friend should have just left the food behind. Not only was the food gross but the service was horrible! Plus, what's with the smell in there?! I am not from Plattsmouth, so if you're wanting to see a good representation of the people and food of Plattsmouth I would suggest not choosing this place as your first experience!

If I could rate a zero on here I would!

Text: We went here for the first time, after hearing that someone else tried it. I had seen it before but never heard anything about it. We were pleasantly surprised. They don't have much business (I'm guessing because of a lack of advertising). It's basically a cheaper version of Famous Dave's Barbecue. My wife and I shared a 3 meat combo and it was enough for both of us. The bill total was $16 (with an extra side) including tax. I had the best ribs I've had in a very long time. The Mac' n' cheese was awesome! The brisket and pulled pork was very good! There was very little fat or grissle in any of the meat. The BBQ sauce was good, but nothing to rave about. The inside was nothing special (see pics). Overall I would highly recommend to anyone.
