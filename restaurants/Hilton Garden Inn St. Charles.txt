Hilton Garden Inn St. Charles
Rating: 3
Text: Location was convenient, located off main street, near downtown Batavia and St. Charles. Lovely courtyard, 1st floor bedrooms had semi-private patios within courtyard. Pillows were the best I have used in a hotel. I didn't have the breakfast, but It looked better than most hotel breakfast/buffet.

Text: There was a really loud wedding party out in the courtyard until 2am. I called the front desk multiple times to ask that the party be moved inside but the staff was completely unhelpful and unresponsive. Don't stay here if you can help it.
