Sally's On Broadway

Text: Great small town cafe, amazing the great food from this little out of the way gem.  Homemade onion rings are fantastic.  I had the Red Hot Sally, tenderloin with pepper jack cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce and other good stuff.  Wife had the Hawaiian Blue Cheese burger and enjoyed it, pineapple and all.  If you are ever close to Springville this is a great place to fill up.
