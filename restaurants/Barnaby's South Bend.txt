Text: Simply the best pizza in town.  It's a very unique pizza, not like anything you'll get anywhere else.  I also enjoy how dark it is.  Just wish there were less TV's but I guess that's just personal.

Text: In a word? Fantastic. Nothing fancy or artisanal here, just great pizza. The ordering process is strange (you pay for drinks at one counter, food at another), but you won't find better pizza unless you're up for a road trip. The crust was no bit player here - a true beer dough crust, expertly cooked with the right amount of flavor and crunch. The pizza was covered edge to edge with toppings and then cheese, allowed to brown just a bit before the lava-hot pie is served up.

Do yourself a favor, South Bend diner. Put this in your mouth.
