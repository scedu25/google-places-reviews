Text: The mozzarella 'sticks' on the appetizer menu is to die for. I will order them no place else. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, they have seating to accommodate anyone or size, and their service is always first-rate. The only thing I can say negatively about the place is you have to pay a price that compliments such a fantastic place to eat.

The staff was very helpful from booking the room to great service on the day of they event, they were accommodating with our menu choices, room layout, and took care of all the little details. The food got rave reviews from our guests. Thank you for a great time!

Text: The martini bar is a mainstay. You will be comfortable in a suit or right off the golf course. We always start with the hummus plate.
