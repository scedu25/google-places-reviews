Text: Quite possibly the most negative dining experience I've ever had in my entire life. The waitresses we had never checked on us after we got our food. We all ordered all you can eat fish, and had to flag down a separate waitresses to actually get more. When we did leave, I saw our original waitress come back immediately and audibly heard her detest the tip we left for her. She was lucky we left a tip at all. I will not ever come back unless some extensive circumstance arrises.

Text: Although the servers are very friendly, I always feel rushed to order here. We were asked three times if we were ready to order in 5 minutes and this happens almost every time. If our menus are still out and we are diligently looking at them,  NO we're  not ready. After all of the attention at the beginning, once we got our food our server was nowhere to be found with refills. Having said that, I got the Ex hamburger and it is the best thing I've had there!

Text: I usually don't write reviews, good or bad; however, in this case I am making an exception. The service was good, attentive and friendly. The food however, was less than dinner quality. "Hand cut aged ribeye" was a 1/4 inch thick strip steak. Over done on a flat top soaked in ag sauce served with yesterday's baked potato. The pork tenderloin... was pork... too tough to eat. Will not return.
