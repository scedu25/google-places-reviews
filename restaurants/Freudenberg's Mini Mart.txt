Text: When it comes to fuel, their pumps are not accurate and they add another 14% to your total bill when it's time to pay if you are not tax-exempt and have the paperwork on file with them. That is complete bull because the pump says that all taxes are included. So even though the pump say that all taxes are included, that is simply a lie. I also find it really odd that they want your name when you go in to pay for your fuel. Then when you question it, they don't know the real answer of why they're adding more to your bill and then the old, crabby, uneducated "manager" that works the deli comes out with a really horrible attitude and just starts yelling what has already been explained not very well. So the owners should adjust their pumps to show the true prices and a minimum. Needless to say, I will never buy fuel from this dump again. You are much better off going to the Love's Travel Stop about five miles down the interstate.
