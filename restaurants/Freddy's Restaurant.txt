Freddy's Restaurant

Text: Just had our last 2017 meal at Freddy's. The food here is great. My favorite is the lamb chops, but their perch is great also as it is pan fried and not deep fried.  They will be closing up for the winter but back in the spring. Awesome place to have a nice summer dinner on the patio and watch the best ever sunsets right from your table.

Text: The pickerel was fantastic as well as the Caesar side salad I had with it. The house red is good too. Good food, good service. Ice cream bar attached next door so I didn't have to get wet going for desert when the monsoon rain started during lunch. Was really hoping to enjoy the patio, maybe next time.

Text: Excellent food, some of the best fish I've had, the skillet-served blackened bacon wrapped pickerel was perfect. No flaws. Period. Our waitress Rebeca was kind and helpful with dining decisions. Rob the chef came out personally and talked with us for a bit, and even made mention to me that he was a scotch drinker as well (Lagavulin 16, highly recommend). Overall one of our most memorable dining experiences - we will be returning when in the area.

Text: This was by far one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Our waitress Rebecca's was amazing and very friendly and the chef Robert came out to ask us how we were enjoying our meal. The food was incredible and the staff made the experience just top notch. We can't wait to eat here again and highly recommend it as a place to stop to or from Point Pelee!
