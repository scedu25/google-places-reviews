Text: I've lived in Topeka all my life and was pleasantly surprised when I ate here for the first time the other day! I had the chicken tacos and they were  AMAZING. It's easy to tell that everything is made from scratch (and it was delicious) and the price for what you get is spot on! Hefty portion for only 8 dollars. The service was excellent, even during their lunch rush. Keep it up Cafe Holliday, and I will definitely be back!

Text: What a delightful little gem! A charming location near a lovely park, with a great atmosphere and plenty of natural light. The staff was friendly and accommodating for our large party. I had a shredded chicken burrito with freshly made tortilla chips and salsa; very authentic, and quite filling. The sandwiches looked very good, I'll have to try one next time. I highly recommend this cafe.

Text: Overall, I normally like Cafe Holliday, especially Saturday morning breakfast. It was not up to par on my last visit. Somehow my scrambled eggs and sausage came out cold. My pancakes were lumps of dense dough that syrup couldn't even penetrate. To their credit, I asked for a refund on my two very sad pancakes;which they gave me.  I haven't taken them off my list at this point because of that. I hope my next visit is much yummier.

Text: Wonderful light fair, good selection of sandwiches, great staff!  The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is I expected a breakfast place with the google write up.

Text: We enjoyed the lunch here today. I thought their guacamole was very good a little heavy on the cilantro but otherwise very fresh and tasty.
