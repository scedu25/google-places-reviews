Text: Not a big fan of BBQ... But did like it...the sauces are very good, award winners actually... And handmade chips are excellent... The atmosphere is casual... plenty of televisions... Memphis style blues play in the background... Get in and out for a good and quick lunch

Text: This was my first visit and I was not disappointed! Everything was delicious, especially the brisket. The pulled pork was great, as well as the green beans, the fried biscuits with apple butter, everything! Our server was fast, friendly, and informative. Can't wait to go back!

Text: I reserve five stars for only the best,  and this place truly deserves five stars.  Their BBQ is some of the best I have had, great enough to rival Kansas City.  I had the BBQ Nachos,  bring a hearty appetite and an empty stomach.  Others in my party had the Thursday special which was superb.   If you love onion rings,  this is the place.  Their service was exceptional.

Text: Tried this placed  based on reviews. I was highly disappointed. First, the price is a little high. We ordered to go and they didn't give us utensils or napkins. Their pulled pork was dry and had a salty flavor. I tried dowsing it in bbq sauce but even that couldn't save it. The coleslaw had a nasty after taste. I rarely ever write reviews but I felt compelled to with this experience.
