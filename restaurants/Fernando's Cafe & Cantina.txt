Text: One your employees Allan Love Jr wrote a very vulgar comment to me on youtube. His language was so foul that it was extremely disconcerting to me. If this is indicative of the kind of people who work for you, then I would run screaming out of there. I wouldn't be surprised if he has spit in your customers food.

Text: Good food, service was slow due to restaurant being busy but not bad. Poor rating due to an employee or friend of employee stealing my card information. Currently disputing the unauthorized charges with my bank. This restaurant was the only place in recent time that I have handed my card off to someone and the charges showed local use only a few hours after eating dinner here. I will be making a better business bureau claim.

Text: Their food is cold and is raw. The owner is a jerk. Some of the co-workers are rude as hell. And the business is just in the dumps. The kitchen area is FILTHY! I will never eat in this place ever again.
