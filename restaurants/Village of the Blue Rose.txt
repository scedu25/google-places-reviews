Text: My large family of 23+ stopped in for lunch and to celebrate an anniversary this past Sun (5-28-17). The staff was very curtious and attentive, and went out of their way to accommodate two of our family with gluten and dairy allergies. Not only was the service very good, the food was fantastic!
