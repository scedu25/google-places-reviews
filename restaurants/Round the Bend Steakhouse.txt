Text: Great and friendly service! Our first time and Gail N. our server was super friendly. The bar staff while we were waiting were also great. Also we were told that it would be a 45 minute wait and it was exactly! Oh, and of course the food was delicious!! Would definitely recommend and it is totally worth the wait.

Text: We were in Lincoln for the week visiting family and needed to find a place between Omaha and Lincoln to meet friends for dinner.  Round the Bend did not disappoint!  We'd heard of the famous Testicle Festival but didn't know what to expect for dinner.  We arrived on the later side so seating wasn't a problem.  A well made (and only $2!) bombay and tonic along with $1 draft beers got us started. The Prime Rib dinner was fantastic and my wife enjoyed the generously portioned Steak Salad.  No complaints on the sides and we definitely didn't have room for desert.  Will definitely return next time we're in Lincoln or Omaha.

Text: Incredible burgers! These may be the best burgers I've ever had. Fresh dinner salad. Breaded shrimp: perfectly cooked. Breaded mushrooms with cheese: firm and well-seasoned. Priced to compete with lower-quality joints, you get more than your money's worth. This is my wife's and my second visit, with Gail waiting on us at our table. Gail is friendly, attentive, informative, and goes the extra mile to make the dining experience fulfilling. You better try the food at this family Steakhouse! You won't be disappointed.

I took a photo of my double Swiss Mushroom burger. Notice the cheese and mushrooms on top of BOTH patties! Wow!

Text: This Steak house is absolutely fabulous!!   The food is excellent and my steak was superb. My sirloin was one of the best I've ever had, tender, juicy, loaded with sautéed onions and mushrooms with a knock out flavor.  The steak I must add, was about half the size of the plate!! The asparagus was tender and grilled lightly. Just a great place to satisfy any appetite. Free soda with any meal.

Text: I was here for a wedding reception so I haven't been to the actual restaurant. The reception was in the same building though and the restaurant catered the event. What I can tell you from the food they catered is that I'm DYING to go back for more. It was delicious!! The menu choice the couple chose was simple. Pulled pork, potatoes, things like that. There was some kind of hashbrown cheesy potato dish that I couldn't stop eating. Everything was absolutely amazing!!
