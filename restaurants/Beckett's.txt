Text: Food was great and our waitress was very good about checking up on us to make sure our drinks were full and everything was fine... but the woman running the front bar last night was a total mood kill for us she was extremely loud and was yelling at some other waiter all the way across the restaurant she was so loud that you could here about everything she was saying to the people she knew sitting at the bar me and my wife both heard profanity several times along with some gossip about someone’s relationship she was not professional at all and is bad for business and I’m pretty sure we weren’t the only ones thinking that last night.

Text: Went for a late lunch with my 2 pre-teenaged boys who were a bit rowdy but the staff was wonderful. The food was amazing and reasonably priced!

Text: Our meal was delicious.  I had the catfish fillets with a baked potato. The fish was tasty,  one more fillet would have been plenty.  The potato was good size, well cooked and was hot throughout the meal.  I had peaches as a side and there was plenty.  I topped off the meal with a slice of their key-lime pie that had just the right amount of tartness to it.  I also want to thank our waitress,  Cathy,  for making the meal enjoyable!
