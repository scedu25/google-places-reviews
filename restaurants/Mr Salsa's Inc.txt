Text: Delicious drinks. Frozen margaritas are super good. Everything I have ever tried here (Mexican buffet, chimichanga, burrito, enchilada, tacquitoas well as salsa & chips) is delicious. Their fried chicken is very crispy and flavorful & cooked perfect. I & ladyfriends eat here often. One if our favorite places. Highly recommend.

Text: I ordered three things off the a la carte menu.  A pork tamal that I thought was above average, a carne asado soft taco that I thought was below average and a enchilada verde with pulled beef that was absolutely amazing.  That was may have been one of the best enchiladas I have ever eaten in my life. I would definitely recommend that dish to anyone.
