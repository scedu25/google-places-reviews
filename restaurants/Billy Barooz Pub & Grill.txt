Text: Just passing through the area when we stumbled across this place and really glad we did. Great layout and atmosphere and our bartender Casandra was outstanding !!! She recommended their buffalo wings and said to try them I believe "Gerry" style?? which is after they're deep fried and sauced then they're tossed on the grill for a short bit......AWESOME and thanks Casandra !!!
