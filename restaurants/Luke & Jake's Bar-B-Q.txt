Text: I stopped by Luke and Jakes while heading to view the eclipse.  The food was perfect and the sauce was amazing.  Whenever I am in Kearney I will stop for a delicious meal.

The folks running this place were very friendly!

Text: The food was great! Took a moment for us to get noticed though, as all the employees were in the back. Didn't have to wait long and they allow dogs in their outside eating area.

Text: Sometimes their food is terrific. The BBQ sauce is out of this world. Sometimes, depending on the time of day, the service and product presented are subpar and potatoes can be tough in spots and hard to eat. The management/owner can be unwilling to listen and defensive when an issue is brought to his attention. I suggest buying the sauce and making your own potatoes at home. It really is very good.

Text: I was a bit disappointed. Ordered the stuffed potatoe with beef. But there just wasn't enough beef to make it seem worth the price. Should've got the sandwich.
