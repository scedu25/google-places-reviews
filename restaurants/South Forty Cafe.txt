Text: I had the pleasure of having south 40 recommended to me while treasure hunting on the fabulous finds on hwy 99. While the food was just ok, we waited 45min. For a sandwich and an additional 30min for the onion rings that were ordered at the same time. Poor VERY POOR service. The cashier VERY RUDE,SERVER INATTENTIVE TO THE POINT OF IGNORING. THAT being said, maybe next year during such a busy weekend the mgmt will consider having some extra help on hand. I will not be dining elsewhere. ZERO ?
