Text: Amazing!! Yes, sometimes there is a long wait time, but they're very efficient about making the pizzas in order of when they get them so they can get them done according to the order. Considering how many people are usually working in there, how little oven space they have, and how many orders they get every day, they stay pretty on top of things. "Good food takes time"!!

Text: Terrible!, Waited an hour and half and then we're told it would be another 45 minutes.  At this point we canceled order.  No one bothered to come tell  us anything  whole time we were waiting.  This was terrible evening as we had several kids with us while we tryed to patiently wait.  Thanks for nothing. Upset and won't be  stopping  there again!
