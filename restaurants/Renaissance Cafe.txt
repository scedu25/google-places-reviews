Text: Went here for a work dinner and the food was FABULOUS for very reasonable prices!  Our waitress gave amazing suggestions not only about the food but also about the wine to pair with it.  Gem in the middle of Kansas, this place is worth the drive!

Text: Came here for my birthday tonight, because my son is the sous-chef.  I'm coming back again!  The seafood minestrone is out of this world scrumptious!  Had the Porterhouse steak for two as the entree...yuuuuum!  For dessert the Chocolate Panda Cottage was an excellent finish to the meal.  I just wish we lived closer.
