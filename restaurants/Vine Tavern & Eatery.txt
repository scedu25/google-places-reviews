Text: Do NOT order a long Island here it's the worst I've ever had.  Salad came after the meal.  I had the Cajun pasta with chicken it was a lil greasy but really good.  The person I was with just wanted dessert instead of a meal, my meal was setting there for almost 10 minutes before he got his dessert and I got my salad.  First and last time I will go.

Text: I went here for lunch by myself, but I would definitely consider coming back with a large group. It is a very open and spacious place. Service was great and prompt. I ordered the peppercorn burger and ceasar salad, it was served to order and tasted great

Text: First of all, I went with a group of almost 30 people. The service was fantastic! We had two servers between all of us so a couple of mistakes were to be expected. My beer came out after everyone else's drinks, but the server taking care of our section did not forget me and made it a point to let me know he was working on it. Our food came out all at once and after only a short wait, all things considered. Nobody had anything bad to say about their plate, and everything came out hot and as ordered. Bottom line is It's affordable, the staff is super friendly and efficient, and the food is delicious. I never hesitate to dine here.
