Text: I love the food here. I don't remember the waitress's but she was a trooper. We had a party of 18 not including the little baby that we were all there to see. She helped us and served us our food in a timely manner. She was awesome. Great food, great place, and great service.

Text: There was dirty silverware on the table, the cloth napkins were stained and dirty, and the food was sub par. I had Alfredo noodles with chicken and the chicken didn't taste good. The noodles were so-so and the Alfredo sauce was below average... especially for an Italian restaurant. The wait staff was awesome though. Pretty much the only good part of the meal was the desert.

Text: I had the meatballs here today. They were really good. About the same size as the ones at the Illa Milano off of Schrock Road. Anyway, the vibe is really great here. The decor and vibe is mafioso. And frankly I probably will be back when I'm back in town. Sending best wishes to the owner and staff. Usually my reviews are a bit longer, but felt like getting straight to the point was more important for this review.

Text: I've been to G's dozens of time over the years. I've never been disappointed with the service or good. I loved my server Nikki and my bartender Shay this past Friday night. Very personable, awesome ladies.
