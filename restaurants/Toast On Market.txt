Toast On Market
Rating: 5
Text: Coming from NJ, I'm accustomed to your old school Greek diners and upscale NYC brunch spots. Toast on Market falls in the middle of the diner spectrum. What separates this place from others is their execution. The service was friendly and informative. The atmosphere was energetic but intimate.  Most of all, the food was spot on.  Keep up the great work guys.

Text: This is the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to, hands down. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone is so friendly and welcoming. The prices are so reasonable for the quality of food! You'd pay just as much for a meal at ihop or Denny's but the ingredients would be much lower quality and there's really no comparison in taste. The hashbrown casserole is to die for! They also have seasonal drinks. The owner is so awesome!

Text: LOVE! Every single time. This is one of my absolute favorite places in Louisville for brunch and a latte. My favorite thing on the menu is the hash brown casserole...it is to die for. The service is always amazing, the host I usually see when coming is a outgoing, friendly gentleman who always has a great attitude and smile. This will always be one of the places I frequently visit when I need a treat myself morning!
