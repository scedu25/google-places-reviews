Text: Great food, friendly staff.  Tuesday is sale day which makes it a little more casual but it's also the day you can get pie.  Nightly specials.  My favorite is Thursdays chicken fried chicken.  Cozy booths and a nice clean environment.

Text: Stopped here on our way by and absolutely loved it.  I had the special chicken sandwich which was amazing.  Chicken was cooked perfect and tasted nice and fresh.  All the food we had came out tasting great.  Service was a little slow but the waitress was super nice.  Highly recommend.
