Bob Evans Restaurant

Text: Food is really good and hostess/cashier service is amazing. Servers and managers are very rude, however. I would not come there and eat at all if it weren't for a sweet hostess named Brenda who always goes out of her way to help people and make sure we are content and enjoy our visits.

Text: I go here often. Usually a good place for the family to have a nice meal. Unfortunately the server for our area walked out. It seemed that there was no plan for this. The entire meal,3 adults and 4 kids , took over 2 hours.
I still paid full price while receiving attitude from a male manager. I am afraid they have lost a loyal customer.

Text: The food was great. The place is clean . And we had the best waitress, she was there checking on us to see if we needed anything else.  I give it a five star,  it deserves  more. Everyone needs to try Bob Evans Resaurant to eat there. It's great.
