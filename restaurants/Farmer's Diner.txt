Text: The food is reasonable but when I walk into a restaurant and my shoes stick to the carpet I wonder about the cleanliness of the surroundings and kitchen. It seems like a den of bacteria. Others I know have Felt the same. We used to have a large group meet there monthly but we have changed restaurants because of these concerns.
