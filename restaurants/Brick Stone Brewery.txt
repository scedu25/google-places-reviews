Brick Stone Brewery

Text: Brick Stone is one of those micro-breweries / restaurants that really has done that mix well.  The atmosphere is warm with a touch of elegance.  The staff is friendly and the food is top-notch!   

The price is a bit on the high side, but you get your money's worth.  The in-house beers are good and they always have deals going on.  

Another side note: they focus on American style burgers, steak, and chicken, but they do some other types of cuisine very well.  The pork flautas my wife and I had were delicious and just enough for two!

They also have larger tables available for larger parties.  

With all those things, it's little wonder why they have been around for years!

Text: Excellent beer, good food, and great service. They accommodated our last minute family reunion party of 24 on Saturday night by opening their back room for us. Highly recommended!

Text: Brick Stone is great. They have a wonderful burger that is put between two Grilled Cheese. Everything I have had on the menu has been fantastic.
