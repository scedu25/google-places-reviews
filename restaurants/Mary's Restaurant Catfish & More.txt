Text: Never had catfish this good in my life. I'll always come back here when im in town and great prices for the amount of food you get.

Text: For the love of all that is holy, if you are passing through Warsaw don't waste your money on fast food.  The food here is less expensive and immeasurably better.  Generous portions too.  Best cat fish I've ate.

Text: Had lunch there on Friday and the Southern Fried Catfish Special was outstanding. Bass Pro's restaurant, Independence could take a lesson on Catfish from Mary's. The special consisted of three fillets, fries, two hush puppies and a trip to the salad bar. I loved the cucumber salad! The breading on the fish was just right.  Thinking of going to dinner there tonight!

Text: It was hard to find, but we'll worth it!- $50 for our family of 5 - which included our tip. It was the best catfish we've ever had!- We were offered beans, but they never brought them. Also,  the coleslaw is bland, but Mary was very nice & the food is served quickly.
