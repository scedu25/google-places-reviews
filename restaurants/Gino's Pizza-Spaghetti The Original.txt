Text: Your policy to not sell bottled drinks to eat in customers is stupid.   Since we couldn't get what we wanted we ordered water instead. You accomplished 2 things with your policy. 1st you got no $ for a drink sale and it cost you for the cups. 2nd you pissed off 2 customers who will go to the many other pizza establishments.

Text: Pizza is great but service is terrible. They are always behind and never acknowledge you as you approach. It's not just one time. But I keep coming back because I love the food.

Text: Ben is a jerk!!! He said he was the manager!!! I am calling the corporate office and sending as many email complaints as I can. The service is always horrible and the restaurant is always short staffed. Ben was rude!! They ran out of many ingredients on Sun. night! He said to me....every minute I spend on the phone take away from me making pizza! I will not spend my money there ever again!!!
