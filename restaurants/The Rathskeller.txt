Text: Attended a wedding here and was amazed by how cool the building was.  Lots of history and character abound in the place.  The staff was quick and helpful.  They converted the room from ceremony to dinner fast and kept the food coming!  Everything was wonderful for the couple's big day!

Text: I travel the country a lot and I eat out a lot and let me tell you right now that this is the best food that I have had in the Midwest. Seriously the best German food you'll find in the Midwest and some of the best food you will find in the entire state of Indiana. Absolutely loved the service the atmosphere and everything about this place! Will definitely be visiting again the next time I pass through Indy!

Text: Food was very good. Great atmosphere. I would only recommend making it clearer what beers were on draft and what comes in a can. Pretzels were oven fresh and the schnitzel was great.

Text: This place is awesome! As the name, it's in basement. It's an upscale place with great selections of beer. Food was good too. You should keep the stomach empty before coming here, since the plates were giant lol

Text: Great outdoor space for listening to music and drinking. It can get VERY packed so don't plan on having conversations in the outside venue. The inside area is nice and the food is good. Prices are a little steep.
