Text: Food was very good,  but way overpriced.  If you would like a drink at the place I suggest you stop at the convenient store next door to the motel and bring your own.  The bartender/ waitress will ignore you unless you specifically yell across the bar to get her attention

Text: Stayed in hotel all weekend and had horrible service at the restaurant all weekend. Very long wait time for everything... Being sat, greeted, getting drinks, getting food, getting Bill. We waited over an hour for several meals. Food was either wrong or not cooked correctly. Some food items were never delivered. I will never be eating here again.

Text: Just looking for a nice place to go. I find it funny one person states over price poor service and yet others giving a Great review. Wonder how many of those are made up by the owner of this place. Don't think I am going there now.

Text: Very nice atmosphere, but very lame service and waaaaay overpriced entrees. Bring your paycheck. No wonder they don't show their menu anywhere online.
