Text: Always knew of this place, but never went. Just visited Norfolk for a week and decided to stop by a few times. The coffee of the day was my favorite. The prices were great too.

Text: It is a quaint bakery that reminds you of an Italian area when you turn onto the street it is located on. 
The menu is limited to bakery items and coffees only but it is delicious and worth your time.
Additionally the staff are nice and very willing to assist you in choosing the very best bakery option for you.

Text: I have never given any place less than 3 but this place doesn't even deserve one star. First, my wife's smoothie had no banana flavoring in her smoothie, which she paid extra. When she said something they said they would add more and never did. Then, we ordered a 12.00 philly sandwich on a toasted bun. My wife ordered a French dip, 8.00. When we received them the bun was rock hard. Also, one side was completely black from being burned. I took 35 minutes for these sandwiches to be made. Such a disappointment. When we mentioned the burned buns, the young lady walked away and we were avoided the rest of the meal. I recommend going to OMAHA NE and eating at CHARLESTONS to get much better food.

Text: I go to lots of coffee shops and sit and study for hours. This one is quite good. Lots of seating in a good setting. Coffee and food are excellent.
