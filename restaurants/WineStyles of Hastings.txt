Text: We just had a bridal shower there and it was the best bridal shower experience I've ever had. The food was incredible. The wine was great and the ambiance was awesome. Brian was wonderful to work with and all I did was enjoy myself which I seldom do if I'm putting it on. They made the whole experience a joy. We all had a fantastic time. The party room has such a unique atmosphere.... Thank you much Brian.
