Text: Best place to eat hands down. Try the hand dipped portabella mushrooms or fried pickles! Best fried catfish fillets everyday of the week or try whole all you can eat catfish on Friday nights. Everything is so reasonably priced and drinks are super affordable. Steaks are had cut daily with a wide selections of cuts offered and cooked to succulent perfection by Todd or Gene on the open pit grill. Served with the huge salad bar! Saturday and Sundays they have All You Can Eat  breakfast buffet 7am to 11:30am with fresh fruit and salad bar included. WOW!  Wednesdays is pizza buffet starting at 5pm. The list goes on and on. This place is absolutely amazing and To Die For!!! Highly recommend you come on out and get you some!

Text: Locally owned steakhouse with a little bit of a tavern feel.  This restaurant/bar is a nice place to eat but if you are planning to eat steak, expect to pay more than you would at Texas Roadhouse.  Average steak meal is about $25 before tip.
