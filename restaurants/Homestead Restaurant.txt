Text: Love to eat here with my family. I always enjoy their fresh salad bar and pasta salads they make. One of my son's favorite places to eat because of the delicious fried chicken. The only down side is that it can get very busy because so many other people know it's  so good too! So you may have a wait if you go at a popular time like  Sunday.afternoon.
