Text: If you can't make reservations to Patti's don't miss the opportunity for great food, eat at Bill's! Bill's offers a more open seating atmosphere with the same menu. It is right next to Patti's and has the same access to the little shopping town and gift shop.

Text: Same kitchen and menu as Patti's but no wait to get in. I'll even argue that is it actually better decorated. Excellent food and dining experience.

Text: Some of the best food I've ever had.  I recommend anyone who is traveling down I-24 to stop and have a 2" pork chop.  There is no possible way to be disappointed.  They do an excellent steak also.  And after you've eaten one of the finest pieces of meat you will ever eat, save room for one of their many ridiculously good deserts.

A must if you are in the area!!
