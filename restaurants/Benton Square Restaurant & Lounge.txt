Text: But it's not "Benton Square Restaurant"... it's Di Trapiani's now. The Veal Luciano is my favorite. High quality dishes across the board.

Text: They were always able to get exactly what I wanted and stay my price range even on short notice. I couldn't have been happier with their service.

Text: Horrible! Horrible! So very disappointed! This used to be my most favorite place to eat. No more bread with the delicious herb oils, appetizers is a rip off like my favorite stuffed mushrooms is now just one mushroom and outrageously priced. Our favorite lasagna is only cooked when the chef feels like it, less of a selection entrees that are outrageously priced with less on the plate! What used to be my favorite place to eat and escape with my spouse and enjoy a delicious meal, with leftovers to take home and enjoy, no longer exists. They don't give you enough food for the price you pay that you leave full and taking a goody bag home. The only things that have stayed on the menu that I did love so much are gross, bland, and no taste! Will not be back again to pay for high priced food that I could get at sirloin stockade!
