Text: It's a shame really. Good food and a great venue, but my oh my, the service is so poorly trained and managed. Unprofessional and unprepared...always (I've been here several times). Whenever this establishment comes up in conversation it is the same thing regardless of who the conversation is with: good food, but terribly unprofessional service. It is just wildly mis-managed (there was an all-day hockey event there involving several teams and they didn't even prepare for a crowd...there was a manager and two wait staff there). Crazy!

Text: The WORST service ive ever had in my life. 

I went for an event on Halloween, cheep wings and cheap jello jots was what they used to advertise the event.

I go and order 12 wings. Only 12!!! & I waited for over an hour and a half to get them!
There was not many people in the place and we watched other tables come in and out while I waited for just 12 wings. When I finally got my wings they were cold and didnt have the sauces I asked for. Just regular cold wings. 

Not to mention the jello shots didnt have anhy alcohol in them leaving many tables disappointed, including mine.

I gave my reciepts to my waiter on the way out and saying I expect these get taken off my card. They were charged in full the next morning.

I will never go back there after this. TERRIBLE. Waste of money and time.
