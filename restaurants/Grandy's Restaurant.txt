Text: Good food good prices. Seem to be out of things often but service is good most of the time, so I'm willing to wait or substitute.

Text: Waited 10 minutes at the drive thru menu to put our order in. 8 meal orders through the drive thru and not a single fork handed out. Then the portion of dumplings was a half portion on one order and another order was completely wrong. A third order was partially eaten when 3 hairs were found it. Absolutely horrible.

Text: It was clean.  Food was bland.  Steak was not good at all tasted undercooked or something.  Mashed potatoes had no flavor.  Rolls are alot smaller then they use to be.
