Text: This place is amazing! Whether you're a francophone, looking to give your taste buds a treat, or interested in a beautiful and friendly atmosphere, this restaurant gives it all! As a former inhabitant is France, it's like a true French restaurant - with the owner checking on his customers. As a mother of a toddler, it's also family friendly with a tasty kid menu. The bar area is cozy and private for date nights. All around a wonderful dining experience!
