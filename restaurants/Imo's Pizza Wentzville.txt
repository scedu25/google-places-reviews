Imo's Pizza Wentzville

Text: I moved to Atlanta 2 years ago and every time I come into town, I hit up Imos! I couldn’t believe it has been a year since I’ve had this. T ravs were great, provel bites were alright and pizza was perfect. I’m not sure if it’s been a long time or what but the pizza did taste a little salty to me. Like really high in sodium. Weird. But otherwise good stuff

Do not give this place your business.

Text: If you're just passing through St Louis or out of Kansas City, DO NOT skip out on grabbing Imo's or you will definitely regret it. Kind servers, clean interior and the best pizza and fried ravioli I've ever had. Sit down and enjoy it piping hot or get it to go/delivered, but make sure and ask about any specials or combos to get the most band for your buck.
