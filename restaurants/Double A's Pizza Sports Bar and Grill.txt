Text: Double As is the place to go. Half price wings on Thursdays (it's dine-in only!), amazing mega meat pizza, and an incredible buffet. It's like $11 for a buffet with salad, fajitas, breadsticks, mac n cheese, wings, pizza, dessert pizza, and more. I'm there all the time with my friends.

Text: Good pizza, bad buffet. Skimpy toppings on cold pizza that to me tasted like frozen pizza. This pizza is really good so I don't understand the terrible, weird buffet. No pepperoni pizza was available, unbelievable and unacceptable.
