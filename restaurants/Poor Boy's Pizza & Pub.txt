Text: I am a server and bar tender and I know how difficult it can be to do the job. But Im not impressed with the passion to serve with this crew. Absolutely unprofessional.

Text: Very unimpressed sandwiches had no meat and bread felt like it was microwaved and fries where like refried and very little amount. cook must really hate his job. A great place to go to when your really looking forward to a great meal and lose your appetite with the first bite, definitely a awsome diet plan starter program if you need one

Text: I moved to this area about a year ago and see this on my route everyday. I always see it packed so I decided I would go in and give it a try. I walked in and saw a window so I walked up to it and this guy walked over and asked if he could help. I asked for a menu. The guy got snotty and said you don't order here, you order in there(pointing through the other doors). How was i supposed to know? Well, I haven't been back and won't since he was rude. So, I go to uncle bills instead. Uncle Bill's is probably better anyway.

Text: For a Hollywood burger shredded lettuce , soggy bun and medium burger. Doused mayo which made the burger sad. The french fries were hard and soggy . i was so pissed to pay 9 dollars for this meal ! Never do it again.
