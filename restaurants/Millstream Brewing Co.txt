Text: On festival days, when they should be thinking about  providing their best service to the many potential new customers that don't usually come into town until those days, I feel like they fell a bit short. For example, despite a hung sign that says "2 samples per customer", they do away with samples altogether on festival days, even though I was there at 5 PM and there was no one else in line. I understand the rule for the busiest times, although in their place I'd be filling up small disposable cups and distributing samples to the new customers in line so they could explore different brews and soda flavors, which should drive up sales, but my impression was that the attitude was in general not very customer-service focused. Not to mention my server was attending to me while talking on his cell phone. I hope that, if I come back, my experience will be better next time.

Text: Great creamy mac and cheese. Awesome chicken strips not to much breading on the chicken strips which is good. Delicious French fries. Kind waiter. Not expensive.

Text: Beer and location is great. Unfortunately the bartender seemed unsure on some pricing and samples were unavailable due to being a festival weekend.

Text: Super friendly, and very helpful.  Beer is delicious. I had the flight since it was my first time here, and it was a good decision. You get to take a glass home if you have the flight of 6 beers.
