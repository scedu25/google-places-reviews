Text: Nice location in downtown St Louis. Swift & friendly service & a really great meal as well. I had the pan roasted duck breast that was prepared perfectly, medium rare of course. A must visit when in the gateway to the west!

10/17/17 - What a difference a year makes. I showed up at 6:45 & they are already out of the daily special - shrimp risotto. My backup choice, the local chicken leg & thigh was disappointing as the meal’s temperature was inconsistent with the potatoes steaming hot but the rest of the meal lukewarm, & this on a slow night. This restaurant is capable of better than this.

Text: We had the most lovely evening here. The food was amazing. We had their blue cheese pre-selected board. My boyfriend was raving about it the whole day after. Also, the entrees were perfectly seasoned and portion sizes were generous. There were so many beer options and also the wine my server selected for me was perfect. The ambiance was very cozy and comfortable. It was very relaxed and the staff was very pleasant and not annoying at all. I definitely recommend and go back.

Text: I can't give any feedback about the food since I only had a martini, but if the service and hospitality are any reflection then it has to be amazing!

I had a little bit of time to kill before catching my Amtrak back to Dallas, had just come off of four days of cycling on the Katy Trail, and wanted a martini which is how I found this place. Long story short, they opened their doors, let me bring my bicycle in, and even found a special spot in the neighboring gallery for it. I offered to change clothes (I was still my cycling gear on), and they told me they didn't care about that! I sat at the bar, was given a tasty beverage, and amazing customer service from all of the staff.

Thank you so much for your hospitality!

Text: So I love this place! Food delicious, with many gluten free options, including house made bread! Our server Andrew was so knowledgeable about all our questions and even suggested a marvelous wine.

Text: The staff is super friendly. Our waiter, Victor, was helpful while my boyfriend and I celebrated our 2nd year anniversary. He explained the menu to us and answered any questions we had. There are affordable prices considering the atmosphere. Overall, a great place to go for a romantic evening!
