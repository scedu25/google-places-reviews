Text: Been a long time since our last visit. We miss the West Chester location. Food was excellent and Margaritas were unbelievable. Our server Samantha was outstanding. Service was quick too!  My only small complaint would be ambiance. Interior was a little dated. Lighting made reading the menu difficult. Overall owe would definitely make the drive and most certainly request Sam!!!

Text: Depends on what you get. Steaks are very good. Other stuff is good but not great.  Margaritas are very good.  It's not a 4 star restaurant but in Anderson Twp is one of the better ones. Bar service is excellent.
