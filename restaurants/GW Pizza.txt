Text: The food is good, but the service is lacking. We called in an order for delivery tonight. The girl who answered the phone was the least friendly person imaginable. Our order was delivered pretty quickly, which I appreciate, but then the delivery guy DEMANDED a tip. I am a delivery driver, and I can not imagine. He is lucky my husband answered the door instead of me, because he would have gotten nothing. And we are big tippers. Disappointed with the customer service. Won't be ordering there again even though we enjoyed our dinner.

Text: Nice local pizza shop I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a small local shop with a good quality pizza.

Text: The guy taking our order didn't seem to know his own menu. We got a special that was 2 large pizzas and 2 appetizers. We ordered chicken and cheese garlic bread. We got (what tasted like) microwaved cheese sticks and bread sticks. They were terrible. Don't waste your money. Go somewhere else.

Text: The staff was nice however the pizza was not very good. It was edible but in my opinion you'd be better off going to get a $5 hot and ready pizza somewhere else.
