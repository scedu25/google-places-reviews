Text: The food is good but the last time I went to the drive thru I was rushed to make my order. It was 530, far from closing. The same girl wasn't very friendly when I got to the window. I was not once rude or short with her. I'll still probably come here but someone needs to have a talk with her about friendly customer service. 08/18/17

Text: Food is pretty good especially the bread sticks and the staff are nice but the restaurant itself is usually pretty dirty unfortunately. Usually quite a few of the tables have not been cleaned or bused so it's kind of gross but that's the only downfall
