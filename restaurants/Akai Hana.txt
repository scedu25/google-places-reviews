Text: It was okay. It's different from what my husband and I are familiar with. The service is very friendly and watching the table for our needs. We regret going because it was a hefty bill. It would be nearly half the price at our regular go to Japanese restaurant. It's real busy for a Sunday,  this is a popular place, many enjoy it. Just not us. Enjoy Japanese food eaters. :)

Text: Gosh was here again today and yet another awesome experience.   The lunch box of the day is the best thing ever!    I have been going here for over a decade back to when they were Restaurant Japan and never a bad meal.   They can be busy if u hit the lunch rush so I try and go right when the door opens at 1130
