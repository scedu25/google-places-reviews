Text: I was very disappointed last night. I took a friend for their birthday to eat because they had never been there. I have been dining at moonlight since I was a little girl and was always great. The chicken was over cooked served on a plastic plate. My friend had ordered fish and broccoli and did not get his broccoli until I reminded them of it by which he was finished with the fish. Terrible service and the atmospher has changed. When your paying good money for your meal and there is a 2 refill policy on soft drinks is silly. I will not be visiting anytime soon. Nothing special anymore.

Text: Good, seems to be very popular and crowded, possibly a little short staffed for the crowd.  Service was good but they seemed stretched thin.  Once we had our checks there was no more service not even for water.  Food was good.  Two of us had the famous fried chicken and enjoyed it.  Two had fish, the green peppers and onions marinade for the salmon was quite tasty and that was good because the salmon itself was a little on the dry side.  One person had prime rib and they said it was OK but not the best they've had.  Overall it's a nice place, food is good, service OK.

Text: Great service. Food excellent. We went at 3:30 Sun. & it wasn't crowded & we & another couple were the youngest ones in the place! It was great!!!! Our waiter was outstanding since he wasn't slammed. One of the best dinners I've ever had.

Text: Fried Chicken done right.  We were a party of 7 and our waitress effortlessly attended to everyone's needs.  All tea glasses were kept full and soda refills were plentiful.  A very pleasant lunch.

Text: Great restaurant.  Has the best fried chicken in the Alton area. They also have a carryout menu that offers family style items. Very convenient and affordable.
