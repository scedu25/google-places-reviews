Text: First night here was awesome, it was slower and getting served wasn't an issue.  Came back ( during Thursday night football and it had a bigger crowd I admit) expected a little better service.  Felt like since I wasn't a local they couldn't care less.

Text: Food is always great, but the service is poor, I had to wait on a carry out the last time.  I watched my food sit on the counter getting cold while standing at the bar waiting for one of the three waitresses to acknowledge me, a simple "hi, we'll be right with you" Instead I stood watching the other six people sitting at the bar watching the Indians. It was an entire inning before I got cashed out, I can see why the place was dead.

Text: It was nice, but it didn't stand out as a place I need to go out of my way to go to. If I am in that area, I would go.
