Text: I really hate to leave my first bad review of what is now a local restaurant to us.  But over an hour for lukewarm food that was sub-par was so incredibly disappointing.  The only positive I have, is the waitresses are super nice (it's unfortunate they have to apologize so much for their cooks)  We won't be back.
