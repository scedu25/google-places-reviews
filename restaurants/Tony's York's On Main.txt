Text: The Sunday fried chicken was delicious however the vegetables was cold - maybe because of the ONE HOUR and 25 min. wait after being seated.  We ordered an appetizer and after 45 min. asked if they had forgotten about them, they arrived shortly before the meal.  I asked if possibly we could have some bread which was provided.  We were sitting first table so I know many staff had to see a party of 4 sitting there for over an hour with no food.   Too bad because the restaurant is beautiful and could be a place I return or recommend but no thanks.

Text: The owner, Tony, was extremely friendly, down to earth and accommodating. He went out of his way to bring a pre-meal snack for my 2 year old, and even made her some extra sides for a sampler, if you will, that he thought would be healthy and tasty options. He sat and chatted with us, told us the history of the location and was just super friendly and informative. 
The food was delicious, the staff was amazing, and the prices were great! I had absolutely no complaints. Highly recommend this place!

Text: Great place to stop by and eat! Their meatloaf and southern fried chicken were the lunch specials and were delicious. Stop by whether on a long trip or if you're in the area.
