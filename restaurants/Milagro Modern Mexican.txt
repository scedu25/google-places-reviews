Milagro Modern Mexican
Rating: 4
Text: The statesmen chili was elevated and well balanced in terms of flavor and spice. The service was great and they play altj, the shins and stuff. Just a little expensive for the portion.

Text: Milagro is ineffectively trying to be more elegant than it is. Went with my sister for lunch after googling restaurants in the area and seeing that it was well rated. 
Really the only genuinely tasty thing we had was the street corn. 
I was really surprised to find out this is a sister restaurant of Mission Taco, who's food is great. Not sure why anyone would go to Milagro over Mission. 
The service was also strange. Our waitress changed after getting our drinks and our new waitress was also the bartender/to-go server.

Text: Milagro has a fun, modern vibe to it. The food is quality (may I recommend their chicken burrito in particular). Our server was kind and genuine. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could! Great experience!

Text: I visited this place several times and I really do enjoy it each time. My favorite is definitely the chips and salsa as well as the street corn. I usually get the tacos but today opted for the stuffed and battered poblano pepper and by hubby did the steak burrito. Service can be hit or miss here and I definitely enjoy the lunch crowd better than the dinner crowd.
