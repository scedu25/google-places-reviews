Text: This is my morning coffee stop when I have time. Fast service, good espresso. They have taken my order over the phone several times which is a huge time saver.
Haven't tried the food.

Text: Me and my friends always meet at Cafe V and I don't think we've ever been disappointed. They have a busy space for people to grab food and chat, and a quiet room for studying. If you ever at Cafe V, you need to try out their side chips! They're the best!

Text: Nice atmosphere but somewhat dusty and dirty. Food was ok not great we had quice. Pastries in the case looked like they had been there a couple days. Quaint but needs a lot of cleaning and sprucing up.

Text: A little more expensive than other like places. Unique environment. Outdoor seating. Healthy drink and food choices. Good place for gatherings, meetings or studying.
