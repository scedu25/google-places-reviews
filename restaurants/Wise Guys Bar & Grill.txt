Text: A co-worker and I are staying at the Americinn across the parking lot and stopped in for dinner. Our waiter, Levi was great, friendly and attentive. We both got  burgers which were fantastic, cooked as ordered. Fries and toppings also above average. We will definitely go back before we leave town next week.
