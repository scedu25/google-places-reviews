Text: Amazing place if you know how to cook your steaks. I was in Grinnell for work and ate there twice it was so good. I would not recommend cooking the steak if you don’t have experience doing it. Pay the $3 extra and have them cook it. Will go back

Text: My husband is a truck driver so we live on the road. This was by far the most pleasant experience we have had at a restaurant and we've been to a lot of them. The food was wonderful. We cooked our own steaks and chatted with other customers at the grill. It was a wonderful experience, yes it is a bit higher prices but the experience itself was well worth it. Whenever we come through we will be stopping at our favorite restaurant, have a great dinner and chat with some new friends.
