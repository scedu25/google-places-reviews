Text: This restaurant was the worst place our family has ever ordered from before. We ordered a lot of food over $60 worth for the whole family. Drove 30 minutes to get there because they didn't offer delivery to our location. Got our food home and ended up throwing it all away because it was that bad. Ordered orange chicken that was soggy and orange shrimp that was so rubbery you couldn't bite into it. The noodles were very dry and the rice was bad. Only an hour after we ate the food we are all feeling sick and I also found bugs in the food. Called and talked to the owner he would not do anything for us. Very terrible experience! Please don't waste your time or money going to this restaurant!!

Text: Service was good but food was not. I have never thrown out take out. The egg rolls were the worst I have ever had. Hopefully just a bad night there but I will never try it again.

Text: The asian woman that answered didn't listen to my order and messed it up. And hung up on me without giving a total and expected wait. That should have been the moment we walked. Gave me a bowl full of green peppers when I asked for extra spicy. Also, the meat was so terrible I couldn't even eat an entire piece of it. Tried a second bite and gagged from the spongy low quality barely spiced meat. The szechuan chicken was terrible and my wife hated the potstickers. The place across the street destroys this place. Don't bother. Biggest waste of $18 in my life.
