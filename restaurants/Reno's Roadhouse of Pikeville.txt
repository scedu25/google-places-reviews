Text: The waitress was great. The food wasn't as good as what it use to be. Maybe it was just a bad day for them.

Text: Great place to eat.  Laid back and very comfortable restaurant.  Friendly staff and reasonably priced.  Try the Kobe burger!

Text: Called on our way over and they said it would be no wait. Once we arrived we waited 30 min to be seated. Once seated a waiter got our drinks and we ordered. Two steaks with loaded baked potato's and salad and a bloom in onion. The onion came first and was so hard my grandmother could barley eat it. Once our steaks arrived I cut into mine and tools a bite....it was cold. Extremely cold. The mushrooms were cold from can and the onions were raw. I moved on to the baked potato...... The cheese on top was burnt and hard. I had to peel it off. Once that was dont it was pretty good. Hot and tasty. But dammmnnn that steak was awful. The only good part about this whole meal was the waiters was nice.
