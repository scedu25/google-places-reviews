Text: Visited Hank's for a wedding reception. Charming facility with friendly and helpful employees and delicious food (try the fried chicken and check out the baked goods).

Hank's location is a bit remote but it's worth the trip.

Text: Great food with a very nice salad bar, including the giant cheese cube. It's a nice country location and fun to walk around the grounds. I love the barn atmosphere inside the restaurant. The shop has cute gifts.

Text: We had a great time.  Our waitress was pleasant. The ribs and chicken were the best. Nice salad bar. And to top it off they gave us a free bottle of champagne  because it was our anniversary.
