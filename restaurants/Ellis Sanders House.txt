Text: It was a delightfully authentic experience and well worth it. We loved staying in a real pioneer house with a unique history. The home is cozy and well maintained and the breakfast is delicious as well. If you get the chance it is well worth your time.

Text: We stayed here with our three children and can't say enough about how great this house is.  The innkeepers, Steve and Karen, we're so welcoming and fun to talk to.  The power went out all through Nauvoo our first night and we sat by candlelight and had a great experience.  The beds were comfortable and everything was so nice.  We definitely got a taste of the real Nauvoo!  If you want a great experience and want a place to stay that is more than just a small hotel room, this is the place.  If we ever get back to Nauvoo this is the ONLY place we will stay.
