Ohana Hawaiian Grill & Bar
Rating: 5
Text: Staff is very friendly, menu has a little Hawaiian taste and also regular American type food like steaks and burgers. Has a sports bar setting but is also a family resturant.

Text: I think it's a nice restaurant. Waiter was s bit slow but I think he had tables outside. It can be as cheap or as pricey as you make it. Depends on what you order. My husband ordered the fried grouper which was delicious. His two sides,  baked potato and asparagus. Asparagus was cold and I told the waiter but he didn't offer anything else although my husband said it was alright. He did only get like 5 spears though. I ordered the Hawaiian chicken salad. It was delicious. I had an angry orchard to drink. I won't do that again though as they were $5.50 each. I can get those cheaper at home. ? All in all it was ok at first impression. I would go back again to give it another shot.

Text: Really good and surprisingly cheap. I recommend the Swai Fish, nice crunchy breading with an amazing taste.

Text: Very good food. Had to get the Mahi Mahi today wanted to either get the Hawaiian shrimp or Hawaiian burger but went this the first time. Maybe next time. Got the Hawaiian version of Key Lime Pie. Didn't look limey but tasted limey. Most they are green or yellow.
