Bill's Steak House
Rating: 4
Text: Normally this place is a solid 5.  Today they were out of mushrooms.  It's happened before, not a huge deal.  The steak tips were crispy on several pieces.  Luckily the servings are big enough I picked around and got enough decent ones.  Our server was great, the food a little less than what Bills is known for today though.

Text: Best steak around. Great prices. Walleye is to die for and mashed potatoes and beef stock gravy are amazing also. Must eat place. We travel from Kendallville Indiana all the time even to get carryout Walleye.

Text: We're from out of town and everyone recommended this place. Large portions. My kids loved the ribs. My husband and I split the sirloin & shrimp combo. It was tasty but nothing extrodinary. Two sides come with the meal, side salad was a good size but unfortunately our fries were soggy, like they'd been sitting for awhile. Waitress was nice, service was pretty quick but for the money, I'd rather go somewhere else.
