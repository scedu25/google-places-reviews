Text: Interesting bowling themes, make us competitive while playing. The castle theme is too good...lanes are smooth and playful. Good crowd. Food and snacking options are pretty much the same.There is a dart room too. Outside the bowling alley is the beach volley ball court.

Text: I bought a Groupon for 2 hours of bowling for 4 people and I called to see if I could make a reservation for Wednesday night but I was told that they don't accept reservations and we have to come before 5 pm or after 9 pm on weekday nights because they have bowling leagues reserved on all lanes and they don't have popular convenient times for groupons or walk ins. The person I talked to was extremely rude. None of these details were specified on the groupon, they didn't mention any time restrictions. I am very upset and not sure what to do with my groupon now because we can't come on Saturday and my kids are at school so there is no way we could come before 5pm or after 9 pm obviously. He did say that there is only couple lanes open on Friday night and they are first come first serve.
