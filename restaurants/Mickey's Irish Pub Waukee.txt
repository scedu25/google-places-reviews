Text: Very convenient restaurant for my family but after our last experience we won't be back. I posted a review on their Facebook page where it was I was ridiculed and then it was deleted. Very unprofessional. Not family friendly despite advertising free kid meals on Sundays.

Text: Had the steak salad with horseradish sauce and roasted red peppers -- sooo good! My bartender was super friendly and you could tell they have a lot of regulars -- the bartender called almost everyone by name. Pretty busy considering it was between meal times, but my food came out fresh and fast. Nothing to complain about here.
