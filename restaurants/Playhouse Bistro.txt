Text: Stopped here for a lunch date, left hungry! $22 for a drink, salad and a "special of the day". The salad was made with rotting kale, the sandwich was the Triple, which had 3 slices of meat and just as thick a layer of Dijon mustard to burn the taste right off your tongue. They didn't care either that they advertise a Cesar pasta salad that is JUST pasta covered in MAYO! Gross! Good job on the redbull infusion though! Squirt of flavor and pour a redbull on top, but not worth $22!!!
