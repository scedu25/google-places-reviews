Text: Service were both decent. But for the money I think there's better places in the area. I do not recommend the chicken pasta. Get a steak. Its a steakhouse after all.

Text: Update:  I'm downgrading my review to 1 star.  We made the mistake of returning to the restaurant where my wife ordered a shrimp and pasta dish and only received 4 small shrimp in her entree that costs $26.  The pasta wasn't cooked very well and was loaded with a pool of grease on the bottom.  We brought the shrimp issue up with the waiter and he tried to charge us when we asked for 4 more shrimp.  My wife didn't finish her meal as she decided to just take it home and add some more shrimp of our own.  When we got home all the grease cooled and hardened in to a bunch of orange chunks totally gross.  I would expect this at a cheap quality restaurant, not one that charges you over $40 for a steak.  

Oh I almost forgot, I ordered a pork chop, and asked it to be cooked medium well.  They brought out a 3 inch thick pork chop that was completely rare in the center!    Anybody can tell you that having a piece of meat that thick prevents you from cooking it properly in the center without over cooking the outside.  again expected a lot more from this price of establishment.

Text: Meats are so good. When you ask rare it's a real rare!!! The service is great too. They bring a cheese cake with a candle to my friend for his birthday.
