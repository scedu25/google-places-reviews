Text: Service was good.  Went one afternoon about 3pm and ordered the ribs.  Ribs were slightly overcooked but everything else was really great.  Area was tables and floor were pretty clean except for the walls.  We were sitting in a booth and the walls next to us and the walls in the booths next to us, you could see grease spots from peoples hands and fingers on the walls.  Not sure if the business new they were there but you could tell they had been there for some time.  Other than those two things I had a really good experience and would continue to come back.  Maybe I'll ask for a table next time.

Text: Pleasantly surprised for a chain. Good, attentive service, good pulled pork and sauces, baked beans and slaw. Limited beer selection, but Sam Adams draft hit the spot.

Text: Excellent ribs! Had the status Louis style half rack with Caribbean BBQ sauce. Got it to go so no comment on service, but everyone was very friendly. The bar looked great and it was not to crowded.  I would go here again.

Text: I really really didnt like this place. Seems meat is over cooked to remove all flavor. No bbq sauce to add taste so very bland. I did like the cole slaw tho!

Text: Place was dirty with straw wrappers/napkins and food on the floor. Host that seated us was sitting down visiting with someone when we walked in. The waiter was kind and the food was pretty good, unfortunately the manager should be reprimanded for such a mess.
