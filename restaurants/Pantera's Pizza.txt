Pantera's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: I use to come here when I was a teenager and there was a skating rink right around the corner...place is awesome, pizza is beyond the best. The owner is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever meet. I could eat Pantera's every day! The only way  to go is with the Supreme Hunk!!!!

Text: The staff is great, friendly, attentive and the owner is quite a nice fellow.  The salad bar is pretty good.  The pizza is pretty good, original or thin.  They have video games for the kiddos (and my daughter loves this place, games or no) and big screens for the sports fans.  They also deliver to a limited area.  If you grew up knowing and loving Pantera's, get there!

Text: I've been going to Pantera's since I was a small child. The pizza is just amazing as it was way back then. The staff is super friendly and my kids enjoy riding the toy horse that I rode long ago.

Text: Sometimes I crave a Pantera's pepperoni pizza! This is your best bet for a traditional chewy crust mozzarella cheese pizza!
