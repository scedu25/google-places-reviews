Text: Pretty good food if not a little pricey for what you get. Fries are always good. I don't really care for their burgers. The crispy chicken wrap is very good. Kinda ridiculous in today's age to not accept CC and to charge for refills. Ice cream treats are very good and a better value than Dairy Queen or the local Dairy Dee.

Text: Good old fashioned lunch counter. No B.S. just good food at reasonable prices. If you are passing through looking for food and like a good burger, tenderloin, ice cream etc at a place that'll remind you of a different place in time do yourself a favor and find this place

Text: This is great food & sends you back to the 60s. We used to buy burgers at 10 for 1.00 years ago. Still going there, it's a mom- pop place loved by locals & visitors alike.
