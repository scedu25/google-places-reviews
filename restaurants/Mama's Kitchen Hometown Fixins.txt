Text: Our waitress was the cutest little thing I've ever seen. What a great personality. 

The food was great home cooking as I would expect from a place like this. We rode in on bikes hoping for a good lunch and these cute girls provided just that!

Text: The menu did not match the Google displayed. Service staff was a bit overwhelmed with the Saturday night dinner rush.  The food was very good, except the steak.  It was cooked right, but the cut was a terrible. The Staff acknowledged this and replaced it with a great steak. Some of the pies and cinnamon look fantastic!
