Text: Just passing thru town, we ordered the steak & eggs. It came with hashbrowns & pancakes. Everything was delicious! The steak & eggs were cooked perfectly!
 The menu was unbelievable! Everything under the sun including veal, liver n onions, tons of various sandwiches, clubs, burgers, and even gyros! 
Lunch, dinner & breakfast served all day! Wonderful service also!! The prices are very reasonable! We grabbed a takeout menu because we will definately be stopping back!! Thank you for a wonderful meal!!
