Golden Corral
Rating: 5
Text: We love this particular Golden Corral. We have eaten at others but they don't hold a candle to the Taylorsville road location. Fresh, hot food, wonderful selection, excellent service and a very clean environment. We would highly recommended for breakfast,  lunch and/or supper.

Text: Well prepared food served at the right temperature. Sometimes difficult to find someone to man the carving station. Seafood salad and sesame chicken are my favorites. Dessert selection is amazing. Clementine is the most attentive server during lunch. Be sure to sit in her section

Text: If you like someplace to take the family, some friends, or group then this is it. A great variety of food for a good price. The wait staff are very attentive to your needs, (especially Mamadou!) and will make sure you have what you need when you visit! Keep up the great work y'all!!

Text: Excellent food and attentive serving staff. Clean bathrooms. Our party seated outside staff door which saw constant traffic past our tight seating or would rate 5. Highly recommend for quality food.
