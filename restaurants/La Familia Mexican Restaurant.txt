La Familia Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Great tasting ground beef which is something that you rarely say or notice at a Mexican restaurant. The chip bar is different and allows you a bit more freedom than most places. Best of all the staff stayed late when my family needed a place to eat later than normal. Recommended for anyone looking for good Mexican in a small town
