English Inn

Text: Beautiful establishment. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Bartender took great care of me and offered drink advice leading to one of the best cocktails I've ever enjoyed. The food was delicious, all four in my group were beyond happy with their food choice. We will be back to sample more. The English Inn is well known in the area for their great food as well as their bed and breakfast. You won't regret it.

Text: From the beginning, I did not have a good experience planning my wedding at English Inn. Prior to 2017, I sincerely loved English Inn the few times I went (pretty landscaping with good food), hence my reason for planning my wedding there. I had a lot of problems reaching the Wedding Planner for weeks. My fiancee and I put down a deposit in May 2017. Shortly after, we realized that our dream wedding was in another location. I reached out to English Inn hoping to donate my deposit to another grateful bride, as I understood my nonrefundable deposit was not likely to be reimbursed, even 1.5year in advance. Not only was the owner rude, but accused me of "blackmailing" by offering to change my 1 star review if their company was willing to be charitable to our community. I am disappointed in this company and their poor customer service. I would not suggest this venue to future brides. Giving is what makes the world go 'round and this company is only interest in making money. Good place for dinner, but not the kind of people I was hosting my dream wedding.

Text: My husband and I went to celebrate our 1 year anniversary, and it was a wonderful experience. The service was superb, and the food was the best meal I've had while dining out. It's a beautiful inn with a stunning view. I can't recommend this place enough!

Text: We had our wedding ceremony and reception at the English Inn and it could not have been more perfect!   Our guests raved about the food, the grounds and the superior service that was given.  Amber, our wedding coordinator, was so professional and helpful from the very beginning until the end.  Anything that we missed, she thought of.  Rebecca was in charge of our cocktail hour and our reception, and she also was fantastic.  She would check in and make sure everything was going well and kept everything moving.  All of the staff was very helpful and accommodating and I can't say enough about the beautiful facilities.
