Text: 45 minute wait for breakfast. There were 4 seated tables when we arrived. Potatoes were burnt and nasty.

Text: My wife and I had the Fried fish dinners.  Both of our plates were full of grease.   Everything on the plate was drenched in grease.  Our fish and fries were soggy and cold.  The couple next to us ordered the same thing and after a few bites, paid and left their entire meal behind.  We were very disappointed and will not be going back.

Text: As the name implies, the food is indeed tasty! The portions are generous for the price and they have great specials. I really enjoyed their peanut butter pie. Homestyle cooking.
