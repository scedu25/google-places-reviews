Text: I had the Mushroom and Swiss burger. It was hot and juicy. The staff was cheery and helpful. It was like they could read my mind. I live over two hours away so go there about once a year when visiting friends. I always get the Cheese Wontons.

Text: The food at the ID is very good and worth stopping by for lunch or dinner. It's also a great spot to check out on weekends for dinner when it's pretty busy and hopping. Pool tables, old school political posters, and the woodwork make it a must have.

Text: Love the stew. Service was poor the last two times we visited and the time before that was terrible. Used to go here once or twice a month. Now maybe one a year.
