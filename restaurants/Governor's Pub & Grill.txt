Text: The food here use to be awesome, but it really isn't that great anymore.  I would suggest going somewhere else for food.

Text: We have been coming to Governors for over 20 years and it had be one of ourselves favorite places. The updated decor is fine however it has turned into a sports bar with multiple TVs.  It has lost its "neighborhood" cozy feel though. We are terribly disappointed in the new menu; the number of selections has been cut in half and the prices have increased. At least, the free peanuts and popcorn are still available.  We understand with change of ownership, change is to be expected however we won't be back. Guess, we'll have to find our new "neighborhood, go to place"
