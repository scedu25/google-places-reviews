Text: You may not be impressed when you walk in but when you order the food is top notch. Start out with Thai spring rolls they are made from scratch not frozen, and plan on whatever meal you choose to be very generous portions, and two other things you should try... Thai tea or Thai bubble tea whichever you prefer, and at the end order coconut ice cream for desert.. it's served over hot sticky rice and sprinkled with nuts. 
Not a cheap meal but very good and you can probably share a meal if your into that.

Text: I was extremely happy with the food. I ordered takeout. I have an unusual allergy. Thai Papaya accomodated my allergy without the dish being bland. I look forward to returning and enjoying eating "in house". You will be on the top of my short list of restaurants that aren't afraid to tackle allergies. Thank you.

Text: The owner was up front helping gather and distribute carryout orders. Both he and the young man up front were warm and friendly. Even though it was my first time there, they made me feel like a regular. Their pumpkin curry was scrumptious, as was the mango sticky rice. I cannot wait to try other items on the menu. So excited to have discovered this gem!
