Tacos Jalisco

Text: This was really good even though it was really spicy and burned a bit the next day. I am not a big fan of their salsa which is hot sauce with garlic and cilantro. I had the asada gordita and taco and they were great.

Text: The best Mexican food I've ever eaten. Salsas
A little hot, especially for one small can of soda. Next time in the area, it's a must stop. ?
