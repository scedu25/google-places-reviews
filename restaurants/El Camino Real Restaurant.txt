El Camino Real Restaurant

Text: My favorite Mexican place in Goshen. It is colorful and fun, service is fine, and the food is really good with large portions. My favorite thing to order is their vegetarian burrito -- it is bigger than your face and full of delicious peppers, rice, beans, mushrooms, onions, etc. The margaritas are a good deal.

As for those arguing over authenticity... just stop. Mexico is a large, diverse place. Food varies by region, and food adapts in new places  because ingredients will always differ.
