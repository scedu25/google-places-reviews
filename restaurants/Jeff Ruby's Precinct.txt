Jeff Ruby's Precinct
Rating: 5
Text: I was incredibly happy with having dinner at The Precinct with my wife for her birthday. Chad, our waiter, was fantastic. He made an excellent recommendation on a red wine for us and he listened to our requests for dinner which led to an amazing experience. The restaurant is incredibly clean and the ambience is amazing. A waiter who was walking around near the kitchen saw us from across the room and asked us if he could pour us more wine since our glasses were getting low. We obliged and my wife asked about a chandelier in the adjoining room, he proceeded to give us some history about the restaurant. It was overall an amazing experience and, though the cost of dinner here is high, it really is worth it for the experience. I'm so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.

Text: I am from Cleveland, Ohio and have family in California and Chicago.  I have been to many restaurants and steak places over the years and I must say, this is the best.  I have met owners of steak places in Cleveland such as "Red" and have told them that even though their place is good, it is non comparable to The Precinct or any of Jeff Ruby's restaurants.  I was basically an unpaid marketing intern in Cleveland when Mr. Ruby had plans to open a place in the area, but I was saddened when I heard the plans fell through.  I have been to The Precicnt many times and in my eyes it is superb each and every time.  From the service to the atmosphere to the food it is perfection.  I have told friends of mine they need to try it, insisting on it being the best.  My friends often laugh and have doubts, but, each friend has returned to me saying "Connor you are right, it is now my favorite restaurant".  I am excited to be there this weekend before the John Mayer concert and cannot wait to experience what The Precinct delivers each time I go.  Mr. Ruby, thank you!

Text: Not great if you any food sensitivities. I understand it’s difficult to cater to those who have them, but what I was given was unbelievable. My husband who doesn’t have any felt as though his food wasn’t spectacular either. I feel like when you attach a price like that to something it should be worth it in some way. I often pick high end restaurants because I have better luck finding things to eat, not this time.

Text: Went there for my birthday and I definitely felt like a celebrity. Best service I've ever had at a restaurant. I wish I could of met Jeff ruby. Very inspired by his work and would love to own a steak house of my own one day as good as his.

Text: Top of the line service and food. Looking for a fancy date night, than this is place is your go to spot. Dress up red carpet style, bring the big bucks because this place is pricey but truly worth every red cent. Staff is so amazing, they are on top of things so well that they know what you need before you do.  I would say if you're going to pop the big question to the love of your life than this is the place to do it, trust me it will be unforgettable.
