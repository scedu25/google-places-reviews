Text: Very good place for a nice dinner and wine or cocktails. Menu doesn't change very much. We go there for live jazz on some Thursday nights but you have to call to see if someone is playing. A little pricey.

Text: Newell House is the best restaurant in Southern Illinois. There are no caveats attached- not best in its price range, just the best in Southern Illinois, period. I've eaten at Tom's & Mary's multiple times. I wouldn't eat at either one over Newell House again, even if they were only half the price. At Newell House, the foods is sabsolute perfection, and the service is second to none.

Text: A place with Class. 

This restaurant is a cut above others in the region. Food, ambiance, and service are very good. Cost is reasonable for the quality. If you're trying to make a good impression on someone you should start here. Classy not stuffy, delicious not opulent. 

  Downstairs through a side door is a second area called the Grotto. The Grotto is a lounge and a limited menu with discounted food on certain nights and a full bar and nightly music. A great place to let your hair down.

Text: One of my favorite places in town to eat, but with their hours being what they are I have a hard time dropping in since I'm not in Carbondale as much anymore. If you catch it open, go in and see what they've got to offer. You won't regret it.

Text: Amazing food. I had their steak which was cooked to perfection. The also offer bottles of wine and champagne, which my friend and I both decided was a good idea as well.
