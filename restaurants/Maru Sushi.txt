Maru Sushi

Text: Excellent sushi with some terrific vegetarian options as well. The Madagascar roll is great if you love fish and heat. The veg hibachi is the way to go if fish isn't your bag.

Text: The lunch menu is lacking options compared to other sushi places. Their lunch combo is not really appealing since there are not that many choices in rolls.
The sushi was good though, but I couldn't find what I was looking for.
They also automatically add a 10% tip to the bill.

Text: Maru is easily my favorite area sushi restaurant. A big selection of rolls, and everything tastes fresh and interesting. The ceviche is excellent. The house wines we usually order are good and reasonably priced. It's loud and small, but it doesn't detract from the experience. A few tables are available for the very short Michigan outdoor eating period.
