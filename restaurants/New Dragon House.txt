Text: Food was Luke warm.  During our meal a roach crawled across our table.  When reported to staff only response was "we have pest control".    Never again.  If I could give them a negative review I would.

Text: During my experience I could taste the freezer burn on my chicken, and then as I'm sitting there eating with a group of people, a cock roach comes running over the table.. Definitely not eating here again.

Text: The food was bad as was the service. Both the fried rice and lo mein appeared to have been at one time over heated at the bottom of a pan only to5be scraped off and served again. Both were hard to the point the were actually crunchy. Also the woman at the front counter had very poor customer service
