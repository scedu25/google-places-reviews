Text: The chips and salsa were excellent. Our waitress was good but not great. My wife ordered the lunch vegi fajitas because it said it had broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. When it arrived it had the typical vegetables: tomatoes onions and peppers. We asked the waitress about it and she said that is what they always put in it. My wife was really disappointed. The food was good but the menu did not match what was served. We even asked the manager about it and he said it was because a lot of people don't like broccoli and cauliflower. I told him that my wife was looking forward to it but it didn't come with it.

Text: Food was served quickly but unfortunately my burrito real had barely any chicken in it. Mostly peppers and onions. Too pricey for a pepper onion burrito!

Text: I got the number one lunch item which includes a chili relleno. To my surprise, the chile relleno was covered with mole sauce, which is not my favorite although it wasn't bad. This non-standard sauce should have been mentioned on the menu. The rice and taco were very good. The guacamole salad was too salty to finish. The chips were very good but the salsa lacked something. I kicked it up a notch with a bottle of hot sauce on the table. All in all, I'd be willing to come back and try something else.

Text: The food was on par with most Mexican restaurants. The prices were as well. A server in a hurry with a "you are keeping me from where I need to be attitude" keeps me from giving El Dorado a 5 star rating.
