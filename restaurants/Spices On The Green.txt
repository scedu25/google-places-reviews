Text: We found it a little difficult to find, but the Lemon Pepper Salmon was awesome! Cute decor and lots of rooms for celebrations! The Amaretto Sour was delish. Now we have 2 favorite places to eat in Burlington, Colorado!

Text: Delicious steaks. Cold beer. The calamari was average, but not bad. It is a shame there weren't more people in there to enjoy this delish food. Good service, too.
