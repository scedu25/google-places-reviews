Text: My wife had a potato,  when the waitress brought the food, she said they were out 

Then the people next to us got 4 potatoes. The manager said they ran out and didnt tell the servers, but they all of a sudden had some.  Then he said she can have one to take home, I said we were done, he said okay and never offered anything. 

The other manager gave us a gift card, and was nice about it. 

I told her i drive to Evansville for this reason. No more in Madisonville Oasis for me

Text: Staff were friendly with good service. The medium rare sirloin came out medium well. I would be embarrassed to call the hearty cut anything? other than petite. At first I thought they brought me the regular cut but was assured it was the hearty one. Lol. Keep in mind this morsel was served on a small plate to help with the illusion. The other meals looked acceptable. Honestly the men's bathroom needed attention and it did not get that way overnight. We were early in the day so no excuses.

Text: Not bad. Service is great. Only problem we've had is the drunks stumbling around on Friday nights. So we just don't go on Fridays any more. Problem solved. Great steaks! Best fried pickles around! Not bad at all! Go, enjoy, relax, and enjoy your food.
