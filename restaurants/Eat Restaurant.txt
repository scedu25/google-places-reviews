Eat Restaurant

Text: Eat is luckily enough to be in my home town of Dodge. I recommend this stop to anyone. The service is enjoyable, and refreshing. Their meals are all home made and you just can't get any better than that. You can feel the passion that this Mother and Son Duo have for one another, and for the people they serve. You will not be disappointed to make this your next evening out, but make sure to call and reserve your spot!

Text: The food was wonderful and service was great. Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious and what we had didn't disappoint. We didn't have room for dessert but got it anyway and it was worth it, strawberry rhubarb individual pie with vanilla bean ice cream...delicious! The waitress even helped me out by making sure I got the bill so my mom wouldn't be able to fight me for it. Made a great mother's day dinner for us! Will be back and defiantly suggest to others.
