Text: After driving for 6hrs a cold margarita sounded fantastic.Not a huge fan of table salt on a margarita but it was mixed well.  
I am a huge fan of finely ground beef, that being said I loved the tacos and burritos. and to top it off the food was prepared incredibly quick.
If in the area again I would defiantly stop in again.

Text: Despite its somewhat offputting exterior, once you step inside the area is quite cozy and inviting. My party of 3 were quickly seated and treated to some of the best salsa I've had at a Mexican restaurant. Looking at the menu showed a good variety of dishes with affordable pricing. I got an order of enchiladas at $7 and it was served within 8 minutes. The dish was delicious and well presented.

As a student I have little money to eat out but I most definitely will return to Tejavan's

Text: Nice Mexican restaurant for family and friends. Food is good and service is good. Prices are reasonable. Only complaint is the salsa consistently is inconsistent. Sometimes it is like water.

Text: The only good place to eat in this area. Without El Tajavan there is no place else to eat. Besides that the food is wonderful.this from a girl from San Diego and a frequent visitor of Mexico.
