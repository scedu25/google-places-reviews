Text: This place is great! I love the old "Walton's" Mom and Pop, feel of this restaurant. As soon as you walk in they have a cozy fireplace going and the decor is very well put together. All you can eat fish and chicken and all the sides for $8.99 They make sure you don't walk out unless you are full. I would recommend this place to everyone. Stop in and check this place out. You won't regret it.
