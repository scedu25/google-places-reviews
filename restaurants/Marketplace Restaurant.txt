Text: What a great experience!
We just had a phenomenal lunch here! My fiancé had a delicious juicy perfectly cooked steak with smashed fingerling potatoes that were perfectly seasoned.
I had the lobster tacos, they were awesome too! Strange to say that the most well cooked lobster I've ever eaten came in 10 dollar taco meal! But it's true. These people know what they are doing in the kitchen!
For dessert we had a chocolate orange cake with vanilla bean Gelato and candied orange peel garnish. One of the best desserts we have ever eaten. The candied orange peel was such an unexpected treat!
Our server was super attentive and treated us like million dollar tipper even though we had lunch specials.
Overall....Amazing!!!
Thank you Marketplace!

Text: Awesome atmosphere, I had the lobster tacos which were good. Wife had steak and potatoes, but the potatoes were smothered in vinager which made us gag. The men's bathroom was disgusting, with a loose urinal wall with pee all over it. I would go back to try other food or drink.

Text: Wonderful restaurant in the downtown area. The room is large but still manages a cozy feel. Staff is excellent as is the cocktail selection. Sadly, they recently stopped the live music. When they start live music again, I'll give them 5 stars...
