Pat's Tap

Text: Pat's tap isn't the biggest or fanciest place to grab a cold one but every time I have gone there I left with a smile on my face. The bar tenders treat you like family (as long as your not rude) and there quick to get you a refill. The people that go there are fun to be around especially on card days.(Tues). I just wish they served food and would remodel the bathroom. But in all its my favorite bar in town.
