Text: Sunday brunch food is just OK.  The crab legs and shrimp were terrible.  Many other things are very good.  They shouldn't even have a food if its trash.   Omelets and prime rib were very good.  Service was outstanding and all the staff are very friendly.   Beautiful location and facility.

Text: We ordered to go . Six beer cheese soups.. We were so excited to get some really good soup. We were totally disappointed. The taste was disgusting. None of us could finish even a couple of bites of the soup. This was a total waste of money. We ended up throwing everything away.. I don’t know if they changed their recipe but the should really consider changing it back.. I will not be returning here again.

Text: Delicious food.  The menu is not extensive but everything is good.  Table service was excellent but the bar was slow in responding.  Pricey for Cleveland but you do get the airport runway viewing experience.  This is a good place to take company if you are aiming for something solid and nice but not attention-grabbing.
