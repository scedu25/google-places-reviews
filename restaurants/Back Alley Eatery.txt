Back Alley Eatery

Text: Back Alley consistently has such great food! It is always delicious... the meat is flavorful, juicy, pulls apart, mouth-watering awesomeness that probably doesn't even need the BBQ sauce but they have it on the side for you anyway! Whenever I have visitors from out of town, Back Alley is my top dining recommendation.

Text: Truly outstanding. Superb walleye preparation. Homemade sauces and dressings. Truly superior. Wait staff-helpful,  courteous and speedy. Juicy steak. Melt in your mouth ribs. Leaving stunned but happy...never expected this.  Will be back. Often.

Text: Great lunch, I would highly recommend the chef's salad with their famous home made blue cheese dressing.

Text: Great food but building needs help and AIR CONDITIONING needs some serious help in there banquet room.  They had to bring in fans that still did nothing to help.  Bathrooms are cramped and no changing area for kids if someone were to have a reception there.
