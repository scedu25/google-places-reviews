Text: Four of us went here on customer appreciation day.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated. We waited 45 minutes for our food and we walked out.  I can't say if the food was good or not.

Text: Always are wonderful place to eat, Tom and I love the food. The ribs are the best in town and Tom's favorite are the many different cheeseburgers. Your fries and onion rings are really great too. If your looking for great food than this is the place. They have such great servers too.  We're so happy you picked  Macon to be in.

Text: Amazing! Onion rings are some of the best I have ever had. Light, crisp breading. We had the pulled pork nachos, tenderloin and brisket sandwich. I could go on and on about how wonderful everything was. Worth the hour drive from home. We will be back.

Text: The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is excellent. The food has always been good. I would give it 5 stars if it had more variety of healthier options. The smoked turkey (Annie Oakley) is pretty healthy and good though!
