Text: Good food, seafood buffet is a bit pricey considering it is all fried food. Salad bar is small, but we'll stocked. They have many dessert options.

Text: Fast, friendly and very accommodating. We usually have their buffet which normally has catfish and fried chicken with several sides to choose from. As well as a salad bar. They have several dessert choices (pies) if you want more than pudding or chocolate chip cookies.

It has a GREAT view of the Ohio River and the Cannelton Locks and Dam.
