Text: My husband and I love this place and stop every week! Wonderful coffees, comparable to even Starbucks or Caribou Coffee!! The staff is great and will work with you on anything! One time I ordered a Coconut Mocha and they made Mint mocha by mistake (I had ordered over the phone so I'm sure the lady on the receiving end misunderstood as it was noisy with the blender on in the background and such) and they were so sweet and accommodating, making me a new drink immediately. If you've never been here, this is a MUST stop! Also great for a quiet corner to bring your laptop or do some reading, or meet up with friends to catch up! They have smoothies and non-coffee drinks as well, which is great because my kids always want "coffee" too ;)
