Text: I generally enjoy all family-owned restaurants, but I would avoid this one.  We were in town for the Labor Day parade and wanted to eat lunch with my Marching Illini daughter.  After waiting for over an hour, we still did not have even our appetizer.  The table near us had waited for two hours and still had just a fraction of their order.  We had to leave without lunch so she could march at 2:00.
