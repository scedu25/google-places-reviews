Text: Went on a Saturday night.  Place was pretty busy which was a good sign.  Atmosphere was trendy and upbeat...food was ok.  I got the Romans pizza and liked it.  Wife's pasta was very bland.  They forgot the chicken and worked quickly to resolve it--meaning she got a bowl of cut up steamed chicken that didn't do anything to enhance the pasta.  Nothing bad overall, but didn't feel anything great either.

Text: They hosted our rehearsal dinner in their private room. They did a spectacular job. The food was amazing and the staff was friendly and easy to work with. They make the pasta in house and there are a number of different noodle styles to try from. They also have house made gelato that is amazing.

Text: 7 of us went today Sept 15, 2017 for lunch. I believe 2 of us  ordered the minestrone soup. Mine was barely warm & another lady at our table said the same .  The minestrone soup was prepared with a bright red tomato base and the bowl was filled with red kidney beans.  Strangest minestrone soup I've ever had
