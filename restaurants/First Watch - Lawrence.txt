Text: I always order poached eggs, which are hard to do right, but they are always under done. Also they top the eggs with lots of chives and I’m not into that. The breakfast potatoes have a weird flavor. But I like their french toast, and they have fair prices, and a fairly expansive menu.

Text: What a very nice, pleasant, and unexpectedly healthy eating experience!  Last time I visited here several years ago, the healthy focus was not in place. Wow. What a delightful change. Will definitely visit again.

Text: Great biscuits and gravy for those who don't like the "healthy" stuff. I went with a friend who loves this place and found something I could enjoy as well! The wait staff were superb!

Text: This is a great place to grab brunch! There is plenty of room at the tables that make for a wonderful place to study or get some work done while you eat.
