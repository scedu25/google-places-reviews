Text: I was excited to find a local shop that delivers, and actually had a 4.3 rating on google. 

All things aside, the initial impression was positive. Fast delivery, hot food, large portions. About 4 or 5 bites in our meal ($27 w/ delivery), my fiancé found a large hair deeply mixed in with the chicken, matching neither of our heads. Food went straight in the trash. I promptly got on the phone, and asked what could be done for the food, refund right, obviously we didn't want any more of it tonight, and it was our one night that we get home from work to relax and not go out and do anything. Well, anyways, I'm typing this still in the heat of things and I'm rambling. Bottom line is we were told that if we wanted a discount, we had to deliver it up there for them to see it... at this point I'm not happy. I just paid an EXTRA $6 (delivery and tip) for food to be delivered... that we barely got to eat any of, and now to get the money back we are owed (at least in my consumer eyes, maybe I'm wrong) I have to make the trip we paid to not make just to get the money back we are owed. Do not trust the fact that their website says that they have all sorts of accolades. The most recent review was from 2011. Maybe it was a one off... but I feel like if it was, they would have done what needed to be done to correct it. Obviously won't be returning here.

Text: This is by far the best chinese food you will find in St. Charles county. No joke, amazing. You have to get their crab rangoon, the best I've ever had! I honestly won't get chinese from anywhere else.

Text: Horrible experience. Very poor customer service. We ordered delivery, and got a few bites into the food only to realize that there was hair in the food. We called to see what our options were, and the only thing the manager told us was to return the food. We ordered delivery for a reason.  We had already trashed the food, and it's not like he could resell the food anyways. That was a wasted $27. I won't be going back here again.

Text: Just left there, front counter employee was extremely rude. She was younger, and it is unknown if this was just a weekend job for her, however I will not come back to this establishment. You will not disrespect me and receive my money.

Text: Great food at good prices. The best crab Rangoon I have ever had. Hands down the best Chinese good in the area.
