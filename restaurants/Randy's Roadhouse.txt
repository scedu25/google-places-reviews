Text: Brought my family here few years back for a birthday celebration, but couldn't get service because the staff was too busy talking to one another. We waited an hour. They just didn't service us. I had to walk up to bar to get us a drink. No one waited on us. We wanted dinner and a good night. We got ignored. Will I go back? NO!

Text: Annie is great, but management short staffs the dining room (NO full time bartender - ever).  Sitting at the bar when it's busy and asking for something is ALWAYS an ordeal.
