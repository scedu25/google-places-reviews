Text: Absolutely delectable!  Quite a good selection.  You have to try the coconut shrimp!  The apple pie with vanilla ice cream (not soft serve) was a special treat.  Excellent service, too.  And the dinner comes with a drink.

Text: The food was good,  the place was clean and the staff friendly.  The only reason I I not gave it 3 stars is because the food wasn't as hot as I thought it should have been.  Nevertheless, I'll always go back.
