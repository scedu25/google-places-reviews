Raven's Glenn Winery

Text: We were here yesterday on our way home from a camping vacation. I have been to many wineries but this one topped most of them. Megan was so knowledgeable and I learned so much about wines. The samples were much larger than most wineries and the taste was delicious!

Text: Wonderful food and picturesque setting. Very friendly staff in the tasting area and restaurant. The food was reasonably priced. The only thing keeping it from a 5star was that some of the wines were pretty pricey even though there were a few good ones.

Text: My wife and I were riding by on the motorcycle and stopped in to taste some reds. A person behind the tasting area gave us a tasting sheet and explained the pricing, got us our first wine taste and then disappeared. Several other groups of folks (much younger) came in after us and were attentively waited on. We were ignored for over 15 minutes. We finally left after leaving a couple of bucks. Maybe it's because we were a bit wind blown, maybe because we were over 50 but whatever the reason we felt insulted and won't be back.

Text: We were here during the Red Wine and Black Festival. Price of admission was a little high for all they had to offer but it included ten free wine samples and a festival themed cup. The ground were very well maintained and laid out in an easy to navigate manner. The venue was very accommodating to the number of people present, even if the parking was not.

Text: Stopped for a tasting and lunch. Both were superb! I recommend the R2 and the White October wines which I believe are made from grapes grown at Ravens Glen. Dining outside by the river was a wonderful experience, and the shrimp cabonara was delicious.
