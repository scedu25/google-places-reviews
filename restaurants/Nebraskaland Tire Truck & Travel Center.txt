Text: 5:00 am was told showers are all dirty and no one would be in until 7:00 to clean them.  She said she was just to busy to clean one for me.  She didn't seem busy to me just didn't want to be bothered with it.  Did say I could have one for free if one didn't look to dirty to me....ill pass.  This was my first time to stop here.  I thought I'd give them a try.  This was my last time thanks to that ladies lazy can't be bothered attitude.  Back to flying j for me I guess.

Text: Best tire and auto service around. Them boys had this fixed in a jiff. Sapp truck stop said that they wouldn't have anyone on site at their Michelin for a week or so. Wal mart said they didn't carry that size  tire. Same story from all tire places around except for Nebraskaland. 2 thumbs up for this truck stop.

Text: A paved parking area and big dirt lot area (no large potholes either). Clean restrooms and a sitdown restaurant on the property.
