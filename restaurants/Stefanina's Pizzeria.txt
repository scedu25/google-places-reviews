Text: I would recommend stefanina to all my friends.  You get your money worth there.  The atmosphere was great. I wish we had one closer to us.  The service was great.   Everything is home made.

Text: Great service! Our waiter was very nice. The food was good. First restaurant I have been to in the area that has served multiple gluten free options, pizza and pasta! Loved that they have updated their menu to accommodate that! Thank you so much! Stefaninas has always been a family favorite since I was a kid, though I do wish you used a family sauce instead of a generic one. Would make such the difference if it were fresh from scratch! ?

Text: The service is good and the pizza lunch special is a good value. The salad greens could have been fresher.

Text: Food was good...wait time was insane. Attended once in a hour wait before we got our food. The food is good though.

Text: Very good food and the staff was friendly. They have a large room in the back that seats 20, so it was great for our family of 14
