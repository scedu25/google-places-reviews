The Carriage House Dining Room & Gardens
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I and my in-laws went to Carriage House to celebrate our anniversaries. Carriage House did not disappoint! The food and service were excellent. We enjoyed a nice, quiet and relaxing meal. Each gourmet dish was not only delicious but was also excellent in presentation. We will definitely return.

Text: We are from the Detroit area and came here to dine with our family from Buchanan. Wow!!! The outside garden is ABSOLUTELY stunning. It's a French inspired garden that can't help but make romance a must! Rodney was a wonderful host and the entire experience from the beautiful surroundings, to the craft cocktails, appetizers and fabulous food was high end all the way!  Strawberry Shortcake and cappuccinos were the perfect way to end the night. Thank you Josh for the quick story of your place and for a perfectly enchanted evening!

Text: You go here for two things: the ambience and the fine dining experience! The food is not as good as you expect from the price tag!

Text: In my opinion, this place is the best in South Bend. Something about the food is special. I really loved some things I never thought in a million years I would like. You can definitely tell they take care in working with local ingredients. I just stumbled across it by accident one day while out biking in the country. Decided to come try it a few weeks later. So, so happy I did.
