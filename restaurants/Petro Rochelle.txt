Text: TRUCKERS BEWARE!!! If you're needing your truck serviced (oil change etc.) watch them closely. They won't put fresh oil in.  My husband was there last week for oil change. Showed him dipstick, black and sooty, tried to say it was fresh.  After exchanging words, they agreed to put new oil in.  HOWEVER. they put in what ended up being 10w30.type NOT the required oil . they knew exactly what they were doing.   They tried messing with our way to make a living. They knew if left to run in the engine it could ruin it.  They failed.  The problem was caught by trustworthy mechanics we use a few miles later when troubles started.   Watch them close drivers.  Very close.  That way of doing business and treating others will catch up to them.

I've seen my share of laundromats, in and out of truck stops and this by far has been the cleanest! Great job Petro for maintaining a clean, working laundry room with plenty of space.-- normal capacity washers/dryers are $1.50 per load. -- high capacity are $2.00 per load.
