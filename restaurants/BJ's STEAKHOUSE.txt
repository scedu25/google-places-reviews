BJ's STEAKHOUSE
Rating: 5
Text: The service was good. The rib eye was outstanding ! I didn't need any steak sauce for this steak! The salad was fresh and large. The fried mushrooms were large and the honey mustard dipping sauce was the best. It was so good, we came back the following week. The service was excellent, the steak was close your eyes excellent!  The Kentucky silk pie was delicious! We'll be back!

Text: Have been there before at dinner time.  This time was lunch and the selections sounded appetizing but left a lot to be desired.  The appetizers were good.  I had Philly steak and cheese.  It was like warm and the peppers and onions on it were cold.   Dessert was good.  I would not go back for lunch but would for a normal dinner.  Last time I had prime rib and it was excellent, cooked perfectly.

Text: I stayed in Bardstown while touring on the Bourbon Trail. We had a party of 6 and we were hungry, tired, and exhausted. Jonathon was our waiter and he was AWESOME! He cheered us up, made us laugh, and kept the drinks coming! The food was outstanding I had steak, fries and a salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. We arrived before the dinner rush so there was no wait for seating (even though the hostess was unpleasant) and our appetizers and food arrived quickly. I can't say enough good things about Jonathon's service, he really fit in with our family and kept us laughing! I'm surprised by the negative reviews, save yourself time and request Jonathon!

Text: Service is very good.  People are very friendly  (including fellow patrons).  Food is good, not memorable.  But at least you won't walk out disappointed  with it.
