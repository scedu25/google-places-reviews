Hampton Inn & Suites Wichita-Northeast

Text: Really can't ask for more! The front desk was super helpful. The room was fantastic. Very spacious and the furniture was really comfortable. There was a nice little kitchenette with a sink and everything that came in super handy! Everything was very clean, the bed was just right for me and the breakfast had all the essentials, including a waffle bar. It's also right in the middle of a bunch of shopping areas and nice places to eat. Will definitely stay there again next time I'm passing through.

Text: The check-in lady that "helped" me just handed me a key and said, "Have a good day". Luckily I overheard her co-worker telling the couple next to me where everything was located and when breakfast was served. The room was nice and clean. My only complaint with the room was that the thermostat was really hard to find. If I had received better service I would have given the hotel a better rating
