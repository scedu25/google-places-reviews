Text: One of our favorite places to go!  Carnitas are amazing!  Dave is always so friendly.....we had the comalada dinner for two tonight.  It was a great meal.  Lafamilias never fails from drinks to main courses to dessert (Dave’s coffee cakes)! ????

Text: Excellent Mexican food. Fantastic light and airy fried chips and those come with a small pitcher of salsa for you to pour from. And you absolutely need to order a beer just to enjoy the presentation on the mug. Finally the food was top notch and very tasty.

Text: Terrible service, walked in waited 10 minutes for someone to get my drink order. No refills on drinks or chips. then after 20 minutes my food not only had one hair in it but two! Told them I didn't want it remade, remade it and it came out completely different...then didn't see them again until they gave us the bill. Didn't even compensate for my hairy food or give an apology. I'll never be going back!
