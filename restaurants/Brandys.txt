Text: I hear lovely things about the place but as a business professional at the end of a long day, I don't want to be stuffed like a sardine into a cramped space such that I can't have a private conversation with my dinner companion about my work day without worrying that every word will be overheard, or constantly brushed by people trying to stand aside for the waiter.  The atmosphere and vibe wasn't enjoyable to me and I left after one drink and just donated the gift card I'd been given for dinner because it wasn't relaxing to me.  If they ever get a different space, I'll happily give this place another go.

Text: The bison steak was awesome.  Dawn our waitress was very friendly and took time to explain the specials. Very busy but the food was prompt. Highly recommend.  I will be back.
