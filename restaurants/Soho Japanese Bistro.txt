Soho Japanese Bistro

Text: Sushi was good loved the workers, the wait for a table was not that long either. Full from the first meal. Tired when I came home haha. Proposed to my girlfriend too so it was a great night.

Text: I went to Soho for the first time about 2 months ago, and it was great. The food was wonderful, the service was great too. The second time I went, I also foot the bill. That is the only reason I gave it one 4/5 stars. Perhaps that is me rather than the establishment though. I don't normally spend that much money on one meal. It was well worth it though!

Text: Best sushi and Teppenyaki grill in Michiana. Local craft beer selection is top notch as well as a respectable wine and sake selection. Weekday nights are never crowded. Expect to wait during weekends.

Text: Always come here when I'm in the area; best teppanyaki I've had in the States

Text: The sushi was as mediocre as the service. Sushi: not extremely fresh. Cooked roll: a little over-cooked. Service: waitress brought lukewarm sake, then acted like she was doing me a favor when I asked her to warm it up. I went one time. There's just no reason to ever go back. Recommend this place to your mother-in-law or someone else who annoys you!
