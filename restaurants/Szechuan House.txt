Szechuan House

Text: The best Chinese food I have ever had! I noticed my usual place was closed and moved. I tried Szechuan, for the first time while traveling and staying next door at the hotel. I would love to eat there again, I loved it!

Text: Really good Szechuan food. I have been looking for a place like this since moving to IC. Not the sticky/syrupy stuff most people are used to with Chinese restaurants, but rather traditional things like hot pot. I love spicy food, and there are a lot of items with heat on the menu! Recommend the Homestyle Twice Cooked Pork, Pan Dumplings, Dan Dan Noodles, and Eggplant in Spicy Sauce.

Text: One of the worst experience. All items we ordered were good. But in one item, the chicken was rotten and smelling badly. We asked to replace it, the guy who took the order was damn rude, came and did not even looked or checked the dish and simply said " No its good. I know its good!". He did not bothered. With absolutely no courtesy said " Whatever it is you have to pay for it!". Anyways we said we will pay but asked to take away that chicken order which he threw to garbage. My friend was already hungry so we order something else. Deserved NO TIPS for him. Never again!!

Text: It serves authentic Chinese, but it's pricey and I've been to a few authentic Chinese places that are better in Madison and Champaign. The food here seems slightly more aimed at American tastes than other Chinese places, which I didn't like but others might. It's still good though, and is great introduction to real Chinese food. My favorite dishes are the poached sliced beef and cold chicken in chilli sauce.

Text: I've read some pretty bad reviews about this place but in my experience the food has been fresh, reasonably priced and they have the best crab ragoons.
