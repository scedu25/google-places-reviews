Text: Perfect rehearsal dinner. Everything was excellent, the restaurant has a private dining space with a separate bar.  Our guests had plenty of food and cocktails; we did a limited menu and everything came out hot and at the same time.  One guest has severe food allergies and the staff handled it beautifully with good options. Planning was a breeze.  Highly recommended.

Text: Chinato is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. While it can be pretty pricey, I've never left disappointed. Chinato's an expert at starters and desserts. The flavors are insane and will put a smile on your face immediately. However, at times their entrees can fall short. My last visit, I had lamb and it tasted like pot roast. The flavors were not cohesive. But then I ended with an Apple Cheesecake and life could not have been better. Their house cocktails are also worth a try. Sometimes they're not made consistently, but they are delicious. 
Chinato's atmosphere and service are wonderful and perfect for a special night out or just a relaxing good meal.

Text: Went there with a group for lunch. I ordered the braised pig cheek, it was terrible and I'm pretty sure the meat was old. It just tasted wrong. I was only able to eat half of it before I wisely decided to stop. The pasta sauce on another dish looked like red water.
