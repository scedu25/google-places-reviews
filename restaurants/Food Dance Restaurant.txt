Text: Food Dance was a wonderful experience! The food was amazing and had wonderful presentation. The restaurant was really creatively set up and decorated. And the staff was very professional and nice. I would highly recommend! 
They have a parking lot across the street designated for the restaurant.

Text: Interior decor is on point, whimsical and intriguing. Food is always good. Always. Wait staff are usually prompt and friendly, as well as knowledgeable about the food products they are serving. The dessert case it's die for. The meat and cheese selection is decent and there's a just a menagerie of little cool acoutrements for the larder in general. The food is fresh and a lot of it is locally sourced, which is pleasing. A bit on the pricey side if you're on a budget, but well worth the spending if you want a good dining experience!

Text: Tonight was our first time we went to Food Dance but it certainly won't be our last. I got the creamy tomato soup and duck breast and my wife got the Bacon & blue burger with fries. The food was incredible; it tasted very fresh and was perfectly seasoned. The icing on the cake was the service we were provided. Our server, Cody, went above and beyond his duties as a server and make us feel very well taken care of;  in the 5 years we have been married, he provided some of the best service ever. I hope he realized how much we appreciated the amazing job he did! A visit to Kalamazoo without dining here would be a sad one indeed! I highly recommend it.

Text: Really great food, great choices especially for vegetarians. They even make their own ketchup and mustard, both quite delicious. Service was extremely knowledgeable, even recommending the proper method to reheat the Mac-n-Cheese, which shows a thorough knowledge of food and ingredients. Top it off with Michigan brewery options, and a huge hit. My caprese was a bit too oily for my taste, but still delicious. Fries were great, small shoestring the way my wife likes them. It was our first time as we don't go to Kalamazoo at all, but I'd be willing to return for this restaurant alone. Great job.

Text: My daughter and I went to Food Dance for lunch last Saturday. It was my first time there. The service was fantastic! Adam, our server was very attentive, as well as the other servers. Our glasses were kept full, and the dirty dishes didn't sit on the table long at all after we were finished with them. The food was delicious as well, but these days it's hard to find a restaurant that takes such good care of their customers. I would definitely recommend it.
