Text: Always very fresh ingredients in every dish, especially the things that are growing on the rooftop garden. The chef is excellent, even the herb vinaigrette was unlike any I've ever had. And of course there are always the fish tacos... I would go back here even if fish tacos were the only thing they have because their fish tacos are always fabulous.

 Recommend the fish tacos or fish and chips. Great soup too

Text: Fantastic food. We had the pulled pork and a pizza and both were great. The Domaine DuPage beer was our favorite.  You can get $2 samples to try lots of different beers.

Text: The food here was great! The taste portions of the beers is a great option for trying lots of different beers that they brew themselves.
