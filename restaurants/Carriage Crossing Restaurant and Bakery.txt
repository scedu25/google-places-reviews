Text: We were here recently for breakfast while on our way to the state fair. I was very pleased by wonderful food and extremely reasonable prices. My husband and I both ordered biscuits and gravy. It was only $4.50 for 3 biscuits covered with a generous amount of gravy. Our daughter order the cinnamon roll. It was huge and only costs $1.99. We were all surprised at how much of it she was actually able to eat. We even bought some to take home. I am definitely looking forward to coming back the next time we are in the area!

Text: My wife and I both had fried chicken. It was juicy and very tasty. The mashed potatoes and gravy were the best I have experienced in a long time. I expect all of their food is really good. The service is great and the staff  insured you are taken care of. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Text: Delicious food. Chicken fried chicken is my favorite. I never have room for dessert but have taken home pie and cinnamon rolls which are always scrumptious.
