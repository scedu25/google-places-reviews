Text: Always good food here.  Buffet serving staples like smoked meets, BBQ pork, brisket, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, cinnamon apples, sweet potatoes, broccoli salad, pies, cookies, ice cream, Amish bread with apple butter, etc., etc., etc.
You always leave here with a full belly, ready for a nap. 
Best place in town for good, American food, in my opinion. 
Casual, closed on Sundays.

Text: Friendly staff,  but only bbq was some pulled pork that you can by at Sam's Club. The name was misleading.  It was like a small mom and pop style of Golden Correll.
