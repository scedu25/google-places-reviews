Text: Absolutely lives up to the reputation. Every bit of my meal was amazing. The chicken is fried to a crispy delicious perfection with juicy meat still in tact and the fritters are like candied dough balls

So as an adult I wanted to try it again 15 years later with my family.  It did not disappoint. This is a take out only place (this location). The menu is exactly as I remember it, and I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed since the place opened, but heck that's part of the charm.  

The food blows any other chicken place out of the water.  I mean no contest what so ever.  

The chicken is deep fried perfectly and the skin is crunchy and fantastic.  But the real winner in all this if the corn fritters...those are the things you dream about.  I heard a couple come in while I was waiting for my food and order 50 of them!  They won the night for sure.  

Try this and you will never go to a kfc/Browns again...it is laughable the difference in quality.
