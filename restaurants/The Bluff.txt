Text: My grilled chicken breast was one of the best I have had. The place is a bit "rustic" but Hey, I'm driving through Kansas and that's to be expected. Family friendly and great service. Would I come back? Yes, definitely.

Text: Food good, very generous portions, hard working, efficient waitress. Not the greatest atmosphere, and be sure not to pick the table by the restroom!
