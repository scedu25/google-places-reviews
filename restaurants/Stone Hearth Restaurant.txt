Stone Hearth Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: I found the Stone Hearth on my way home to Ohio from Tennessee. I am glad I stopped. Steak tips, baked potato, and magnificent brussel sprouts. The sweet tea was perfect. The atmosphere was classy and Charming. The prices were reasonable for the high quality of the food. It was easy to relax here and the music was cool but appropriate for a relaxing dinner experience. I want to come back and try other dishes especially Seafood.

Text: Sketchy, to say the least.  Decor hasn't been updated in decades.  Friendly staff though.  Salad bar is good.  Otherwise, OK food and an OK value.  We go for nostalgia as this was the place my Dad would always go when he wanted a "fancy" restaurant.  He was a simple man w/ simple tastes, RIP.

Text: Food is average for the price. For what was paid the staff was not real attentive. Great salad bar though and the soup is always good.
