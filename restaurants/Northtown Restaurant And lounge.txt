Northtown Restaurant And lounge

Text: I had dinner last weekend Northtown restaurant and ordered the salmon which was absolutely fabulous. It was cooked to perfection not dry at all very moist and delicious. My partner and I shared the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was also cooked perfectly well. The waitress was very attentive. The owners were also concerned if we enjoyed our meal and wanted to know if we were happy. I would definitely go back there.

Text: Food is so amazing. The wait was totally worth it. I had the catfish dinner. Normally dont like catfish. That catfish was one of the best. I definitely recommend the asparagus as one off your sides. GREAT RESTAURANT. Thank you.

Text: Good food, great service. Really nicely remodeled inside. My steak was a good cut but a little over seasoned. Wife's shrimp was good. Comfortable and priced well with a good selection. Looks like a great venue for a wedding, etc.

Text: We had appetizer sampler. We go around and try a lot of the bar food. If you can't get this right. Then hang it up. So ....hang it up ...the onion rings were good ....nothing else. Was unable to make the stuffed portables. So gave us 2 more shrimp....that was a joke. Normally we go back 3 times to a new place. This has been open for almost a year. If you can't get this right....oh well !!!!   Good luck .

Text: Good, very close to great food! Service is slow but good. Now if there was no smoking in the whole place they might get the last star! I always smell like smoke even when there might only be one person smoking on that side.
