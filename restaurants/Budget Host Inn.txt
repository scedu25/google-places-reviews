Budget Host Inn

Text: I got to spend a night here. Although a little outdated, this was still a nice place to stay. They have a pool, hot tub, and a bar and grill on site. For the price and amenities, it's not a bad place to stay. My room was clean and everything was in good working order. Free WiFi and satellite TV as well. I'll stay again when I come visit Fort Dodge.

Text: I have now stayed in the hotel on two seperate occasions. The hotel is great for the price. The decor is a little outdated, but that has no effect on the friendliness of the staff. On both occasions we had adjoining rooms with our children. It is a nice place for a quiet weekend getaway. The pool is spacious and very clean. The hot tub is also very nice. On both occasions we have had pool side rooms and it is very convinent. I did purchase a drink from the on site bar, it was okay. They have coffee, cappuccino, vending machines, and even a couple arcade games. They dont have breakfast but honestly would rather have the lower prices then free bagels. Grdat job to the staff!

Text: For the money it was a great value. No breakfast but that comes from the inexpensive cost of the place.
