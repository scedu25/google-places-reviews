Tigin Irish Pub
Rating: 4
Text: My wife and I came to Tigin's Irish Pub after visiting Three Sixty at the Hilton (that bar was totally whack). It turned out to be trivia night. Some guy was calling out questions to teams competing with one another. Bartender was quick, accurate, and efficient. Place wasn't packed, it it was a Tuesday night around 8 pm so I don't know what their busy times would look like.

Text: Food was not authentic.  Small portions very high price.  There were only three thin slices of factory made corned beef on the Reuben.  Mushroom soup was like Rosemary gravy.  Only reason they stay in business is because they are in a hotel and get no repeat customers

Text: Stopped by for lunch.  Fantastic meal for all 4 of us.  Had the fish and chips and loved it.  My son and his friend had burgers and they were awesome.  My wife had some sliders ham, pork and something else.  Enjoyed the ham the most.  Would go back anytime.

Text: Fish was pretty good (I'm from New England..... So it's hard to get an amazing this far inland) but the chips were PERFECT!  Excellent service. And open on Sunday!
