Text: My husband and I love "The Club".  Whenever we want a quiet, comfortable place to have a great meal, we head there.  I recommend the Prime Rib and the Library.  The only issue we ever had was very quickly and quietly solved by Jan.  Wait staff is never perfect wherever you go, but this group does their best in our opinion.  We will definitely continue to patronize this lovely place.
