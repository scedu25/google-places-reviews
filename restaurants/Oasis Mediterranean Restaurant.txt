Text: The service was very good the waiter took time to tell us about different dishes. The food was ,well some was very good others I didn't care for. But we had a sample player so we could try different foods. Now we know more of what foods we like and what we didn't care for.

Text: I have been coming here occasionally, for many years. Lovely people, nice lunch buffet. One persistent issue. The items on the buffet which are supposed to be hot, are most often luke warm, at best. I was amused most recently as two employees were looking at the restaurant inspection form, and chatting about it (97 this day). Clearly, the inspector never sticks a thermometer in the buffet pans.
