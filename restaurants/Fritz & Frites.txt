Fritz & Frites
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best restaurants in Galena but gets forgotten being on the north end of main street. One of the smaller eateries but so quaint. Reminds you of a bistro in France. Waiters are friendly and know their menu. The roasted chicken is to die for!

Text: Very fancy and elegant breakfast atmosphere...they remade my fiances entree no problem due to him not being able to eat onions.

Text: Probably the best value on Main Street In Galena. We had brunch with fantastic flavors, right sized portions all at a reasonable price.

Text: Good food but I'm not in a hurry to go back. I had steak frites and expected a big steak for $25. It was like a 6 oz piece and didn't fill me up. I've had better steak/bigger portion at Texas Roadhouse for the same price. They serve room temperature tap water, which I wasn't a fan of either. My girlfriend had the chicken and that was much better than my steak. Overall it was good, just overpriced in my opinion. Maybe my expectations are a little too Americanized for this type of restaurant.

Text: Wonderful little bistro at the end of main st. Escargot was wonderful. Both the pork and veal schnitzel were great. Very nice spatzel. Red cabbage was hardy and tasty. Great wine and beer selection. Probably the best restaurant around if you are looking for French or German cuisine. Waitress was very dutiful and made for a great experience!
