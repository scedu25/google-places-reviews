Text: My wife and I went into the local moka in Hays, Kansas, this morning for the first time. The Young girl behind the counter was busy with a customer in front of US didn't seem to be making much headway with her. She looked over at me and I smiled at her and she said I'll be with in a minute, not Bad, but we ordered paninis and I ordered the French vanilla coffee was told that they didn't have a French vanilla so my wife, who used to own a restaurant and coffee shop for 15 years kindly told her how to do it, she brought it to me, that was okay, but there was no coffee in it plus neither one of our ponies had been in a panini. Press even the cheese wasn't even melted. My wife sent her back. And I was in the biscuits and gravy that we got was cold, we had to take it and put it in a microwave  made me wonder why I was charged for the half arsed meal. I won't be back to mokas. .......................We did not have a Pleasant experience.
