Text: I did not really care for my gyro. The meat was rather tough and fatty. My kids were upset there were no delicious rolls on the house. My son didnt care for his grilled cheese on a hamburger bun. My husband enjoyed his sandwich. This was our first trip since the owners changed.

Text: New owners changed the menu so we were not happy about that!!
Way over priced for what we received.
Long wait time for our food.
Friendly staff though.
Will not be eating here again.
