Sunset Grill

Text: We drove 3 hours from Indianapolis passing multiple BBQ places along the way just so I could have the ribs here. My potatoe was not that great but I came for the ribs so my meal was awesome. I cannot recommend this place enough as it is a very friendly atmosphere with a river view and damn good food. Do your self a favor, go for the ribs but call ahead to make sure they still have some.

Text: This place has lots of potential but fell short of me being able to recommend it... Great views loved the outdoor seating!! Food was over cooked and under seasoned...

Text: The food is really good and the prices are reasonable.  The waitresses are friendly and make you feel welcome. My favorite waitresses are Lexi, Brittany, Erica, & Elena.

Text: Like to stay at Belterra but do not care for the buffet or other food options.  We have found a solution The sunset grill.  Friendly waitresses reasonably priced good food.  Ate here for lunch and breakfast.  Will definitely be back!
