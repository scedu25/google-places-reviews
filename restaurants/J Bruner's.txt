Text: They set the standard for good food in the area.  About the same price as other restaurants of their caliber.   Try their delicious onion rings.  Great service.  We like all the servers, especially Greta.

Text: The fried portabella mushrooms and onion rings are outstanding.  The grilled prime rib is the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating.
