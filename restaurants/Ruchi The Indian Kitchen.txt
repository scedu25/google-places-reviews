Ruchi The Indian Kitchen

Text: Excellent Indian food with just the right spice and rich flavors. Good service with very nice ambience. Their lunch buffet is the best and the Kebab Platter is a must try.

Text: I am from Bloomington, came to Peoria for a visit. I am amazed to see this restaurant in a place where there is no interstate access and middle of nowhere, but they manage to provide better food than most of the restaurants I visited. Yes their buffet is little without spices, but I am guessing it is because they want everyone to enjoy their food.
Overall it was a good experience. Kudos Ruchi.

Text: Food was not good and I am pretty easy to please. Tandoori chicken was tough, biryani was dry and tasteless, chicken tikka masala tasted like spaghettios sauce, rice was dry, desserts had no good taste. I can honestly say it is the absolute worst Indian food I have ever had. By the way, I almost never complain about food. Staff was friendly.
