Kilroy's on Kirkwood
Rating: 1
Text: Charges cover on homecoming and will not stamp, too money hungry for my taste. Also a bouncer pulled a girl's hair to get her attention. If you want to drink cheaper look at other bars.

Text: Came to town for a wedding. This place was recommended.  Was very disappointed to find they had a $3 cover charge.  Who does that?  Despite that the food was excellent and the Boom Shrimp was addicting.  Service was excellent as well but the food took way to long to arrive.

Text: Waited for breadsticks for an hour, bartender was so rude, and why do they have 5 doormen on a night that is dead?? They don't do anything but sit around.

Text: If I could give 0 stars I would. We ordered a mimosa tower and were told that no more towers were available and we had to wait. 20 minutes later, out waitress brought out a tower to the table next to us. Kilroys should try to hire competent adults in the future.
