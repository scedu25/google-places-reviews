Text: Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The drunk chicken pizza is spectacular. Their wings and sauce selection is superb. Great atmosphere in a historic building. Highly recommend!

Text: Staff is rude, music too loud (like not the fun loud just.. can't even hear the person sitting right next to you loud), The groups that appear there there are assholes with no control and the drinks suck ass. Also the water is very bad tasting and bugs tend to make homes in the terrible kitchen... Do not eat here unless you wish to get sick ( and that is due to the hangover from their shotty selection of booze.) All in all a very poor experience.
