Great China Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: We stopped by for a quick bite.  Excellent service and fabulous food.  The Crab Rangoon is light and flavorful.  The rice is delicious, so are the noodles.  Nothing disappointed, highly recommend!

Text: Wife and I arrived after the supper rush on a Sunday just passing through on our way home.  Food was good. We enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the egg rolls. They continued to put out fresh food on the buffet after our arrival. Friendly staff and several main dishes to choose from on the buffet.
