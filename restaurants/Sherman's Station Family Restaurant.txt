Text: Not sure about Breakfast, but I ate Dinner there while passing through on a slightly unusual trip to Point Pelee. Happened to have a few other people with me. The Lasagna had no meat in it (Just noodles), and the Chicken Parm came with 2 tiny cuts of chicken. And far too much pasta, like a mediocre substitute. The free salad/soup and dessert that comes with a meal just barely justify the price, and funnily enough, I thought it was better than the meal. Not a restaurant I ever plan to visit again. If you want something you'll probably like, or are thinking you want a Burger, well, there's a Wendy's past the (canning?) factory. Go there instead.
