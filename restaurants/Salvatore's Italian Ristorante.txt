Text: One word - amazing!

If you find your way within 30 miles of Ozark, Missouri...you owe it to yourself to visit this fantastic Italian restaurant.

We had the best server, Courtney, the best waitress ever.  And the owner was wonderful - he brought us he special batch of limoncello, out of this world.

I can highly recommend the chess and sausage ravioli.  Fresh, homemade pasta - so good!

Text: Great food and service. My mother stated it was "the best Fettuccine Alfredo" she had ever had. Cheese bread sticks are the size of a medium pizza. They were very cheesy, hot and worth getting. I had the manicotti, it was good. The homemade Italian dressing was good on the simple side salads. Great service at dinner time. No issues would recommend and will return when I am in the area next.

Text: Being Italian myself I was excited to try this restaurant after seeing so many positive reviews! We started with the Tuscany salad with in house made creamy Italian dressing. It was delicious! Then shared the all meat pizza and Sabrina's ziti. Both lived up to the reviews! So yummy! Thanks for great meal and service! We will be back when traveling again!
