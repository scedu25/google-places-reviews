Cielo Restaurant & Bar

Text: I hosted my daughter's baby shower on November 4, 2017.  The entire experience with the staff of Cielo was excellent. I live in New York and planned the event with Jennifer Moore over the phone. Jennifer helped me create an unbelievable baby shower with excellent food. The baker made the most beautiful cake I have ever seen. The fireplace room was beautifully decorated. The entire experience surpassed my expectations. Thank you to the chief, baker, waiting staff and the Cielo manager. You all made my daughter's shower an unforgettable experience.

Text: My Neice called at 2pm for a reservation for seven for dinner at 5:30. The ambience and view of the St. Louis sky line was nice. Cielo was well attentive to our every need. The food was impeccable. The Herron Family loved their food  experience. The service was an eleven!!

Text: This review is for the brunch only. Servers were very helpful, and everyone was friendly. View is decent as well. Food was good but not $50/person good in St Louis. So unless you plan on eating your weight in shrimp, you might want to go elsewhere for your brunch. (Or grab a Groupon!)

Text: not really a review, more of a question?  Who can i call to talk a little business along the lines of the produce you use, how much you use in a week and a cost?  i am venturing out into the aquaponics world and will be growing all organic and want to see what kind of prices i need to be at?  any information would be appreciated.  

Thanks,

Ian Fenton
