Text: It's just not plackes anymore. The juicy burger is not Brads juicy burger. The foods okay but most of it taste just ok. Not great . Makes me sad. Wish they would of changed the name when it changed owners. The place looks great and is very clean. All the girls are nice. Just not a must stop place anymore.
