Text: An excellent choice on Mass. They have a buffet that is very good and has a little bit of everything. The menu offers lots of favorites but I especially love their hummus and falafel.

Text: Good portions, tasty food.  Cheesecake was a little skimpy, so look for desert elsewhere.  Like sylas and Maddie's.
