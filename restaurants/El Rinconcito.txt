Text: I love this place for an authentic Mexican meal.  The food is really great! Best authentic Mexican food around... not Tex Mex or Americanized... it's the real deal.  Awesome homemade salsa bar, tacos, burritos, tomalles, and more.  The menu is in Spanish and they only accept cash (no credit cards), but the server is always able to answer my questions.  She's not the most friendly or outgoing person I've met, but she's certainly not mean either. Clean and well-kept restaurant.
