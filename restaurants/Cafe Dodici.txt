Text: We were there on the weekend after the 4th of July to celebrate a friends birthday. My 4 month old was getting fussy and I was doing my best to entertain him when the owner came up and said "if you need to breastfeed go right ahead, or if you aren't comfortable doing it right here, i can take you back to the banquet room." I sat in the banquet room feeding baby and as soon as i got back to the table she offered to hold baby for a few minutes so i could eat my meal. Absolutely wonderful and genuine hospitality. The food is just as amazing. Thank you for being such kind and sincerely gracious  people.

Text: My lasagna was very good.  Staff was exceptionally friendly.  The tiramisu was very small for $8:00 and not very good.  Mostly like small pieces of coffee soaked cake with thick pudding on top.
