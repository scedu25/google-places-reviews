Jewells On Main

Text: I've been to plenty places around this area that cooks this type of food. This wasn't the best but not the worst. I LOVED the amount they give you portion wise but there was not much for my kids to choose from on the menu. The service is fast but barely any interaction with the waiter. It's a small place so If you have young kids it can be really hard to be comfortable here. This place is great for take out and food flavor is decent.

Text: Best steak and mushrooms, I have EVER HAD.  LOVE THE Baked potato,  ( not over cooked ) like most places. Everyone was, very nice, and polite. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant. And I don't give 5 stars, ever.. I take FOOD SERVICE TO HEART...

Text: So glad we read the reviews and took a risk on Jewell's on Main. Was headed home to MI from a conference in Nashville with a friend. Couldn't stomach the thought of eating at a chain restaurant on 75. This experience was well worth the detour! Best shrimp and grits I've ever eaten! Unique experience, order at the counter and you get a table assigned to you. Had a great conversation with people in line and decided to share a table with them. Small town America at it's finest.
