Text: Sometimes you walk into an establishment and get the feeling you're intruding. That was the feeling we got when we stopped at Balducci. The lady serving samples clearly had her mind on other things. When I asked about food, she motioned to a menu down the bar and rattled off a few items they offered. The wines were OK, but we finished our samples and headed out -- just didn't want to bother her anymore. This was on October 7, early afternoon.

Text: A great place to enjoy a taste of fine wines. Anywhere from semi-dry to fruity. We did not eat but there was a place for eating. Looks like a great place for large parties, plenty of outside seating if you choose. Staff was very inviting and knowledgeable. Will return if ever in the area.
