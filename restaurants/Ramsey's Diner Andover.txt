Text: Ate lunch there yesterday, and fell in love. So good. I had the melt in hour mouth Cajun catfish. Already planning my next trip back. Kudos to the great cooks.

Text: Ramsey's has consistently brought incredible, fresh, delicious food to the Lexington area since before I was a kid. Now I'm bringing my kids there to enjoy corn daze for themselves. The service is always great, the food has never let me down. It's pretty incredible to consider how they've delivered so well for so long. Go and enjoy a true taste of Kentucky.

Text: Kentucky cooking at it's finest.  Down home favorites.  Friendly staff.  Family oriented.  I recommend the catfish... Try it, you'll like it.

Text: Aug. 23, 2017 Couldn't wait to eat here again! At least that's what I thought! Got the Chicken Livers again, they were Sooo Salty! Had to take the crust off! Tried the Apple Fritters-they were an Apple Slice with a Very Greasy Breading-Not Good At All! My Husband got the Chops again & they were Even Saltier than last time! His Fries were Way Overcooked & Tasteless! So he didn't eat very much at all! Extremely Disappointed! 
1 yr ago: On our way home to TN from MD, we searched for Diners & found this one! Extremely Glad we did! I got the Chicken Livers & they cooked them to my liking perfectly! (All I had to do was tell them how I wanted them!) Also had a Baked Sweet Potato with Cinnamon/Sugar Butter-YUM! Their Sweet Pickled Beets were good, too! My husband got the Country Fried Pork Chops with fries & coleslaw! Enjoyed his as well! (Chops were alittle salty, but good!) Portions were large, didn't walk away hungry! No room to try any of their delicious sounding pies! Maybe next time! And there WILL A Next Time!
