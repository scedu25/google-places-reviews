Text: Nice clean and quiet.  Food came out quickly and was good but the waitress could have came back to check on us a little sooner.  We were out of water and wanted dessert.

Text: This place had what I call a good case of the Sundays. Sundays in restaurants tend to suffer from being short staffed and this place was no different.  I gather it was busier than average but the service was extremely slow, even though they were working their bottoms off.  It took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  It was delicious and everyone was very nice but we spent far longer there than we meant to.  I would still recommend it for a stop... just understand that you might be there for a awhile and plan accordingly.
