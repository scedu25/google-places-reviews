Text: Decent place to grab a bite or drink. I went there to watch a Monday Night Football Game and wasn't a good spot for that. Small TV's and some were in not working right or on at all. But the number one thing for me was having to listen to music blaring instead of the Game.

Text: Fat Boyz has been a good place to hang out with great people from our first experience several years ago to today. If you don't like it here you don't belong here.
