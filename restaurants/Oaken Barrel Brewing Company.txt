Text: Went in for a growler of APA. First visit, so I didn't know they sold 6 packs. After pointing out to my friend that I should have grabbed one instead, the manager (I assume) came by and offered us one that was a mix and match. Very very friendly and I left feeling very good. Will definitely return!
