Text: The overall dining experience was incredibly new to me. It was very fun and interesting. I will say, the cuts of meat were exquisite, especially the lamb. I’m impress with the restaurant. In addition, the table service was excellent, although all of the servers were so kind they were almost apologetic. They were incredibly formal. The meat came in fast rounds to the table so I constantly had a variety on my plate. And the salad bar was excellent. I tend to shy away from salad bars because of their boring and dry options across the board. But this restaurant had an amazing selection of things to choose from. In fact, I didn’t even get a salad. I got a combination of salmon and cheeses. The meal was also served with a few other appetizers, and they were amazing as well. 

Really the only issue I had with my visit was that the dessert, the cheesecake, was disappointing. It was almost frozen in the middle. Not sure if it’s because they get their cheesecakes frozen or the fridge they store them in is too cold or if they freeze them after making them. Either day, that was very disappointing, despite looks.

Text: Amazing restaurant! You are given a disk the size of a coaster and you flip it over to signal that you would like me of the 10 or more chefs to bring you fresh steaming meats on the skewer. I tried a plethora of meats but the lamb was the most amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant. The price was around $20-$30 per person and the drinks are very expensive. I felt that the food was well priced.

Text: Amazing! Food is delicious, staff is attentive,excellent, & friendly. This place is on point for everything. It’s a little pricey. But it’s a place where you can say ‘’you get what you pay for’. Also if u register with them online they will occasionally send you a coupon via email. It’s also a good idea to call & make reservations. My family & I love this place!

Text: I absolutely love this place!! The Lamb is outstanding!!! It may be on the pricey side for most but it's worth every penny. Prepare to spend around $60-$65 with drinks for dinner. One of the best places for family and groups to enjoy and fill up.
