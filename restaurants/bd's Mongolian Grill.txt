Text: The food was amazing. The guys on the grill were very engaging with the customers waiting for their food to be prepared. My only complaint was the shrimp seemed a bit slimy so I chose not to get any. But my fiancee asked for fresh shrimp and the shrimp was replaced immediately.

Text: I sat at the bar and ordered spicy Asian steak stir-fry. I was disappointed to see that their prices on their menu were more expensive than the prices on their website. There was a band inside playing classic rock. The band was so loud that the bartender and I had to shout at the top of our lungs at each other. And no, I am not old.

The place was really busy for a Thursday, and I think the bartender forgot about my food order. Eventually she remembered and brought out my to-go order. When I sat down to eat it back at the hotel I discovered they didn't give me any rice, and the entire dish was completely bland. The only thing I could really taste was a little bit of seafood from the shrimp that had somehow fallen into my dish.

Overall, definitely not impressed and will not go back.

Text: I didn't like the food so my husband was going to eat mine and we were told he wasn't allowed??? We paid around $40 and my food went to waste. The way they do the food is confusing unless you're a regular. They really alienated us and I won't be back.

Text: This is an all right place to stop and get a quick bite.  The staff try really hard to make it a good experience. I think it's kind of a novelty Place nowadays where people just go there to see how much food they can stack on a single Bowl

Text: Yes,  it's a good place to have a stir fry with your own choice of ingredients. Cook was fast and good but you have to cautious on your selection as your choice of sauces can easily spoil the taste as cook will not mix anything from their end.
