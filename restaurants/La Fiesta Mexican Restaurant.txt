Text: If you can't  go to Mexico,  go to Lafiesta in Abilene Kansas! The food is that Good! The service and the ambience is lovely! We really loved it, we only ordered half a meal, have enough left over for a week! Loved the place! Now home to Minnesota from Texas!

Text: This place is fantastic. Everything was fresh and delicious, the service was very good, and the prices were fair. We were visiting from Colorado, and it was better than most of the Mexican food we have in the Denver Metro.

Text: A really solidly good meal.  Hard core Mexican purists might find the amount of cheese to be over done... but I really enjoyed my meal.  I had a bit of that “drunk from food” happiness as I paid my bill.  

I missed 5 stars because I thought the price was a touch high and the service just missed the mark a bit (I’m new to Kansas so perhaps this isn’t so odd regionally) 

I’d happily eat here again tomorrow.
