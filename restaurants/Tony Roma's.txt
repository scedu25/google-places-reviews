Tony Roma's

Text: This place was beyond terrible. When we walked in we waited for ten minutes to be acknowledged by staff in an empty restaurant. When we were greeted it was assumed we wanted take out instead of a sit-down experience. The hostess refused to acknowledge us, so we were seated by a waitress. The wings were cold and the beer was outrageously expensive, even in terms of beer prices. I'm talking 12 bucks for a Sam Adams bottle. Our waitress started to walk away after taking my fiancee's order without asking for my order. It took a good 20 minutes or more for a simple burger order in an empty restaurant. We had to ask for silverware and waters. Water wasn't brought to us until halfway through the meal. Staff were vacuuming repeatedly right next to our table throughout our meal at least an hour before closing time. Don't waste your time or money on this place. Horrible customer service and mediocre overpriced food and beverages.

Text: Stayed at the hotel on a Thursday night. We ordered a room service family special Thursday night, over charged us which good thing my husband was paying attention & they forgot 2 of our drinks. On Friday we went to breakfast at the restaurant. Over charged again & the food was awful! The pancakes were so bad our 7 year old wouldn't eat them, my husband tried them & he refused to eat them too. We were also given a limited menu when we shouldn't have been since we were paying for our meal. We live close by  & we will never be going back.

Text: As Tony Roma's is one of our favorite Dubuque restaurants we decided to enjoy a late lunch there on Friday.  As it was not busy we expected quick service.  After giving our drink order to the waitress for two iced teas we proceeded to wait and observe her doing everything else except getting our drinks. After about 10 minutes we went to the hostess desk and asked to speak to the Manager. After explaining our situation she gave a lame excuse about only having one waitress even though we had seen at least one other waitress and the hostess and obviously the Manager.  How the Manager ever allowed us to walk out of the restaurant is absolutely appalling. Not sure if we will be making a return trip there anytime soon.

Text: I have never had a bad meal here.  As a matter of fact everything that I have ordered has been excellent.  The staff is professional and prompt.  I never walk away anything less than pleased and stuffed.
