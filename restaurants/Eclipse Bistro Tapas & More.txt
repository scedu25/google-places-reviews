Text: This place is phenomenal. I've been here twice now & have had over 12 different dishes.  All were fantastic. My favorites are the Gambas & Vieras Al Ajillo. Great wines. Fantastic service, the owner cooks & he's very friendly and approachable.  My favorite place in Evansville so far (I'm here on business for a few months).

Text: Food was decent, but extremely over priced. They don't have a fountain for drinks. Everything is either a 2 liter bottle or can. A sandwich, some chips, and a soda cost me $14 for lunch excluding tip. Wouldn't be mad at the price if the portions were congruent to the cost, but I left hungry after a small panini and a handful of chips. Might be a decent dinner place if you've got $100 to blow on the tapas.

Text: Great food, but very expensive!!  Each plate is anywhere from $9-$14.  You will need at least 5 - 6 dishes per person to fill up.  Two people cost me $110 without tip.  

Overall, food it pretty good.  For $55 a person, I would want my food to be jaw dropping, one of a kind, but the food is just above average.  

Good to go to if you have the money, but if you want to spend that much, I'd rather just get a juicy filet from a steakhouse :)
