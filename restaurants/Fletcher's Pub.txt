Text: Came here as a couple on a date, had a GREAT time watching the UFC fights, Sarah the barmaid, IS EXCELLENT! AND SO IS MATT! nice, clean, friendly atmosphere, and we danced to one song on their handy-dandy touch screen jukebox! What a wonderful and local place to go to for a meal, drinks or just to stop in with friends and family! Highly recommend THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE and EVERYONE!

Text: Food is subpar. Typical bar food. Good atmosphere for watching sports. Take advantage of the monthly beer specials (BOM and MOM - beer and micro of the month)
