Text: The food was horrible and over priced. The staff was not friendly and I had to go to the counter and ask for a drink refill.

Text: Great place to go eat!  They have been making stuffed sopapillas here for over 50 years!!  That is incredible to think that a slice of american history can still be found!  Talk about the American dream!  It has also been family owned and operated for the same amount of time.  Absolutely incredible.  The staff is always friendly and the service is very prompt. Fabulous food and they are always offering new and tasty specials.  Thank you La Familia for always being open and ready for business!!!

Text: Odd place. Might be a locals favorite but found it to be too pricey for what you get. The food was warm and layout of the restaurant was bothersome. Thankfully there was no wait and the service seemed good. Not sure it really warrants returning to for another visit.
