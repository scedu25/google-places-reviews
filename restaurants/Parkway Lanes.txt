Parkway Lanes

Text: I love this place! I like that it still has a lot of that retro feel...gives me a warm, reminiscent feeling of past bowling fun with my grandpa and my friends. I have loved eating at their diner for many, many years. Really good homemade food at reasonable prices! They have the best breaded cauliflower and cheese sauce...I've liked everything I ever tried. Nice lanes, clean, a separate bar & lounge, and friendly staff make for a pleasant experience. My son and I go every week--either to enjoy the great food, bowl, or both. One of my favorite places to go!

Text: We had 17 family members bowling in my mom's honor. She was buried 5 oct. Went to be with our Lord on 1 Oct. She bowled at Parkway for decades in the senior leagues. Had an awesome time!!

Text: The folks who own Parkway are top notch human beings, and they run some very fine bowling establishments in Lincoln (including Hollywood Bowl). Of course, everyone goes to Parkway for the legendary burger, and you should too.
