Text: I travel for business. I'm currently staying in the hotel and am very impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of staff. We are here for two weeks and work over night. Today happened to be the eclipse here in Nebraska. I have worked service industry for years and know signs of good management. I wish I could name check her as she deserves it, but I've been preoccupied as I'm in a new position even though I know she introduced herself. I sleep during the day and keep the "do not disturb" sign on, but today my family was coming to town for the event and I was gonna leave my room early enough to reasonably ask for it to be cleaned. She let me know that it would be, but the staff was going to be allowed to view the event so it would not be during that time frame, which I thought was AMAZING. This showed confidence in their ability to service the guests and compassion for them as people, which you don't always see in regards to entry level staff.  You have to allow your staff a little freedom to enjoy things even though I'm sure they have likely never been this busy. The fact that she cares enough about the staff to allow them to enjoy what the guests are here for speaks volumes as to why they are all smiles. My coworker said most were working during the eclipse which only enforces that they take pride in their job, and good management is key to that. I hope they got out for a bit though, cause it was really cool! Kudos to her and her amazing staff. I'll continue to recommend this place to others and my HR travel booker who, I assure you,  will be booking this place for the next visit!

Text: Such a nice hotel! Great breakfast and pool. The staff were so kind to help accommodate our family. We were in town for a funeral and they made sure we had a place to be together as a family.

Text: This hotel was perfect for the night. Had our new baby with use and they got us a 2 queen room on the first floor on short notice. Guest services were great and the whole experience made a long day of traveling disappear.
