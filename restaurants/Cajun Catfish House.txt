Text: One of my favorite places to eat in the Jefferson city area. The staff are first rate, and fun be around, and the food is excellent.  Try the grilled Catfish with some red beans and rice.

Text: Service was excellent sides we're great however the fish was over cooked. This is the first time I've ever had this happen. I will be back. It's a nice change of pace and the people are so nice.
