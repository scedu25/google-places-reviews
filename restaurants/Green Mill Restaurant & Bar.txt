Green Mill Restaurant & Bar

Text: I thought the food was very good. It seems reasonably priced although some things are overpriced. The menu is fairly large and accommodates many tastes. The pasta was exceptional that I ordered. You even get 20% off if you stay in the hotel.  Very underrated.

Text: Nice place to crash an emergency.    The bar is part of the Holiday Inn. So, if you are in trouble you can check into a room and spend the night. 
Just off the highway, it is close enough to several car shops and dealerships, that you can have your car serviced and stay in the area.
A bit pricey, but I had a decent Thai salad.
The bar has a wonderful display piece which is a copper barrel, reminiscent of those used in Homebrew beer. But, it is purely for decoration only.

Text: I was shocked. I was expecting a dumpy diner. Super clean. Great atmosphere. Would make for an excellent date. The service was on point. The menu had a wide variety...fish, burger, steak, chicken, pasta. Easy to please many. I had some of the best chicken nachos ever. Each chip had toppings. No soggy chips. Fresh ingredients. Boyfriend had a bugger he'd compare to his nostalgic burger joint or better! Pricing is decent all things considered. A hidden gem.

Text: We stayed the night in the hotel. The next morning we came in for breakfast. We were seated right away. The server was very nice and on top of things, the prep of the food was the issue. I ordered eggs over easy. They were cooked till there was no soft yolk left. Not good but still forgivable. The real deal breaker was the shell in the eggs. Lucky for me they gave me a 20% discount when I pointed it out. Thanks a lot, I will never be back.
