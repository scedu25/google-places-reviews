Text: I've been here a couple of times. Both times the food pretty good. I love the johnnycake with bacon butter. Service is not so great. Last time there was hardly anyone else and my server took forever. The food had to have sat in the window as the johnnycake was already cold. I could here her chit chatting with other workers. Not sure if I'll go back.

Text: Our first time there. It seemed poorly managed. After about 10 minutes a server came and asked if we were helped just before we were ready to walk out. She seemed like one of few that knew what was going on.  Although even with a bartender whom wasn't busy all the servers were behind the bar getting their own drinks.  Majority of which were on the house for the lack of service. Looking around it was hard to tell who were servers, runners, and so on. If it was better run and managed it may have been a better experience 
 Food was okay. Looking at the outside it looks like a great restaurant.  Was not impressed but may give it one more chance.

Text: I like this place. it seems like they need to pay attention to smaller details like replacing the dead flowers on the tables. Those seem like a metaphor for the place, dying and in need of freshening up. The food was good and we had an excellent server. I recommend it.

Text: Great food! The black and Bleu salad is one of my favorite meals, shrimp and grits is one of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. They have the beers that my beer snob husband likes. Great service.

Text: Service is ok, though a little slow. The restaurant was surprisingly not packed when we dined at 7:30 on a Friday night. The food is fresh and the menu has a good range of options. Just a solid restaurant with plain food, definitely not bad, but nothing great.
