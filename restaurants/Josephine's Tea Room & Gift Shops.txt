Text: I will never eat here again. The last two times I waited 1 hour and 35 minutes respectively even with reservations. They take too many reservations too close together.  The last time our service was so slow that it took 2 hours to complete our meal. Their food is delicious but not worth the wait. On the flip side, I do love to shop here.

Text: Josephine's is warm inviting establishment with lots of artistic flair. There is a store on site and two others with in walking distance. All of the decorations on walls and in some of the restrooms usually are for sale. The menu is usually soup, salad, sandwiches and dessert but everything is extremely tasty. I always need a doggie bag and usually it's for my dessert. Please try the dessert. That alone will keep you coming back again and again.
