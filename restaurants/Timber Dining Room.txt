Text: Took the wife here for Dinner, an overnight stay and Breakfast in the morning for her birthday. The dinner was great, we had the crab cakes for an appetizer and both had the Up & at 'Em Burger. The burger was great except we asked for medium rare and ended up getting more of an medium well burger. The burger still tasted great along with the crab cakes. For breakfast we enjoyed the buffet and was surprised at how well the buffet food tasted. This is a place we have been coming to for 10 years now as part of our family tradition (especially during the month of December for the brunch with Santa) and is a place we will continue to return too many years to come.

Such a beautiful restaurant with live piano music and great service. 
Large groups, special occasions and cozy romance, always make reservations for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Leave enough time to stroll the gardens and grounds.
