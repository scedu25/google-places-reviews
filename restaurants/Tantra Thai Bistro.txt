Text: This is one of my favorites restaurants. I love it! They have delicious food. Try the green bean appetizer, you won't be disappointed :-) their noodles are fabulous (spicy basil is my favorite) and I enjoy their pineapple fried rice. I've had several of their stir fries and curries and would order any of them again. The building is amazing and is close to the Mississippi. The staff is great! Highly recommend :)
