St. Louis Pizza & Wings

Text: Best wings ever. But quite pricey for them. They have great lunch deals though.  Maybe a remodel might bring in more customers. It reminds me of chuckie cheeses in the 90s. Makes me a little dizzy

Text: Every time we order from here it's wrong.  How hard is a pizza. I don't ever go on and publicly complain because I have worked in all types of restaurants and I know how hard it can be, but this is terrible. I ordered a meat pizza and a hamburger bacon pizza I got a meat pizza and a pepperoni pizza. It's on the receipt correctly so not sure how you mess this up! If this was only once I would be forgiving but this is EVERY TIME.!! We won't be ordering from here again!

Text: I googled a few of these one star reviews and if you are working for a competitor in a field, you really shouldn't write bad reviews just for the sake of swaying people.  The pizza makers at this location have over 20 years of experience in knowing how to make excellent pizza.  Do not take the word of someone who is trying to discredit their competition, go in and taste for yourself.  If you have any issues, the owner is committed to making things right.  That is the kind of service and food that makes me proud of St Louis Pizza and Wings!

Text: I love the pizza... Always hot and the ingredients are so fresh. I am a great fan of their house onion dressing.  The weekly specials are usually pretty awesome.  
Great staff and service.
