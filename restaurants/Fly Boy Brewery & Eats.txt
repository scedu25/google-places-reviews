Text: Had an awesome dinner with my wife and some friends.  I had a KC Strip and my wife had grilled salmon.  All we can say is that we found a hidden gem of a restaurant in the tiny confines of Sylvan Grove!  We will be back.

Text: What the hell? Seriously. What the hell? Who would have expected a delicious microbrew/restaurant in Sylvan Grove? The beers are solid, and the food is delicious. This will be the only place I eat out at when visiting Wilson State Park from now on.
