Text: We went to Walldorff"s for the first time a few weeks ago and went back last week. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the food is great. The chicken nachos are awesome appetizers!! Have tried the BBQ pizza and the burger and both are very good.

Text: Very good pub! To begin: Order the root beer. It is to die for! Might be the best fresh draft root beer I've had. I had the Really Good Ham and Cheese sandwich and my wife had the Turkey Pita. They were both delicious (we share). I posted a pic of both plates. Service was a little slower because of how busy it was, but well worth the wait. Had the Bistro Blonde. Not much to report, but I'm not a huge beer guy either.

Text: I really wanted to like this place, however getting a table is a problem.  The first two times I would chalk it up to them being business, 60 plus minute waits.  This last time we were give a 30 minute wait time.  After seeing several people leave muttering under their breath and speaking with the hostess I was told the kitchen was inexperienced and behind...even though half the restaurant was empty.  60 minutes later we left. I feel bad for the staff that has to work for such a mismanaged restaurant.  The microbrew beer was good and hear the food is as well.  However I will never know as I, along with several other people, will not be back.

Text: Great atmosphere.
Food is fine.
Bathrooms are downstairs and seem less than required for such a big place.
