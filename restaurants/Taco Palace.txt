Taco Palace

Text: Food is good. Staff is not always friendly. When we were there last week the staff was all in the back cutting up laughing and being very loud about it,  then a employee was using foul language. I'm all for having fun at work but not when there are customers in the store. You don't need to spew personal business for everyone to hear. Work is not the place.

Text: My son and I stop at Taco Palace every time we're in town. 
When my son was about twelve ( he's 41 now) we would take all seven of our children to the Taco Palace in Springfield, MO. Their tacos were 25¢ each at that time. We would order 30 tacos and 3 large drinks. Everyone had enough. 
John, our oldest works with me and we both look forward to working in Lamar, MO because we know where we'll be having lunch! You got that right.....Taco Palace!

Text: The food is amazing when your order is correct. Out of the last 5 times I've went there something has been wrong at least 3 times. They gave me the wrong thing one time. No sauce another time and just two weeks ago tried to charge me for an extra burrito. I know what my total usually is though so I caught the mistake and got my money back. I love the chicken nachos though!

Text: I read the reviews first before comming here. I was actually disappointed. The food wasn't all that great i had ordered 3 enchiladas, one cheese, and 2 delux enchiladas it was very salty way too much sodium.  I couldn't even finish it all i ended up throwing it away.
However the staff was very friendly, the restraunt was clean and the bathroom was well kept up.

Text: Tonight was the last night I ever buy food at Taco Palace. I got charged $10 for two basic burritos, a meal that at most should cost $5. Absolutely outrageous prices.
