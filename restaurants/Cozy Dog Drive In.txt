Text: I had a huge amount of fun here. The food was great greasy spoon diner/grill fair, the staff is friendly and all of the decor, Route 66 stuff, memorabilia/Waldmire photos and art was amazing. I bought a bunch of posters and prints and honestly, I could have spent hours or days more looking through everything on the walls at the place. You want a real feel for the "Mother Road"? Go to Cozy Dog.

Text: Coming home to Springfield MUST include Cozy Dog Drive In! Best corn dogs on earth; just the right crispy/ chewy ratio. And the fries are amazing. Down home spot for entire family.

Text: Good food! Nice staff. Corn dogs are good, but best ever. Not even close. I guess I am spoiled being from chicago. But worth the stop if your in town.
