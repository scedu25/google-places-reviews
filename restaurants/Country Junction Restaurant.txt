Text: The waiter was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were full and that everything was up to par. The portions were huge for a good price.  The asain salad i had look very fresh and well put together. Im always pleased with anything i get here and the home cooking feeling is the icing on the cake. Great place for anyone and everyone.

Text: Was last here a few years ago, then again June 2017. I know owner has changed - I'm a sorta distant relative of former owner - Kings.  I miss them. Anyway, place has changed some. 

Menu feels similar to me - country comfort. Good shop similar, but not quite as good. 

The pie, oh the pie used to be TERRIFIC. It is still pretty good, but not as good as I remember it. 

I'd still go back, but it is different. Or maybe it was just me.

Text: Wait staff were very friendly.  Loved how the restaurant was decorated.  Didn't like the Pepsi so much it tasted funny but our waitress didn't charge us for it.  The coconut pie was amazing.
