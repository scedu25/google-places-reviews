Text: First impression is its decently clean ... but not spotless.

Service was fast but not all that friendly. I asked if they had coffee and was greeted by a rather gruff "NO" ... i guess the coffee machine 10 feet behind the server was turned off and the "NO" was a signal that they didn't care to make some for me.

Prices are what i would call cheap. Most items were under 7 dollars,

the menu has a decent selection to choose from. Burgers , Sandwiches etc. There is also a full breakfast menu.

I had a Clubhouse sandwich. It included the usual fake turkey and ham, a decent layer of cheese slices, warmed up precooked bacon, all served with a small portion of fries. 

It tasted good, not greasy and was a nice sized portion for a lunch meal.

Nothing fancy here, but it is a decent place to grab a quick meal.
