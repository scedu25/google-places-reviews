Text: 5 star on the view over the river and 3 star on sitting availability, very long wait even though we arrived before rush hour. Option to roam half the first floor and second floor to find your own seat. Food/meals available at bar. Staff was very busy but attentive

Text: I've been several times, from Reds pregame rushed dining to laid back social and work outings. The staff is friendly and attentive. Very good selection of beers and cocktails. The food is par. It's flavorful and well prepared, but menu choice limited and unimaginative. The restaurant's interior is open and contemporary, and sports some of the best riverfront views in Cincinnati. The atmosphere is dynamic and suits many occasions. It can get a little loud, so look elsewhere for the intimate.
