Text: I brought my family from out of town. 22 people. They have gave us 2 waitresses that were fantastic... we ate appetizers before the meal and I recommend all three we had, nachos, calimari and the potato bites.. YUM!!
All our dinners were fantastic from the pasta, to burgers.   I recommend this place highly.. we just dropped by thinking bar food... and were rewarded with great food and awesome  service. The kids had a blast... Jason the manager even opened up the pool table for the kids to play for free... they really made us feel like we were THERE only customers even though we weren't... OH AND DONT FORGET THE CHICKEN WINGS!!!!

Text: Great food. Friendly environment and a damn. Good beer list. Definitely a place to enjoy some brews. Plus im not getting scammed out of 2-5 bucks at the door just for showing up.
