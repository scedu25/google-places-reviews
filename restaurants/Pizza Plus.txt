Pizza Plus

Text: We stopped on our way home from vacation, having been in the car for 7+ hours, we were starving. The sign on the door said they were open until 9pm, so we went in and sat down. The waitress brought our menus and informed us that they close at 2pm ( in 20 minutes) so they have already started to  clean the ovens and grills and wouldn't be able to make us any food. She told us the buffet still had some food on it, so we decided to try it. Bad decision. There was hardly any lettuce to make a salad, the few pieces of pizza that were left were hard and barely warm. They had some taco bowls to make a taco salad, but once again, there was no lettuce. And some sort of soup in a crock pot. The waitress was friendly and did clear our dirty plates, but other than that the experience was terrible. I would not ever recommend this restaurant.
