Text: Wonderful food and even better service. It was our first time and we will definitely return. We didn't have a reservation  but were  able to be seated pretty quickly.  I would recommend making a reservation.

Text: I was there yesterday for the Midway Festival. My friend and I had the Mary Burger. It was amazing! So fresh, cooked to order, along with very tasty fries. Loved the whole experience. It's a lovely place for a ladies brunch or a romantic dinner for two. I will definitely be going back and encourage anyone to make the short trip to Midway for a delicious meal.

Text: I've been here many times and never been let down. The perfect combination of food and wait staff is the best in the Lexington area. I cannot recommend this place more. The owner and chef are fantastic at preparing the menu. This is the place to eat in central Kentucky!

The only thing that they could improve is the wine/alcohol selection, while pretty darn good it isn't the same caliber as the food.

Text: Amazing.  The menu descriptions don't do the food justice.   World class dining at affordable prices.  Large portions.  Professional,  friendly service.   A must-do for dining enthusiasts.

Text: When we first arrived I got the feeling we weren't welcome.  We didn't have a reservation but there was a table opened.  We were pleasantly surprised with good service.  Lunch was pricey but food and drinks were really good.  Would definetly go back.
