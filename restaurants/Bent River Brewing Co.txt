Bent River Brewing Co

Text: The Bent River experience was bad. Wait staff wasn't very friendly...I have theories on that.  Besides a long wait for my meal, the food was bad.  I ordered catfish by recommendation.  Deep fried.  The entire fish was deepfried.  It should have been cut in steaks or filleted.  So they overcooked the bone in corn mealed cat fish to a dark brown, not golden had they cooked it for just a few minutes as most seafood is cooked. Will not be back.

Text: The food was fantastic. Phone died before I could get pictures of everything but I did snap a shot of their habanero mango wheat beer which was really interesting as it was spicy and fruity which is difficult to nail down as a beer. Also in the picture is the appetizer which was the fried green beans which were really well done with fresh tasting green beans and a good crunchy fried outer shell which was enough to share for two people. We then got the pulled pork and the bangers and mash and both were exceptional and at a good price for the generous serving sizes.

Text: Huge portions... we order the fried pickles and it was literally a huge pile of fried deliciousness that our entire table of six shared. 

The food was typical bar food but it came out hot and the orders were correct. 

I had the gose and pale ale and both were good.

Text: The outdoor atmosphere at Bent River Brewing Co was awesome, but the inside was not as great. We sat outside and thoroughly enjoyed the Raspberry Wheat beer! The service was good, not great but not bad. And our waitress was really friendly and willing to give recommendations, as well as samples of the beer.

Text: Great food and local craft beer. Service is usually great. Outdoor patio in back is a great hangout. Gets really busy some nights.
