Text: I enjoy Amish cooking, who doesn't, and I came for breakfast. I had the breakfast fajitas, which are more like breakfast tacos and they were good. The cinnamon roll was good too. Not the best food I'd ever had but much better than an ordinary diner. I'll go again!

Text: This is now a restaurant only. The store has moved across the street. Food was great and mostly made from scratch I am told. They will add at least 3% fee for paying with a credit card. Which I deducted from the tip. I feel they should just add 3% to the price of the menu items.

Text: A very nice Amish reataurant nestled in the heart of Amish country. The bacon is wonderful and you have to try the fried mush with tomatoes gravy. Very clean and relaxed and a great place for an event.
