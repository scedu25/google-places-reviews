Text: Server was nice, steak was ordered medium rare, arrived looking like shoe leather. Returned it to chef, took over 20 minutes to get replacement. Got the bill along with a coupon for $5 off our next visit. Asked to see the manager who scolded us for giving the server such a hard time, which we didn't do. She scowled at us and walked away. Food was fine, but under this type of management don't dare complain or you get blamed. We brought a group of 25 people. You're welcome Windrow. We will go somewhere else next time. Unacceptable!

Text: Server took forever to take order, then took forever to get drinks when we did get drinks ice was melted, pointed this out server got rude but brought new drinks with we later had gotten charged for extra drinks. Food was cold when we finally got it and we ordered way before the the other two tables around us and we were there before they even came in. When we told server food was cold she stated  well if you would have eaten faster it wouldn't have gotten cold. I told her it was cold when she served it. Asked to see the manager server then returned with the check stateing since we were problem customers we had to pay and leave. I refused to leave without seeing the manager they threatened to call the lawyer I told them go ahead then the manager would have to come out. Then they sent out this man and said he was the manager, but I seen a woman named Donna when I came in who was the manager she seated us and introduced herself as Donna the manager she would be seating us because the other person was busy. I refused to pay for anything but the drinks since the food was sent back never touched and neither was the first set of drinks and since the server they sent over to impersonate the manager was not her and pointed this out. Server went and then I followed her seen her talk to this Donna server came out and stated pay for the drinks and manager said to never come back..this was me and my best friends first and last visit to this place. I wouldn't go back if they begged me or unless the got ALL NEW STAFF, especially that so called manager Donna.
