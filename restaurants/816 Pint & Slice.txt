Text: Best pizza in town! Lunch time is crazy everyday!  That's how you know it's good! They offer different slices every day to give you a chance to try other kinds.  I love that about them. Great service and food!

Text: Another one of Fort Wayne’s many restaurants worth visiting!! You can’t beat the selection of pizzas during a busy lunch hour!! Prices are a little high and parking can be a pain. But the one of a kind pizza selections are well worth it!! I really love their spicy veggie with a Greek salad!!

Text: Food is pretty great. They have craft beer on draft. Atmosphere nothing special. They have additional seating upstairs. They have limited outdoor seating. I would go there again.

Text: I'm always underwhelmed when I visit. The pizza is good, but nothing amazing. I've had cold slices multiple times. The price for one slice is a good deal, but one slice is never enough to fill me up.
