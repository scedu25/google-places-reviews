Text: I love the Sweet Joy Shop.  My husband and I go there often.  We love our hot chai tea and wonderful baked goods.  It's such a lovely place. You can sit outside, if you like, it's very comfortable there or there are many other places to sit. They have many paintings from area artists and they have photographs from area artists. Also they have many different plaques and books and many interesting things to look at and to purchase if you like... you just have to try it cuz it's a great place!!!!!!
