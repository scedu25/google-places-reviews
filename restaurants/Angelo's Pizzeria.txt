Angelo's Pizzeria

Text: It's not the best pizza I've EVER had, but its up there. I'd you live in the Sterling-Rock Falls area, you've been to Angelo's. Probably a lot. It's one of those famous local places that the people who have here absolutely love. I personally think the pizza comes out better at the Rock Falls store due to their old rotisserie style pizza oven. It's good at all of the locations though.

Text: Excellent food try the hot ham and cheese it was wonderful! And anything else you order on the menu is great. They also have different kinds of pizzas for example macaroni and cheese pizza, BLT Pizza, taco pizza and a spaghetti Pizza. They all are a must try.

Text: I've gone there for years and now that I live 70 miles away I stop by when in Rock Falls and bring it home with me. Their really old oven is what makes the pizza from this location the best!
