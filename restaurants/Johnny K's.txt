Text: Been there a couple of times. Being from the city this place is surprisingly good. The service is great and the place is clean. When I pass through here I try to stop and grab a bite. Its worth checking out.  In the city you can go anywhere to eat. Out here at best too few options. With Johnny k's no worries.

Text: We've only started coming here since the remodel, and my family and I love it here. The food is great, the ice cream is yummy, and that service is always wonderful! This is a great family diner, and kid friendly. Plus, I love supporting small businesses!

Text: YUMMY FOOD & ICE CREAM!! they have a wide array of food choices. There's burgers, sandwiches (hot & cold), appetizers, and many other options but my favorite is there shakes and malts.

Text: Very over priced. I ordered "The Godfather" with fries and a dink and the total was almost 12 dollars. This meal should cost no more than 7-8 bucks. The fries were good, but I've never really had bad fries anywhere. The sandwich itself wasn't good and I didn't even finish it. The wait for the food was ridiculous as well. I did like the atmosphere and ambiance though, that's about all they have going for them. Will not go back here.
