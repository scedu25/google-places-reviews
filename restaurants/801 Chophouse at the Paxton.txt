Text: Excellent place to dine for special occasions! I would highly recommend getting a steak if you do choose to come. I had the filet cooked medium rare, and it turned out fabulous. We also had the hash browns with cheese and those were amazing. I would definitely come back here. Plan on shelling out money, but for one of the best steaks you've ever had.

Text: Everything about 801 Chophouse is amazing! The food is phenomenal and the staff is wonderful. My family went here for my brothers' birthday and it was so awesome we decided to have our company's Christmas dinner here this year. Already made the reservation and I can't wait to eat here again!

Text: Delicious food and amazing service.  Made you feel like an honored guest from the moment you entered with complimentary valet. Steak and sides were all superb, including the duck fat potatoes.  My steak was slightly overcooked to medium, I was going to eat it, but the server refused and made sure I had a steak cooked to perfection as well as added a free dessert for the trouble.  Will highly recommend for a splurge dinner

 One of our best dining experiences. It was great from the appetizers to the desert. A wonderful wine list. A full menu. Great waitstaff and environment. You will not forget spending an evening here.

Text: OMG best food and service ever, hint to open table people, when you reserve do so 15 minutes before you expect to be seated.  Other than the 1/2 hour wait for a reserved table everything was fantastic!  Try the hash browns - best ever - steaks melt in your mouth, seafood  outstanding and top quality.  Don't pass on this place.
