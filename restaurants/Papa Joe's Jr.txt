Text: GREAT food GREAT service Awesome specials. Hands down some of the best food I've ever had. Never had anything bad. Definitely recommend this place. Would give it 11 stars. All there pizzas and calzones are hand tossed and there salads are out of this world. Check these guys out!!!!

Text: Very good. Staff very friendly. Owner came to our table herself and gave suggestions which were incredibly good. We will definitely return to this restaurant.  The bar is open until midnight on Friday and Saturday. Come try an Italian Margarita!!!!

Text: Very nice evening.  The menu had a lot of choices. "The works" salad was a new favorite  for me after tonight! Server named Linda was very nice and accommodating.  We will definitely be back!
