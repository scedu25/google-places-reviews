Text: Food was amazing and so was the service. Wait staff was very attentive and took wonderful care of us while we were there.  We ate on the patio and there is an awning that can be rolled out for sunny days. Hands down the best feature was the view from the Upper Deck.

Text: The lobster bisque, OMG, so good.  The perch and walleye are fresh and moist.  Service is quick and seating. Best scenery on the island. Sit on the upper deck for great views and cooling breezes.

A sour dough bowl of of lobster bisque and a craft beer was $18.25.
