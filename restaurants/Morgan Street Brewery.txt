Text: Probably the most inconsiderate host I've ever dealt with. We accidentally chose a bad night(Blues Fest) to visit this place after the arch. I had 2 elderly people with me and there were empty tables everywhere. Stood waiting for over an hour. Could have at least seated us and gave us water. The host was rude and waved me out the door and did nothing to seek us a seat. The entire wait staff was outside serving Blues Fest people and ignoring the internal crowd. We left without ever being seated as did several other parties. If I could give this hole negative stars I would. Can't judge the food but service and customer appreciation was pathetic and shameful.

Text: Beer was pretty good.  Service was on point - greeted quickly, regular check-in with the table.  The food was tasty too.  Pizza was thin crust with provel cheese which was a fun twist.  The Cesar salad with a blue crab cake was flavorful and not too heavy on the dressing.  Overall, a good place to eat.  Didn't give 5 stars because nothing stood out about it, just a generically good meal with beer.

Text: Wonderful little spot. Food was great. Beer was great. Service was great. We specifically chose this place for their pet friendly patio. Everything was very reasonably priced. The coniques were especially tasty.

Text: The food was good. I had the crab cake sandwich and split the pretzal with beer cheese appetizer. Both were good but not great. The beer itself was tasty, but not the best beer. However, the staff was some of the friendliest people I have ever encountered at a restaurant (it was on the slow side). Overall I would say it's worth a try, but it's also worth shopping around to find a better place.
