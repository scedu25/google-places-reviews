Text: We came all The way from Kansas city on vacation went to one of our favorites( Eggberts) to eat, for they have pretty good breakfast, this was a call in order as usual, sometimes we go in. Well the manager there took my order, and read it back to me, needless to say when my husband picked it up, we always check, it was wrong. It was thrown in the box, and missing items so when the manager took the bag, she reached in the box with her little nasty hands, took the bacon out and threw it in the trash, ewe!!! well I ordered bacon! ?  so why did you do that!! she proceeded to be rude and argue  with my husband, over the Bacon! We are Chefs and have been in food service over 40 years I would never ever do what she did! So we just wanted our money back at this point.. I'm not going to enjoy my food anyway, but one has to think, was she having a bad day or is this the norm? NORM! 
It's a done deal! If your food  is ok and your customer service sucks then you are doomed!!

Text: Staff was friendly and attentive. The chicken fry was advertised as a "real" steak pretty sure it was soy meat. Meatloaf was the same. Overall the staff was great (5 star) the food was terrible (minus 5 star).

Text: Great hamburgers & fries! Not pre-made  but made upon oreder! Good coffee & nice breakfast, served anytime! Seating at table suits me best,  rather than the booth cushions.

Text: I have been going here for years and hadn't gone for a while but I can honestly say I was super disappointed. The staff was so rude, our food (which was only a few simple breakfast items) took over an hour to come out, and once it did everything was cold. Our waitress was rude and did not refill our drinks and when we said thank you she did not even acknowledge us. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone!
