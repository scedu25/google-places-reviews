New China Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: Food quality and selection above average and truly exceptional for a town this size.  Inside of building much nicer and larger than outside appearance suggests.  Clean, including restroom.  Good quality ice cream for desert.

Text: Good food, decent prices. Don't let the interior of the place turn you off (there's paint all over everything when they redid the walls),  the food is always delicious.
