Text: Our Venue had an Appreciation dinner for The Circle City Classic Volunteers, who volunteered for the actual game on September 23rd, 2017! Austin the main waiter was GR8! I've never been to Harry and Izzy's!  But Austin suggested certain items on our pre-set menu! And he was very right in suggesting those Mashed potatoes!  Excellent! The food was good! Austin's service was GR8!!!??? DOWNTOWN LOCATION! INDIANAPOLIS, IN...?

Text: As good a dry aged steak as you'll ever find. The cocktails we're great, the staff had great personality. The sides were good, but not great. All around, killer meal. It was my birthday and Id be happy to do it again next year.

Text: Excellent food, no question. The steak is absolutely fantastic! The atmosphere is nice and very fancy so you might want to dress up a bit. Servers are quick and friendly. 
All things considered a great place to go for a fancy dinner, although you can't help but hurt a little bit inside because of all the money you will spend. 

Tipp: Come during Devour Indianapolis.

Text: I love their food, I love their service, and I love the atmosphere. And there’s nothing I would change about this delicious restaurant. The steak is incredible and it’s one of my favorite places in all of downtown Indianapolis. It’s great for any special occasion

Text: Excellent service, and a perfectly cooked steak.  Sister place to St. Elmo's next door with a newer yet clean look.  Our waitress Eliza was knowledgeable, professional, and one of the nicest waitresses we have had at a nicer place.  The shrimp cocktail with that wake ya up horseradish is amazing and the calamari was superb.  We will go again and will request Eliza again.
