Text: If you're not into the night life, this is still a great place to go to for breakfast. I think it's the best breakfast in town. there is a server there named Derek. if you need info on any thing going on in Put In Bay, just ask him. He has been here for a long time and he will take the time to share his knowledge with you.

Text: Has that local bar feel with a warm welcome to visitors. PM pizza is delicious and the AM breakfast is a good way to get over that hang over. Very friendly staff and bartenders!

Text: Love it! Been going their all my life! Pizza is the best, thin crust, tons of cheese and many toppings. Bar on one side, eating on the other! If you go to PIB you have to go to Frostys for breakfast and later for pizza!

Text: We ate breakfast on a Sunday. We were seated quicky and our waitress was great. Our food was done fast and everything was good. Bought a couple shirts and the man selling those was helpful about showing us the shirts and helping to find a size. Always a good spot to stop.

Text: For Put in Bay the food is affordable and pretty good especially if you have a few beers first.
