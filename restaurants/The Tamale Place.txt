The Tamale Place

Text: So so good. We love everything that we have tried. We like to get the takeout before concerts BC it's easy to eat in the hotel room and the tamales travel well to take into the show if you want. Big tamales! Yum.

Text: Not what I expected, was looking for  authentic tamales like I had in Texas & these were  not them. The corn wrap around them was good & the beef inside was ok, that's where the red sauce was at unlike inside & over it. Staff was very friendly & the Apple pecan tamale was fantastic when it was hot, only mediocre when cool.

Text: We drove 3.5 hrs. one way to have lunch there. Absolutely worth the trip, best tamales I have ever had. We will definitely be making the trip again real soon.

Text: Great tamales and at pretty decent speed. I have liked every tamale I have ate there. The spicy is definitely spicy so if you think Tabasco is spicy then don't try it. Go for something mild instead. If your going to a race you have to try it.
A few suggestions: outdoor seating, the place needs more seating and why not take advantage of the location and add a side entrance more windows and outdoor covered seating. Another suggestion have a set pickup area that doesn't require people to constantly shuffle around so someone else can use the bathroom. These are just minor things still a great place.
