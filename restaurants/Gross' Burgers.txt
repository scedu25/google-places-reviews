Gross' Burgers

Text: It was okay.  Food was bland.  Got the pizza burger.  The pizza sauce tastes just like tomatoes, not much seasoning in it.  I was expecting more of a pizza flavor. Hamburger was overcooked. Very crispy on one side, was tough to eat.  First time being there, lots of friends rave about this place.  We just didn't see it.  Would be willing to try again.

Text: This is my favorite burger place anywhere.  The burgers are thin and crispy like steak n shake, but better. The quality of the freshly ground beef is obvious. Some complain that the patties are dry, and they are because the beef they use is leaner, but you leave satisfied without that heavy, sluggish feeling you get from greasy burgers.  Adding toppings makes it a perfect consistency.  This is a family business, and they are deeply patriotic if that matters to you...and it should.  I personally love everything about this place, and every menu item I've tried has been fantastic.

Best burger and fries I've ever had personally and very reasonable prices!  Awesome feel to sit down and eat there as well. I love it!!! We will be returning for sure.

Text: Had the Triple Burger combo. Patties are thin, so the burger wasn't super huge. Condiments weren't overwhelming on the burger to make it less of a hassle to eat. Bun was soft and moist. Fries were good while they were hot- serving size was humongus. Chocolate shake instead of a soft drink was awesome. Would definitely go back again.

Text: We only get to visit a couple times a year. If you haven't stopped before you should. .yes it's only just a hamburger. ..but it's the best hamburger you're going to eat. ..the fries better than that famous fast food joint.
