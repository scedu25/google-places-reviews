Text: Cakes were fine as usual. The scary face pancakes came as a "make your own" kit. Restaurant was mostly clean.$2.75 for coffee, $3.00 for cup of milk. Prices are HIGH!

Text: Waited 15 minutes to even be seated, not because it was busy, the 4 waitresses were not acknowledging any of the 3 parties who were waiting to be seated. When we were finally shown to a table nobody offered drinks of any kind or even talked to us. After an additional 10 minutes of waiting with no service, as well as listening to two of the three adjacent tables sending their orders back because of poor tasting/incorrect food we decided to leave without ordering. We took our business to a competitor where we had excellent service. I have lived in this area for 20 years and have never received decent service at this location although we do attempt to "give it a chance" every few months. 
This event occurred at 3pm on Sunday August 20th.

Text: I and a friend went to IHOP for breakfast today and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've hsd in awhile! Our waiter was second to none! He was very tentative and showed genuine care to our needs!
