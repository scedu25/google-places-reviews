Text: When I want something besides fast food . I go here they have the best salad bar around. Everything is always fresh and a variety of choices on the salad bar. Great pizza too. The drinks are a little pricey but they do have drink special's .

Text: Really enjoyed my dinner with my daughter. Food was good. Waitress was very nice. Had the shrimp fettuccine and my daughter had the seafood seafood stuffed ravioli. Both were very good. Not impressed with salad bar.

Text: So we grew up in Clinton and moved 13 years ago. On our way to a visit to our hometown, we reminisced  (and drooled) thinking about our beloved Rastrelli's.  We went for Dinner on a Friday night. My husband ordered the Lasanga and I ordered Cheese tortellini (and  a pizza to go).  Our waitress was very good. Salad bar came with our meals. Brownish lettuce, and when I got back to the table I found that the strawberries I selected were rotting underneath.  Our meal came and my husband's lasagne was pasty and overcooked. (I tasted and verified this). I ordered the tortellini with meat sauce. The sauce tasted burnt.  On top of it, we both felt sick later.  The Bread was great, the service was great. The pizza we took to go was good the next day.... The rest of the meal was very disappointing.  Certainly not the fabulous Rastrellis we knew and loved. I hope someone reads this, takes it seriously, and restores the quality we once knew.

Text: Ordered pizza and picked up had to be the worst pizza. Pepperoni was so old and dried out, bland tasting. What happened to the old rastrellis and great pizza. So disappointed

Text: Rastrelli's has been around awhile for good reason. Great Italian cuisine in a great atmosphere. Can be a little pricey if you are not careful but daily specials are good.
