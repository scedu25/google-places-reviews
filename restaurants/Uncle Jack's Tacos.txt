Text: ....We tried this place, due to " good reviews"...Welllll...I'm not impressed. ..; the other " one or two star reviews are CORRECT. ..The food is " okay", I expected more from a Taco place. They don't serve chips and salsa, ...That's basic fare  at anywhere that serves tacos !  The taco meat was too much like a " smooshed up meat" , which too many places serve it that way. Taco meat should be kinda " crumbly" ,with just enough moisture to hold it  together a bit. The cheese on the tacos was good,the lettuce and tomato were fresh, which was a plus. 
Having worked in a restaurant I just feel they have too many things on their menu and they should focus on the Mexican side of the of the menu and provide really good food and better options.  ALSO, THE  MUSIC. TOO LOUD and not pleasant....I don't care to listen to " Twisted sister" while I am eating. There's a middle ground to be had, just because maybe the owner or whoever is running the place likes to listen to that , it doesn't mean your customers do.

Text: Been around and owned by the same family since the mid '70.."Cali-Mex" style.
I am hooked on their beef enchiladas and their corn tacos. Interesting homemade hot sauce. Personality I love the food here.
