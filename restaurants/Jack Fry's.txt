Jack Fry's
Rating: 5
Text: Restaurant recommended to us by a local business associate when we were in from LA.  Food was amazing, great wine and drinks menu, and excellent service.  Was really impressed (and, I admin, surprised).  Definitely try the veal or lamb, and the spicy oysters to start as well.  Will definitely visit again next time I am in Louisville.

Text: Many years ago, Jack Fry's was one of the top restaurants in Louisville - excellent food, cozy atmosphere, a local tradition.  Expensive, but worth it.  NOT ANYMORE:(  Jack Fry's lost its excellent chef who built the restaurant's reputation years ago and doesn't seem to have recovered.  Prices are very high for this city and neither the food nor experience justify it.  I have to wonder if those eating here either are tourists who don't know better or locals who remember the place when it really was something.  As they've tried to pack more and more people into a tiny space, the noise level on a weekend night is absolutely deafening - far more obtrusive than any other local restaurant. Definitely don't go here if you want to have any conversation whatsoever!  Service is atrocious with special requests and even food allergies completely ignored.  Many servers also can't hear??  Communicated clearly twice that I was allergic to onions and had to send food back when my entrée arrived smothered with them.  Manager apologized and we waited a long time for a new order to return (with my husband eating by himself).  Couldn't believe it when the replacement order also was smothered with onions!  Nothing either of us had (appetizers, his dinner since I gave up) was exceptional and we certainly never will return:(

Text: It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience. We booked a reservation for a party for four over the phone and when we got there - a table was waiting for us. Sean was our server. He was knowledgable about the menu and the drinks --- the food was perfect. Simply tasty. We had the brie salad, escargot and the halibut. The perfect amount of food. But beyond that was the exquisite service. There was never a moment when we wanted for anything. Service plus great food in a cool vibe = 5 stars from me.

Text: Mainstay of the Louisville fine dining scene for years.  Not your typical Louisville restaurant.  It's small with close tables and can even feel a little tight if you're seated near the bar on a busy night but the food, service and ambiance make it a great place for that special dinner or night on the town.

Text: The ambiance felt like I had taken a step back in time. It was cozy and comfortable with prompt service. The beef filet was out of this world so was the lamb.
