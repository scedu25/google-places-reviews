The Hangout Bar & Grill

Text: I love this place. What a funky little hang out. We spent all of our time on the deck. A live band Friday night, a whole different crowd Saturday night. It was literally like two different bars in the same place. Three of us are six different items off of the menu and the daily special, all good.

Text: My wife had a veggie omelet and I had special eggs benedict. Both were very good. The place is very clean with a nautical theme. We will be stopping back when we return to our cottage.
