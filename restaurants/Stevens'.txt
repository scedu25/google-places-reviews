Stevens'
Rating: 4
Text: We really like Stevens, the atmosphere is more attractive since their remodel and the crowd is often upbeat at the bar and engaged at the tables. The staff is top notch. The food is always good. I give only 4 stars because I'm not one for steaks or salmon or pork so my choices are limited. A good place to go nonetheless.

Text: Wonderful place! Very clean and stylish very friendly staff. Our waiter Dan was the bomb!! We started with the Crab Avacado Mango Salsa and Chips which very good. Could have used a little more avacado. We both had the Hazelnut Crusted Red Snapper. OMG this was to die for!! Would definitely drive the 45 minutes to come and have dinner there again! Well worth the trip!

Text: A rare restaurant gem in an area dominated by chains. Staff is friendly, the food is first class. Tuna tartare was just spectacular.
