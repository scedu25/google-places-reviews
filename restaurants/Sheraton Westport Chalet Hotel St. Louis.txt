Sheraton Westport Chalet Hotel St. Louis
Rating: 5
Text: Recently visited the Sheraton Westport Chalet Hotel in St. Louis for Beyond The Stars Dance Convention. The hotel was absolutely beautiful, both inside and out. Not only was staff friendly, but the guests were as well. The hotel was easy to find and in a great location with restaurants and shopping nearby. I would definitely visit again and recommend this hotel to family and friends!

Text: I hope you don't want clean linens for the entire room.  Apparently the fold out sofas are overlooked.  When I called at midnight to request them they took about 40 minutes and didn't even bother to bring pillows so they had to make another trip.  No housekeeping at night means you have to wait around for security to deal with anything and the rooms/customer satisfaction are not high on their priority list.

Text: Nice hotel and was nice to get a room where the temp was already turned down, iced water waiting on desk. Did have a water leak from room above. Little disappointed the only offered breakfast coupons which was already provided with our stay. Lot of construction going on right now but still a nice place to stay. Restaurants near by and easy to get to with out driving, including a comedy club and an array of food choices... Wish I had time to visit the pool which looked refreshing...

Text: We attended a dance convention at the chalet. The lobby and convention area were immaculate. The staff were above and beyond helpful and attentive.
