Text: Our family loves this place! We get great service regardless of how crowded they are and our food comes out hot and quick. My teenage boys get more than enough to eat and it doesn't break the bank. Highly recommended that you give this place a shot - you won't regret it!

Text: Have had numerous bad experiences and will not be back.  Several months ago, took the wife on a Friday date and arrived only to find the entire place was "open-but closed to the public because of a private party".  Went back another time and the owner said, sorry we're closed to celebrate the new name and ownership change....strike 2.  

Finally, we arrived last night to use a gift card we had tried several times before.  One of our meals was good, one was disgusting.  the fried taquitos were dry and burnt on the ends with the middle being rubbery and under cooked...not sure how you manage that.  Worst part...we go to pay and use the gift card we had and they say "sorry since the name change we can't accept those, we've had a bunch of people try though".  Strike 3.  RIP OFF...PERIOD.  WILL NOT BE BACK.

Text: Decent mexican food made fresh with decent prices. It's certainly not Texmex or Baja, but it's pretty good for being in the Midwest. Great service. Salsa has a great flavor but a runny tomato sauce like texture.   Love the lunch special pricing and daily specials.

Text: Poor service and my quasidilla was extremely greasy. I actually tipped my plate to let it drain. Other menu items might be better but coupled with the service from our waiter, we are not planning to return to try those items.
