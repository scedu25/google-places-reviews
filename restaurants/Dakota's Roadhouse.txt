Text: Excellent wings! The best wings anywhere. The steaks are hit-or-miss , sometimes they're cooked correctly,  other times not so much.  Service is usually very good.

Text: I was very disappointed, they messed my order up and I had to wait a extra 30 minutes for my other wings and I had called the order in 1/2 prior and asked if they could have them ready by 5:30 and when I got there they told me the price and I said tgat can't be correct because I ordered 2 orders and the manager was even out there seen me eating and he brought the other order and didn't say I'm sorry or nothing. I said thanks but I'm sure the other order is cold by now and they just looked at me. Very disappointed.
