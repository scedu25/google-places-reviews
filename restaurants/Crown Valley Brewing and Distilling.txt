Crown Valley Brewing and Distilling
Rating: 4
Text: The service and staff were great.  The view from the porch area was awesome.  The beers are all pretty good, their coldwater whiskey was good too.  The food was hit and miss though.  The pulled pork nachos were cold, soggy and disappointing while the hot wing pizza was pretty good.  I'd come back again for drinks and a good view but I wouldn't come here for the food.

Text: My only complaint is they're only open till 7pm, what a bummer. And I was here in September, I would have assumed they had production of their pumpkin cider by now like most breweries but I guess they're a little late. I live their big bison beer and other beers by crown valley. Nice little spot to have fun with friends but where to take the fun after it closes so early is a more appropriate question lol. Their blackberry cider is rediculously good. Their pizza was top notch!

Text: Staff were more concerned with setting up displays than assisting customers. We had to ask about tasting, ask where the product was if we wanted to buy it (which we didn't). This was about the coldest reception we've experienced in Bransin

Text: The atmosphere here is fine. No complaints, but no raves either.

This review is entirely about the beer. Each beer I've tasted either is too hoppy (I know personal preference) or tastes like burnt electrical wire. I've only found one beer there that is palatable and that was their equivalent of Bud Light. I am pretty adventurous when it comes to craft beer, but this brand needs to replace their recipes and the hops they use.

Pumpkin smash tastes absolutely horrible. I'm so glad I only bought one bottle in a mixed six-pack with other breweries.
