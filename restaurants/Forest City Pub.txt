Text: Conveniently located near several hotels, we came looking for lots of different beers and some bar food.  Instead,  we found a short list of drafts and some really yummy sandwich fare (and burgers). The BLT w/avocado is really great,  the fries and kettle chips are crispy and salty,  and they have a full bar. Cozy ambiance. Would eat here again.
