Text: My husband and I just stopped in here on a whim this past Sunday for lunch. The food was Amazing! We got the BBQ brisket egg rolls for an appetiser and the Steak New Orleans to share (celebrating our 15 years wedding anniversary). The food was Delicious! Service was excellent. Quick and Attentive. We drank the Moscow mule and the Lavender 75. Both Delicious cocktails. Will go here again soon!
