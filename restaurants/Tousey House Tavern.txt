Text: Love this Historic House that houses the Tousey House Tavern.  Beautifully restored.  The halibut was amazing!  Service was great.  Had a romantic dinner with my husband on the outside porch.

Text: If you consider yourself a bourbon lover, look no further than this place.  It's located inside of an old historic house/building and still has that old feel to it.  They have one of the most extensive bourbon lists I've ever seen and I work in the industry.  They have bottles still from the 60s and is the only place I've ever seen that offers Vertical Flights of Pappy Van Winkle.  They're known for their Fried Chicken and I must admit it was pretty amazing!  We also ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which was like a slice of home!
