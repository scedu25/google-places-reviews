Text: This might sound like hyperbole, but it's true. When I take the first bite of their Hobo meatball sub, I think or say, "OMG, this is delicious!" I also love the hand-tossed Canadian bacon & pineapple pizza. And the coffee is brewed in a Keurig so each cup is fresh & perfect. The people who work there are friendly and accommodating.
