Text: Outstanding experience.   The turquoise laden bartender with magic dish towel tricks held our attention while waiting for apps and entrees.  Food was above expectations due to the owners intensive efforts who's seemingly never absent.  Well run establishment.  Would return.

Text: Very good food and super friendly staff! We came in and noticed they were packed. We kind of worried if we would have to wait, but three different staff members asked if we were doing okay. We were seated quickly and had our food in no time!  Great place.

Text: Want to like it but the value just isn't there for the price. They want to be upscale and charge upscale prices but their food is just okay. Nice location, decent but loud atmosphere.
