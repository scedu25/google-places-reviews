Greyhound Tavern

Text: Has always been good for quite a number of years. Nice Colonial Kentucky decor. Menu is comfort food with good solid portions. Really like there Wednesday evening pork chop special with mashed potatoes and two sides Plus a complimentary blackberry cobbler dessert which was fantastic

Text: I love Greyhound! The chicken is the best you will find. The fried cod dinner is fresh, hot, and flaky, not too fishy either which is just how I like it. The Reuben is my favorite for lunch and I always start with their iconic onion rings! Hands down the best, true to Kentucky, dining. I return frequently. Great for private parties too!

Text: The food is great and so is the service! This is a place you must stop when you're in the greater Cincinnati area, or if you're looking to bring out of town guests somewhere to eat. Beautiful location inside as well as on the new patio! Fantastic place to eat all the time!

Text: Very nice place, with lots of food choices you don't find at a lot of other places. Very friendly staff that's not there to just turn tables. A very beautiful, relaxed environment. A very pleasant dinner experience - they don't rush you - the don't even being dinner until you are finished with your salad, imagine that.

Text: I am a little torn with this review.  If it was only based on the food I would say a 4 would be appropriate.  The service was slow. Take in to consideration that it is 3:00 o'clock. Maybe they had a busy lunch?  My number one concern would be cleaning. Or lack of.  I was sat next to a wall covered in dust.  My table was inches from this wall that is covered in dust.  I have sneezed several times and my sinuses are on high alert.  I hope this is something that will be corrected.
