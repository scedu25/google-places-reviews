Text: The best gyro. This is my only reason for visiting Burlington. Little whole in the wall run by family. It's great! Their fried chicken is also good as well as their pizza.

Text: Wonderful Greek Salad with no lettuce. They used tomatoes (as the base) with a good amount of feta cheese and black olives. Yummy! Now ready for the Greek pizza with gyro meat added!
