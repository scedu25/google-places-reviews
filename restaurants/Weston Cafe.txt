Text: Hole in the wall restaurant with great food and great service. If you're the type that likes to be harassed by your waitress, all you gotta do is ask for Sam and give her some crap. She'll dish it right back out to ya. She'll have you laughing for your entire meal. Great selection of American style food cooked to your liking. My personal favorite is the B&G breakfast.

Text: The food here is good overall. The BBQ beef sandwich is absolutely AMAZING. Nice ambience too in this small-town diner.

Text: Very small town atmosphere, love the old building and people.  Needs some cleaning on walls and corners.  Food is good old fashion homemade.
