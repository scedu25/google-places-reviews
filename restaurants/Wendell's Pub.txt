Text: Interesting menu, certainly well beyond standard sports bar fare. Expert prep, well presented, and very tasty. Good service staff, friendly and very knowledgeable, they do seem to be overloaded because they pass quickly from table to table, little time for check backs and refills. Food comes out slow, but definitely fresh and hot, not like most chains, where your meal sits under heat lamps until some one gets around to running it. We are definitely regulars, enjoying every visit.

Text: We had a party of six. Seated promptly. Waitress Julie was very attentive. Drinks for everyone right away. We had a couple appetizers and everyone had a different entire. We were all pleased.

Text: The place isn't very clean. The food is mediocre. And they took my mother in law's plate away twice because the wrong order came out. A table of 11 (including a newborn) took 3 hours for their brunch menu..... I've been here once before, same exact experience. Disappointing
