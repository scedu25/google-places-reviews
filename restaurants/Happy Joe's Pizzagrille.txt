Happy Joe's Pizzagrille

Text: The service was horrid. Took her almost 30 minutes to take our order. After we finally got our food, she never even checked back. I had the gluten free pizza and it was cold. The server did not prebus our table. The regular crust pizza was enjoyed by the rest of the table as was the omelet pizza. I wish the server would have checked back so I could have enjoyed my gluten free pizza as well. Another server finally came over and cleaned our table and refilled our drinks, but it was too late to save the GF pizza. She is the only reason we will try it again.

Text: Place has really turned around since the remodel and adding the grille aspect.  Now with all the great local and regional craft beers on tap available, and great specials, it's a perfect place to hang out at after work for a drink!
