Scooter's Coffee
Rating: 4
Text: It would be 5 stars but they raised their prices recently and the service is sometimes slow. But overall I really like scooters. Their coffee is amazing much better than Starbucks. From their Americanos to Coconut blender and my new favorite Pumpkin chai latte.  You won't be disappointed.

Text: They left their open sign on, on a Sunday and made me waste gas trying to find parking just to find all the doors locked. #Starbucks4NowOn
