Text: The satay was amazing! We sat at the bar and could not have had better service. Food cooked to perfection and the carrot cake dessert was moist. It was served with a side of homemade butter pecan ice cream that was amazing.

Text: First visit since reopening. The lavosh & baked brie were still wonderful. There were a couple of issues with the hot dishes. Only one of three soups were hot. Hamburger & lamburger were overcooked. But waitress gave us two free desserts. Hoping they are just still working out the kinks.

Text: Excellent as it has always been! Was here the day after their grand reopening and it's as though they never left. Glad they're back and when I'm back in town I'll be coming in. Highly recommended!
