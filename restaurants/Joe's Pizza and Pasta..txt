Joe's Pizza and Pasta.

Text: In the street of old town, this is a perfect place for a pizza joint. The atmosphere is casual. The meals were just ok. The pizza and sandwich had a delicious sauce that has a touch of sweet BBQ flavor and would have loved more. This place is a good for cheese lovers as it is a little thick. They offer your standard pizza, subs and salads. They have a little bar area also to the side.

Text: I've tried 3 Joe's locations so far, and this one is definitely my favorite. I love the Greek pizza (Without olives). It has so much flavor and I like to think it's healthier without the sauce of the regular pizza. The salads are somewhat plain so I recommend getting cheese on them. If you order the lunch pizza at night time, you get a personal pizza with a salad and drink for a great price. The restaurant is always clean and the service has always been great. Stop in and try the Greek pizza, you won't regret it.

Text: This is a surprise it was really good it seemed like just a pizza place but it was like fine gourmet dining. I ordered brushetta and fried mushrooms for appetizers and they were both very flavorful probably the best fried mushrooms I've had anywhere and they were large mushrooms not the small usual type then for the main dish ordered the lobster and crab ravioli Alfredo and you could really taste the lobster and crab big pieces too not just ground up a decent portion as well. I'll be back for sure!
