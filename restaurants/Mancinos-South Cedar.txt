Mancinos-South Cedar
Rating: 2
Text: I love mancinos however I am truly disappointed with my recent visit. I ordered a turkey club grinder at 6:20pm and did not receive it until 6:50pm because one of the workers forgot it was sitting on the oven. The people i ordered directly after had gotten their food and finished it by the time I was walking out the door. I patiently waited because I figured they had a lot of call in orders to fulfill first. Anyway I get home with the sub, take a bite and there's no bacon. At this point I don't even want the sandwich but I live too far away to drive back. However I will say I love love love the lady with the short hair cut that works there!
