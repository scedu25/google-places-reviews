Text: What can I say about pasta house but that I have been coming here most of my life. The food is good sometimes the service can leave alot to be desired but that usually depends the the server. I tend to have many more positive trips here than not. One of my favorites is the fish sandwich. I also love the tortellini and the pasta carbonara. I will continue to eat at pasta house.

Text: Walking into the restaurant the greeting was outstanding. After being seated the server was promptly there to take my drink order. A salad and bread was delivered shortly and then my dinner order was taken. Dinner came quickly. The server was excellent throughout my meal. On a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is excellent, the meal gets a 7.
