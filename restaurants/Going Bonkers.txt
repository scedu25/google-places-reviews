Going Bonkers

Text: Indoor multi-level climbing structure. Fun for kids of any age (adults can climb around in it too). Great place to take the kids on days when the weather is to bad to be outside. Admission prices are very reasonable (cost us $12 for 2 adults and 3 kids) children under 2 are free. Their little food court is what impressed me. The prices of food are comparable to any fast food joint (kids meals even come with a little toy) but the quality of food is SO much better. They have a good variety and plenty of options on their meals. There is also an arcade upstairs (tokens only but they run specials on them (currently 100 tokens for $20)) with lots of ticket winning games. Might sound a little silly but the ticket cost on prizes is a bit better than other places around town. They also have birthday party rooms, offer 3 month and 6 month passes, even offer little things you might have forgot or ran out of (like socks for $1.29 or a diaper for $.50). I've been in Quincy for 5 years now and this is the first time I've "Gone Bonkers". We will be going back regularly especially come winter time when we all are getting cabin fever. Check it out it is well worth the money

Text: A little high priced but good when its not crowded. When its crowded it's tons of bratty kids whose parents don't know how to remind them to behave. I try and take my kids when there's not a lot of other people there. Food is over priced for what you get and slushies are awfully watery.

Text:  Good for my kids,  not too expensive,   friendly employees, but the food could use help.
