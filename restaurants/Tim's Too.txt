Text: We go every time we pass through St.Joseph, once or twice a year, and every time I think, "it can't be as good as I remember, I probably just liked it that much because we were on vacation" and then we get there and it *is* as good as we remembered every single time! My vegetarian spouse and I get a great meal, our meat-loving kid and friends get a great meals, and the vegan options are great for those folks too. They have tons of sauces to choose from and little paper sample cups out so you can try them all if you like before you pick. It's so lovely to get a meal that perfectly suited everyone in your party that is so healthy and delicious! I want one back home!

Text: You get this little tiny bowl of food for $15! I should of got up and left when the waitress showed us the little bowl you get to fill up for $15. It overflows fast, so even though you can put in as much as you want, you only get a very little amount. My husband and I left the restaurant hungry and had to go to another place to fill up and I am a small person. Terrible service. The cook was rude and did not seem to know what "gluten free" was even though the restaurant was on a gluten free website. The kitchen looked dirty and the place is dingy. It is beyond me how this place is getting good reviews! Did we all go to the same restaurant?

Text: This place is great! Pick your own stir fry ingredients and combine the available sauces for your taste preference, downtown st joe location may be busy on weekends during summer months, but to be patient will be the payoff! Quicker for a takeout order! Wait staff is excellent as well....enjoy!
