Text: Family favorite.  We go here fairly often.  Reasonably priced, well made BBQ.  They have a lot of great food to offer, but my go-to favorite is the simple yet delicious BBQ Pork sandwich basket with seasoned fries and a sweet tea.  Their sweet tea is super sweet so if you're not into that sort of thing, try asking for half sweet, half unsweetened.  It's still sweet enough, in my opinion.

Text: Good barbecue here. The offerings are stock BBQ house offerings and the meats are cooked so anyone can eat it.  They have three sauces.  Not too many but there is one for you. :) I honestly cannot think of a time when I ordered bad at Mark's. It's just good eats.  Also, they will treat you in your birthday...

Text: This is the second time we have stopped here to eat. We liked the food so much last year we decided to come back. The BBQ is good, the sides are good, the sauces are good, and the staff are really friendly (even when it's packed or closer to closing).

Text: Recommend the chicken finger salad it was very good and filling. Their brisket is hit and miss, I have had good and bad from here. Sometimes it is great other times it is a thick piece covered in fat. Their bbq sauce it most excellent also.

Text: The DIXIE location is fantastic. The staff are friendly and prompt. The food is scrumptious - their brisket is moist and full of flavor, the ribs are fall of the bone good and the potato salad - yum, yum
