Text: Not just great chicken but great service and friendly too!  The GM walked around the dining room making sure everyone was enjoying their lunch also took the time to thank several for choosing Lee's.  As I was heading out he offered everyone leaving a "trick or treat" since it was Halloween.

Text: Don't usually write reviews, but after having yet another great meal (%100 thus far) I figured I would. Prices are great, service is always excellent, the chicken and sides are both some of the best I have had. I would say this Lee's location isn't just one of the best fast food joints in town, it's right up there with one of the best restaurants. Idk how KFC stays open, lol.

Text: When I'm in the Rolla area I always make time to stop by Lee's Chicken. This time however I experienced less than adequate service and chicken that was stringy and tough. I broke one of their knives trying to cut through it. The biscuit was barely warm, and had a burnt flavor to it.
This was while the manager was doing a good by tour of the staff.
I miss the old days when you could count on Lee's doing it right.

Text: Way better than KFC. Strips are big, tender and delicious! Yummy sweet tea too! Tastes just like it has my entire life, love driving through on my way back to where I grew up and getting a taste that hasn't changed!

Text: This place is an absolute must when I come through here. Easy on easy off in a car...no trucks really can fit with any ease to stay and eat maybe there is parking but I haven't seen it. Prices are fair the place is always clean and the food here is fresh...even at close with minimum wait which is refreshing in a chicken shack. I like it better than KFC and the sides are a treat as well. Nice job wish there were more of these.
