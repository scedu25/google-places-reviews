Text: I brought my daughter to this company thinking that it would be decent. When we pulled in she miss read the sign and said Mid Rate... honestly I think that would still be a complement. Worse food we have tried.

Text: Had a maid rite burger and fries.  Fries were pretty good. The meat seemed kind of old tho. Workers were very friendly. Would go back to try at peak hours for fresher beef.  Steamed buns for the win though.

Text: Not a good experience. Nothing like memories of other sites in the past. Cheese fries: luke warm fries, slice of processed cheese not even warmed up enough to melt, came off in single piece. Onion rings: solid block in the little tray, warmed up in microwave maybe?  Very much over priced, poor value.  Shakes were good. Sandwiches were mediocre, but not worth price.  NOTHING like the Maid Rites in the past.
