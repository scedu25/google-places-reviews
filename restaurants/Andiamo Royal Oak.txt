Text: Horrible customer service at this location. We had a large party and in order to alleviate some of the chaos that comes with putting in 20 orders at once so we ordered our food in waves. Almost everyone's food still came out incorrect, not hot, steaks not at requested temperature, etc. We informed the manager, Matt about these issues and all he did was pull out a piece of paper and ask what needed to be "comped" in other words given for free several times. We did not come with the intention of getting anything free, and his tone and attitude was less than unpleasant giving us the impression he thought we only complained for the sake of getting something for free. Needless to say we were disappointed not only because of how our food turned out but because rather than offering real recourse (like correcting orders and making it known that he was listening and changing things accordingly with the kitchen) we were left feeling like we didn't matter. The waitstaff was clearly following his lead, by not listening and being rude on several occasions.

Text: I went here for a birthday dinner with my parents and I had a wonderful time. Our waiter (Emmanuel) was very friendly and professional. The food was delicious. I even got a birthday dessert surprise! I will definitely return for the good food in a pleasant atmosphere.
