Stella's Bar & Grill

Text: Visited on a Friday night. Line was out the door, but they got us in fairly quickly. Massive, delicious burgers. Fries ordered a la carte. The burgers came out on napkins rather than plates or baskets, which I think was a mistake, considering how big and juicy the burgers were. It just caused me to use massive amounts of napkins. 

Food was delicious. Service was friendly. Intimate, casual burger spot! Good for families.

Text: What a jewel tucked away in Greater Omaha area. Our son found it through research on best burger places in Omaha soon after we moved here. We go there several times a year with friends or family. You can build your burgers as tall as you can eat (I have done a double and my sons a triple). I love peanut butter on mine! The taste of their burgers is out of this world, better than any other place we have eaten. Marilyn Munro pictures in rest rooms are a funky reminder of how old the diner is. The legend has that it was Warren Buffett's favorite burger place growing up - I haven't researched that but I don't think Berkshire owns the place. The staff are just lovable and friendly. Their sweet potato fries and fried ice cream will make you want to return. And lest I forget, it is an inexpensive place. Writing this review, I think we are due for another trip!

Text: Decent burgers. Very fresh. Fine fries. Great onion rings and chili.  Buns were not toasted and tasted a little mushy.  Will be back.
