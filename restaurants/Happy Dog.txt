Happy Dog

Text: Doesn't look like much sitting on the corner, but inside they are serving up a unique hot dog dining experience. Mark off your combination of their interesting condiments and toppings to sit atop your hot dog/burger/fries/tots and get ready to eat! Live music and cheap beer to boot!

Text: My experience at Happy Dog was great. It was my first time in Cleveland and we just needed to grab something quick to eat. Luckily, we found Happy Dog. Not only are the hot dogs good...The fries are GREAT! There is so many choices of toppings and sauces. I would highly recommend Happy Dog!

Text: Dive bar / hole-in-the-wall feel with live, local music almost every night (mostly weekend nights). Build you own hotdog, fries, tots archetype. Very gormet selections for customization. Excellent secret fry sauce. Amazing selection of drinks. A must go in Cleveland.

Text: The hot dogs were good, and fries were edible, but the atmosphere was lacking. It's a music venue that seems to cater (and have employees interested in) a very narrow music taste that did the match our own taste. It's not offensive, but also not interesting. 

The employees were all friendly, but a bit strange.
