Text: We looked forward to having dinner on our way through Essex on Saturday evening. Talked my husband into trying the Cashew Chicken. I order this dish every time I go to Crabby Joes (Kitchener Cambridge and Essex). This dish is usually very tasty and I finish every bite. This time it was so spicy I couldn't eat it and my husband was not impressed with the super spicy but tasteless version they served us. I sent mine back and they brought me one with sauce on the side.  The chicken was tough and hard and the vegetables cut all different sizes so some were mushy and others raw. I arrived home  hungry and my husband was up.most of the night with indigestion. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not be returning to this location.

Text: Got here at 11... they close at 12. Bartender didn't offer me a menu because kitchen was closed. And then told me last call was in 6 minutes. Every time I come here the staff is in a rush to get out of here. We should be offered the same services during open hours.

Text: Service was not good at all. The waitress was very rude. One of my friends tried to pay her bill multiple times and was ignored every time. Very bad attitude and a very smart mouth. Very bad experience
