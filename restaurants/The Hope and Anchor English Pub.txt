Text: Nice place. Decent service.  Our food was good and timely.  Is it an authentic English pub?  Don't know.  I've never been to an authentic English pub.   BTW. Excellent beer selection

Text: This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Rockford area. It is cozy inside and an ideal setting for small parties or family meetups. I am British so the food tastes great to me. Pay special attention to the desert menu!

Text: I found it a good experience. Food was very good and so was the service. Good sized portions we had to take a doggy bag with us. I'll be back with other friends. 
Thanks
