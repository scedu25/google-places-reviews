Text: On purpose, we drove out of the way to return to Oberlin...for the rib eye sandwich...after 15 years. Almost broke my husband's ? as they were gone, that is until we saw a place open across the street. Jackpot!! Still in business, same people, new location.  No need to look at menu as the rib eye was all we wanted. Happy ??? we did make the detour. Tasty and fricking awesome ??.  This is a fantastic place to the good days where local and visitors all talk with each other. Friendly and so enjoyable. The salsa here is a hidden spicy gem not to miss.
