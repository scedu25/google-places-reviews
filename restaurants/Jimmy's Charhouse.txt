Text: Most meals a little on the crazy side if you are looking for steak. Food was fine overall. Not too busy at 9 p.m. Staff was friendly. Ordered steak kabobs which were fairly tasty and reasonable price for amount of food. Also had barbecue special for month of August which was a good price but food was only okay. Waco back again but it would not be a top priority. They did have some other intriguing looking appetizers.

Text: Service was excellent --well anticipated but not hovering.   Bartender made a great brandy old-fashioned!  Flavorful and generous entrees.  Definitely going back!

Text: Great place to unwind. The bartenders are friendly and the food is good. The lamb chops are amazing. The stuffed mushrooms are the best. Hubby has the two tails every time so they must be good.

Text: Nice clean place.  Wine by the glass was fresh and good selection.  Steak and lobster special was good and filet good.  Great atmosphere.  Not a 5 star when you charge extra for cheese on French onion soup.  The chowder taste like vegetable soup.
