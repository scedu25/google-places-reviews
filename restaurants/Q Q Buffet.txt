Q Q Buffet
Rating: 3
Text: Most of the food on the buffet was good. When I got the bill for 1, and a water I was shocked $12.35 for a buffet!! I left a $4 tip, so to me definitely not worth it. I could have been eating steak for the cost.

Text: Absolutely trash food and service and a minor was running the register. I've gone here multiple times and have told myself I wouldn't come back but this time that's it. They had food out that had been sitting there for who knows how long and when I asked for fresh food they said no. They had one scoop of rice noodles and when I asked if they'd be bringing out more they said no.
