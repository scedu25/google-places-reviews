Text: Tammy that works in the kitchen never disappoints when I come to eat breakfast. Food is always great! However, with the understaffed waitresses things seem to be very tense. Due to the kitchen being open I witnessed a waitress who was very impatient and unprofessional. Arguing back and forth. Ridiculous. Hire more waitress and hold them to a higher standard. Please! Food was great but deffinatley left a sour taste in my mouth while paying for my food.

Text: Food is fantastic!! Decor is humorous! Service seems to always be a bit on the slow side and you have to remind the wait staff for a drink refill.

Text: Good food,  fast friendly service. Large portions at a fair price. The menu here is very extensive. They have a comic strip theme and the servers are supposed to tell three different jokes of the day. Unfortunately, ours wasn't very helpful that day. However, a server from another section did everything ours was supposed to do!
