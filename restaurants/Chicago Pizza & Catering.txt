Chicago Pizza & Catering

Text: We've tried all the pizza places in Batavia and Chicago Pizza and Catering is our favorite. They have the friendlies service and a very clean looking kitchen/building. The thin crust is our favorite and we love getting it with the beer nuggets on the side. We order here at least 2-3 times a month. Highly recommended!

Text: Pizza is great. Unfortunately it takes forever. I ordered, I was told 45 minutes for a pick up. I show up on time, my pizzas are not ready. Stuck waiting with 2 babies in the car. Not coming here again. Cashier is clueless to what's happening in the kitchen. We are going into 30 minutes out here waiting. Never again.......

Text: Good pizza but forget about delivery! Ordered at 10:30 for my 11:30 lunch and showed up at 12:15 come on totally unacceptable people!! Sad thing is we gave them lots of opportunities same thing every time. We're a company of 100 and refuse to order again...Ps, Rosati's always on time ??
