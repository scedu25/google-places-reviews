Jasmine Thai Cuisine & Sushi Bar
Rating: 5
Text: I have visited this location frequently since it opened years ago and it has never let me down.  It is definitely the best sushi you can get in Paducah.  They have raw and cooked sushi options, rice and noodle dishes, and entrees.  The photo with this review is the Green Dragon Roll which is my current fave.  It's shrimp tempura, asparagus, and cream cheese with thin slices of avocado on top.  Love!  We  also love the Jasmine roll, California roll, spring rolls, crab rangoon, lettuce wraps, dumplings, orange chicken, and fried rice.  I could go on and on it's all delicious.

Text: It is an extremely rare occurrence to find customer service that can hold a candle to that of the seasoned bartender and server Mr. Grubbs. He and several others do a phenomenal job at serving paducahs best sushi and other delectable treats from the orient!!! Peace Love and Jasmines.

Text: Oh my goodness, this restaurant is one of my favorites. If you get a chance, try the sesame chicken and definitely the lettuce wraps. They are sooooo good. Not to mention the friendly staff. Those guys are amazing.

Text: I was the last person to walk in 45 minutes until close. My server, Justin, suggested Drunken Noodles and an awesome mixed drink.  I was very pleased with my food, my drinks, my service and I WILL BE BACK!  Next time I am bringing my husband, we love sushi and spicy foods, this place is the best of both worlds and the ambiance was perfect for a night out.
