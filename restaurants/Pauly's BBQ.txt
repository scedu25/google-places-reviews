Text: if you are a fan of BBQ, this place is a must. the food is standard BBQ fare and is beyond delicious. try the hog trough for a little of everything. and their sweet sauce is the best!

Text: Awesome service! Very good food. Not the best barbeque I've ever had, thus the 4 stars. But I will definitely eat here again. VERY busy place on a Saturday afternoon.

Text: Amazing food, service and staff!

This place is a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall stop in Arthur. This place is amazing, I am not a fan of pulled pork but theirs makes my mouth water. My family and I eat here often to the point to where they know it's us when we call based on what we order. The breaded mushrooms are AMAZING, loaded fries are to die for, and they even have FUNNEL CAKE FRIES! 

If you are passing through Arthur and are looking for a good place to stop for food, I urge you to stop here. Their employees care about their customers and are very nice, patient and delightful to deal with.
