Text: OK, I know it is Hooters and they know people don't go there just for the food, but they need to realize that their "hooters" isn't enough to keep people or at least me coming back! When they first come to town they cared not just about the looks of their servers but about the quality of the food too. But I have seen a loss of quality in both over the years.

Text: Sat at the bar during shift change. Bar waitresses were friendly and efficient during the few minutes they were not in a gaggle chatting. Beer was cold, as were the fries, unfortunately. Besides the scenery, nothing obvious to draw in repeat business.

Text: Worst waitress I have had in a long time. After eating, We had to clean off our own tables to make room for  birthday cake. 45 minutes after moving our own dirty dishes to the table behind us we she decide to remove the remainder of the dishes. She was to busy flirting with some guys on the opposite side of the room to take care of the 12 people at our tables. We alway tip very very generously. But not this time 
It took for ever to get our food also.

Text: The lunch menu at Hooters has changed. Prices have gone up 50 cents or $1.00 on all remaining items. The iced tea is always fresh.
