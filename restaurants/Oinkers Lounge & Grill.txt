Text: Cozy atmosphere in the basement bar. Old fashioned service and food. They have the friendliest bartenders and best service. Always good people to talk to in a small town of Atlantic, Iowa.

Text: While the food is fine and the servers are friendly I think this place is a bit overpriced. You sit in a wood paneled basement at folding tables but should spend 30 bucks on a steak and 4 for a beer. That is asking a bit much.
