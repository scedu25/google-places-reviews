Kings Table Bar & Grill

Text: My absolute favorite bar in the area. Service is always prompt and friendly. Always a fantastic selection of beer in draft accompanied by two mixed drinks on draft!  As for the food... Always good! Nice selection of items and on some days there are specials. Very roomy environment even when crowded. They have pool, darts, some arcade games, and Keno! You will not be disappointed!

Text: The food was excellent. The service was excellent. However, I am a pool player and only after the fact that I played I was told it was $10 an hour to play pool! Every pool hall in the state is $4 an hour or less, or close to that price. I can't believe you would charge one person to play pool for $10 for 1 hour. That's just insane. I'll never play pool here again. Their pool tables aren't even kept up good and they roll off and they're unlevel. Unreal.

Text: Good lunch specials, especially if you go with a large party. Their Tuesday burger special is my favorite. Staff is friendly! Plenty of space and, of course, pool tables. Also a nice place to go in the evening for a drink and some pool. Although, I'm not a fan of their tap water.
