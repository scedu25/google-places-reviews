House of Hunan

Text: I am not sure what these other people are talking about. I visit 'House' at least once a week and the food is always delicious. The 2 meals for 12$ deal cannot be beaten. If you order, get take-out, its much better when eaten fresh.

Text: Solid, simple Hunan style food with absolutely zero pretense. The menu and signs say "carry out & delivery" and they mean it. The shop is tiny and cluttered, with sparse decoration, and has  no dining area. The staff are not chatty, but are friendly and efficient. The food is all very simple but also very flavorful, with less of the gooey Americanized sauces many folks are probably used to. The prices are low and the portions are good, so if you like this style of food, this is an amazing spot.

Text: Ordered the jade chicken with broccoli. The food wasn't swimming with oil. The broccoli was cooked just right. It wasn't the most amazing in flavor, but overall a very solid choice.
