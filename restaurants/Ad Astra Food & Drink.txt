Text: This was an awesome stop! My parents moved to this area of Kansas last year, and i came to visit from Atlanta. This place is as good or better than any excellent urban yuppie. Craft beers, unique meals, and the apps were big. Nice portions as well. ?

Text: Food was great! Best you'll find in that area including Emporia. Love the atmosphere and service. Good beer selection. Would take more local craft choices if they had it. Love the effort that the Larkins bring to the area.

Text: It has great service, warm and historic-update atmosphere as well as an extensive menu ( my lunch mate had the crab cakes and thought they were the best she had ever eaten). Only downside: they serve Mr Pibb instead of Dr Pepper ( a small price to pay ?)....

Text: Great, friendly and fast service, amazing burgers and wide selection of food and drink. The work of local photographers is featured on the walls of the restaurant, and the atmosphere is welcoming to travelers and locals alike.

Text: For a small town like Strong City this is an exceptional place. The menu isn't large  but the food is always well made and well presented.
