Text: This is our second time here and love it. I had the big cheese hamburger and it was delicious. Second time had their biscuits and gravy and cinnamon roll all was delicious.

Text: Doug, Becky and the staff at cookies go out of their way to make sure you are happy. And if something is wrong with your order let someone know and I'm sure they will make it right. They have for me.
