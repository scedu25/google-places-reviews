Text: The hands down best Mexican&American restaurant in existence. Great place to eat. Friendly staff and exceptional customer service. Reasonably priced with generous portion sizes.

Text: Still waiting for our food we ordered it 45 minutes ago.  Very very slow.  A party took priority over customers walking in.  They should have staffed the restaurant accordingly.  Won't be going back.  That was our first and last time.

Text: I think this place used to be good. Could have just been an off night. Salsa tasted sour. Inside of my enchilada was cold. And ground beef tasted like a slim Jim... chips were good, beans were good, and the margarita was good.
