Casa Nueva

Text: Easily my favorite Mexican restaurant ever. The food is amazing, but it will take some time, so don't be in a hurry. Excellent for vegetarians and great drinks, as others have noted. I miss the days of their jarred salsas (particularly their salsa verde and garlic salsa). As for recommendations on food, I don't think there's a wrong choice. Just pick something that sounds good at the time and you wont' regret it.

Text: Really great food. Our greeter on this occasion was pretty short with us, but the server was good. It takes forever to get your food here - if you are in a rush or really hungry, you might want to come back another time. It's a co-op, so I appreciate that everyone working there really is in it for good reasons, but it's hard to wait so long for your breakfast!

Text: I've been going to Casa Nueva since the mid 1990s. It has changed in appearance over the years, but still remains my favorite Athens restaurant. Terrific food, vegetarian choices, great cocktails, and enjoyable atmosphere.

Text: If I'm being totally honest, when I first moved here 9 years ago, I was pretty skeptical of Casa because it wasn't your run of the mill Mexican restaurant as I had anticipated it being. I started really enjoying their drinks (the infused vodkas are to die for) and eventually decided to try the food again, which was a great life choice on my part because it's absolutely delicious. 

This may sound odd but I noticed that as my love for the Athens local community grew, my endearment toward Casa also grew. Casa uses local ingredients and gives their employees a livable wage (which is hard to come by in the restaurant business). 

I definitely recommend Casa to anyone, my only advice is to go there understanding that it's not comparable to Gran Ranchero (so to speak) in terms of being a "typical authentic Mexican restaurant"
