Legends of Notre Dame
Rating: 5
Text: Absolutely one of the best restaurants in the South Bend area. If you love amazing food and want to be surrounded by die hard Notre Dame fans and history then this is the place for you. I thought the prices would've been too pricey but I was surprised to find out they were quite reasonable. Definitely a place to be at around football season...GO IRISH!!!!

Text: Nice sit down restaurant at the University, with a friendly and efficient waitress. The menu is vegetarian friendly (not vegan). I had a tasty quinoa and roasted veggie plate. Very good buy the portion was small. My husband said his cheeseburger was delicious.

Text: It was during trivia night so the place was packed. But considering that, they still were able to sit our party of 18 within 10 min of getting here which was great. Took awhile to get our food, however, but that's to be expected.

Text: Not very busy, service was horrible, food was a tad less than average ... our food and a group near us were served barely warm food.  The establishment was not very clean.  I would recommend seeking a different eatery
