Text: Great place. The waitress, Danielle, was pretty awesome. Made an error on my meal and promptly made adjustments to our bill and a free appetizer coupon. The setting is very cool with an abundance of Louisville memorabilia. I'll definitely be back when traveling through the city.

Text: We went there after a long day of showing horses. We were dressed very casually and didn't feel like we belonged there at first but once we got in and talked to the friendly staff it changed. Great food, great service, and good prices.

Text: The steak salad was SO good. If I lived in town, I would stop by often to get one. The vinaigrette dressing was incredible!    One of my daughters (8) had the kids chicken tenders and thought it was good. It was your typical kids tenders with fries meal.  My other daughter (10) had the wings appetizer with mild buffalo sauce and ate every last one. Nice atmosphere with plenty of tvs for sports lovers.

Text: Great place to go if you dig a college memorabilia themed restaurant. Big place, wait staff was pleasant and on point, but throwing a flag on the food.  It was like eating fast food bought from Sam's club.

Text: Great service, great food, good portions and reasonable prices. Have been here several times before but this time I went out of my comfort zone and got a ribeye. It was cooked correctly but I don't think I am a big fan of that certain cut of meat. Definitely not any fault of the restaurant. Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I was freezing cold the entire time. Will be back!!
