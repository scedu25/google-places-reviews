Text: We always go nearly every weekend during the winter months because they have AWESOME chili bread bowl soup. We go occasionally during the spring/summer and have been going here for 15 years. The staff is always friendly and welcoming.

Text: This place was ridiculous. We got there at 10 am, ordered some drinks and breakfast. 45 minutes later we still hadn't received our food nor did anyone refill our drinks. They were not busy.  We walked out.
