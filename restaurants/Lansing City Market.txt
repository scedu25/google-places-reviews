Lansing City Market
Rating: 2
Text: Over half of the building is a bar!  Once upon a time Lansing had an historic farm market but the city sold it to a real estate developer.  They constructed apartments that the average resident can't afford. We were promised a better, modern, and wonderful market. I don't see that ever happening but we now have excellent community farm markets in Lansing so it can all become another bar, we need more bars downtown.

Text: As some have commented previously, the Lansing City Market, once full and active, feels empty. The French market feels disorganized and is nowhere as nice as other French markets like Grand Rapids or Ann Arbor. As for anyone looking for a farmers market, in ally visits on Saturdays I have yet to see any sign of one. One the plus side, there is a nice on-site restaurant and it's location by the river adds to the experience

Text: Seating for the restaurant is outside and right by the Grand River so the view is great. The food and service is great as well. There is a large bar inside and a small amount of merchandise for sale. It is not very much of a market. You can also rent bikes and kayaks inside to go up and down the river.

Text: Love this place and the potential it has but, it is dying as of late.  Wish the management would make changes to make this place thrive like the good old days.  There are barely half the amount of vendors vs three years ago.

Text: The place has a gr e at view and the grill is quite good, with a nice selection of beer and fairly priced food. The service was also friendly. The stores inside change, so if you want to have some consistency make sure to support the owners of that particular business.
