Text: Excellent! Was traveling down 35, took a chance, came in and had a great meal. Had a terrific pork chop, delicious vegetables and a standard salad. Would come again and I do recommend it.

Text: I was traveling through the area, stopped for the night at a local hotel ?. Decided on The Iron Horse ? because I wanted steak. I ordered a Long Island iced tea and was NOT disappointed. My steak and baked potato were excellent. My companion ordered a sandwich and upgraded to the onion rings...they were thick cut and hand dipped delicious rings. All the food in the restaurant that I seen appeared to be fresh and good quality. It also appeared the locals go here as a lot of people seemed to know each other. Some dinners were a bit pricey but they also have a good selection of moderately priced items. I would definitely go back again if passing through.

Text: My favorite restaurant in Osceola. I love the beer battered onion rings.  Everything I’ve ordered there has been delicious and well prepared

Text: Service was adequate, not a long wait. I personally did not care for the coleslaw and I love coleslaw. Ordered medium rare steak, it was cooked medium well, so not good there.
