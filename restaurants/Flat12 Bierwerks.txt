Text: First time to Flat 12. Staff was great, very friendly and eager to help. We did not have a chance to order any food, however the menu looked good. Beer well it was great. Sunday seems to be a great day for deals as well.

Text: Solid beer and the hogy was good, but the fact they put their beer in plastic cups is disappointing. If I could give a half start I'd give them a 3.5, but I can't give a 4 to a place that doesn't respect the beer enough to find a way to put it in a real glass.
