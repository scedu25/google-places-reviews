Text: Some of the best burgers in Southeast Kansas! Don't forget fried pickles, okra, mushrooms, and green beans. We had a group of 25 and they easily accommodated us when we called ahead. Hamburgers so large my senior boys runners couldn't even finish them.

Text: Every burger is made with 100% beef that is ground? fresh daily. Everything is cooked to order, nothing sitting under a heat lamp. If you want the best burger in Kansas, you have to try one at King's. If you are brave try the Triple Bacon Cheeseburger.
