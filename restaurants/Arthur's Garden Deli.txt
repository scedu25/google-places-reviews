Text: pretty awesome sub place. it's another Rock Falls/Sterling favorite, IF your in town here. don't go to Jimmy John's or Subway stop at Arthur's Garden Deli for sure for a sub sandwich, potato or soup

Text: Soggy microwaved sandwich. Cheaper than subway but way less quality soup is bland as well. Not sure why it’s so busy
