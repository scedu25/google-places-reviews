Text: I had a great side salad and burger here!  Definitely better than what I was expecting.  The side salad was really big and tasted so oo much better than a side salad.  The burger was fresh and unique!  They only have 2 wines here.  The service was good!

Text: Bone-in hot wings are great! A different kind of scene for Pikeville, in a former Bank building which gives the place a unique feel. Service is sometimes a bit slower than it should be for the number of patrons, but otherwise fairly consistent with food quality. Decent selection of spirits for this area, too. They sometimes have live entertainment featuring local talent, so check their schedule. Located near the parking deck in downtown in case you can't score nearby street parking (which can be a challenge on busy weekends or during events).

Text: Only thing nice I have to say about this place was are waitress.Bathroom not taken care of at all,yet a waitress was in there.But to busy texting.And the food was not good at all.Should of known when there was half eaten meals on the table before it was cleaned.$5.00 a beer.I have been in some hole in the wall places before but this one takes the cake.
