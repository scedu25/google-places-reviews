Weingarten Vineyard

Text: Brought my wife here for our wedding anniversary following a friend's recommendation. They seated us by the window so we could look out over the vineyard during dinner. This place is a little off the beaten path so you really feel like you "escaped" for a while. Beautiful views, extremely nice staff, very friendly with fast, attentive service who enjoy visiting with each table. Had a bottle of their wine and it was very good as well. Would recommend, and will definitely be revisiting.

Text: It is a disgrace. Never ever again. We were going to give them one more chance and went to try a meal. The parking lot was empty and when we entered we were told that they had a private event and couldn't accommodate us. This place sucks, the Owners suck and we will never ever go there again. Hopefully the banks take them over and create a place befitting of the wonderful people in this area. The Owners do not deserve any business and need to be run out of the area due to their arrogance and incompetence.
