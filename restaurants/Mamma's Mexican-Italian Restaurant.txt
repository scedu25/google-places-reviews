Text: Typically enjoy eating here. However, I recently went here with my family and we found two hairs in my fiancées food. When we notified the waitress the first time she just said oh. There was no apology and no offer to get him a new meal. After packing up the rest of what we thought was hair free food we found another piece under his burger. We notified the waitress again and still there was no apology. Her response was "you guys took the food and ate it". I can understand if you can't give us the meal free. What I can't understand is how there was no apology for our unpleasant experience or a promise to make sure it wouldn't happen again. She did not receive a tip and I will not be returning
