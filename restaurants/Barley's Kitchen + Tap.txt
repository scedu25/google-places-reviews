Text: The beer selection was pretty good and I did like the atmosphere. The food was ok. Beer cheese soup was good. My entre was this salmon fillet thing with a excessive amount of kale or some other kind of greens. Would not order it again but would go back and try something else.

Text: Over 50 different types of beer on tap.  Excellent food.  Mixed drinks as well and TV's on all walls.  Good place.

Text: Great beer selection. The fish and chips is delicious. Their burger used to be better than it has been lately. Over the last year or so I've had the burger several times and not once has it come as ordered. It is either overcooked, the wrong cheese, missing toppings, etc.

Text: One of my favorite places to eat. The food is delicious. The filet mignon is to die for!

Text: This is the second time in a row that service has been dismal and food substandard.  Both times they seem short staffed, and the food that was suppose to be hot was room temperature.  Very disappointing because they use to be one of my favorite places to eat.
