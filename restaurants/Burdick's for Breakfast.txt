Burdick's for Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had such a great experience at Burdick's for Breakfast! They had a regular menu to order from as well as a breakfast buffet with made to order pancakes, eggs, omelettes, and a lot more! I enjoyed the fresh fruit and yogurt bar as well! They also have an awesome freshly squeezed OJ machine! All staff was so friendly and helpful! Would definitely be back!

Text: The buffet is varied and delicious. All-you-can-eat omelets, waffles, bacon and just about every other breakfast dish imaginable. The tables, dishes and silverware are very clean, unlike other restaurants and the interior is neat and cozy. Great place to spend a Sunday morning with a friend or family.

Text: With very few breakfast buffets in Kalamazoo it's tough to find one that actually tastes good for the money. Burdick's for breakfast does just this. It has your standard offerings like fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, etc, as well as omlets made right in front of you whatever you want. Definitely my choice to go as long as you're not bothered going downtown.
