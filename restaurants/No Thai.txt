No Thai

Text: "No Thai"is right.  If you have never had authentic Thai food, you will think that this is great.  Well at least they tell you the truth up front:.This IS NOT THAI. Find somewhere else to go where they have Thai people who are actual cooks.  Being from Thialand is just not going to cut it.

Text: This is one of my favorite places for a quick bite! Service is always great and I've never had a bad experience. All the locations in Ann Arbor tend to get busy around meal times, so there may be a small weight at times. Just goes to show how popular this place really is!

Text: Great place. I miss the convenient take home style of the food. Please open location in Kalamazoo!

Text: Reasonable prices,  family run, friendly, super service and each dish ordered (four of us ordered our favorite Thai dishes) exceeded expectations.

Text: This is sort of a fast food version of Thai. If you know that going in, you'll be very satisfied.
