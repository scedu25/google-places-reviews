Fastimes Indoor Karting
Rating: 5
Text: Had our Indiana Moto Meet up in Indy then went for a ride. Everything was calm until we got here. An absolute BLAST!! Take your kids, friends, family. YOU NAME IT. Too much fun to pass up. I'm 6 foot, carts fit me great. Safety Safety Safety all the way. You are missing out of you haven't been here. Us grown adults had more fun than kids a Disney i swear.

Text: The price seemed normal for these types of places, $22/8 minute race. We didn't have much guidance to know what to do once we watched the safety video and had to ask. Karts were fast and well powered and the track was fun, challenging, but a little rough. It would be helpful if they had a flag signal for passing since visibility is limited due to the helmet. Overall pretty good experience.

Text: Definitely a great track. All of the gear seems in good shape. I really like that it is two stories. I had a great time here. I recently went to a different indoor track that uses a "move-over" flag and I am glad that this Fastime does not use such a flag. I felt like the flag interferes more than it helps. I really enjoyed this track.
