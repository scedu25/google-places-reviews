Text: I received a menu from a flyer passed out to the homes in the area. When I tried to place a dinner combo, I was told that was for the Express location only. I then placed a regular order from the menu. To my surprise, the amounts were much higher when I went to pay. Apparently, the menu prices read $1.50 less than what is being charged.  Then why pass out menus with the wrong prices? Bait and switch. I ordered Generals chicken and it was over cooked, like chewing leather. I suspect it had been in the warmer all day or reheated from the previous day. It had no spice at all and it should have some heat to it. I had to throw it out, it was that awful. The shrimp and mixed vegetables had about 8 shrimp, also overcooked, with raw vegetables and little flavor. The fried rice appeared to just be colored rice. It had no flavor and tasted like it was old.  I also had a coupon for 2 free Crab Rangoon. I told the call taker that I had the coupon. She said "we give you 4 free with coupon at this location." Ok, cool. When I get the order, there were only 2. So, don't tell me you will give me 4.  The food was disgusting and overpriced.

Text: Good Crab Rangoon nice and oniony and not sweet! Black Pepper beef is not spicy and kind of bland. Spring rolls were super greasy.

Text: The food was fine. The atmosphere was nice. Although everything seemed a bit rushed. However the egg rolls were great.
