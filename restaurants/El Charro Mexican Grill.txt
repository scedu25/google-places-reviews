El Charro Mexican Grill

Text: From what I read here the 3 and above stars were years ago.  Now, June 2017,  we gave 1 star because that's the least that can be assigned.   I did not heed my initial instinct of turning away as the parking lot was completely empty at 1:30 in the afternoon. The waitress was indifferent and unfriendly. 
The chips and salsa were average at best and did not appear or taste fresh or handmade.   The "beef" was ground beef and had ZERO flavor and no seasoning.   honestly, I was not expecting much because of my initial reaction of the parking lot being empty, and boy did they deliver on that expectation.  In my 55 years of eating Mexican food all over the country,  I have never used salt-and-pepper and had to load it up today!!!  Damn good thing I left my palate at home in my sock drawer. 
if you're there for drinks, I'm pretty sure they don't distill their own alcohol and you'd be safe doing that… 
Thumbs down

Text: I gave El Charro's 5 stars because my family and I enjoyed the amazing taste of the food, quick service, the irresistible nachos and salsa that's given as an appetizer, and the extremely friendly waiters that served us with a smile! Please visit El Charro's! You will enjoy everything there!

Text: I have eaten here several times and really haven't liked anything I have gotten. Ate nachos yesterday and only ate a few bites. They were nasty. Won't eat there again.
