Text: I've never had such bad sevices or trying to push a medium sized pizza off as a large, and I've ordered the same thing there for years, and me and my entire family know the truth!

Text: Not impressed despite the recommendation by a local.  
It's a good size pie for the price.  But the pizza could have used a few more minutes in the oven to melt the cheese fully.  Too salty for my tastes.  
Counter person needs a lesson in customer service.  When the customer makes clear we're taking the pizza for a picnic, then later asks for napkins, don't be surprised and have no ability to provide napkins.  Are there none in the shop?  It is a sit down place isn't it?

Text: I originally gave a very bad review, I am not changing it because I am being forced to. I just felt it was the right thing to do. I am still giving a bad review however. I hate this restaurant. That's my opinion, I've spent thousands there over the years. They gave me a nasty and sloppily made pizza and it made me very, very sick, I was getting sick all night long. So I won't be going back ever and neither should anyone else. This is my fair opinion.
