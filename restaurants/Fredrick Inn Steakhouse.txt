Fredrick Inn Steakhouse
Rating: 5
Text: Love the prime rib, consistently cooked the way I like it.  Reasonably priced.  Did not like the soup that comes with the meal.  Salad Bar included, but get the spinach salad instead...very good. Never tried anything else on the menu.  Our waitress has been there for 50 years!!??  She was a delight, wish I could remember her name.  Would recommend reservations on weekends.

Text: This past week my stomach was grumbling,  and I wanted to try somewhere different than the usual belt highway trap. So I ended up at the Frederick Inn, largely due to the fact that they are open at 4 pm. What a breath of fresh air! Turns out there is an early bird special from 4 to 5. I had the smothered steak. Starting with the salad bar, I was one happy camper when I left.  I was so impressed that i returned the next afternoon for their fried chicken! I surely will put The Frederick Inn on my dining rotation!

Text: This place is a true local fixture. Great food, outstanding service, and a very comfortable ambience. I can personally attest to the salmon, chicken livers, and prime rib. Plenty of local regulars... always a good sign. Even if you're just passing through on I-29, Fredrick Inn is worth a detour.

Steak & prime rib cooked perfectly. Salad bar was clean, fresh, & tasty.
Service was spectacular! Shelby & everyone else made sure that we were well taken care of.
