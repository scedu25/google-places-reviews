Text: This was the worst Mexican food we have eaten in a long time. After being in the road all day, we were looking forward to a good meal to take back to the motel. It was very disappointing and pricey.

Text: This is definitely the best Mexican food in Burlington. If you are driving through on I-70 you should stop in.

Text: Went there today and I asked for sour cream and guac and the waitress gave me a pissy look. I believe we are done doing business here. Very sloppy looking fat nasty waitresses.
