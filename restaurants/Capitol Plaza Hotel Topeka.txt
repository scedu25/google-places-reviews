Capitol Plaza Hotel Topeka
Rating: 5
Text: Amazing customer service! Exceptional food! Very Elegant hotel! Fast elevators! We stayed there for three days and every time we would leave to attend our meetings our rooms would be clean when we returned. Fresh towels...everyday. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Topeka but the Capitol Plaza. Breakfast delivered to your room! Wonderful fitness center! The list goes on!

Text: It was a fairly nice hotel.  The first one I have been in where the shower drained correctly.   Housekeeping didn’t even make the bed tho. I didn’t want towels or bedding changed but that surprised me.  Rooms were nice.   Hot tub didn't bubble at all.  Would have been a nice one if it worked.   Needs new carpet,  a lot of taped seams in the halls.  Rooms were nice tho.  Typical.

Text: A very positive and refreshing stay. Everyone polite and helpful. The food delicious and priced well. Room clean and fresh. The best stay I've experienced in my 40 years of traveling as a civilian and 20 military.

Text: Held my wedding reception at the Hall adjacent to the Capitol Plaza, and the staff, the room, and the venue were amazing. The security was friendly and even danced with us, the room was clean, updated and well put together, and the food that night and the best day was perfect! I WILL be returning.

Text: We stayed here for a quick stopover during a cross country road trip. The bed was comfortable, everything was clean, and the staff was courteous. For the price I was very impressed. The restaurant and pool looked very nice, although we did not have time to check them out ourselves. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area!
