The food is always a delight when I come here. The customer service, however, is not. The last time I came here, the hostess slapped a menu in my hands and said, "You'll sit in the corner," like I'm some repulsive monster. So, definitely not the best place to get a smile, but your stomach will be happy!

Also a mildly well-kept place. Nothing to be afraid of, and it's a nice place to take your family out on a Saturday night (if you're okay with the wait time).

Text: Stopped there for lunch on a Saturday. My order was quite good but my 10 and 12 year old not so. My 12 year old order Kraft macaroni and my 10 year old corn dog. The macaroni was one small bowl and the corn dog was overly cooked and hard. I told the waitress about it. She informed me that's how they are cooked. The shock was when I got the bill. My meal that consisted of three good size items was $6.85. the kids were $7.25 each. I complained again about the overly cooked corn dog. She finally removed it from the bill. Not very kid friendly, the Mac and cheese bowl was about a forth of a box. I ended up sharing my meal with the kids.

Text: This was disappointing, the staff was not very friendly. Our drinks were empty for quite a while. I pointed out to my husband that our waitress was on her cell phone and the guy who was helping her was sitting at a table with another employee just hanging out. The food was pretty bad compared to what I am used to at Mexican restaurants in Colorado.
