Text: Service was very good but food was just OKAY. Both of us had something that had the shredded beef in it. And we both thought it was very bland/flat tasting. Tasted like plain roast beef... Zero seasoning. In a town with multiple choices for Mexican food I'll be checking out the others before coming back here again.
