Text: My family LOVES Italian Villages! The pizza is amazing! The layer on the ingredients and cook it in large oven. It is delicious! They also are famous for their buffet: Salad bar, pasta, soups, and pizza. Huge drinks with free refills.  I can feed my growing boys at a fair rate! Wonderful small town kindness and locally owned!!! I recommend you try it!

Text: We ate here for dinner tonight. My boyfriend got the Steak & shrimp. They only gave him 4 shrimp & the steak was like rubber. It was tough, a rubber texture & no flavor. For $17, it was not good. The employees we're very loud & playing around in the back. Definitely needs better management.
