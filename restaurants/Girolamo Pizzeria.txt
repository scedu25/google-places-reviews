Text: If I could give NO stars that would have been my choice. This review is not a reflection on the food, but on what I just witnessed. I am appalled at how the owners just treated a member of their wait staff and in front of customers, even laughing at her while the poor girl was in tears. Extremely unprofessional and I genuinely hope she will report them. Local owned and operated businesses are so very important to our small communities, but this is one I will NOT support any further nor will I recommend! No one should be treated like that by an employer. Now I understand why I never see the same staff here for very long.

Text: I just went there for the first time.  I had a toasted submarine sandwich and wings.  Best food ever!  Fast, friendly service.  Next time, I'm ordering their pizza.  But, they are not open at the times posted here.  I've tried to go there in the afternoons and it's closed.
