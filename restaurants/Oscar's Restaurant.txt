Oscar's Restaurant

Text: As a rule I stay away from hotel food but decided to try it.  We went as a group and was during the evening.  The food was terrible. The steak was so tough I could not eat it. Nor did I want to eat it.  The menu consists of one front page.  The fish was deep fried like you would get at any fast food place but they charged 23 dollars for it. I didn't see any reason why someone would want to eat here other than just to say you did and spent a lot of money to do it. Worst place I have eaten in Portsmouth.

Text: $130 a night hotel, and breakfast isn't free? Ok, I'll pay for my breakfast.... Oh, the Western skillet looks great, it says "two eggs any style" so I asked instead of getting it on the skillet, can I get it as a cheese omelet on the side?.... Nope! Had to stand at the "please wait to be seated" for 5 minutes.... Busy? Nope! 1 person eating. Ordered hot tea, no spoon with the silverware to stir the sugar in. Food is a decent, and with only one other person eating, it came out quick. Overall bad experience!

Text: Best steak and lobster I've ever had! My family and I eat here at least once a week. Staff is always friendly with a warm laid back atmosphere.

Text: We had our office's Christmas party at Oscar's, and it was amazing! The decorations were beautiful, the staff was so accommodating and hospitable, the food and drinks were delicious, and the entire event was wonderful! We would recommend Oscar's to anyone looking to book a really nice event in the Portsmouth area.
