Sam Bass' Saloon & Steakhouse

Text: My husband and I ate here last night. Parked at the truck stop, thought we'd treat ourselves to a big fat steak dinner.
For the 2 of us, we spent $63 for dinner.
Ok, now about the food. We both ordered the 16 Oz t-bone steak dinner with mashed potatoes and brown gravy. 
The steaks were low grade. The entire steaks were encircled by a ring of inedible gristle. You know,  the stuff that is normally cut off before cooking,  and definitely not served to guests. 40% of the steak was inedible,  left on the plate. We will never be back. 
I must add, to be fair, that the waitress was really nice and the steaks were cooked perfectly rare/med rare, the only reason I give 2 stars. 
Come on, people,  this is Nebraska, beef country! I get far better steaks in California and New York. This place is a fail.

Text: I love a thick steak medium rare.. as a truck driver I was hoping it would be good since its next to a truck stop.. I always read reviews to help my decision making and take it with a tablespoon.of salt.. but with most reviews complaining about the same thing.. overpriced, thin, low quality and overcooked.. I think I'll pass.

Text: Been coming here for years. The steaks get smaller and the prices get higher.  Might be time to start eating at Grandma Max

This place use to be a 5 star tell the changed they menu, it had so much more and had prim-rib Fridays,  and Saturday you could a prim-rib sandwich. I should give this place a 2 but still good service and cool place to hang out and have a drink..
