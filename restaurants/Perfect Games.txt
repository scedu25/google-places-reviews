Perfect Games

Text: Carpets are really dirty. Games were ok. Good price on lots of them. Went to get pizza... No server. Got yelled at for slipping behind counter to get waiter attention. Pizza okay a little under done. Good price for buffet.

Text: It's a good place to go with a group of friends.  Today we ate Pizza, played mini golf, and played in the arcade while waiting for Lazer tag.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because I was playing the hunting game in the arcade and was upset to find half dressed girls dancing on the screen as I waited between shooting rounds.  I enjoy shooting bucks, but I don't enjoy seeing women's bodies used to attract an adult/teen male audience. Women and children like to go hunting too.

Text: This a great place for a family friendly outing or event. We tried the mini golf and the course is fun. Seems a little price, but overall we enjoyed it. Love the arcade, bowling, laser tag, etc. Good food as well.

Text: Don't come here when they are busy.  The staff can't seem to handle the simplest tasks and the customer service is poor.  Very poor.
