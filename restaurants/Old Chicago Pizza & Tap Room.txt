Text: Salads  were fresh. Ordered cheesecake with blueberries that was on the menu but they were out of blueberries already on a Saturday afternoon. Waitress was excellent and when she was busy manager jumped in to help her.

Text: Service horrible.  Management horrible.   Food horrible.   Ordered the Italian nachos to be told more than 15 minutes later they where out.  After another 45 minutes my pizza came out.  I ordered a pan crust pizza and received something that looked like it had been run over by a train.  My daughter's kid pizza was literally thicker.  When I asked I was told by the waitress it was a pan pizza.  So a "manager" came out to the table and couldn't even tell me what kind of crust I received.  All she could tell me is about how tired she was.  Oh and mysteriously when we where leaving there where at least 5 orders of the Italian nachos setting on the counter.   If your gonna lie to me you should be better than that at.   Will absolutely never go back to this joke of a place and it's sad because it used to one of my favorite place to eat
