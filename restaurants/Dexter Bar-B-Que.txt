Text: 1st time to eat here. Both ordered ribs and Cajun fries as a side. All OK, but very salty. Good sized portions. My husband didn’t care for any of the BBQ sauces - I didn’t use.

Text: The sampler plate with brisket is enough to feed two, unless you have a huge appetite. Staff is always friendly!! Best local BBQ I have had.
