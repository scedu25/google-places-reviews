Cafe Andiamo

Text: Wonderful staff. Great atmosphere. The fresh baked goods are top notch. The young lady who does the baking on site is a pro. The main cook is producing delicious specials and the menu items are extremely consistent. The best part of all is the decor. Whoever is doing the interior design has a wonderful eye and superb taste. ??

Text: Quaint old storefront. Love the bare brick walls & old-style tiny white tile floors. Very convenient to busy downtown area Food  & baked goods are healthier choices. Fresh brewed coffee in a variety of flavors is great, also have teas. Public wi-fi. Friendly staff. Only regret is 2 pm closing but cater mostly to morning & midday so understandable for business efficiency.
