Text: Their Sicilian baked sandwich is popping with flavor! Their hearty sandwiches, including the fat meatball sub, are worth every penny. Their pizza is a hand tossed crispy crust with a variety of flavors and sold by the slice. Catering to the very busy business crowd, these orders pop out pretty fast.

Text: Not the best Italian in Des Moines but a pretty good place nonetheless. Worth checking out if you haven't been yet. Easily accessible from the skywalk as well.
