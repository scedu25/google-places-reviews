Text: They remodeled the arcade that was here before.  It is definitely much nicer but for one game of bowling for 3 people, it was $31.  More than it used to be.  The pizza is really good but they don't offer pitchers of pop. You can only buy a glass full and it will cost you $4. That's a little much for soda pop.  So while it is nice inside, it will cost a bit more.

Text: Had a party for 12 at 3:00 on a Sunday. Great speedy service, staff was very attentive. Definitely got my money worth and would come again. It was the perfect option for a birthday party with guests ranging in ages 3 to 55. Nice atmosphere, only slight complaint is lighting made it hard to get pics. So parents should be aware of lighting in lane area.

Text: I was here last weekend with some friends. Its an awesome place to be on a Saturday night! The music was awesome, the staff is over the top friendly and  the food and drink options were great! Don't forget to check out the awesome game room with arcade, ping pong, pool and "Ballin"   Good times, Good Peeps!

Text: Absolute best bowling place (for the best price). Has a very nice inside area and a nice arcade. I would recommend this place.
