Baxter's Lakeside Grille

Text: This place has great food and even better desserts. We visit Baxter's every time we come to the lake. Typically, we sit outside and have coffee and dessert in their great patio seating. I'd suggest sitting outside if the weather is good. The views are great. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the host staff and wait process. I always feel like there is an exclusive club that we aren't members of when we try to get a table. We'll be waiting for a table and someone the host knows will walk in, shake hands, exchange pleasantries and the host will seat them ahead of everyone else who is waiting. It always rubs me the wrong way. We keep coming back because of the food and desserts when we do get seated.

Text: Nice atmosphere and ambient, great terrace overlooking the lake, and nice service. I had great Asian inspired shrimp pasta, but my husband was not so lucky. He started with fried calamari that were greasy. Went on ordering grilled chicken with side, and got under-seasoned chicken breast. So my hubby left the place hungry and disappointed overpaying for the food that he did not eat.

Text: We had nightly special, excellent flavor on meat, although we had to send make for a little more fire to match our taste.  Service was little slow but workable.  Enjoyed it!
