Text: The service was terrible. We had a party of 13 and they put us in a private room. Not good idea for a group of black educated adults here for William Penn University football game. And hour wait just for salads is not acceptable at any restaurant.  We felt secluded, forgotten and not accepted as other customers. 
After calling the manager at the end she was not passionate as we thought she should have been with our concerns. 

Coming back for graduation the restaurant will not be on our agenda. Please note as patrons as everyone else we feel our acceptance was not welcomed.
