Village Anchor Pub & Roost

Text: This place is literally at the end of the road. It's a great environment, and with the professional down to earth staff, that are prompt and precise, you can't really ask for more. The decor is wonderful and the drink selection is of the best in the business. I will always recommend this place to anyone that inquires, and can't wait to visit again. The food is fresh, and the finer details are routine. Keep it up!

Text: Good food and cocktails, but a bit pricey.  Definitely pulls in the trendy Anchorage group.  Nice place for dinner but I'm not sure if this would make it in my short list of future visits.  The service seem a bit slow and we were forgotten about towards the end (we ordered a dessert for the table that the waiter forgot to place) However I would still recommend trying it for yourself.  Good out door seating.

Text: Neat decor with an awesome wait staff.  Food was very good with ample amounts.  Had the Cuban and a salad both great.

Text: I've only been here once, but I'll definitely be returning. $10 Tuesday is a great deal and the restaurant had a nice casual atmosphere, on the patio and inside. It's also a positive that there's a few picnic tables outside so that you can stop by the bar and wait for a table with a drink in your hand where it's not too crowded.

Text: Had the wontons...excellent! Best I've had. Sipped an Old Fashion Mimosa with bourbon very delicious. Hotter Brown for lunch...super tasty!
