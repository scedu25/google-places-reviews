Text: I had the grilled chicken spinach salad. It was extremely delicious. The perfect amount of walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, chicken, strawberries.
The raspberry vinaigrette was so tasty. This is my go to salad when I'm in Charleston!! I've had other salads here and they are all very good.

Text: Seems we get the worst waiter/ waitress every time we dare try it. And the bartender needs a few classes on how to make drinks. Not impressed
