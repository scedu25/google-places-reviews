Text: AMAZING experience at CSC! This was my second time jumping, but the staff and the facilities were so much better than the place I went my first time around. Loved "Klash" especially!

Text: Overall: CSC offers a life-changing experience with class and expertise. I would recommend anyone and everyone to go!

The good: Customer experience is top notch. Everyone is super friendly and professional, from the receptionist to the tandem jumpers to the videographers. It made every step of the experience very easy and fun. The jumpers were detailed in all of their instructions. Mine decided to joke with me, which, while it seems cruel, really does help distract the mind and ease the nerves (at least after I got over the initial shock of some of the jokes). And, OF COURSE, the skydiving experience was amazing. The whole time I was screaming with glee, and I felt safe the entire time. 

The not-so-good: Bring your wallets, because everything is expensive (except the food and drinks). That said, the restaurant, while delicious, large, and overall a great experience, did have some slow service.

Text: Incredible experience with first rate staff.  My wife and I tried skydiving for the first time yesterday to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful experience. Hats off to Doug and his whole operation, see you next year and plan to brings some friends so they can try this life changing event with us... all the best!

Text: What a cool place. Cool little restaurant and bar, sand volleyball, bags games, helicopter rides, and skydiving. I'll definitely be back.

Text: The best skydiving experience you will ever have. The facilities are large and beautifully maintained. The spectator's area is clean and easy to access. There is a restaurant & bar on the premises for celebrating after your jump. The staff is absolutely professional.
