Avanti's Ristorante

Text: Avanti’s has always had great food at very reasonable prices and it’s no different today. The salad was simple but fresh and delicious and my Gondola Deluxe was oh so good. Fresh bread and butter with every order.

Text: Rude Workers. I didn't recieve my salad that was supposed to come with my dinner. No big deal, I was going to go back and pick it up but I wanted to call and make sure it wasn't going to be an issue. When I told the worker over the phone that I was missing an item from my order, his response was " uhhh.. there's nothing I can do about that. hold on." and put me on Hold. I hung up out of frustration clearly it's not worth it. I work at a hotel and I'm done recommending Avantis. frustrating.

Text: A very busy place at lunch. Only one person in takeout last Friday and the phone rang non-stop the whole time I waited for my order. The cashier kept her cool though and seemed to be managing. Good service and good food.

Text: If 0 stars was an option they would have it. After messing up an order they offered only to replace the item they had failed to prepare properly, leaving me to eat hot food or wait till my wife got ger correct food and me to eat cold food.
They refused to make the whole order which was under $17 dollars. The manager Allison called corporate, who told her the terrible service  only justified bringing their failed item not the entire meal over.
This makes me think there is 0 hope in improvement as the people at the top back such terrible standards.
Better go to olive garden would be my advice.
