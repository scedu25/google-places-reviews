Text: I come to Delaware every three months and have been doing so for over twenty five years. We eat here at least once every visit. It's high end but it's always good. Somewhere in the back there's an awesome staff making it happen consistently.

Text: Nice little bar and restaurant with great food and great drinks. The bartenders were super friendly and talkative and you could tell they really enjoyed their jobs and company of everyone. Definitely recommend!?

Text: Nice restraint with a unique vibe. It offers high-end food, without a super classy environment. It's almost like they took the menu from a expensive nice restaurant,and put it in a bar like atmosphere. The salmon filet was exquisite.

Text: This is my go-to when going out to dinner.  Always a good meal.  Endless beers on tap and truly unique and masterfully crafted cocktails. The weekend specials are always good and the weeknight events are a lot of fun.  I recommend it to everyone.  Also.... get the banana pudding it's amazing.

Text: Wait for food was long, but worth the wait. Price was too high for the quantity of food. Skip the drinks, go with water and a cocktail at home before you get there. Wait staff was nice, friendly and helpful. Just what you like. Seating spacing is good. Lower the price and this place is aces...
