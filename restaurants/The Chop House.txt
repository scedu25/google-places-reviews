The Chop House
Rating: 5
Text: As many times I have dined at  Chop House, I have never been disappointed. The food, service and ambiance make for a great dining experience. I ordered a selection from the lunch special menu. The trout was as good as any in town. I always have the cream spinich and a side house salad. The salad is not your run of the mill typical side salad. There are actually tomatoes, shredded carrots and other vegetables. The new champagne dressing is quite good. My friend ordered the ribeye. He commented the wellness was a perfect medium - and he is a chef. If you have not tried Chop House, try it. You won't be disappointed.

Text: I have always received great food from this restaurant except for (1) unusually tough ribeye steak..but no restaurant is perfect.. Cant say as i have ever been to any restaurant multiple times that i havnt gotten something that wasnt good as it should be. Good specials to choose from, Good prices, friendly staff. U Won't be disappointed. Do wish they would turn up the lights just a bit though sometimes can't see the menu it's so dark.

Text: The Chop House offers a very upscale experience for super reasonable lunch prices. My family and I always go out of our way to stop by this Chop House when driving through Lexington. The restaurant is extremely elegant, however we have often showed up after a day of hiking in athletic clothing and been welcomed all the same. Lunch will stay easily under 10 dollars for a generous helping of delicious food. If Chili is their soup of the day then it is a must try!

Text: Went to the Chop House last Friday for my husband's birthday. He ordered a NY Strip and I  ordered a Rib Eye. My steak had to be the worst steak I have ever had. The texture was like  TV dinner steak (mealy) and didn't even taste like a steak. My husband showed me all the gristle on his steak. This was the 1st time we both left part of a steak uneaten as it was so bad. The salad and baked potato fortunately were good so we didn't go home hungry.  Really poor.
