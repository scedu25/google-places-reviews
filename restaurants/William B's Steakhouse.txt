Text: This by far was a very delicious and well prepared dinner from the appetizer to the main course which was surf & turf (Alaskan king crab legs accompanied by 7 oz. Filet Mignon). Our waitress Barb was superior and was very knowledgeable of the entire and very helpful in selection of food from the menu. Me and my wife have dinned across America and this truly a REMARKABLE dining experience. Thank you all for making my wife's birthday a pleasant and memorable occasion.

Text: I'd say it's the most overrated corporate-run steakhouses I've run into. I've been here a few times over the years and have been caught off-guard by the lack of attention-to-detail, service, or food quality for the price their asking. I steer clear from this place nowadays and feel my money can be best spent elsewhere for a high-class night out.

Text: My boyfriend's friend recommended this place for us. The place is really small and dark but good thing that we got there in time, no wait! He ordered me the Scallop of the special and it was so so amazingly good! Felt like in heaven, ha. He ordered himself a Salmon and it was really good too.

Text: I ate there two days ago. Thought it was great prime rib. Until I started  feeling ill. I ended up with full blown food poisoning!  I had diarrhea,  and sick all night long. I ended up in the E.R. they were going to put me on I.V.s because I was so dehydrated! Never again will I eat here! I only wonder about the other people that ate that night....  My Dr. Said it was most definitely  un safe food handling.  Worst sick I've ever been in my life!!  Yuck!! I hope you change somthing! Make better cooking choices!  The only reason  you got one star, is waiter was awesome.
