Text: So delightful. I come here every year for my birthday and is always my top pick for a Fairfield restaurant in the evening. Great food and good prices. Our server tonight was phenomenal as well. I highly recommend Amore Mio.

Text: The owner was welcoming, he treated my girlfriend and I as if we were family. We talked about  the culture of Italy, Malta and other surrounding country's. The food presentation was delicate. The taste of each meal course was well blended, crafted, and a natural fresh homemeal taste. The owner was knowledgeable. It is an experience of a lifetime. You should go it's worth the drive and talk to the owner he will make your night phenomenal.

Text: Very disappointed. I brought my family here as a gift to my brother for graduation. The veal was literally rubber. So bad we sent back. My brothers dish was so off putting he had to drench with parmesan to eat. The first waitress was very informative and lacked any real knowledge of the menue. She would constantly guess and not verify. By the time we were done we paid close to 100 bucks for a meal we hated. Not impressed and this is the last chance I'm giving them.
