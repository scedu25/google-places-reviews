The Watering Hole

Text: Very slow service. Prepare yourself for a long wait - even when it's not Game Day. We placed an order for one small wing plate and an appetizer. We waited more than hour, and only after notifying our waiter, we were told it would be another 15 minutes before we would receive our food. We promptly left.

Text: Food (as long as its not the wings) and service was good. Their wings are over priced and are not that great. Atmosphere was good.

Text: Good food, good service, friendly people, stiff drinks.  If you are snooty stay away. This is a working man & woman's Watering Hole.
