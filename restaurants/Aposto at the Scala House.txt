Text: Splash still does a great job. I have been here several times over the years and have never been disappointed. The oysters, on the half shell or fried, or always great. Try the cheese/ meat board also. Any fish dish has been great.

Text: I have dreams about this pasta!  The texture, the taste, the sauce. . . You name it, the pasta has it. Plus the atmosphere; it feels like you have been invited in yo this little Italian home to have dinner with friends.  From the staff to the owner, I just loved everyone there.  And did I mention the food?!!!  You gotta go there!!  Only down fall is that you can't make a reservation online.  Hopefully that's coming soon!
