Text: A great meal and service while visiting our son at UCM. After the football game we decided to try a new spot. Glad we did! Fried pickles, buffalo chicken sandwich, fish & chips and cookie sundae were fabulous. We will be back for sure.

Text: This is one of our favorite places.  The restaraunt has the best view and catches really nice sun sets.  The food is always good and reasonably priced, and it's like the only place in the nation to get a Pepsi for under $2. ?  The inside decor is nice also.  It's a comfortable, yet nice atmosphere.
