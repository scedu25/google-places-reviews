Text: It's better than south park but it's getting a little run down. Would like to see some new stores. Still a decent time shopping.

Text: Nice clean mall. Not a lot of empty storefronts. A little dated but not too bad. Good variety of stores.

Text: A nice variety of stores. But they could use more security guards inside & outside in the parking lot.

Text: Northpark is a fairly diverse place to shop and generally hang out. Most Vine Vera kiosk workers have been known to be very obnoxious and will try to follow you a couple feet to get you to take a sample when you tell them no, I'm surprised they haven't been told to leave yet. I also wish there were more alternative stores, no specific ones come to mind but once Hot Topic stopped catering to the Goth subculture I sort of lost a big clothing supplier.

Text: Decent mall with large chain department stores, and chain boutique stores. Medium sized food court. Clean and security-conscious, including parking lot. Never had a problem shopping there in 30 years.
