Text: This place had good food and quick service. The staff was friendly, restraunt clean and comfortable.  There is a lot of tables spread over 3 rooms so there was no wait for seating. There was a large selection of pizzas, appetizers, sandwich choices and Greek cuisine available.

Text: Although I haven't had very many friendly waitresses, the food is really good! I appreciate the gluten free pizza they offer. I was dismayed to be told that they didn't offer ANY children's portions or meals!
