Text: I've wanted to stop in for the last few years and finally did this week. We thought the meat was very good, and came back a couple days later to get more. The burnt ends were "melt in your mouth" good.

Text: If you want some good down-home barbecue like Mom used to make this is the place for you! For years I drove by this place always thinking they were only open on Saturdays. I now go here almost weekly for their burnt ends and beans. Nicest folks you'll ever meet
