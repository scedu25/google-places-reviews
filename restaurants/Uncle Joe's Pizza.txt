Text: Pizza was just ok, woman at the counter was extremely rude.  We had our 4 children with us and ordered 2 pizzas to go and then decided to eat-in after the pizza was ready as it is a small island and there is not much here.  Apparently that was not ok because she was very short and rude after delivering our pizzas and glared at us the whole time we ate. Love middle bass but sorry uncle joes-you do not have out vote for island life!
