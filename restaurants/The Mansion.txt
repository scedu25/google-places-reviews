Text: Giving this two stars only because the service was good, friendly staff and great ambiance. 

That being said, the food is blah at best and WAY overpriced for comparable restaurants.  Party of two with drinks and meals was $140 plus tip.  I have no problem paying for good food, but for this price range  it has to knock my socks off, and this one missed the mark by a long shot.  

 Other places like Cleveland-Heath and Hemingway's Zen Garden produce incredible meals for about 1/3 less cost if not even greater savings and amazing food.
