Ophelia's Cup
Rating: 4
Text: Fresh food. One of the best places in town for good quality food. They could improve on the garnishing of the salads, as they were primarily lettuce and quite sparse. Otherwise, good. Coffee is pretty decent.

Text: Used to be my all time favorite place to eat when jess waa there she cared about the customers and extended great service I sat in dining area 15 to 20mins no one came and said a word then I came to counter and then he took my order so I just got it to go didn't apologize for the misunderstanding or anything so I believe this was my last trip to Ophelias cup.  

Thanks in advance
