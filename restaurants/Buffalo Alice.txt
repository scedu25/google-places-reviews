Text: Came here for the 1st time on a Saturday for lunch. Ordered a pizza and had a few drinks while we waited. Apparently they had burnt our pizza and the owner came out asking what she could do to make it right- offered us a gift card if we were in a hurry or would throw in another for us if we wanted to wait. Decided to wait and were glad we did! Best pizza that I've had in Sioux City. Been looking for a good thin crust pizza and finally found one. To top it off, they insisted we not pay for the pizza or any of our drinks! I'm sold. Will definitely be back.

Text: I love that place so much. They serve good food. And I am best friends with the owner there (even the staff members).
