Text: If you are up around Smithville Lake, here is a place to stop at. They serve some killer burgers...and the rest of the menu is pretty good as well! The staff is always helpful and super friendly. They have most of the little things on the selves you find out you forgot at home after you get to the lake (if your camping trips go like mine) and live bait (worms & minnows) and some fishing tackle (mostly for catching bass or crappie...not a lot o f catfish tackle)!

Text: Perfect little local station. Good American food and a perfect stop point, by the lake to stock up on food, gas, and beer before heading out for a day on the lake.
