Justus Drugstore - A Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Best restaurant in KC since I've moved here.  I had a first date two nights ago and neither of us were familiar with the area, so we ended up at this restaurant and it was the perfect setting for a date.  We sat outside on the patio and the staff was literally amazing.  Food was so good, it melted in my mouth.. We had the steak and best steak in KC by far.  I will def. be back.  This is a must try in KC!!!

Text: Recommend the outdoor patio. Food was fresh and had great flavor. Bottles of wine were a great price. Ordered a couple locally sourced hamburgers and a cheese plate. Ordered them med-rare, unfortunately, beef was overcooked. Enjoyed the atmosphere.

Text: The food was good but there were issues. The ceviche was bland. The service was slow. Our entrees we're very good. For the price I was a bit disappointed. It was good but won't make the drive again.

Text: Always a treat for the mouth and the soul.  Each course brings a Wow or an oh my or just a moan from everyone I go with.  And I love the more casual atmosphere and the opportunity to explore the little shops nearby.  Friendly people and 5 star dining.  Doesn't get much better.  And don't miss the one of a kind cocktails.  Girl in the Fireplace. Yum

Text: Excellent food! We sat on the bar/ casual side and had the specials (blackened catfight over risotto and braised ox tail with vegetables and polenta).  Both dishes were delicious, the cocktails were excellent, and the carrot cake beignets were to die for!
