Chenoa Family Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Quality clean and proper slaughter house.  I use then often and have recommended them every opportunity I get.  

Great people, great product.  If you're going somewhere else, Chenoa is probably better.  They're that good.  (Speaking for the farm or customer side)

Text:  I'm kind of biased because, like most of the customers here, I've been eating here since I was in diapers. My whole family goes here. It's a small town family restaurant. The food is pretty good, the wait staff is usually pretty good and the atmosphere isn't bad either. Lots of older locals like to hang out here and drink coffee and gossip or tell stories about when they were younger. It's a nice place to stop if you're traveling.

Text: For being a family diner in the middle of "nowhere" IL, I was actually pretty impressed. The menu is extremely large, with a great variety of options for everyone. We were a party of 4 and each ordered a different entree, and everyone enjoyed their meals. The service was extremely prompt and the portions are large.

Text: The best things I've ordered here have been the cabbage soup and the appetizer sampler.  Not good quality steak meat and the crepes tasted like paper.  They do have a large menu including waffles and many kinds of tasteless crepes, though.
