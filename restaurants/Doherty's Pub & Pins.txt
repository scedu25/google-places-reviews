Doherty's Pub & Pins
Rating: 3
Text: Doherty's is a pub. The atmosphere is friendly and casual. This is not a fine dining restaurant and the food is only passable. They do have a couple of large rooms suitable for meetings and/or parties. Prices are reasonable.

Text: Very good selection of craft & bottle beers. Great pub fare with O'Paddy melt, various styles of horseshoes & burgers. Our waitress was on top of things & clearly enjoys her job & her connection with diners.

Text: It was okay. They had decent priced drinks,like beer specials,which was good,and the selection of beer was also very accommodating and a factor that would make me choose to return. The place smelled like mold/mildew but i figured it's a pub so oh well(TURNS OUT it just used to be a bowling alley...i'm not from the area so I had no clue!). I ordered the steak(i dont know why i ordered steak from an irish pub but i was in the mood for it) which was a mis-steak,i got it medium rare,and i guess it was?but it had no sear whatsoever on the outside,was a weird pinky color outside and in,and tasted kind of hamburger-y. I ate it anyway as I didnt want to upset my date nor our waitress(because she was very polite).

My boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon which I tried and it was delicious(first time i've ever tried fish),and we got a combo as our appetizer(we picked fried pickles,mozz sticks,and garlic bread)and they were all very good as well! Over all,i'll probably end up going again sometime since it's in town,and they were very friendly.
