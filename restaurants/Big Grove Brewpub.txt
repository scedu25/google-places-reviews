Text: We just had the most amazing date night at Big Grove! Food was out of this world. Loved the new summer menu. And our server Gabriel was on point! He made sure everything was perfect. Most enjoyable night out in a long time. I will be speaking very highly of Big Grove to anyone who will listen.

Text: A couple things.  One, this place is easily one of the best restaurants in the Midwest.  From the service to the food, it is top notch.  Second, we had them cater cheesecakes for our wedding recently.  Abe and his team did out of this world cheesecakes and spent the time to plate and design them.  He made our wedding very special!  Thanks again Big Grove!

Text: What a great addition to the downtown Iowa City area! We loved Big Grove's first restaurant located in Solon, so we were thrilled to hear about their expansion closer to our Iowa City home! They have a huge location with lots of seating, which is great because they are always busy. They have two bars and plenty of severs, so even when it's busy you still get good service. Indoor they have several TVs if you're trying to catch a game, and outdoor they have lots of patio seating a several fire pits for cozy nighttime fun! Their beer and cocktails are really great too! They offer both tap craft beer and a full bar! We have yet to try the food at this location, but if it's anything like their Solon restaurant, then I'm sure it is delicious! I highly recommend everything Big Grove. You don't want to miss this new Iowa City hot spot!

Text: Cool local brewery with a good atmosphere. There brews and one of a kind mix drinks are always refreshing. The food menu has many traditional foods on it with unique twists. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are always busy which means it tends to be a little loud inside. However it is still a fun place to go with friends for a beer.
