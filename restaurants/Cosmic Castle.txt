Text: I am from out of town so I was sticking close to my residence when I first started exploring Parsons. The first place I ate at was Cosmic Castle and I was blown away by how great they are. I had the cosmic dog and it was wonderful. I also had a chocolate malt with homemade whipped cream, and that was amazing. I haven't had a chance to walk throguh their gaming area, but if it's anything like their food, then I have no doubt in its superior quality. Great people, Great food, Great service.
