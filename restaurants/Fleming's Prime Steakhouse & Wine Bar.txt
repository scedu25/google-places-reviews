Text: What a way to spend our anniversary dinner!  The food was incredible as was the service.  Our server, Lauren, was friendly and attentive but, allowed us the personal time to enjoy our dinner and conversation.  The filet was prepared perfect and served beautifully.  It was an incredible dinner and an perfect night.

Text: Service was horrible, waited twenty minutes for a glass of water. It never came we left and went to 801 chophouse. Waste of time, don't care if the food is good, bad, or in between if the service is bad the experience is bad. Will never return and will steer everyone clear. I only gave it one star because I didn't have the choice to give it none.
