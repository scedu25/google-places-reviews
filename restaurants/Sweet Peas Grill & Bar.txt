Sweet Peas Grill & Bar

Text: Excellent tasting food and great environment; highly recommended! My wife ate the Gibby (pork tenderloin) and coleslaw while I had the beer battered chicken tenders with BBQ sauce (on the side) and waffle fries. The tenders and fries were seasoned perfectly and DID NOT need sauce or ketchup - crispy and tasty as prepared!!  Did not give all stars because slow on the drink refill.

Text: Always love coming here.  They didn't have my favorite item on the menu, so I asked them about it.  The waitress checked and said I could have it.  WONDERFUL!

Text: Sweet peas is our favorite restaurant in town.  Its a comfortable, family friendly place to dine.  Not to mention, the food is delicious!  The staff is great and the manager always makes sure we are being taken care of.  Make sure you try the gumbo!

Text: Alot of fried food but it's good. They have clams! The server said they are revamping the menu can't wait to see how it changes. Good service.

Text: The food was great. Had the chicken gumbo soup and the pretzel chicken sandwich was awesome. The draft beer was really good too. Had a few selections of local craft.
