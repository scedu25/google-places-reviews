Text: Charming place with great staff. We were looking for a good steak and found good reviews of this place. Unfortunately the steak was flavorless and chewy. To their credit, the portions were generous, the beer was cold, and the staff very attentive. I'd give it another try, but try another plate. 
We also tried the duck. Very large portion, for duck, and a tasty side of veggies. The fruit reduction was a bit overpowering, but the plate was very satisfying.

Text: Had a great experience here tonight, after many other good trips. 
Great food, great drinks, attentive staff. 
What put things over the top tonight was a staff member noticing our Cubs gear, and inquired if we were going to the game. We were, and he promptly gave us 10 tickets for our whole group to the game. Completely unexpected, but so much appreciated. 
Thanks again Court Ave for helping make a great night!

Text: We just stopped in for drinks.  Great service and wonderful martinis!  It looks like a great place for a group outing.  Since I'm not sure how the food is I didn't give it 5 stars.

Text: A quite old school brewery.  When many other spots in downtown Des Moines were bustling on marathon weekend, this place was quite with just a few couples watching some college football.  We got a beer at the bar and had a nice conversation with the beer tender.

Text: The overweight female bar manager is totally incompetent. As a manager of 25 years she leaves a lot to be desired. It is now wonder that EVERY member of the staff hate her.  Sunni and the rest of the staff are great.
