Text: Fair price, reasonably decent food.  I usually get the all you can eat bar when I go there as in usually in a hurry. I have never been unhappy.  There are a few minor things,  like occasionally, they have ran out of some items, but usually it's been fine.

Text: Phenomenal food and friendly service. I recommend the steak and eggs; my only complaint is they no longer serve my favorite appetizer, the fried ravioli!
