Text: The Spot is nostalgic first and foremost!! Shiloh home used to be a railroad station and other different restaurants. As for Shiloh, great sports bar with great food choices, and kid friendly. Their patio is one of the best in town. Take time to visit and enjoy your favorite game with smiles.

Text: Have been here several times for lunch. Service and food were great. However, today we waited 20minutes on the patio, watched the servers come in and out, even made eye contact, still, 20 minutes later, no service. We left. it's a shame as we were starting to like the place...

Text: Total College bar, but with good service and bartenders who don't have attitude.  Sat at the bar and observed - a lot.  I enjoyed the buffalo chicken pizza and some IPA. The place with filled with raucous St Louis Cards fans who were watching their team on opening day, so there was a special energy going on.  Loved it.  Will go back next time I'm in COMO.
