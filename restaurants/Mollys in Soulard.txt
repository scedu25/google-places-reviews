Mollys in Soulard

Text: Was told it was going to be a 15-20 minute wait and proceeded to wait an hour and we're told that it would be another 15 minutes before we would be seated and another hour before the kitchen would be ready to serve us. At no point during our wait were we told that these were the circumstances even though the manager later said that the kitchen had been backed up since 4 PM. Since we arrived at 6:50 PM, if that was the case, that information should have been told to us before we decided to wait there for the initial estimated wait of 15-20 minutes.

I will update my rating once I am actually able to eat the food.

Text: Beautiful patio and restaurant. The food was pricey and a little disappointing. I had their signature burger (I can't remember what its called). It was underwhelming for $12. Ok selection of canned beer, with some local brew. No taps though. The waiter was very friendly and service was fast once I was seated, and he even brought my dog ice water.

Text: Very good service for our group of 12.  Server was very experienced and listened well.  Food was great as well.

Text: We had Hurricane drinks. They made them differently to what I was used to which concerned me, but they turned out very tasty.  We had the BLT and Molly burger for lunch.  The Burger was very tasty!  The BLT was quite bland and difficult to eat - it kept falling apart.  They should have toasted the bread a bit more.  The patio was a nice escape for a beautiful Saturday afternoon.

Text: Great New Orleans-style food in a neighborhood that feels like the French Quarter. Really cool patios for outdoor dining.
