Bella Italia
Rating: 5
Text: The food was simply amazing, zesty and had the "real" Italian flavor and ambiance. Mark and his wife were very cordial and humble in their ways. This restaurant will put the big city establishment to shame. If you are anywhere near Cozad Nebraska you owe it to yourself to try their gastronomic delight.

Text: We went to Bella Italia as a group of nine.  The owner was our waitress and very friendly.   The food was absolutely wonderful.   It was different than what you can order at other restaurants.   A wonderful asset for the town of Cozad.
