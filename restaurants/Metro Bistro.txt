Text: I love this restaurant! I was sitting there eating when reviewer " j c " waited all of 4 minutes for the excellent waiter to return. Here is an impatient man that never worked in a restaurant for sure. The waiter greater his party, took a drink order and 4 min later j c had stormed out the door. Don't believe that review. Food is great, owner cares and always a perfect meal. They have a diverse casual well priced menu that deserves a try. Go eat and enjoy! SE

Text: Waited and waited after being seated. Waiter came for drink order and never came back. We left after waiting for over 15 minutes of being ignored. I can be ignored at home and not have to pay for it.

Text: Would have loved to order food but both employees were out back smoking. Stood inside for over 10 min with no one in the restaurant
