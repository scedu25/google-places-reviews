Text: I have been very Leary about ordering Chinese food..since I have had too many bad experiences, but I have to say, this was one excellent experience ..the food was amazing ..delivered quickly and very friendly person on the phone..I will definitely be ordering from here again ..if you like egg foo young ...it was to die for..I had the shrimp egg foo young and it was the best I have had in a long time. I have tried Hong Kong and it doesn't hold a candle to this place ..GREAT JOB !! AND THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT LUNCH!!! I would recommend this place to anyone !!

Text: Gross !!!!  Fried rice is not fried its yellow and tasteless... The egg for young is not cooked right. I spent for the price its not worthy of my money. Or yours never again will I order from them.

Text: Our food arrived quickly, but lacked taste, had no quality, and one of the entrees arrived spilt all over the bag. The egg drop soup was unlike any egg drop soup if ever had before. It has the consistency of syrup, bright orange, and had no flavor. The "fried rice" wasn't fried rice at all, instead is was yellow saffron rice with vegetables. The beef and broccoli was covered in a sticky, overly sweet sauce. I wouldn't recommend eating here to my worst enemy.
