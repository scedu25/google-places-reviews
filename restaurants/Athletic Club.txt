Text: Came here for a bite to eat after reading the reviews and seeing a picture of the fresh ground burgers. Decided to give the turkey burger a try and it was delicious. Made fresh and a two hand burger. Just passing through town and stayed one night. Very pleased with the food and the bartender. I recommend.

Text: Let me start off by saying this is a great place to watch sports with a good crowd; I do appreciate that Charleston has this unique  experience available, there are not many other places in the valley that can even compete.  

Which is why it makes it so much worse that the service here is absolutely, unforgivingly terrible. Seated in front of the big screen, wearing team colors, our waitress brings out our food at the start of the second quarter and disappears until the end of halftime to bring us... the check?! She explains her shift is over and would like to cash us out. Sympathetic to her situation, we pay our bills and leave our tips with the understanding that someone else will soon be taking over our table. Only no one ever does. And the waitress never leaves. We were never checked on for the remaining hours we were there. 

Simply, this was an inexcusable situation that makes me question going here ever again.

Text: Happy hour deals great food a lil high but the staff always takes care of you. Oh and any sporting event you want they prolly have it.
