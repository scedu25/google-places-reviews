Text: My smoking hot girlfriend said she "loves going there." I also agree. The wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable of each item on the menu. And our server was able to make recommendations of what we wanted. Jen had lobster tail. I had shrimp and scallop longuini. And we both had a couple awesome drinks. We're going back for sure!

Text: One of the best rib eye steaks I've had in a long time. Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. The piano player was great as I tried to guess every song in the first 30 seconds like "Name That Tune".

Text: Decided to try this place out when searching for a nice restaurant to celebrate me and my wife's anniversary. Was pleasantly suprised, steaks were the best we've had in a long time. Our server, Kate was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was perfect for a night away with my wife. Will be back for sure.

Text: EXCELLENT service! There was a misunderstanding with seating, the manager personally came over and apologized.  He comped us 2 appetizers and a round of drinks!  The steaks were some of the best I've had in a while.   My ribeye was cooked to perfection.   We can't wait to go back!

Text: Came in very close to close on Eclipse Night and sat at the bar for drinks and dessert. Our bartender was so nice and he hustled up our stuff even though it had clearly been a busy night! The desserts were actually really good, would definitely order the sundae with bacon again, the bacon was literally perfect!
