Ragin Cajun Piano Bar

Text: Not a bad place to have a drink. We sat outside, so the music was just at the perfect noise level. Their musicians are fairly talented.  Food could have been a bit more authentic from a Cajun perspective.

Text: What an awesome place! We decided to do a bar hope in Alton last night and of the 5 or 6 bars we went to this one my favorite. Can't really rate the food as we were not there to eat. But the service was fast and the atmosphere was great. It was just what we were looking for, so much so that it's the one place we hit twice in the same night. The dueling pianos with the sing alongs were right up our alley. I can't wait for when our older children come home to visit so we can bring them here.

Text: It was my first time here. And, enjoyed it. The food was delicious. Steak cooled exactly like I asked for. Not, to mention it is a piano bar come on down to this joint. A little piece of New Orleans in Alton Illinois!

Text: My 1st time here was amazing! The food was wonderful. I had the Blackened Chicken Penne pasta. It was so big I needed a to go box. There was a live band here tonight on a Friday. The band took requests and played our songs extraordinarily. I will be back. Oh did I mention the Mardi Gras theme. If actually felt like I was in the French Quarter w/o the added smell.
