Miles Lab - The Burger Bar at Bulldog Crossing

Text: I have had items from the menu that I love and some that were not that impressive.  They have smallish bar area that is always packed and a bit loud but most of the tables are not usually full in the regular seating.  Seems more like a local hang than a place with excellent food...that being said the last time I was there the food was excellent and the waitress was terrific.

Text: Sort of strange location but once we found out the history of the place, it didn't matter at all. The food was great from soup to burgers and fries. Staff was very king and service was reasonably quick.

Text: Nice surprise to find this place. Good variety of food and very imaginative burgers. Nice bar too. Only complaint is food took a while to come out.
