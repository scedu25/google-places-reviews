Text: One of our family's all time favorite burger joints! Been patrons for 35+ years. Held our rehearsal dinner here. And so did our daughter! Excellent service, unique, family-friendly atmosphere! You must check them out!

Text: This is a landmark in New Buffalo. Hamburgers, beer, french fries. Friendly service. Waitress very pleasant and helpful. It did not fail to please us. The burgers are fresh and tasty. Fries are plentiful and you will not leave hungry. Great place and expect to wait depending on when you get there. Worth. Now I can say I've been here.

Text: This place is legendary for nostalgia. If you're over 45 and you did the diner thing, probably awesome.

But, if you're not pining for a burger and a flick and a Dame, you're probably going to be dissatisfied with this place and this food. It's really sub-par by almost any other standard. If you're looking for a great burger at a good price, five guys is a way, way better option. If you're looking for delicious specialty, there's a butcher shop like two blocks away. If you're looking for a fun place to do a family sit-in...well, this MIGHT be alright.

Also everything was cold.

Text: Will definitely visit again if we are in the area. Great burgers with that homemade taste. Extremely quick service and friendly staff.  Prices are more than reasonable.

Text: While visiting relatives in Northern Indiana, we drove over to eat at Redamak's, which we had heard about from them for several years.  We were not disappointed! We all enjoyed either hamburgers or cheeseburgers & had to split 2 orders of hot French fries between the two couples because the baskets were so large.  Definitely will visit again when in the area!
