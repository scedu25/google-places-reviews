Text: Really nice service and you get a good amount of food for cheap. The desserts are also really good. I plan on trying to go here more.

Text: This place used to be hit and miss, now its miss and miss.  Service is painfully slow no matter how little patrons are there.  The food is less than stellar and the past few times I've been multiple dishes have been incorect for my table.  How can a place be so careless and inconsistent?  There have been better places in Muhlenberg county that have closed, why is this place still managing to stay open?   Overrated.
