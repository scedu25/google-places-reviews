Text: Server was great. Friendly and talkative... Food was eh. You get straight olive oil basically to dip your bread in, pretty gross. Mussels were mediocre, as was main entree. For the price, you're better off at any other restaurant damn near. First time finally eating at one of these places I see commercials for constantly, and I have no desire to go back. Invest more in your food rather than your advertisements my advice. Like I said though, great service!
