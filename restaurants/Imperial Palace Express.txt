Text: I have been eating here for the last 18 years, and I cannot say that I have had a single bad experience in that timeframe.  I recommend the Mongolian Beef, and pick up a side order of pot stickers for good measure.

Text: I moved to Grand Island recently from Omaha, and maybe I'm picky because I'm used to having good chinese food back home, but this place is AWFUL. I had an Imperial Palace by my old office in Omaha and they generally had FANTASTIC food, so I was really excited that there was one here in GI. Not for long. I've given this place 3 tries, and I've tried a couple different thing. The last time I ate there, I actually got physically ill from the food, I had to stop eating it, that's how bad it was. Everything is old. The sauces don't taste like they do at other places (including other imperial palaces), the soda is always terrible. It's extremely quick, i'll give them that, but apparently that means they lose the quality. Don't eat here. I'm giving Peking Palace a try today to see if it's any better. I suggest you do the same.
