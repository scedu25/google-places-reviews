Text: First off... I NEVER write reviews. However, this place is so amazing and I want to make sure it stays around! Fantastic service and some of the best BBQ I've had in the KC area. I've tried about all of them and I'd put Smoked Creations squarely in the top 3 of all KC! Very reasonable prices and definitely worth the drive from wherever you are!

Text: I just don't know where to start. I've been coming here at least every other week for almost 3 years. There has never been an "off day". The food is great, every time. The staff is great, every time. The prices are great as well. I've tried a good portion of the menu, and it's all great. The pulled pork with the hot barbecue sauce is so good, it took me a while to try other dishes. You wouldn't expect to be surprised by something as simple as cole slaw, but leave it to smoked creations. Claudia took care of me on my most recent visit, and was amazing. Smoked creations is all that and a bag of homemade chips!

Text: Our waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere here was adorable and comfortable. They have a lot of TVs to view the local games from. The food here was excellent and they had a great beer selection. I love seeing a busy BBQ restaurant with CLEAN bathrooms!
