La Cascada Inc

Text: Decent Mexican food, but nothing to brag about. Portion sizes for the price is ok, but isn't a wonderful deal. Not a lot of parking. Kind of cramped dining area. The cashier where you pay is in the foyer and is the only way in or out of the restaurant. Often people are stumbling over each coming in, going out, and standing in line to pay their bill. Very bad design and setup.
