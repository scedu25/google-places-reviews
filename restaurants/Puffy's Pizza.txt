Text: We tried the pickle cheese sticks with marinara sauce the first time. It was the best cheese sticks I've tried. The people are friendly and the food is delicious. They have buffet for the lunch rush, or order off the menu and sit back and relax and talk for a few minutes. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing.
