Text: Quaint little place. The good was very good and the drinks were not badly priced. I went on a night they were having a comedy show. The cost...a whopping $5! It was a great time!

Text: This is becoming my favorite place for lunch downtown. An exceptional menu of selections (including the *fantasic* Santa Fe Skillet Rice) that won't leave you hungry -- or broke. Top-shelf meals, with everything priced under $9. Great servers and staff as well!
