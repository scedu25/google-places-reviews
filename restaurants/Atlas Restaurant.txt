Atlas Restaurant

Text: Love the tomato bisque and my husband loves the Buffalo Chicken wrap. Their Thanksgiving burrito is a must - wish they served it all day for longer period of time as we often just miss it when we are back in town to visit family for the holidays. Good cocktails also.

Text: I used to absolutely love coming to Atlas regularly when I first came to Iowa City. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed every visit since the new ownership has taken over. I'm not necessarily suggesting that this is the reason for the decline of the restaurant, but I noticed it started when they took over. Service has gone downhill, and the food/specials just aren't as good. Also since the new management took over I haven't received my birthday club notification, what gives?

Text: Ordered a very well presented Kale and Strawberry salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. Had shrimp as an add-in, which were beautifully filleted.  Light red onion and pistachios added a nice texture and crunch.   

Treated myself to a fantastic Old Fashioned on a whim.   Sat outside.. three wait staff were responsive,   courteous and knowledgeable (not their names...) they each demonstrated exemplary teamwork and hospitality. 

It was reasonably priced considering the exceptional service, creative menu, comfortably elegant place setting with a city sidewalk lunch atmosphere...

Was recommended by a foodie friend and I wasn't disappointed.

Text: Fantastic food!  Wish I lived closer so I could eat here every week!  Their version of a pancake is the best I've had in a long time, especially covered with strawberries.  The service could have been better, the server was slow and unfriendly as was the person who sat us but it is to be expected in a college town.

Text: Great service at the bar.  Atmosphere is very cool in and out.  Unique wine, beer and cocktail list.  Apps, main dishes or small plates, it's all great!
