Cemeno's Pizza

Text: Pizza was really good but it’s very expensive.  I paid $55 and one pizza came entirely wrong.  I ordered sausage, onion and green pepper with extra sauce, and delivered was a pizza with little sauce, olive, garlic and mushroom.  It tasted good, but when you’re paying that much, you expect your food to be correct.

Text: Delicious food for our company luncheon today. Bob was our delivery guy, and he brought everything to our basement lunchroom, too. Everyone was helpful, polite and professional from ordering to confirming to delivery. Also, if you're planning a party, be sure to get the Mac n Cheese as a side dish - it was everyone's favorite! Thanks Cemeno's for making our company lunch a HUGE success! We'll be back for sure.

Text: Great food and very friendly service. We scouted this place for a rehearsal dinner and they were very very accommodating. Both the pizza and pasta are fantastic. Can't wait for our upcoming dinner.
