Text: Should've just ordered pizza, hard to mess that up. For the price I really didn't think I'd get dry, over cooked, burnt food. Tasted like it all came out of a can or freezer bag. No flavor. Waitresses were friendly but made my friend uncomfortable. Kept staring the WHOLE time. Really wanted to like this place but I can't really find anything good or decent to say about it. The side salad was OK. Save your money and cook at home. It will be much better and actually edible. I don't even think my dog would eat it and he eats everything. I wish I could give a zero. Worst restraunt experience I've ever had in my life. Won't let me upload a picture at the moment or I would.

Text: Absolutely the best pizza ever.
Have returned a few times already just on the short trip I'm on lunch specials are fantastic and the brick oven does its job very well the flavor that's brought up by the brick oven for the pizza is fantastic the thin crust is perfect and all of the ingredients toppings selections seem to be well paired I recommended with an Italian Chianti

Text: The pizza was great!  Awesome crisp bread crust.  I had Lasagna per the server's recommendation as they were out of scallops.  The pizza was so much better.  Good green chilled house salad add for $3.95. Crisp,  chilled and fresh.   I gave it a 4 star because service was terrible.  Although she was accommodating,  she was crabby,  slow and inattentive.  I met the female owner.  She was awesome.
