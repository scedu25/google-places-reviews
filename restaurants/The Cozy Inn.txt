Text: This is such a neat little place. If you don't like onions, you better suck it up. It adds great flavor. It's a very small environment, but everyone working was very nice.

Text: Do not go to this place unless you eat onions. All burgers are made with onions and there are no exceptions. It is not a set down place. The guy who was working was not very polite. Basically all they have is cans of pop, chips, and very tiny burgers. Not at all a place I would ever recommend. It is definitely a one of a kind place though. Not at all what I was expecting.

Text: The burgers.  Oh my goodness the burgers.  Simple, cheap, effective.  If you're driving along i-70 and need to stretch your legs and grab some food it is a short jaunt into town that is WELL worth the time.  It's been around for ~90 years and I hope it will be around for 90 more.  Phenomenal experience!

Text: Excellent hamburgers!!! Definitely worth the wait.  On a road trip from San Diego to Missouri.  Wanted to have something different than regular drive thru choices.  Cute very tiny little building.  Only 3 people working. The girl on the griddle cooking the burgers did an excellent job making these hamburgers!!  Thank you!

Text: For all the hype surrounding this restaurant, I was thoroughly disappointed when I was finally able to get there. The place is definitely unique and one-of-a-kind, and it has that nostalgia feel about it, so they do have that going for them. My issue is that they charge entirely too much money for one of these teeny tiny little burgers. That, and they tend to burn easily. And The Taste quality isn't even that good.
