Parisi's Ristorante Italiano
Rating: 1
Text: Went for dinner on Friday before a home game.  Checked the website menu out before going--food choices looked great and we were all excited.  Oh, says the waiter, we have a limited menu on game day weekends--"hello"---no one bothered to tell us that when we called for reservations two days ahead of time.  Food was bland and waiter "seemed like he could not have cared less"--too busy serving birthday cake to the large party next to us--I observed the service and watched him place his thumb in the middle of the cake plates one after another.  It has been a long time since I have given a 0 dollar tip.

Text: My wife and I stopped into Parisi restaurant for our 17th wedding anniversary. This was the best dinner we had in a long time. We were greeted as we were family. The service was exceptional as was the food. I would recommend if you are looking for a elegant dinner and fabulous staff stop at Parisi 's  for your next dinner.
