Text: I would not recommend this place. The service was terrible and the food wasn't much better! I was ignored once I received my food. The waitress, who didn't even think brushing her hair this morning before work was necessary, was rarely seen. I had to wait until she came out of hiding to pay for my food. Definitely not worth stopping and paying money to eat here.
