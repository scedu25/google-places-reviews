Text: This is a cozy and comfortable restaurant to dine.   Their food is always so good.  Their lasagna is wonderful.   Their deep fried shrimp and fresh lake pickeral is great.  Fresh, not frozen.  All their pasta sauces are made from scratch.  Yum.

Text: This is a family business that has been passed down from father to son. The pasta is home made and their sauce is their recipe.  They have added on to the building over the years and at times there is still a wait. The reason for the wait is great food and service.

Text: My favorite place for authentic Italian food. I love the platter with chicken parmesan and lasagna. The full serving is big and I always have left overs. They also taste wonderful the next day.
