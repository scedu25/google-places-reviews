Text: Great food and extremely friendly owner. When I pulled in at around 3:00 I noticed the sign that said they closed at 2:00. The owner was in the parking lot and she reopened the restaurant so that my parents and I could eat. She went above and beyond to help us out.

Text: I just went here today with my grandparents, and I rather enjoyed it. The food was great, the service was excellent, for example, I had just noticed my glass was almost empty, and the waitress was almost there within a half second of me even noticing! But, while the outside of the building is quite cool, the inside is a bit, different. I really don't know how to describe it.
