Text: First time to visit this restraunt.  I travel a lot in route sales and it is tough to find simple,  tasty "home cooking. "   Found it here.   Service was great.   Met  Mike and Janet, the owners:  really friendly.  Next time,  I am going to try the smoked chicken or ribs.   They smoke it in house and I missed this dish on menu.... darn it.  Trust me,  drive past the junk food places and enjoy a good meal in a friendly,  clean,  happy environment.
