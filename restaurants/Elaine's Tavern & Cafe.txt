Text: I loved this place because it was about 6 miles from my motel (Black Horse Inn AKA Stubby's) and full bar, good food and friendly service.   Bonus- there's a great life size model turn-of-the-century small town Main Street display. We'll done Winnetoon! Prime rib and steaks on Saturday night. Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park is less than 20 miles away and outstanding!
