Koi Sushi & Japanese Cuisine
Rating: 4
Text: This place has a great selection of sushi on their menu, and I highly recommend sushi lovers come here when they are in the area. But the downside is sometimes service can be lacking, but I've only found it to be during their very busy times, so I recommend coming here when it's a odd time of day. Besides that this place is pretty great, I personally love their Golden Dragon roll, it's so yummy!
