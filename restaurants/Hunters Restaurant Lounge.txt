Text: The food was fantastic hunters nachos, prime rib, vegetable beef soup, duchess potatoes, sweet potatoes fries,home made crab cakes, and my personal favorite creme Brule. All of it was fantastic (i was in a group/not all for me haha) the food was great no complaints, be prepared to pay for it but it is worth it.
