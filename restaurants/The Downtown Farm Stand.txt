Text: I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate you providing my fruit and vegetable party trays last Sunday.  Everyone commented on how beautiful they were and I was sure to tell them I purchased them from you guys.  Please let whomever made the guacamole know that it was the best I have ever had.  Also, I cannot begin to tell you how amazing it was that you were able to deliver it to my event.  Life changing… for real!

Text: Power was out this morning.. Came downtown to get done food and was not disappointed. My Chipotle pork belly sandwich with some legit hummus, made me forget the power was out at home. This is a great local shop. If you're not stopping in here weekly, there's something wrong.

Text: Wholesome eats from their deli, I love their avocado panini with a side of soup. Limited shelf space for groceries means very limited selection, but all the most important foods are there, some fresh produce, bulk grains, dried fruits, coffee. Organic and Fair Trade... If you live near downtown, a very convenient place to shop.

Text: Can be easily overlooked from the outside, nice cool market feel on the inside. I do think that the pricing is a tad overpriced on the food you eat inside, not sure about grocery prices. I know with quality organic items comes a higher price but I think the price level is still a bit high. Decent spot, food, environment, etc.
