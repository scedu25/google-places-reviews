Jerry's Pizza

Text: I still will give it a 5 because it still is the best in Sioux City. That said what and why did you change the crust. No seasoning on the bottom. I have been eating Jerry,s pizza since 1975 when I was a rescue tech on the Woodbury county Rescue Squad. I don't get to eat it often and am very happy you deliver to the Truck stop. Please go back and do the seasoned crust. I'll still order every time I'm in town but sure hope next time it's back to old way.

Text: Spent 40$ plus tip to have cold pizza delivered 20 min late, it wasn't bad after a nuke in microwave but still doesn't change the fact that it wasn't hot ready and on time.

Text: Lost my business! They had a very bad day.  Ordered and they said come pick it up in one half hour.  Got there half hour later and they couldn't find the order.  Started it again while we waited. they said 20 minutes.  One half hour later I said you forgot about us!  Shortly after they offered me to choose a bottle of soda pop for waiting so long.  One hour plus waiting.  Embarrassing to my guests that were there with me to pick up a pizza!
