Text: It's been awhile that we've had a meal at the Chicken Coop not living in GI. Hey, it's still good. We like the openness of the place, great service staff, great menu. TVS abound. I tried the pumpkin ale. I did drink all of it but.. I'm good on that, thanks.lol The pork chop dinner was perfect with the Bourbon sauce. My sides were the hash brown casserole and fire roasted cream corn. And that ale.

Text: Located down town Grand island it gives you the option of enjoying all there is to offer. Chicken Coop has the thunderhead brewery on tap with many great options of wheat beers. The food is great some other best burgers in town my personal favorite is the jacked burger. They do have prime rib on weekends but I have never tried it. If me and the wife are out on the town this is one of are stops before going anywhere else. The service can be a little slow on the weekends because of the large crowds. Over all chicken coop is my favorite place to eat and drink at.
