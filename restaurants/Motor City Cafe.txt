Text: This place is great! So glad I stopped by on my way home from St. Louis. My girlfriend had sloppy joes and I had taco salad. Doesn't sound like much I know, but attention to detail goes into every order here. My meal was great and so was hers as I had to try it. Service was good and friendly too.

Text: I walked here from the small truck stop across the street,  past two empty restaurant buildings, (one has the same name as this place, old location maybe?) Anyway I was hoping for a decent meal.  They sure delivered! My Chicken Salad was a good portion, tender chicken, with a nice crispy breading and my salads Veggies were fresh and satisfying.  The wait staff was friendly.  The restaurant inside was very clean and nicely decorated.  I'd eat here again in a heartbeat.  I might even stay in town for breakfast.

Text: Everything a diner breakfast should be. Almost too much food, bottomless coffee and cheap. The atmosphere was very welcoming and felt more like eating breakfast with all of your neighbors than your run of the mill restaurant
