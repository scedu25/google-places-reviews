Text: I tried several menu items including the nachos, kale salad and "awake" tonic (all delicious).  The waiter was very attentive.  The ambiance is relaxing and they play good music.  I gave the place 4 stars because of the prices.  However, I would come back for the "awake" tonic every day if I worked or lived nearby!

Text: Nice atmosphere and staff. I don't usually eat vegetarian or vegan, but the food here tasted just as good as other style restaurants. We tried the Mac and cheese, chipotle butternut squash soup of the day, and fruitful smoothie. All were good. The mac and cheese was rich and a large serving, so we needed a box. Large menu with lots of drinks including juices and espressos.

Text: I really eat impressed with the theory of this place good food and caring for others. They have an item on the menu that can be purchased for as little as $3. The food is very good. Though the serving sizes are small, I enjoyed my time.

Text: I LOVE Cafe Gratitude! I used to never eat Vegan food, and then girlfriend took me here and I was blown away. I am a big meat eater but the chili soup, lasagna and other dishes that typically MUST have meat, are actually quite delicious. Wine specials are always good too

Text: This place is amazing!! The service is fast and the waiters/waitresses are SO helpful and kind. It usually doesn't take too long for them to prepare the food either. The food is also super tasty! And the best part is that it's all plant based!
