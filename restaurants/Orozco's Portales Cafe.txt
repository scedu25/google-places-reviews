Text: We got there 30 minutes before closing, the menu said they turn off the grill 20 minutes before closing at 7pm. By the time the waitress got back to our table with beverages and to take our fiod orders the grill had been shut down.  We were very disappointed as all four of us ordered Hamburgers and Cheeseburgers.  When the cook heard our order he quickly restarted it just for us!  The burgers and fries were cooked beautifully!  Will tell others about the great service and the "Best" burgers west of Highway 135!  Thanks for what you did for four tired travelers.

Text: To the people who had the audacity to say "best food in Kansas" or even "best food ever!!!!!", you need to get out more. 
Anyone who thinks this is "Authentic Mexican food" is culturally challenged. 
To the person who claims the staff is "friendly and down to Earth", we have very different definitions of quality service. 
I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Will NOT return.

Text: Looks like a Mexican restaurant they even have the Mexican flag but as far as Mexican food goes it's yet to be found. The menu has a very limited selection. Your choices is burrito, breakfast before 10 AM or hamburgers. Awful food! Awful service. The waitress had the nerve to charge a 20% gratuity on a group of 4.  Don't even waste your time stopping here. Oh and the were out of lemons for the tea and they were out of rice. I ordered a Mexican  plate and it looked like slop. WORST EVER!!!

Text: Not even considered as Mexican food. The service was terrible! Overall it was a bad experience. There was a poor selection on the menu. The pork does not look or taste appetizing. I will not come back here nor recommend this place. Terrible.
