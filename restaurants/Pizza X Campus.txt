Pizza X Campus
Rating: 4
Text: Cheap, and well done for how cheap it is. The service is timely and friendly, and it stays open late for all of you party-goers on campus. Truly a staple and a legend here in the Bloom. One of my favorite places to eat here; the aesthetic just bleeds 'college kid.'

Text: Pizza delivered quickly and have never gotten an order wrong  for me.  They are open very late and offer a lot of different toppings.  I didn't give 5 stars bc the pizza is good but definitely not the best in town.

Text: Love coming here with friends to enjoy a campus classic. Four stars because their pizza isn't really the kind I dig and also kind of expensive.

Text: My wife loves their breadsticks more than she loves me, so that's saying a lot. Or maybe it isn't, not sure.
