Text: Oh my Lord is this THE place for BBQ! All pulled off the bone, and absolutely the BEST! They have a mashed potato salad! Not the yellow, mayo mess that I grew up with. This is phenomenal. Corn pudding! Hello!
Theo was our Rock Star, with great recommendations and great information!!!
Thank you RED STATE!!!

Text: The 1/2 chicken was fall off the bone good! The fries and homemade corn pudding was also good. I was in for the brisket but I think the HUGE amount of traffic that was in there before we arrived at 3:40pm cleaned em out. I'll have to come back another time and try them again.

Text: Incredible BBQ . On our way up “north” from Florida and my friend and I craved some barbecue. We saw the sign on I-75 and went for it. The place didn’t look like much. Boy am I glad we did. Excellent service great food with a roadhouse atmosphere. Beef brisket was excellent and my friends ribs fell off the bone! Great sides.

Text: Simply the best BBQ we've ever had. Dreaming of their ribs, brisket, and peach pudding with bourbon ice cream. My God was that good. Found via Yelp on our 12hr trip home from Mammoth Cave National Park. Fit all the parameters we were looking for. A well priced authenticate BBQ pit with casual dining that appeals to both locals and visitors. I can get down with a place where grandmas kick back some domestic beers, eat with their hands, and lovingly chat about their grandkids.

Text: Brisket is great! Their Alabama sauce is good to be outside the state and really added to the flavour of the smoked chicken. Their Kentucky small batch sauce has a great bourbon finish perfect for the area. Will definitely be back when we come back through this way again.
