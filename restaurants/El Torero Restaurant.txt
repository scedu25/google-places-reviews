Text: Was bared because we did not have money for a good tip. I am retired so going on to eat is not always possible. Thought we were doing ok by going to home town place to eat,but was told not to come back. So if you just got enuff money to eat do not go there it's not for the poor according to money hungry bald waiter!!!!
