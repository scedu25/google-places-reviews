Text: Excellent and fresh items on the salad bar.  Laneta was an excellent server.  I was torn between the French Dip and the Cheesesteak.  I decided on the Cheesesteak, she even got me the Au Jus so I could have the best of both worlds.  Delicious food and a great friendly wait staff that really takes care of you in a nice country atmosphere.
