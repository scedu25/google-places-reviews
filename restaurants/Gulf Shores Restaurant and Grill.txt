Text: The Gator bites were seasoned perfectly. The Crab Cake entree was good, but the only complaint was that they lacked seasoning. Other than that they were full of meat and went well with the sauce. The hush-puppies were great, but i was disappointed when only 5 came on my plate... The twice baked cheesy potato was great and covered in cheese (just to my liking). Overall the service was great, no complaints. Definitely coming back.

Text: Gator taco. Phenomenal. $3 hurricane special? I'm there. Very strong, but delicious. The feel of this restaurant is amazing, I don't feel like I'm off of olive. Also the food came out super quick and super fresh. Caught me off guard. New favorite place!

Text: Had the Lobster Bisque and the Lobster & Seafood Alfredo.  Both were delicious and creamy.  The Lobster Bisque had a great texture and large chunks of lobster in it.  I was really pleased with the Alfredo, which had plenty of lobster & seafood, which was great considering some places really skimp on the seafood in these types of dishes.  It was a bit pricey, but I think it was worth the money.  Waiter didn't check up on us much, but it was during lunch and a bit busy.  Would definitely go back!

Text: We had the crab legs and the periods were huge! Love the fried corn on the cob as well. The green beans were hohum. The service was pleasant. It's crowded and busy so be prepared for the wait on a Saturday evening.
