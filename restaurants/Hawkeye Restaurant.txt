Text: 1st time here. Many locals highly recommended it. The 10 Oz filet was cooked to perfection, other entrée was seafood sampler which had grilled salmon, & bacon wrapped shrimp & scallops - they were excellent - the salmon was on the overcooked side as it was a little dry rather than melt in your mouth tender. I know it's possible to grill salmon & still be super tender but is easy to overcook. Wild rice pilaf was very good, baked potatoes piping hot, hash browns nicely browned as they should be. Lots of leftovers as there was so much food! Salad bar was good with nice variety & tasty cheddar cheese spread to go with crackers.  We arrived about 4:30pm and some of the lettuce on top of lettuce bowl on the salad bar was a little wilted and could have been refreshed for evening guests arriving. The hot mini bread loaves were delicious and wait staff was super. (Friendly & attentive) I mentioned the salmon because we were asked on the way out by a manager about our satisfaction & I received a sincere apology, nothing more. I did not mention salmon to wait staff when they asked as it was still edible, just not done perfectly.  Still, I give it 5 stars because the slight imperfections of a couple of items wasn't enough to knock a whole star off.  Would definitely go again before leaving Keokuk, IA.
