Text: We were excited to try Kinja, as it is much closer to our house than all of the other sushi restaurants in town. Unfortunately, when we arrived the waitress was also working as the hostess. She acknowledged that we were there and then proceeded to serve her tables water for the next ten minutes while we stood in the entryway. We ultimately left.
