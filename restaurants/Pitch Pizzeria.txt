Pitch Pizzeria
Rating: 5
Text: I have already had a love for Pitch since I first went back in 2015. The food is amazing, the wine is delicious, and the atmosphere is always friendly and inviting. Today, I took my dad, who is on R&R from deployment, for a quick lunch break while I was working, so he could see this favorite place of mine that I always talk about. He really enjoyed the food and conversation that the employees made with us during that short hour. Sometime during our lunch, his deployment was brought up to Scott, one of the employees at this location. Between him and our server, unfortunately I did not catch her name, they thanked him several times for his service and discounted our meal. I am not one to get emotional about my father's career or time away, but it definitely made the experience memorable for us before he gets ready to leave again tomorrow. To Pitch, thank you so much for the above and beyond customer experience! To anyone who has not tried Pitch before, you need to go right now, and try them for yourselves!

Text: Really fresh and creative pizzas.  Seemed like fresh seasonal ingredients too.  Definitely among the best pizzas out there.  A bit pricey though.  This is The Doc pizza. Tons of fresh basil, so yummy.

Text: The absolute best pizza in Omaha! Brick-oven fired pizzeria with excellent main entree & appetizer choices. The beer & wine menu is is equally as impressive. Great atmosphere in the historic Dundee district of Omaha.

Text: A great 'Mule' menu, I would highly recommend the Kramer if you're looking for a truly spicy beverage.  Ginger beer, jalapenos, and cucumber vodka.  It's great!
