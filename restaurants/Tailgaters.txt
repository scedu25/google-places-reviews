Text: Good sports bar! The chicken fried steak was perfectly prepared and fixed the right way, with mashed potatoes under it. The service was friendly and quick. I'm wondering where the locals are? I would think this place would be busy. The only draw back is, and it's minor, is the menu doesn't set itself apart from any other sports bar. Almost everything is fried. Otherwise a solid business with seating for small and large groups.
