Text: Depending on when you go will depend on service and food quality. I ate here 3 times over the weekend and both times during the day the service was good and so was the food. Saturday night I ate late and while the service was ok the food wasn't. I ordered the Tenderloin sandwich & fries. My sandwich was overcooked and absolutely plain. They forget the lettuce, onion, pickle etc. The meat itself was kinda bland but the bun it's served on was great. I also ordered the Better Made type sandwich for lunch Saturday and found it to be very greasy, not much flavor and it was cold. I mentioned it to the very nice lady working and she immediately took care of the temperature issue. Sunday for lunch I ordered the Double Up Burger and its was absolutely delicious, it's without a doubt the best burger I've had in a long time. Sunday night I had the Shrimp Po' boy, it was good. There is also a more formal restaurant in the same building BUT for me the menu options, food quality and prices here were exactly what I was looking for. This little restaurant is located inside the Mark Twain casino.
