Text: Horrible place for basketball tournaments..  There more concerned on making money then hiring good officials.. You would think charging 25$ to watch a 5th grade basketball game they would have at least on scoreboard that is readable.. Place sucks.  They should ask best choice fieldhouse for some help ..

Text: Not a good place for basketball tournaments! It's pretty clear the officials decide before the games even start who will win the game and make sure it happens that way. I watched 27 basketball games this past weekend some were our team but most were other teams while we waited to play, it was sad and sickening for these kids who deserved to win, lose because of horrible calls. If this is not the case then there is not one competent official in that place and the gym needs to do a better job hiring!!!

Text: Best gym I've used in Fort Wayne so far. They have way more racks/benches than the other gyms I went to, and best of all they have an actual powerlifting area with rubber bumper plates and all that, so you can do deadlifts without annoying everyone (or getting yelled at) and olympic lifts if that's what you're into. They have tons of other stuff too but I just go there to lift.
