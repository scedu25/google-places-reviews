Text: Great atmosphere to get some homework done in the mornings or evenings. Afternoons are busy, but still an awesome place to grab lunch. Their highlander grog coffee is the best and they have the best quiches in town.

Text: Great coffee with great service. Attracts a trendy, college crowd as well as other locals. Serves smaller plate meals, pastries, cocktails and craft beer. Small tables indoors and outdoors are good for smaller groups and individuals. Best coffee shop in town.
