Text: Every time we come here was are always greeted with top notch guest service. Salsa is great. Food is great. Tied for best Mexican spot in btown with Juanita's in terms of food, but they nail service here.

Text: I have eaten here many times in the past, but evidently management has changed. The help cant even answer the phone for a take out order!! I certainly wouldn't trust them to get the order correct. 

I'll eat somewhere else!

Text: I have been here quite a number of times. I always order the chicken chimichanga with queso (which they will charge extra for ): ), rice and beans. Barring that additional cost for queso, I have no complaints about the restuarant. The portions are good, the food is excellent, the salsa is the perfect texture. Service is normally quite good: only had 1 bad experience, and the manager made it right the same day.

Text: Been here many times and had a wonderful time and delicious food. Today I got fajita taco salad to go and came home to eat and salad looked like soup. The shell smelled like fish. Had to throw away the salad after few bites. Will not be doing this again.
