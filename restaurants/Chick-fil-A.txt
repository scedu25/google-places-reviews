Text: Didn't realize it was inside an office building when I typed it into the GPS ( we were just driving home from the airport)  we were disappointed that there were no combo meal options. The chicken sandwich was of course yummy as usual

Text: This is not a full chick-fil-a.  They have a limited menu and run out of items frequently.  The service was good but we were disappointed that it wasn't a true restaurant.  No drive thru either.

Text: Good place to get a fast food favorite. This is an express though so they do not offer a full menu.
