Text: Waitress Kim and the hostess we're both very professional and friendly. I would love to say that the food was good but I never tasted it.  We ordered drinks and when they arrived we ordered our food. Then the two of us waited for 50 minutes, watched as a table of 8 got their food before us (I hope that them being members had nothing to do with it) and that was the final straw. We left, hungry, angry, and disappointed. 
I can't imagine a scenario where we would come back, or recommend others to go.

Text: Best wine! The tastings are great and the wine club is such a good deal. All the food and service has been fantastic. It's our new favorite spot!

Text: I tried to go in here with an optimistic attitude. I wanted to like this place. Unfortunately everything from the food to the beer fell flat for me. There just was nothing that wowed me here or even would make me want to come back. The food was mediocre and the beer just was not doing it for me. Hopefully others have better luck here.

Text: Great selection of wine and beer.  Prices are a BIT high. I think 1 vegan option which was hummus. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and we were the only ones there.
