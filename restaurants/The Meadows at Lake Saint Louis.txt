Text: This shopping center has beautiful landscaping and design.  However, it has lost a lot of stores over the past few years.  I wish they had more restaurants.  Recommend Von Maur department store during the Christmas season.  Nicely decorated and the best Santa in St. Charles County.

Text: Twice weekly I take my kids to Lil Bits Gym. They love it there! Most days before classes we go for a walk around the shopping center. It's very clean with tons of walking space.

Text: Love going to the Farmers Market. And my dogs love visiting Sebastian's pet salon. They are very friendly and do very well with my pets.
