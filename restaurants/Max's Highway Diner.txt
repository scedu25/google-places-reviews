Text: Honestly, the food here was just okay, and the service was kind of grudgingly terrible. It felt like a coffee refill was on parallel with asking for a kidney. Wouldn't waste my time here again.

Text: The service is slow. There were only 2 girls working the whole restaurant. My boyfriends burger was a half a patty so he had it sent back for a full one. Our appetizer came with out food. The food was alright but for the price they charge it wasn't worth it. Probably won't go back.

Text: Food was not seasoned at all. Most of the food on the Buffett had been there a while and some of it looked like it had been recycled from another day...who knows... maybe more. The sausage and onions looked good which is the only reason I ate there. Unfortunately is was barely edible. The chicken  was reheated, mash potatoes crusty, corn on the cob was okish. Cookie might have been the best thing there...it was probably pre- prepared. Not trying to be harsh...I know it seems like I'm being a d head...just the truth. Wasted 15 bucks to try it but not again. One and done!

Text: Waited too long to even be noticed for seating, then wasn't seated but yelled at across the room "over here". Waitress was distracted and rude. Doesn't take my drink order but walks away. Comes back more than 5 minutes later to take my drink order but doesn't listen so I have to ask again after she brings it for lemon then also for a straw. Leaves again without taking my order. Comes back after another 5-10 minutes to take my order but again doesn't listen even though I am pointing to the item on the menu so I have to repeat myself again. Then I wait for almost 30 minutes for my overpriced  (for the size) appetizer and meal which she brought together. She then snags my sweet tea to refill it and fills it with unsweetened tea without asking to confirm. She did pick up the dirty dishes once but didn't check on me until I was done. Then just dropped the check and ran. I can't believe I left her any tip at all. She certainly didn't deserve it.

Text: Staff was fine but food was not good.  My husbands hamburger looked like it was boiler and his fries tasted like fish.  Will pass on this place.
