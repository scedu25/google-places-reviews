Text: It was a fluke we ended up here on the day of the solar eclipse and we could tell they hadn't expected the crowd that was there. We were there in between lunch and dinner time so we were surprised by the crowd as well. What surprised us the most though, was the three young ladies handling everything outside of the kitchen because they were hustling and doing a good job of it too! Understandably there was some congestion and confusion at the cashier counter/hostess area and we waited a bit before we were able to get our name on the list to sit. After that we didn't wait long to be seated and service was prompt. Sweet tea was good, sides were all good and the meats were delicious. I prefer white meat; the turkey & chicken were both tasty, but the chicken is what I would order again. It was flavorful and juicy! If you find yourself in Cuba checkout the BBQ

Text: Excellent smoked meat done on an enormous rotisserie grill consisting of a chain drive with 10 5 ' trays that are able to hold 1/2 a hog securely...
With an amazing grilled natural taste and an assortment of uniquely flavored sauces that meet the appeal of all the basic and not so basic BBQ sauce for any and all traditional and not so traditional tastes...

Text: Went here as a fluke because I was passing through on vacation. Great decor and ambiance. But ribs were dry and "pulled pork" was chopped white meat. Great for route 66 memorabilia.

Text: Edited rating, had a much better experience second time around! Would recommend if you're passing through and want good BBQ, they also have 5 different sauces, so there's something for everybody. They also have great kid selections, BBQ as well as pb&j. Will come back next year for sure.
