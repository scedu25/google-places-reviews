We had an excellent experience here. Waitress was very friendly chicken fried steak sandwich was exceptional. And then there was the coconut pie!!! Wow... 

9/9/17

Update on review went there a second time and totally different experience food still good. Service was horrible. The girl that had our table should definitely not be in the food service industry

Text: This is a hidden gem in Western Kansas. Every time I'm out at my land in Quincy I go here. The food is pretty great and the people are very nice. It's got a country feel and is a great place to bring groups.
