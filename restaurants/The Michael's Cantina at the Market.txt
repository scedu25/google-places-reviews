The Michael's Cantina at the Market

Text: We come here every week. We like the food and the Margaritas are outstanding.  Warm and friendly atmosphere abounds from the hostess to the waitress to the servers. The Bartender/Manager is the best in Omaha.
We bring friends here on a regular basis. It's a can't miss place.

Text: Not very good food. Not very good service. It used to be wonderful but in the last several years has gone downhill tremendously.

Text: I was hired at Michael's on a Tuesday. Started the next day. I'm a single mother to a five month old, and was told as long as I kept my communication clear everything will be fine. On that Sunday, in the morning my son had a fever of 102.9, I didn't work until 4pm that day, immediately too him to the ER, and my babysitter was unable to care for him due to the cold he had. I got a doctor's not excusing me from my shift to care for him, I then called the restaurant. Keep in mind there's no management there until about 6pm. So unprofessional. I let a bartender know then right away I sent a copy of the doctor's note to Jill the manager. I didn't get a response until Wednesday telling me I was fired for being unreliable. For people who beg for a new hires they tend to  fire immediately. I wasn't the first. Don't work here, dont eat here. I would give this place a -10
