Hofbräuhaus Newport

Text: Good timing or good service?   We arrived at was seated. Immediately asked what we wanted to drink and if any appetizers were wanted.  With some great advice we ordered our appetizers and main course.  Within minutes the appetizers were out and very shortly followed by the main course.   The absolute fastest service I've seen in a long time.  The food is great beer is flowing and entertainment is wonderful.  I highly recommend this place.

Text: I had a good bratwurst here - beer was delicious and service was great (@bar). Wasn’t too sure about the Friday night country music with accordion, but it grew on me. I was just passing through Cincinnati (staying at hotel across the street), and I’m glad I stopped in. Signing off as the band is making a birthday celebrant play the washboard- random, but amusing.

Text: Fun and family-friendly German beer garden associated with the famous Munich beer garden. My kids love dancing to the German polka flavored music. This is a must visit when we have friends come in from out of town.

Text: We were told an hour wait for a table tonight. After watching multiple groups that came in after us get seated we were told we weren’t on the wait list but could be added. No “I’m so sorry this happened”. Just right back to their conversation about being on a party bus. What the hell is that?! Thanks for ruining the date night plans Hofbräuhaus.

Text: Always good food and drinks and I love the live music. Only issue ive ever had was they run out of the beer of the month way to quick! My last 2 visits they didnt have any available. Still 5 stars
