Text: Having great tasting pizza will only get you so far, your customer service has to match the great taste. We had a great visit this evening, however, we had a large order and the cashier messed the order up. When the manager came out to confirm the order with us, we confirmed what the order was supposed to be and the manager seemed annoyed and inconvenienced by this. Two things: 1) don't ever get annoyed with your customer for an order being wrong- hire better employees. 2) as a manager, be apologetic when its obviously necessary.

Overall, the food was great and we had a great time. However, remember that the "Guest Experience" trumps everything - as this dictates your future business and continued revenue.

Perhaps I'll change this to a 4 or 5 star rating the next visit. I hope I can.

Text: This is a great restaurant. Their food is very good and so are the workers there. They are generally always on time with getting your food done. One time Matt Bush told me that my ham and cheese sub would be done in about 8 minutes. And in exactly 8 minutes I received my sub and it was very good.

Text: This is a great little place a must visit if you going to or through Westport. Great owners, staff and food. The only down fall is they only deliver to a 3 mile radius.
