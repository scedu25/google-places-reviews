Text: Great food and service. The staff is so friendly and I just love the attire. It all fits into one. Your moms old school country meals and it's an all you can eat. You can't get much better then that. I would give this an A+ for all the hard work these people do to make sure you have great service.

Text: The atmosphere is lovely. The staff was friendly. The wait was terribly long and the food disgusting. We ordered grilled chicken and fries and the chicken was flavorless and dry as cardboard. We were one table of only 3 or 4 in the whole place at the time, not a busy time of day/ week. Over 45 minute wait for truly terrible food. Will never be going back.

Text: High quality traditional American fare made from scratch in their kitchen. Excellent, friendly service in a family-friendly atmosphere. Don't miss the broasted chicken, salad dressings, bread pudding, or roast beef!

Text: The Barn Restaurant offers a rustic buffet and menu of food. Kids four and undereat free, which is fantastic. Salad bar offered a wide variety of toppings and everything seemed fresh. I was personally not impressed with the other items on the buffet, which included lasagna, mashed potatoes, and some meat dish. Servers were very nice, but a bit slow paced.

Text: I am from out of town but I had to stop here, looked beautiful. The buffet selection was not what I expected but it tasted great. Overall, I enjoyed the cozy feel and the warm buns with butter.
