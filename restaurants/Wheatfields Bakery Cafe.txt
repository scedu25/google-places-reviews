Text: My favorite restaurant of all time! So cozy and there are SO many great food options. 3 cheese melt, eggplant sandwich, turkey swiss and apple, quiches, and side salad with blue cheese are my favorites for lunch. biscuits and gravy and primavera omelet are my favorites for breakfast. And the water filtration system here is UNMATCHED!
