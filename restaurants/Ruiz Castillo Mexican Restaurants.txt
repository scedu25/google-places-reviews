Text: Margarita was good and server was nice, looks like she had more people than she could handle, the food on the other hand not the greatest, nachos we're pretty sad, ground beef resembles Taco Bell, the salsa tasted like ketchup or something. Unlike any salsa I've ever had at a Mexican place, fajitas were mediocre, even though I ordered steak and chicken I got chicken wWith all the flies that followed the food I felt like food poisoning was in my near future. The place could definitely use a remodel, pretty dated and doesn't feel clean, maybe bar rescue could come in and help....

Text: Trash. Worst meal of my life. Stale, bagged chips, rotten salsa, dry old chicken. All served on an old pizza pan. Just trash. What are these people ordering that earned 5 stars???

Text: Fantastic! The margaritas were great and my dad always orders the fried chicken. I know that sounds crazy but I was sceptical at first also, wow! It is delicious.  Obviously the chimichangas and tacos are good. We were very pleased with the experience.  We will definitely go back.
