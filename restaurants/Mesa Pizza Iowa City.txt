Text: WE KNOW PIZZA. And we sure as hell know vegan pizza. Why the hell are CARROTS and PINEAPPLE on my pizza together? Then they threw on spinach and peppers? And why is this vegetable mish-mash the ONLY vegan option? If you're vegan and you're drunk, you could possibly enjoy this. But I feel more like a drunk vegan made this pizza.

Text: My favorite place to get a slice in Iowa City. The crust is perfect and lots of interesting specialty pizzas. I never saw the appeal of Mac n cheese ? but it's so popular they made a shirt to honor it.
