Text: I came here for the buffet. It wasn't as good as I expected, but I love the deep dish pizza! I'd like to get a whole pizza of it

Text: We ordered this while staying at the Best Western. The delivery guy brought it up to our room and was polite. The pizza was by far the best we ever had. We got the meat lovers. Good job!

Text: Really good food. Chicken fries came with parmesan which my daughter can't have. They got her a new order really quickly and left the other order for the table. Only complaint was that we ordered the Saturday special but they charged us full price. I always check the receipt and they fixed it when we pointed it out, but it could have easily been missed.

Text: Pretty tasty. There is a buffet for lunch, but you can still order off the menu, which I like because the vegetarian options on the buffet are not great, and I didn't like the quality of the salad items (I'm a picky salad person; I like good greens!).
