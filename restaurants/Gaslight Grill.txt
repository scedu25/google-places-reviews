Text: We took a group of 6 to dine in the back room during the live jazz from 6-9. (The jazz band was very good and entertaining. The pianist was incredibly talented!) The service was great. The food was excellent (and portions were well worth the price). My husband and I shared the Porterhouse and Crab legs for 2 for $69. The crab legs were cooked to perfection and were the best I've had since visiting the coast. We also had the calamari and beef tenderloin as appetizers. The calamari was incredible. We would return again and again.

Text: My Wife and I went here for our anniversary, we ordered an appetizer and some wine. The waiter was incredible, very patient with my Wife, she always reads the menu twice and asks a lot of questions. He was genuinely interested in making sure we were happy and taken care of. The live Jazz is incredible! I can't recommend this place enough.

Text: Quiet on a late Tuesday evening and I am a solo diner. Still treated well and not relegated to the back table. Great wine list. I like the 8 for $28 hook and the wines in the deal are good quality. Steak was tasty with a reduction demi-glaze. The garlic mash was subtle with skins and chunks. Presentation was excellent and Whitney was delightful. A lovely spot for date night. 40s big band music in the background.

Text: Great experience at the Gaslight Grill.  Our waiter Juan was fantastic and eager to please.  In addition to great food my wife and I enjoyed listening to the jazz band.  Towards the end of our meal the owner came to each table and introduced himself and made small conversation.

Text: I had such a great experience here! The food was fantastic and the staff was incredible! There was a small issue, where one of the members of the party I was in, had an over-cooked steak. The server and manager promptly corrected the issue and went above and beyond to make our dinner wonderful!!!!!!! I WILL recommend Gaslight Grill and will be back!!!
