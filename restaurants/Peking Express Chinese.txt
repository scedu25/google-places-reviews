Text: Maybe it's because I'm not from around here but I really wasn't impressed with the quality, portion size, or pricing. It just wasn't that good and I'm used to having huge portion sizes for half the price in Salina and Lawrence. It want worth it so I won't be returning.

Text: Good Chinese food. Excellent service, clean. Food was fresh and hot. Drinks are refillable. Dishes came with rice. A very nice dinning environment.
