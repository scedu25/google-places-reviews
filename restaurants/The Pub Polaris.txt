Text: Amazing fish 'n' chips. Fun theme. Authentic English comfort food. The Pub Passport will keep you coming back. Impressive scotch and bourbon flights. Servers and bartenders are laid back, and the restaurant has an upbeat vibe. Nice patio seating.

Text: Portions are a terrible value. $14 sandwhich was tiny. 12 fries. Leaving hungry after lunch. Everything tasted great, just remember to bring a snack.

Text: Excellent British ambiance except for the size. Plenty of pictures of Winnie. Strange, but no pictures of Neville Chamberlain... unless it is hidden because of current British politics. Fish and chips are delicious and the beer selection works. The layered beers are excellent@
