Text: It had a fast wait time on game day. The food was OK, nothing special. Zero complaints on the wig and pen.

Text: Excellent service and neat atmosphere. The Cobb Salad was great, and the pizza was alright but it didn't live up to the hipe. It was a level of spicy that I find unpleasant, and the overall construction of it was such that the components fell apart and tumbled into a pile. It felt less like eating pizza and more like a tossed "pizza salad". Try the fried avocado slices or get yourself a salad to share.

Text: This is honestly the best pizza I have ever had. It certainly lives up to its "best pizza in Iowa" title! The service is wonderful, too.
