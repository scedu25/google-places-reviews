Text: Service here was awful.  Food sub-par.  Atmosphere not exciting, not clean.  Nothing at all I can recommend about this restaurant.

Text: Great pizza options. I've had several wing flavors and have not been disappointed. The cannelloni is awesome as well.  I love the hot dog choices for lunch. The recent addition of draft beer is a welcome addition and so far I love the beer choices.
