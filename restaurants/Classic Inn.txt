Text: We've been eating here for over twenty years and we're never disappointed.  The buffet items are always delicious and so much better than most Chinese buffets.  The salads are fresh and yummy.

Text: Classic Inn. The owner stops at your table, might even serve you, and watches the food being prepared for you ...being prepared for you. This is the one of a select few places in Great Bend, KS that QC is monitored by the owner from order to serve and asks if you are satisfied before you leave. What else? Served in an old cottage ambiance with unmatched chairs and open conversations with servers and guests. This is what traveling foodies search for. Want original and personal?.... Classic Inn has homemade Chinese food cooked by order. Nothing made before your order. I can witness. Often.
