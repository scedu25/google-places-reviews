AMF Stardust Lanes
Rating: 5
Text: For people looking for fun - understand it's a corporate bowling alley, and the prices are high by default. Better for groups, rather than looking for a cheap date - but if you look for specials ahead of time you'll end up paying s reasonable price. Fun and inviting for all ages. 

For bowlers - smaller house (24 lanes) consistent approaches, consistently oiled (can almost always find a fresh pair/single lane) and the in house pro shop is amazing and very fairly priced.  A pretty busy house, so calling ahead is advised if you want an open lane.  

In general - service has significantly improved over time, and the management is great. Food is what you can expect for a bowling alley - but there are a few hidden gems that are pretty great. Great bowling alley for fun, and there are leagues that start on a consistent basis if you want to take it a step further (plus league bowlers get various discounts that take the sting out of the naturally high corporately placed price).

Text: Nice place too have a fun little family outing. Wish you could put the bumpers up just for those who need them and not everyone. Other than that I have no gripes.
