Text: Ok first of all don't have the word buffet in your title if you don't have buffet available. Then when I order fried green beans and ask to have them right away cause very hungry I mean tha not get them half way through my meal...if you screw up and tell the chef the wrong thing you should comp me meal it.....oh and they were not good tasting....final complaint if you offer me an option of steak fries they should be thick not normal fries makes me think the normal fries are shoestring. ....the hamburger was very good although over priced in my opinion. ....for my first time in Russell I was very disappointed
