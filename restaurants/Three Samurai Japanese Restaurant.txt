Text: I have had sushi from all over the country and this is my favorite sushi place in the Iowa City area, it stands up to some of the best sushi I've had much closer to the coasts. There are other decent places but every time I come here the sushi is delicious. They also have some of the best entrees I've had at an Asian place in a while. The Matsuzaka entree is one of the best steaks in town and it's only $20. The only negative things I can say is the service is just okay and they don't usually do takeout. Still, that's not enough to downgrade a star IMO.

Text: Very disappointed. We got seated and neglected for 45 min. Staff and manager are disrespectful and rude. I was told “ we can just cancel your order” will get my sushi elsewhere from now on

Text: This is my favorite place in town. I come here at least once a week and I LOVE the food here. Tonight I came and they were busy, which is fine I get it - I've served too. I ordered something and it was not very good, it was pretty awful.  I told the server and was hoping to be offered another option, which was really hard for me to do in the first place, I hate sending food back it's so embarrassing. But i was told that - that's how it was always and hallways been made and too bad basically. I wasn't offered an alternative and was Instantly snubbed. It was the only time I've had this bad of an experience there. I asked for it to be taken off the bill, which again, I NEVER do but it felt wrong after the terrible service too. I would have rather a meal alternative but wasn't offered. I didn't want a free meal, I didnt even eat it. Our waiter came, dropped the new ticket on the table, rolled his eyes and didn't say a word. It was SO bad. I love this place, I won't be deterred from coming back but I needed to mention to awful service.

Text: Had amazing service! We had 12 people and they moved us from the grill to a private room because we didn't know we couldn't get the full menu at the grill so they willingly moved us right before their rush. We managed to get our food after only 45 minutes and they gave us free miso soup and salads because of the wait. Such an amazing place and the food was delicious!

Text: The cook refused to do any fire show or the food toss which is all we heard about before we went. He told us that the owner had told him that is wasn't allowed anymore. Then he gave the full show to the table behind us. I did tip because the waitress was good at her job, hopefully it went to her. My family and I won't be back.
