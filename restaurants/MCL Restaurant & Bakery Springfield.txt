MCL Restaurant & Bakery Springfield

Text: This place is most popular with senior citizens. Most likely because it doesn't advertise or promote as being hip. Oh, and no alcohol. 
Bit, the selection of salads, sides, entrees and desserts is astounding! All excellently prepared to high standards. We love it!

Text: The meatloaf was dry with very little flavor. The price was very high for what we got. I will not be back.

Text: Food is not bad. Great iced tea. The floor staff is always nice, helpful. What I can't understand is why the line employee's do not all wear a cover on their hair and they never wear gloves. As well they don't appear to be trained when it comes to rotating food items. I think these things fall on management.

Text: Cold food right after they opened, loud rude managers, and my deviled eggs tasted rotten. #worthless

Text: The chicken and dumplings are AMAZING (hint: ask for it as your entree even though its over with the sides for a bigger portion)!!! Their prices are travelling back in time low and you get so much food. Most of the patrons are older but younger people would seriously benefit from discovering this Springfield classic. 

I've been going to MCL religiously with family for well over a decade, well before this larger location was built, back when they were in the mall. I love it and my family loves it too.
