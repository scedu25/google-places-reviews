Text: This place is incredible! Beautiful location on a bend in the Kentucky River. Has outside dining with a peaceful feel. Service was excellent. And the food was incredible. Small menu, but its all home made. Good selection of beer/wine/spirits. Highly recommend!

Text: Good views. Good atmosphere.  Good food.

Really good banana peppers served with cocktail sauce just spicy enough. 

We love the hot brown.  One of the best in the area. 

Sit on the patio if you can.  

If you can, enjoy a short hike up the trail just off the side. Up to the creek and back is an easy mile.  Good way to work up an appetite or work off your meal.

Text: Place was not busy and had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Had to ask if a bartender was working after waiting 10 minutes to order a drink. After we were seated, no waitress came to take our order. After waiting another 20 minutes, a young man we seen cleaning a table earlier  ask if we were being waited on. We said no,so he offered to take our order. The food was very good. I also noticed that other customers were being waited on and seemed quite well. I think that we were just forgot about. Probably won't return because of the bad service and the food although was good, was priced a little high. For the price I expect good service..

Text: AMAZING! Had Lamb Fries first time ever, and were delicious! Heather was our waitress and was enthusiastic, prompt, caring, polite, and hospitable. Two shrimp and grits were unique and tasty as can be! The fried green tomatoes and smoked chicken wings were the best I EVER had!!! My 7yo daughter was treated like a princess! Wonderful experience! WILL BE BACK!
