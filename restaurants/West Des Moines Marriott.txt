Text: Got to the hotel about midnight after driving 15+ hours the staff was extremely nice and the lobby was lovely however once I got into my room I was less than impressed. Firstly, the bathroom had curly hair on the floor that had been missed by housekeeping in multiple places, private hair under the toilet seat, no trash liners in the cans but hair and a tissue in the can, something on one of the bedspreads ( nice bedding other than that), the beds were poorly made, the place needs a nice dusting, and the mirrors need cleaned correctly. All little cosmetic things that make all the difference. I was too tired to bother changing rooms last night but feel these are things that should be mentioned.

Text: This hotel is very clean. Knowledgeable helpful staff. Easy access from the interstate yet quiet. Nice lounge and great food. Hot tub was also good.  Nice pool and exercise equipment.

Text: It was great, we were only there for one night, however, the room was clean and ready for us, the curtains were great for blocking out light. The parking lot was a safe place to park our truck. They let or dog stay with us. There are plenty of restaurants around for late nights. It looks like a place where there are lots of people dressed for formal events, at least during the night we statues there. I recommend it!

Text: Wonderful staff that was very polite and helpful.  However ice makers on our floor didn't work and had to go to the next upper and lower floors to get enough ice for ice bucket.  Also hot tub does not work and apparently has not for 6 months.  Love Marriott's but was not expecting to have things under disrepair especially hot tub,
