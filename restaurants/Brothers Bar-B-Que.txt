Text: Eclipse day 2017 - We stopped in after being stuck in traffic for almost 2 hours. What a turn-a-round from tired and hungry to happy and full. We had the BEST BBQ and such a pleasant overall experience. Our traffic nightmare was eclipsed by the scrumptious BBQ! We may have to make a special trip to visit again.
