Big Dogs Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Our family really enjoys Big Dogs pizza. It is family friendly and we like how easy/simple it is to grab a bite. It is nice to find a place that isn't a chain and has a local nastalgic feel. Kids enjoy the old school video games and the train that goes around over head. I suggest the Buffalo Chicken pizza.

Text: Outstanding friendly service. The crust is amazing, not greasy and the sauce is the best. By far the best pizza place in the area!
