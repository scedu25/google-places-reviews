Romano's Macaroni Grill

Text: I had not been to this Macaroni Grill in a long time.  The last time I went (a few years ago), the food and atmosphere were sub par.  I happened to try lunch with my parents recently and had a great time!  Everything was better than I remembered!  The custom lunch special offers a nice variety of choices in addition to refills on bread if you're still hungry or like it as a compliment.  If you're looking for a tasty lunch where you can relax but aren't feeling like spending too much; this is a great choice!

Text: We had a great time. The food was very good the service was very nice and helpful. They seemed a little slow on customers that night but the bartender did an excellent job making drinks

Text: Lunch choices are ridiculously few - 4 pasta dishes, 3 of which were not acceptable to me. The one I picked was delicious, but wonder why they're discouraging a lunch crowd? My friend and I and a twosome at the table behind us were the only patrons in this big place. They used to have great, reasonable, quick "Pronto Lunches". Now it's hardly worth opening for lunch.
