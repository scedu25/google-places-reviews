La Carreta Mexican Restaurant

Text: Best restaurant in town... And about the only one too. If you don't like Mexican they have a 6 dollar burger that not worth it. They do have decent kids menu options.

Text: Good service, average margaritas, fish tacos were boring with no effort put into its construction.  Flour tortilla (never had flour shell with fish tacos) with a piece of fish that was the size of a skinny french fry, lettuce and tomatoes.  Super boring!  It was like something I would throw together real quick at home if i was in a hurry.  Tamales were all dough, no flavor and cold.  Beans were really runny and flavorless like the rice.  Never again.

Text: Came to this place because it got good reviews. I was very disappointed. The servers kept speaking to me in Spanish even after i told them I couldn't speak spanish. The salsa was mostly water. The tacos came out in a few minutes, but were clearly just microwaved. My server did not refill my water even after i asked and then asked me if I needed a refill after I got the check.
