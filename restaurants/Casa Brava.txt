Text: I am lactose intolerant and ordered my meal with no sour cream, no milk and no cheese. The meal came with lots of butter. They gladly made me the meal with a new recipe. It was great.

Text: The food here was very nice and pretty good value. They have great enchiladas. The only downside is that sometimes they can get pretty busy which may extend wait times.

Text: We went on a Sunday evening around 7:30pm so there was hardly anyone there, but the service of our waiter was amazing. The food was cooked perfectly, was very delicious with generous portions and didn't take long to make it to our table.
