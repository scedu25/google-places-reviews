Text: One of the best restaurants we have visited this year! They went above and beyond to meet our allergy-friendly needs and made sure we had a wonderful time! Food was amazing, atmosphere tops and service was tremendous. We'll be back!

Text: I ordered a side  of hash browns and the serving they gave me was less than half a very small plate. Literally not much bigger than a silver dollar. I was charged $ 3.10. Wow a 1/4 cup of potatoes worth about 10 cents.
