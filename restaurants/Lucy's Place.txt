Text: I stop here every other week when I'm through with my truck. Very nice quiet place. Food is very good with generous helpings. Staff is friendly and helpful. Best stop from North Platte to Denver

Text: We stopped there twice and had lunch. The first time I had a white bean and chicken chili and it was absolutely phenomenal. The second time I tried their buffalo burger. They raised their own Buffalos and it was really tasty. I also had their potato salad and some dump cake, both were really tasty.  They have nice clean bathrooms and are really nice down to Earth  friendly staff. All around good experiences.  I would definitely recommend.

Text: We found this place traveling. It is a cute and clean place. The food was good and plenty of it. 

When we first arrived, I thought it would be a small burger joint or a cafe. It was not either. It was a Chinese restaurant. We were the only customers in there. So our waitress / cook was very nice and attentive. 

Only complaint is when I asked if the crab ragoons had crab in them and she said no.. but when I bit into it, it had what looked like tiny bits of something red (crab?). Not sure if if she understood what I was asking. 

I would however, go back if I lived nearby.

Text: Not sure what all the fuss is about. We stopped because of all the 5 star reviews. I wasn't expecting 5 star big city food but I was expecting some flavorful tasty food. First I want to say the service was really good, very friendly. Got the bison burger and it was nothing special. Wife had chicken strips. Fries were decent but overall the food just lacked any real flavor. Pretty bland. I suppose it is better than fast food joints which is about all you will find out here.
