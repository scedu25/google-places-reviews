Text: We go every other month or so. Bang bang shrimp is a must! The Chilean sea bass is simply delicious, & yes, it is pricey & may even be the most expensive item on the menu, but it is easily my favorite. There are other types of fish dishes that are more reasonably priced that are still very tasty. The salmon is also excellent. Even though this is mainly a seafood restr, the pork chop is very good, too. Bar is usually busy, especially during happy hour. Never had a problem with the service. If you're going at peak dinner hour, call well ahead for a reservation. If not, there are some nights you can expect to wait 15 to 60 minutes.

Text: Disappointing.  We go to this Bonefish about 6 times a year.  We like their Sunday brunch.  Today we were disappointed.  The Bang Bang Shrimp was soggy.  Normally it is crisp and fresh.  Not today.  Eggs Benedict was spot on but the asparagus was colorless mush.  Way overcooked.

Text: Despite having reservations, we had to wait 40+ minutes. The managers response was, "We can't make people leave to open up a table." I wonder how other restaurants manage to keep their reservations.... ?

Text: They make a good consistent gin martini. My last visit included the Grilled Swordfish with feta cheese and pumpkin ravioli, utterly amazing!

Text: We have always enjoyed this location. Staff is on point and the food is consistently delicious. For best ambiance it is best to brave the late evening wait list and avoid the seemingly deaf and oblivious happy hour regulars.
