Text: Overall experience was great. Had a very competent waitress. Decided to order 3 small plates. Potato Leak Soup could have been a little hotter as well as the frites. Onion soup was delicious as was the Spinach Salad and mussels. Will definitely return.

Text: Always have a great meal and great service. Love that there is never a corkage fee. We always have a nice bottle of wine to drink from home and want a nice meal to go along with it. Really appreciate the new menu, the great cheese plates and of course the mussels!

Text: A truly French experience.  Great for dates, business meetings, or a special night out with the wife and kids.  Exceptional service.  Genuine raw bar.  The meat and cheese platter are carved at the bar for a nice supposed fair.  

Our kids also like the place.  The French fries are really good.

Wonderful wine selection.  

However, the Cesar Salad lacks luster, even with the optional anchovies.  Skip it.

Text: I was a bit surprised. The general ratings are quite good so perhaps I got an off day. I started off with the tuna as an appetizer. Had to spit two pieces out as they were too tough to chew. Then I got the fish as an entree. It was very heavily breaded with nearly zero flavor outside of the fried floured coating. All in kinda disappointed.

Text: Lunch: First impressing was good. I really liked the shrimp pasta. My favorite pasta in Des Moines, but this is only on the lunch menu. Only downside is that the wait time (to take order, bill) is too long. Wouldn't go if I'm in a rush. 

Dinner: Went twice for dinner. Didn't like the food. Every bite of the seafood in the photo just tastes like carrots. I also ordered seafood crepes. It tastes better, but too greasy. Wouldn't go again for dinner.
