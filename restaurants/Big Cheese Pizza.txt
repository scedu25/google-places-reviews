Text: Good pizza! Staff is very kind and helpful. Don't know if it's the owner or manager, but he needs to let the nice girls run the place cause he's pretty rude, and too concerned about the almighty bottom line for good customer service.

Text: Nothing against the staff.. but the pizza was not what I expected for the price. The mushrooms they used look like they are out of the can, not fresh. And the onions were chopped up small. Very different and didn't taste very good. I would prefer Casey's or Pizza Hut.
