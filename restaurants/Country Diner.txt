Country Diner

Text: Good food, lots of it and low prices. The meatloaf tastes homemade - delicious, and my wife goes nuts for the ham & beans with cornbread. We usually eat for well under $20 for two, and when they have a special it's worth checking out. Their 6 oz steak and shrimp special is very good. Soups also taste homemade. The burgers are tasty and I love crinkle cut fries. We stop by a couple times per month, even though it is out of our way, being a 30 minute drive from home. Worth the trip.

Text: Homey atmosphere. Good food.  Love the Chopped Sirloin Dinner. Sometimes understaffed. Worth the wait.

Text: Friendly staff, with well portioned breakfast food. The bacon was particularly good. They have traditional diner food and a fairly typical truck stop feel.
