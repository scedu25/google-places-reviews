Text: 45 minutes and nothing to eat kitchen looks dirty owner does nothing but talk on phone didn't know what the special for dinner was and had no idea how much it was . Sorry looking forward to a new place to eat this isn't it need to improve. The waitress doing great job but no support from the rest of the crew. Big grill only one order at a time a table of about 8 were getting there food a plate or two at a time. Cook couldn't understand the orders if it said x 2 he was confused. Probably won't be back
