Text: Lunch time visit. Somewhat busy, but no wait. Clean with a contemporary look/feel. Good prompt, friendly service. Had the pulled pork sandwich (the special), was on point. Apple dumpling was great too. Just wish more desert was prepared so I didn't have to share ;)

Text: Waitress was weird and didn't really know about the menu and kept having to ask the chef... But the chef knew what was up and made amazing food! I'm a huge meat eater and I got the veggie burger to try something different and I highly recommend it along with the pork nachos!

Text: We are from the PNW traveling south and stopped to eat at the Union. The service was great as was the food! We had the burgers, curly fries and their famous apple dumplings.
