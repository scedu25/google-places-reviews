Text: I oldered there sandwiches at 920 pm after waiting 30 min I called to check on my older and the manager named Trisha was very rude!!! She said we have not had an order for over an hour and demanded that I give her the order number so I called back with it and she said it just popped up now. Clearly it was a lag in the system or something so I ask for a discount for the wait and they said they can't do that! So I tell them to make it and it took another 30 min to get it! How does it take an hour to get "freaky fast" service? When we got it the tuna sandwich was tiny it only had a paper thin layer of tuna and nothing else what so ever! I am pissed but they refuse to give me a discount!!!

Text: They are always Freaky Fast!

I order from here via the online menu a few times a month. They have always been fast and on time. The only issue I've had was they forgot a bag a chips.  I called and within 5 minutes they were here with the bag of chips!

Text: Good food. Very poor service. You don't get what you order and when you point it out, they argue with you. Just not a good idea to go here unless you want a random sandwich you didn't order and then get poor service to boot.

Text: I love Jimmy John's and this is probably my favorite shop around the area it's fun to watch their workers actually run out to their cars when they're doing deliveries I've never seen that before
