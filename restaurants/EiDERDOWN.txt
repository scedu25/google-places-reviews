Text: Great food....would love to see some German breads like Bauernbrot and Brotchen added. Very nice beer selection.  Staff was absolutely fantastic. Atmosphere reminding me of my time (12 years) spent in Germany.  Highly recommend.

Text: Fairly full at 8 on a Friday, but I didn't expect 10 minutes before anyone so much as said hello, then another 10 min waiting to get a beer when sitting at the bar. I asked an appetizer and said I might have another after, and 35 min later they brought both. The curry wurst was burn-your-mouth salty, but what I could eat from the middle layer was flavorful. The salad was excellent and beer selection was impressive. They did refund the curry wurst without me asking, and the service was friendly when they were around. Seems like they may need to increase their staffing a bit.

Text: Wonderful German food! Plus vegetarian and vegan selections. I drink coffee with every meal and this was just like I remember the coffee I enjoyed during 8 years stationed in Germany.
