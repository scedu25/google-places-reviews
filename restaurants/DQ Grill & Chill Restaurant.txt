Text: I went through the drive thru. They told me the combo upgraded blizzard would be $1 and it ended up to be $1.70. It was busy, but I got the incorrect blizzard order and also an undercooked basket of fries and a cold burger. Better luck next time, but I’ll just go for the blizzard only in order to save me some money.

Text: Disgusting. Firing a great worker because he respectfully told a customer who was HARASSING him and calling him the "N" word to leave then called the police on the customer because he kept attacking him. I can't believe an established  business like this listens to a racist angry man over a respected worker who was following the protocol. You will never see my business there again until you right your wrong.
