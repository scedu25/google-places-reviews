El Tarasco Mexican Restaurant

Text: A good place to eat. Generous servings and reasonable prices. We were seated immediately even though it was a Saturday evening. The plate pictured was a $10.99 special of the day. The steak came well done so if that's not to your liking, be sure to instruct your server.

Text: Might be the best Mexican restaurant in Kentucky. Seriously. I've lived in Southern California, and this place is really good--there's lots of other acceptable Mexican places around (especially if you stick to dishes with plenty of grilled meat) but everything we tried was way above par.
