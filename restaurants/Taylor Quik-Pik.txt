Text: This place has the worst customer service you are never greeted. The cashier never even told me my total, I payed and said have a good day and she never even acknowledge that I spoke to her. The only reason that I stopped was to use the cash box and get a drink.

Text: Been here before. Good food. I've never had a problem until today. They put a note on my truck, " we would hope you we are getting your fuel business as well as your food business. If this is not the case you would need to park somewhere else. I hope you do not consider this unreasonable." Well, I guess I'll park somewhere else from now on. I guess I consider it unreasonable.

Text: This small-town gas station wouldn't have been too bad except for the cashier who insisted in telling me, without me so much as saying hello,  about what it was like to be classified as a sex offender and how that differed from being a pedophile.  He wasn't aggressive or unkind, but that's not something you tell customers; especially when small children are about.
