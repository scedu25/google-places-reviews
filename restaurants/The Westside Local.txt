The Westside Local

Text: Delicious, local, perfect

I am mad at every single fry I have had in my life that wasn't like these fries. Perfection. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, salty, heaven. 

We had the Sleepless in Seattle and the League of Their Own beverages. Expertly crafted and a delight to behold. 

Can't believe we stumbled upon here, just looking for a place close to our B&B. Wow. 5 stars. Absolutely coming back. Wow KC!

Text: I? have eaten at WSL several times, dine in and carry out, and the food is amazing! THE BEST KALE SALAD I HAVE EVER EATEN. I get mine without bacon, and I could seriously eat one every. single. day.  Also have tried the fries, tomato fennel soup, and grilled cheese...seriously great food. Comfort with an upscale twist. Highly recommended even if you’re not in the area.

Text: I have been a fan of WSL since moving to KC almost five years ago. They effortlessly combine upscale comfort food, amazing creative craft cocktails, a quicky fun staff, and a cozy casual environment into a well rounded experience that will make you never want to leave, and once you do, only make you want to go back.
