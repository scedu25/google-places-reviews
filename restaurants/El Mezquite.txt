Text: WORST SERVICE  BY MOHAWK DUDE!!! 4 Of us went in after a day on the river. Waiter slammed plates down, didn't  refill drinks, or chips when one of the people with us asked for more. He also sat a plate on top of my husbands phone. When asking for boxes he ignored us. After my friend  commented on the terrible service, he punched the nearby table. My husband left a tip, while the rest of us agreed he didn't  deserve one. The waiter then tore it up and threw it out the door located in the bar where sitting.  We are a group of middle aged people. No one ordered alcohol, and a couple of us have been waitresses in our time. Too bad none of us will go back because the food was great, but who wants to be treated like that? The manager apologized as well as another man when confronted about the tip being ripped up.
