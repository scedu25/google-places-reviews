Text: My favorite part about Wings Over Athens, the size of their wings!!! They were big boys! Do yourself a favor, support local business and leave Buffalo Wild Wings alone... WoA has all the answers you need!

Text: Boneless wings were very chewy and difficult to eat because they are so large. Sauce was good, fries were okay. Delivery driver was rude.

Text: To die for Wings with tons of flavors. Waffle fries and onion rings just as good!
