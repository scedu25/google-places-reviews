Text: The food was very good and the staff were quite nice. Kind of confusing when you first walk in, must go to the right to pay.
Definitely give their mac n cheese a try. Delicious.

Text: Looked like a great buffet, but you can order from menue. Very good, generous fish sandwich. We're definitely coming back for the buffet. The desserts looked really good! - W

Text: Went on the train ride then my boys were starving. I didn't want a chain restaurant or fast food. Looked it up online and this place looked like the perfect place. Went there at 4pm and the food was hot and fresh. I just wish my appetite was bigger. The bourbon chicken was AWESOME!
