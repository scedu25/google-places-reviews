Text: Looking for some good BBQ in Bellevue?  This place ain't no Famous Dave's and that's a good thing. Their brisket is tender and moist and their hot barbecue is hot. I have made this place my Thursday thing. I will admit the way you order is a bit strange, but quite efficient.

Text: All in the pool can give you a great taste of the main menu items.  I would not recommend their cornbread.  It is rather dry.
