Ruby Tuesday
Rating: 4
Text: Good food at competitive prices. One of the best salad bars around. Great service from both waitress and manager. We travel a lot so we use Ruby Tuesday often. Great e-club coupons.

Text: The food was great, and the environment relaxing. I would have enjoyed the evening more if I had felt we were not imposing on the staff in staying long especially when there was no shortage of available tables.

Text: Food was great! They even fixed the burger. Hostess girl needs to stop creeping on people in booth next to her stand. Though.

Text: They have made some well needed improvements to the selections they have in their salad bar.  They also had a pretty good Veterans Day deal, better than most.

Text: The food is okay.  The service is something to be desired.  The hostess lacked enthusiasm and welcoming vibe.  The server was good.
