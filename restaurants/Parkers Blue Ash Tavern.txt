Text: My wife and I went here for dinner, on the recommendation of a Staff Member at Hyatt Place. We did not know the area offerings. Eric did!
 We had a fine dinner, in a family friendly environment. Very good food and service, not cheap, but a great meal experience(4.5 out of 5.0)! Go there,you will be glad you did. Call ahead see if you need a reservation; can't hurt.

Text: Good to try just once. It ain't "all that"!
Happy hour had some good prices on Appetizers, but not on cocktails.
Prices are disproportionate with the servings and value.
We had the cedar plank salmon, which is good; and the shrimp vodka, which is too spicy for me, and had about 5 medium sized shrimp.
Can't recommend them because we don't want a second visit.

Text: Classy place. Good food, good draft selection. A bit pricey for a pint, but the environment suits the price. Recommended for a date night or a nice professional lunch. Oh, and Sunday brunch is fantastic.

Text: As soon as we entered the place we knew we had chosen well.  The bar end of the restaurant was cozy, with a real wood burning fireplace that beckoned you to stay awhile.  Our waitress was very engaging and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend the Rainbow Trout and their Mac & Cheese.
