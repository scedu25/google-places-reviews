Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan
Rating: 3
Text: We spent a night here Mother's Day weekend which was also graduation weekend for Kansas State University.  We didn't have the best service, but it was explained to us that they had 2 new employees and the manager was on lunch break.  After a couple of hours, they did finally get us settled into a nice room.  My little nephews and I did have fun in the swimming pool while my mom and sister relaxed in the hot tub.  Breakfast buffet was good.

Text: I was worn out and dehydrated when I got to Four Points. I was moving across country driving a rental truck with my 2 cats. This place was great. Yes. There was a little noise from the pool area but it is called a 'resort' for a reason. Room service was fantastic!!! The burger and desert were delicious. Even the french fries were excellent with little bottles of ketchup. The staff was very good. Room service staff was the best!  The price made it even better.

Text: Poolside room we were given initially smelled incredibly musty, but upon asking the front desk we were given a better room that didn't smell. Shampoo and conditioner were empty in the shower the first day but otherwise the stay was excellent. Bar stayed open late on our last night to honor the coupons we got with our stay.

Text: Hotel was clean for the most part and the staff was friendly. A couple of things that could have been mentioned and or offered. 1 the ice machine on my floor was broken and turned off, would have been good to mention that. 2 was there were 2 weddings and my wife and had to get up early for a race the next morning. This was talked about with the front desk and it would have been nice to offer a room not facing the atrium where it was so loud. I called and asked but could get one.
