Text: This brewpub was great! I had the pizza and homemade root beer and tried a few beers!outside patio with the bean bag game to play and extremely friendly staff. After a few drinks the river walk is right down the way for a nice stroll!

Text: Fantastic place to go. The environment is great. No loud, obnoxious drunks. Great food always made fresh. And they remeber their customers. Beer selection is great, with good seasonal options. 
Voted the top brewery in Indiana by yelp, and now listed as one of the top 25 breweries in the country. It's worth the visit.

Text: This is one of those local gems that is an absolute must-visit kind of place. The pizza is awesome, some of the appetizers could be a whole meal (in fact I get the 'shrooms all the time as my meal), and the beer on tap is really incredible! The outdoor seating is awesome! And the inside has an atmosphere that, you just kinda want to be there. Hard to pronounce name, not hard to understand why this place is so popular!
