Text: Great atmosphere, wonderful staff and good food. I recommend ordering the poutine, it was excellent and the calamari was delicious. Get the tumbleweed shake if you like a milkshake with an adult kick on it. I would recommend for a high end date night or taking clients out. I will be back for more of this amazing steak house.

Text: An absolutely wonderful dinner from start to finish. Started with the sheared tuna for an appetizer and then got a variety of salads. I loved the mozzarella & tomato salad. It was an Italian explosion of flavor. The house salads we're good as well. Lastly, the steaks were some of the best I've had. My family enjoyed all of their steaks as well. Such a great experience and good service too. Will be back!! I recommend a old fashion for a starting cocktail and an aviator for dessert.

Text: I have been here a few times and now i am done revisiting. The food is good, but for the price i can name countless other places i would rather go. Personally when i spend 100$ i would like to leave feeling satisfied and i am not.
