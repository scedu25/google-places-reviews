Livengoods Pub and Grill
Rating: 2
Text: Pros: The salad bar was good and the waitress was very friendly. 
Cons:
1. The cod was cold in the middle and had to be sent back. Fortunately, it was the right color so it had clearly been pre cooked. Serving raw fish would have been zero stars!
2. The waitress forgot my drink order and came to ask me again twice. 
3. I ordered the Cabernet, which is typically red, but got something white. So it was either listed incorrectly or the bar staff made a mistake.
4. We were brought the wrong bill. When she brought us the second bill, two items were missing, and therefore had to bring us a third bill. 
Overall, they really need to improve their service.
