Gerst Haus

Text: I'm not into German food so I can't rate that. Simply because I would give an unfair negative review. So I am rating their beer selection, customer service, and atmosphere (I like the old buildings). 

Great selection of beer and friendly service. If you like german food then... Give it a shot as well!

Text: Gerst house beer is great.  Corn beef and cabbage was really good.  I will come back every time I come to town.  Found my new Favorite!

Text: Instead of raving about the terrific food in general terms, I'll just say that the spaetzle (fluffy pasta chunks in just the right amount of a dark, rich mushroom gravy) was way up there in my lifetime food experiences.  Plus, the folks working there were more flexible and accommodating than anybody would ever hope for.

Text: Always enjoy an occasional German restaurant.  Discovered Evansville had one.  Glad we drove over (1.5 hour drive) from Southern Illinois.  Great food coupled with a great wait staff.  Will be back on a more regular basis.

Text: Came here while on a business trip. Wow, the food was amazing, clean dining area,  and a great staff. Beer selection was very authentic and at reasonable prices. Stroganoff was as good as my grandma's!
