Text: It was my first time there.  Birthday dinner for a long time friend. Dinner was good. But like I stated, it was a birthday dinner. My friend told the waitress it was her birthday when she first came over. A little while later the waitresses acknowledged another patron's birthday with a candle lit dessert and a song. My friend however never had this experience. Her Birthday gift bag & card were in plain sight the entire time we were there.

Text: Great food and atmosphere!! The staff all worked well together between seating customers,  taking and delivering orders promptly and clearing tables for those who were waiting. There is a private room for those who  have larger parties or have a private event. Personally tried the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger....fanominal!! For Dessert... BlackBerry Cobbler w/ Vanilla ice cream...delicious! Will be returning for another wonderful dining experience.

Text: I've known of this place since high school but didn't start my patronage until about 2 years ago. The bartenders are always friendly, I never have trouble with parking and the house beer rotation had much variety. Their fruit wheat beer is seasonal and super tasty (we had blueberry tonight). And the food had never disappointed my palate.

Text: Skip the ribs and brisket, stick to the burgers, etc. Ribs and brisket were dry, definitely needed the BBQ sauce. House beers are good though. Had 2 different IPAs, and the Hefeweizen, very tasty.
