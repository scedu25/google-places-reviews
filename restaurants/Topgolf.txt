Text: I love Top Golf! Absolutely fabulous experience every time I step in this location. Primarily due to the fact that the Event Sales Coordinator, Kara, is phenomenal at her job in literally every aspect. From start to finish she handles each event with perfection & there is never any problems! Next time you're interested in any events at all with this location, ask for Kara, you will not be disappointed.

Text: Came here for a birthday ? Party it was a wonderful experience. Top golf staff here? really go above beyond for their guests' guests. Was nice to have the manager come by and show how the game is played. The food selection was amazing, the range amazing and the game amazing. Totally loved it and recommend!

Text: Topgolf U is a great golf clinic inside Topgolf with a couple resident Pros (Matt & Ryan) available to fine tune your swing. I've been going to Matt. He turned my physical and mental golf game around 180. I considered quitting golf for the season but glad I didn't. Up to 4 lessons now and it's so much fun to aggressively see your game improve each week. I couldn't shoot under 100 this year but with lessons and practice (between lessons) I'm shooting low 90's with confidence I can keep dropping. It's not a coincidence.

Text: Service = 5/5
Experience = 3/5
Food = 2/5
Drinks = 2/5
Notes: Large work party of mostly non-golfers spent 3 hours on rainy Saturday afternoon. Only the good company made it worthwhile. Waitress was sweet and brought drinks promptly and smelled like vanilla cupcakes.

Text: Went for a work outing.  Had a fun time, service was good. However, they started cleaning up our food before asking us if we were done or letting us take anything home.  There were only 10 of us, and it was done through catering.  Not sure if that had something too dio with it.
