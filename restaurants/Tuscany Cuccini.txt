Text: Fabulous! Food is served hot. Excellent staff. You won't find guys like Chef Francisco Ortiz in many places like Gallipolis, Ohio. A very nice man. A good dessert menu. The menu has changed.
Great management. Cleanliness.

We were down for the Mothman Festival and randomly chose this place for lunch. I will drive an hour and 18 minutes from home to eat here again.
