Text: Always a fun and relaxed, albeit, mixed crowd. Esp during warm weather. On the river, so boat up, drive up,  bike up. Great service and staff.

Text: Great location on Fox River. Clean and inviting restaurant. Exceptional service, food and beer with a laid-back atmosphere! I enjoyed the ambiance of sitting either inside with a panoramic view of the river or outside on the deck. Boats can pull right up for service as well. Live bands come often and I also enjoy the car shows on Tuesday nights!

Text: This is a great place on the lower fox river to eat, drink and some great entertainment. Service was good both times I went. The only thing I can tell you is stick to the meat, do not eat the fish!! My waitresses warned me not to eat the fish, and I did anyway, and I sent it back for a burger. They need to seriously improve their fish tacos.

Text: The food looked good but unfortunately my friend and I waited 15 minutes and were ignored so we couldn't even get a beer. The place was not busy when we went. There were more waiting staff than customers. I was disappointed because the location is cool but the service was non-exisitant. I would have loved to try the food but had to leave because we seemed virtually invisible to the entire staff.
