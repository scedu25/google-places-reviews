Text: Merrick's has been our favorite place to eat for years. Getting to know Jacki & Bob & there family was an added bonus. Was sad to see them sell it but understand why. We still eat there as Denise has kept things pretty much the same. Also get to have Amy, Kristi and Rebecca wait on us.

Text: Waiter never followed up with us after we placed our order. Food was not home cooked like advertised, my chicken sandwich looked like a Tyson chicken patty you could purchase from the store. Chicken fried steak was not home cooked either. Mashed potatoes were good. Had high hopes and was disappointed in food and service.
