B&C Barbeque
Rating: 4
Text: Hands down the best BBQ in Wichita. The staff is awesome and they go out of their way to help you. The only reason I give a 4 star is that the owner keeps all tips if you put the tips on your debit card receipt. I always tip in cash whenever possible. They definitely deserve it.

Text: The food is really good, and you should absolutely go. The only reason they got 4 instead of 5 stars is because I got my food to go and was belittled for going to the checkout line not realizing that my food needed to be weighed; I had just followed the people I was behind in line to the register. No one stopped me to get my food weighed on the way there, no sign near where the food is weighed, and there was no one getting their food weighed, so I just figured it would be done at the checkout. As the manager very rudely informed me, I needed to "get back to the weigh station". After I apologized for my ignorance, he continued to watch me like a hawk until I left. I understand, but if you're so worried about it, maybe let people know where the weigh area is and don't be a jerk about it. Great food though. I will definitely go back.

Text: This place has the best barbeque set up that I've been to. The selection is just right, not too much. Plenty of seating and not a wait at all. I wish they were open for dinner also.

Text: Awesome all u can eat BBQ. They have every meat from chopped brisket, pulled pork, ribs to smoked chicken and turkey and some more in between.. they also have a small salad bar and sliced white, wheat, or rye breads. They also have unlimited fountain drinks. Friendly wait staff and reasonable prices.
