Text: We live 45 miles away from this restaurant. We have eaten here several times as in this town there is not much choice at all. The food is not too bad. Not great but ok. We were there recently and ordered food to go. Which was again a bad choice. We were shorted on our food again. We have gotten meals that we eat there before and we pretty much always get the same thing. So we know the serving sizes. We got one dish that is covered in sauce.  We got a tiny little plastic container of sauce to use. maybe two tablespoons??? We always get the rice substituted for beans. So essentially we get a double order of beans. Well We barely got a little dab of beans. We ordered corn shells and got flour. Someone just didn't pay attention or didn't care. This only happens when we get it to go. Can't say the other place in town is any better so oh well..This is what is available. Take it or leave it. Have to agree with another comment that the salsa could sure be improved. Watery and poor flavor. Oh and No chips go with it when you get take out. Really??? *sigh* Oh well.

Text: Decent food. Not very authentic. Cheap store bought tortillas. Priced accordingly though. The salsa was like it was ran through a blender, very runny !! I probably wouldn't go back !!
