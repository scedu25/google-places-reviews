Text: Owners (?) were 25 minutes late opening. They were ready to take orders immediately as their children sat at what looks like their usual table, closest to the counter. 

I had a lunch special of Orange chicken with 2 excellent crab Rangoons and very plain fried rice with a speck of fried egg and a dark hair. I ordered the orange chicken because it had great reviews but I found the chicken a bit difficult to chew. The sauce was not too heavy or too sweet but there was also no spice which I am use to with this dish. I also ordered a Cheese and steak egg roll that was very good.  

Service was friendly and they seem to cook to order although I don't know know they were able to deep fry my chicken and cook rice moments after opening. Perhaps someone was here earlier then left to get the rest of the family ???

We are just passing through so I doubt if we will return but I'm sure it's worth a try. I may have caught them on an off day.
