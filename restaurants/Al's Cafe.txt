Text: A bit pricey to take the whole family but always great tasting food. Depends on who's working if you get good service. The good food makes up for lack of good service. Great date night or girls night option.

Text: Does not take debit or credit cards. Very important because it is at least 6 miles to the nearest ATM. Must be great food because a train stopped on the tracks and the engineer and another guy walked over for a bite to eat. 
After a drive to the ATM and back I enjoyed a good meal. Chips do not come with the meal but order some of the flour chips. Enjoyed it very much.
