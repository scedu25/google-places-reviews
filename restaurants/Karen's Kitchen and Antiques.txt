Text: When they're cooking the food, it doesn't take forever for them to make it.  They don't toss it out in 30 seconds either, though.  It takes a certain amount of time to make a burger or other food correctly so that it tastes excellent (and it's nice that, as opposed to fast food, it's real meat - not this 30% beef stuff that you get at Taco Bell and McDonalds).  They take just enough time to make the food well and not a bit longer.  It's definitely worth the money and I'd recommend it to anyone eating in Tribune.
