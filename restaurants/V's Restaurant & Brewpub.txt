V's Restaurant & Brewpub
Rating: 5
Text: Dined here late one evening, around 10:30. Only restaurant open that late for miles around, except a couple fast food places. We had excellent service from a friendly server. Good-size portions with good food. I loved the cinnamon roll! And sports on TV--hard to beat.

Text: Good was very good! I had a burger and my husband had the hot beef sandwich. The portions we good sized....I took home 1/2 my burger! A little noisy while we were ordering but other than that I can't complain!

Text: If you like craft beer, and who in their right mind doesn't, V's should be on your bucket list.  Better yet your Iowa Brewers Guild map! If you are on the "Lite" side in your tastes, their Cream Ale is the Cream Soda of the beer world, the Helles is also a decent option. If you have gone to the "Dark side", any stout here will please you. That said, the Belgian Tripel is "Mothers' Milk" in a glass. Oh, and if you prefer your food on a plate instead of in a glass, they make it in house, they make it well, and if you have an issue, they make it right. GO THERE or miss out on the best this area has to offer.

Text: My husband and I stopped here on our way to visit family and we were so glad we did! The smoked "naked" fried chicken was amazing! My grilled tenderloin was great too. Real mashed potatoes, excellent homemade desserts (German Chocolate Dump Cake was yummy!), and very friendly staff! We'll definitely stop here again next time we are in the area. Good find.
