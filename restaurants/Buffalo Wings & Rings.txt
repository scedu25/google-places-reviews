Text: Great Crew. Bartender is excellant. Close down way too early. If its a slow night they force you out.

Text: Good selection of wings. I like dry wings more, but this is pretty good for wet wings. The parmesan garlic fries are great.

Text: Giving this restaurant a 5 because the servers we normally have are amazing and the food is always good - we also tip 15-20%. My SO orders his wings atomic every time (and we normally go 1-2 times a week for the past few months) so a lot of the wait staff and kitchen staff are acquainted with us at this point (apparently he's one of the few regulars that orders atomic, according to a waitress. We've also had a kitchen staff member bring our food to us before and acknowledge my SO as 'the atomic guy'). Had an issue with our only drink refills taking 40 minutes, management contacted me over Facebook and were extremely professional and nice about resolving the issue.

Text: The atmosphere in this restaurant is amazing. In my opinion, they serve the absolute best wings you can get around here. The price is average for a sports bar. Their food is top notch, worth every penny. The service is also very good. Great for groups, family, or dates with your honey. Visit here every so often.
