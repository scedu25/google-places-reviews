Text: Very nice place. Even had a nice little band... could not tell you how the service was because we bought a beer on the outside and brought it in with us.We never got served or  no one even acknowledge that we were there. An hour later we just got up and left. I don't think that they even missed us.

Text: I had my wedding reception in the moonlight room.  I would never recommend this to anyone.  When we first arrived they had the room set up wrong and didn't have a bridal party table set up.  There was not coffee and the pop was being carried up in pitchers from down stairs and had no syrup (flavor).  The food had been set up already, which was not suppose to happen until the bridal party arrived so by the time by guests ate, it was cold.  The two waiters, (including Brandon who is the manager) kept leaving out a back door and when they would return, they would reek of marijuana.  These two did nothing as my aunt was clearing the empty plates from my guest tables.  They did not cut and plate my cake as I was promised they would, and there is a giant hole (2 feet wide 3 feet deep) at the edge of the dance floor that children could easily fall in.  I was not offered any type of discount for all of the issues and they still had the nerve to add a $400 gratuity onto the bill.   I am appalled and disgusted with this place!
