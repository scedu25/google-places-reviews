Text: I had a bad experience with this place a couple years ago and decided to give it another chance. It's "seat yourself" and somewhere between 15 to 20 minutes of sitting there after we sat down (you have to wait to be handed menus and that took quite a while), we finally just gave up. Last time I went there a couple years ago, only one plate of food was brought out even though the rest of us had ordered salads and we had a very hard time getting the waitresses' attention even though it was empty in the middle of the day. Maybe I've just had multiple bad experiences and the food is brilliant, but the atmosphere was depressing and it was some of the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant.

Text: Great food. Steak sandwich was perfect. Just the right amount of fries.  Help is friendly.  The owner is working the floor also.

Text: Been coming here since I was a kid, so 25 years or so. I can't get past that gyro dinner, it is so good. I don't even try gyros anywhere else now because their not as good.
They also have backlava, it not quite as good as my mom makes, but it's passable.
 The old style crinkle cut fries are good as well.

Text: Had a gyro dinner, and the meat and pita was excellent. As is traditional, onion and tomato were served with it, but only a single bland tomato slice and a disk of onion which are difficult to nicely assemble into a sandwich, were served with two sandwiches worth of meat. The meal would have been greatly improved by having the option of rice and hummus rather than just a baked potato or fries.
