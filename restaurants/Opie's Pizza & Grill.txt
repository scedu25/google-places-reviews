Text: Always a great experience to go back home and eat at Opie's. A family restaurant with salad bar and a buffet you can also order from the menu always great table service their waitresses and waiters are top-notch. The food is always hot prepared fresh daily their Fried Chicken and their homemade cheesecake tops the menu in my opinion. How is clean bathrooms oh is clean tables and Floors has multiple rooms for bigger parties you can schedule a multitude of different events to host for luncheons or dinners. I do believe they recently started catering. They also deliver a great place to check out.
