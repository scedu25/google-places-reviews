Text: Great food, and a beautiful restaurant. Some of the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. Looking forward to coming back for dinner!

Text: Really tasty food and great prices! I had the chorizo hash and it was fantastic; I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. My friend got the harvest Benedict and loved it. I wasn't a big fan of the bloody Mary as I found it pretty intense in flavor, but my friend liked how spicy it was. Definitely going back!
