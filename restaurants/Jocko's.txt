Text: Place was clean. Our waitress was very friendly. This was my birthday dinner. I would love to see the wonderful salad bar serve pizza as well. We had excellent service.

Text: Ordered a beef (they did not dip it or put peppers on it so I basically got bread and dry beef for $8 ?) and fries (extra .99, tasteless and no salt. Made with no kind of love) Was hoping for something extremely delicious after driving into town from Texas. Waste of money unless you enjoy tasteless, loveless food.

Text: Always enjoyed the salad bar and the regular thin crust pizza.... Tried the Italian Chicken and it was delicious, if you want something other than a tomato based sauce with toppings!!!
