Text: Can I rate higher than 5 stars?

My boyfriend and I were in town from Michigan to visit some of his relatives in Green Castle. Since we're from out of town we turned to google maps and found this place. Immediately upon walking in we are greeted by Angela, the sweetest woman we've ever met. Once we were seated and ordered appetizers, we noticed we'd showed up right before they closed, but when we apologized for coming in so late they not only stayed and chatted with us for a while but continued giving incredible, friendly service. This is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Not only was the food absolutely INCREDIBLE, the staff was EVEN BETTER! We would be returning on Tuesday before we leave if they weren't closed on Tuesday's! We will absolutely be returning any time we are back in town.
