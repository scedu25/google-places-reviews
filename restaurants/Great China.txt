Great China

Text: Best egg rolls! Chinese food is my weakness and this place is by far my favorite. I've tried just about all the Chinese food places around. (I wish I was kidding but I'm not!) It's in a small strip mall with not much going on around it but don't be fooled. You will NOT be disappointed. I have so many great things to say about this restaurant and the owners/staff that this review will not do them justice. Eat here! Seriously.

Text: If you are used to eating food similar to what you may find at a Miyako's or Ban Thai, or even Panda Express, this is not the place for you. 
The prices are cheap, and  the person who took our order was nice, but it was nothing like other Chinese food we have tasted.  We took a few bites,  discarded what was left, and off we went. 
I think it is great that the restaurant has so many likes. Different strokes for different folks, and the restaurant gets to stay in business:)

Text: Always good food!  Seems to be a hardworking family.  Appears to do a nice carryout business.  I enjoy the cashew chicken personally.
