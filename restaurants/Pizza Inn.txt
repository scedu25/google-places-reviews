Pizza Inn

Text: The best salad bar! Pizza choices not bad...sometimes only 2 choices put out and they run out quickly. On our last visit though, the waitresses were cleaning the plastic guards above food with a spray cleaner, even if it's non toxic it's just the idea. We won't stop going, just really wish they weren't allowed to do this. It should be cleaned before the food is in place and at closing.

Text: I wish I had one of these by me. Great buffet, pizza and unlimited ice cream. If you are on a diet beware.
