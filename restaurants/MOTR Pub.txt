MOTR Pub
Rating: 5
Text: MOTR is a great bar with live music, as well as a very decent brunch and burger. If you enjoy live music, visiting is a must. A number of big names have performed here, as well as local and up-and-coming bands from all over the country. This is a beer and basic mixed drink type of place, with posters adorning the walls of the band's who have graces the stage. I'm the basement, there are pinball machines and a secondary venue.

Text: Friendly, and quick bartenders even though there was a good size crowd. Enjoyed the live band "The New Royals" they had that night. Room to dance if you choose or hang back and mingle if dancing isnt your thing. Reasonably priced drinks and some really cool vintage decor.
