Stefano's Italian Cafe

Text: Cool Italian elegance with traditional favorites. Conservative, reliably good. Delicious salad dressings made in House leave you wanting more (hence, salads SHOULD come with endless refills), coffee and tea are brewed, strong but never bitter. Cozy and warm, a hit with Townies.

Text: Excellent Italian cuisine. Cozy bar, dining room, and outdoor patios.  Original Italian dishes plus steaks and seafood.  Handsome selection of liquors, beers and wines.  Great and friendly service.  The menu is well priced for the average person or family.

Text: My wife and I used to live close and would love to have dinner outside here during the summers.  Great Italian food and the lamb bolognese is incredible.  They have great pizzas as well.

Text: Food was decent at best... not sure it's worth the price. Water was gross. Service was really good though.
