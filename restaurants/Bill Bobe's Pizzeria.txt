Bill Bobe's Pizzeria

Text: Best Pizza in Vincennes.  Never forget to get the deep dish. Service can suffer at times, but this is usually because it can get very busy there. Don't recommend it for a lunch break, but its a great place to sit and get some good pizza. Lunch special has been good to me for 15 years.

Text: Good pizza. Salad bar is way too expensive for what it is. I come here for their sausage. It's phenomenal. Pizza prices can't compete with chains but they aren't outrageous. Large 1 topping, 2 drinks, 4 breadstix and a trip to the salad bar for about $30.

Text: Great lunch specials that are a lot of food. I am an eater and was so full I had to forfeit a piece of my pizza... Will be back again for sure.
