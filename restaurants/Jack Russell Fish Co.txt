Text: This place is awesome. The wait staff was great. Fish tacos are the show here, along with the red beans and rice. 
A thought for the owner!
We loved your food, and definitely would have come back the next night but we tried Chinese and it was inedible. Offer out of city travels a appetizer to come back. 
We'll still be back. Keep up the great work and say thanks to the staff!!

Update: 
Another Grand Slam by this place and their staff. Visited Sept. 2nd. We visited again with 10 people, 4 smalls. Delivered our kids menu first to let the adults to enjoy our meal. Everything we ordered was outstanding. We ate out on the patio and the kids loved it.
