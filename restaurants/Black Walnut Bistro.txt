Black Walnut Bistro
Rating: 4
Text: The Black Walnut Bistro is conveniently located in Hermann, MO on 1st Street.  There is ample parking in front of the restaurant.  The food was very good, and dietary accommodations are readily met.  I was able to substitute the pasta for a gluten free version and dairy was easily removed from my selections.  If you are a dessert fan try the apple cake, it was delicious, perfect for fall.  Our service was wonderful!   Jane made our visit delightful.  We would definitely go back.

Text: Tomato bisque was wonderful. However, the pasta was over priced and over cooked. Chicken in the sauce was dry. We waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order and over n hour after we ordered for our food. We had to ask for the status of our starters. Would not recommend it.

Text: We have Girl’s Weekend in Hermann every November and this is our favorite restaurant!  Even though we didn’t have a reservation the staff accommodated us. The Brussels sprouts are fantastic!  Every bite of our pasta was amazing and Jane was a fantastic server!
