Weber's Restaurant & Boutique Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Everything was great at Weber's!  I flew in for a three day business trip and from the time I walked into the lobby too I left the customer service was superb!  It's an older hotel but very clean, good food but best of all the entire staff was fantastic!  I had room service everyday (prefer coffee/breakfast in my room) and then snack at night...the delivery staff was incredibly friendly and fast service!  The meeting rooms were set up great, coffee, water, snacks and great lunch provided... everything meet or exceeded my expectations.  Thank you Weber's for a great stay!

Text: We stayed on the 3rd floor, pool side for a Saturday night. The faint smell of the pool hit us when got there, but we got used to it. It was ok. There was a large wedding reception until 10pm and children carrying on until about that time. We could hear it all, but we planned to stay up late anyway. It is a family-friendly, nice place. Met some cool people at the pool/hot tub.

Text: Went to Weber's Restaurant for breakfast. Was a simple menu of standard fare. Good quality food. My links sausage was good. Had home made fruit preserves that we're exceptional. Not very crowded. I liked it but wish they had items like custom omelets.

Text: Most of the reasonable Ann Arbor hotels are well used, and give you the Willy's.    Weber's is not more money , but clean modern and updated.  The amenities are actually surprising.

I was especially surprised by the reasonable price for top notch food and  the entertainment nightly in Habitat the bar lounge.

This is now my go to place when in town!
