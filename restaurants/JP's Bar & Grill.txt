Text: NOT handicap accessible. Requires two steps up from street and ramp from street at end of block is crazy far away. Front entrance also has a step. Garden entrance has no step this is nice, but in winter will that be open? Even if it is, then it's a long walk from garden entrance to inside dining area. Food was very good though, waitress friendly and prices reasonable. Just don't expect every member of your family to be able to join your dining experience.

Text: Never a bad time. Great outdoor bar, even in winter. And K-9 friendly if you're walking the dog and need some suds.
