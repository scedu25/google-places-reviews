Roma Pizza

Text: My friend and I decided to take a random exit and find a pizza place today (July 2017) and stumbled upon this little gem.  We were surprised to actually find a pizza place as the first restaurant in sight.  It's small and cute and we felt so welcomed even towards the end of the night.  I think our waitress' name was Shelly.  We got our drinks and food quick and it was excellent.  The place was clean and comfortable.  Everyone just seemed genuinely kind and took care of us.  I'm picky with pizza and the standard version was great.  Perfect crust :)  we found our new tradition spot everytime we head home on our trip back from Michigan.

Text: Food was fresh and delicious, and our service was top notch. Our group had several dishes: chicken fettuccine, both raviolis, the lasagna, and two pizza turn overs (PTOs). Every Italian Dinner came with a mini loaf of garlic bread, so we ended up with a ton of bread that we didn't eat. Getting ranch dressing was an added bonus for the PTO.

Text: Great place and great workers. Too bad New Buffalo doesn't have a Dominos though.
