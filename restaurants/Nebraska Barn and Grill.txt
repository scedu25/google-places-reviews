Text: We stopped in a few minutes before 10:00 PM thinking they were open till 11:00 and even though they were actually closing up they encouraged us to stay. I chose the salad bar and was pleasantly surprised to find it fresh and full that close to closing. Our waitress, Sarah was very friendly and helpful. Everyone enjoyed their meals, we will hopefully be able to return before traveling on.

Text: We conveniently walked over from Motel, Comfort Inn.  On the menu is a Whiskey Tango and is a Whiskey Marinated Steak and hubby said it is absolutely delicious!!!  And of course, Nebraska's beef cattle are corn fed, not grain fed, as they are where we reside, so that makes the beef taste even better.  Service was excellent as well.

Text: We were passing through and decided to stop for something to eat. We walked in and stood there for about five minutes wondering if it was a western museum, or a restaurant. Nobody was there to greet us, so we just walked around until a lady noticed us. I ordered a steak with waffle fries. The wait was kinda long, but figured it looked like a new place so it wasn't bad. After getting our food we quickly found out that the only thing consumable were the drinks. Steak was cold and chewy, and my wife's food was cold. I wish the food was as good as it looked!

Text: Took forever to get drinks,  orders wrong, most cold,  salad came with the core chopped in it.   Very disappointing. Out of a lot of things.

Text: Nothing fancy the food and the service was wonderful. Our food came out fast and hot. Oh, did I mention that the prices are also great!
