Text: the food was very good, i was pleasantly surprised when the pancake i had tasted like pumpkin spice! i can see where you would want to know in advance if you don’t like that sort of thing though. the place was packed when i went (sunday morning), service was very good.

Text: Quiet chill place to study/read. First, it was intimidating because it seemed like a fancy restaurant, but as I went often enough, got more comfortable. Tuesday is great Irish music evening, and great coffee all the time with nice decoration!

Text: When the host takes your name and tells you to stand out by the sign, don’t. He will forget about you indefinitely. Good food, very seasoned/salty potatoes. Friendly wait staff.

Text: Fantastic restaurant in an old house. I've been there for breakfast as well as coffee and dessert. I will go back some time for dinner. Their selections are interesting, and the service and quality is great. A must go place?

Text: stopped in on a whim for Sunday brunch. It's a little on the pricey side. Also, Sunday at noon is their busiest time. Food was good - I had the corned beef hash with two eggs. They're known for their coffees, but the decaf i had was consistently lukewarm at best.
