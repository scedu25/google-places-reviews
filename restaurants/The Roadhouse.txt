Text: Food is Ok, Salad bar is basic, the inside of restaurant needs a refresher everything looks like it’s from your grandmothers house or is old , faded, outdated. Overall atmosphere was  out of the 70’s . Not to busy in fact it was a wait to get someone to notice that there was life waiting to be seated. Makes one wonder how fresh food is if the granulated auger packets are solid masses and have to be broken up for coffee. The table ware and table clothes worn from age. 
They need to refresh and stimulate customers with advertisements and excitement for dining and food , without relying on the bar and slots.  Choose one or the other . One is self driven the other needs work.

Text: Great hospitality and food. If you want a steak, this is the place to go. Makes you take a step back in time, the design and decor make you feel like you are on the frontier. Would definitely come back again and recommend to my friends. Very adorable also!

Text: Very interesting place to eat. The food was excellent, with both a hot bar and cold salad bar. We enjoyed talking to our waitress and hearing about the ghosts. We'll go back.
