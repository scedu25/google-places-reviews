Text: Super cheap, beyond decent food. This is true Italian pizza, if you don't know what that is, you won't like their pizza. I thought it was fantastic. The Mac n cheese n spaghetti are worth the price alone! Great place, would give 5 stars, but giving the small selection I'm giving 4. Check it out if ever in Maryville!!!

Text: I had heard this place was delicious. Now I can confirm it myself. One of the best, if not the best pizza buffets I've ever had.
