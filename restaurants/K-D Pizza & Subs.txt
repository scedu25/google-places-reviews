K-D Pizza & Subs
Rating: 5
Text: The subs are some of the best selections you will find around and they even come in a combo. Drivers are willing to bring your food practically anywhere you are and the prices are fair. The pizza is okay and wings not to bad. Amazing salads and friendly staff

Text: This used to be our go to place for subs.  The mgmt has changed and the food has gone downhill.  The subs were cold, the mozzarella sticks were overcooked and no cheese left inside. This has happened the last three times we ordered. Three strikes...never going back.
