Text: One of our two assigned bowling lanes (lane 6) kept turning itself off every twenty minutes. We were one of two groups of customers bowling and I don't know they assigned us to the only bad lane in the whole place. Food order of chicken strip basket and hotdog took 30 minutes to be served because "equipment was deep cleaned earlier that day and hadn't been turned back on"...until 9pm when we ordered. Guess they didn't expect customers to order food on a Friday night. Popcorn was stale. Place was clean. The kids working there were attentive and did their best to keep things running. Bowling balls didn't glow during Cosmic bowling. We managed to have a good time bowling but will likely never return...even though we were given vouchers for free games because of the lane trouble.
