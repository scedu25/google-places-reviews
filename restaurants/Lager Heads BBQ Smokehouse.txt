Lager Heads BBQ Smokehouse

Text: My husband and I like to try new places for dinner. We drove an hour and a half to get here and it was worth every minute. Our waitress was fantastic and went way above and beyond for us when she discovered we we're from out of town. We literally came here for the pork rinds and found out it was a smokehouse/brewery. All of their craft beers were original and there was a great selection. The food was some of the best smoked meat I have ever eaten. We shared a sampler platter and it was the perfect amount of food for both of us. Lots of sides are homemade and we're amazing. Homemade BBQ sauce as well and nothing was disappointing. I highly recommend this place and we will be back for sure. We even ordered dessert and our waitress went out of her way to make sure our dessert and ice cream made it the hour and a half drive home. Can't wait to come back here!!

Text: Nice selection of beer and decent quality BBQ foods. They are in a very rural setting and I wished they had a nicer outside sitting area. It is just a few tables crammed between the building, parking lot and AC system. This place could be so much more...

Text: Food, beer and atmosphere good. Service can be hit or miss. Great for good food close by. My favorite is steak wrap with loaded fries!

Text: Really good place. Seems like everyone has a micro brew and that’s the new fad. Well we don’t drink beer. The food and the BBQ was EXCELLENT.

Text: Love this place. Always great to get the draft beer right at the source. Menu is great, buy you have to like BBQ, otherwise, probably not a good choice.
