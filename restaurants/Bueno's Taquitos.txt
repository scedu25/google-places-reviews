Text: A bit of a hidden gem, as even on a busy thoroughfare you can easily drive by it if you're not paying attention. Very friendly service with a small, limited menu. The small menu means they get to focus their attention on kicking out good food. The chili verde smothered onto a burrito is excellent, and portions are huge. McCook is certainly not lacking for Mexican food restaurants, but Bueno's Taquitos holds its own against the competition. Bonus points for the salsa bar, featuring a couple delicious salsas.
