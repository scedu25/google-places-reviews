Namaste Indian Cuisine & Bar

Text: On a few occasions I have eaten at this restaurant at this new location off Ring Road and Dixie and at the old location off the I-65 at exit 94 (Executive Drive?). Every time I go I am floored at the staff and how wonderful they are. Always attentive, greeting patrons as they enter and watching to make sure they are filling empty glasses, taking care of your every need. Food is absolutely delicious. If you don't know what you want, they can help find something that will surely please your palate. A must stop when out for a drive or to feed that hunger. Vegan or not they can appease any appetite. Do try this establishment, again and again!

Text: Tried it for the first time. Always heard good things about it. Got my food and to be honest I was scared to try it because it looked weird but I did it anyways and immediately fell in love!! For sure one of my favorite restaurants now! I recommend the namaste curry lamb or goat and the cheese bread!

Text: If you are ever in the area definitely come here! The service was the best, our server/host greeted us as soon as we came in and continued to  exceed my expectations.  He gave us recommendations as it was our first time trying Indian food and coming to the restaurant. And when then food arrived it was amazing! I am definitely in love! Haha. (They also had a bunch of both vegetarian and vegan options.)  He makes sure our drinks stayed full but he wasn't like so attentive I felt like I'm being harassed LOL. I'm definitely coming back there again!
