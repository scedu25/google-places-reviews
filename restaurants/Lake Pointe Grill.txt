Text: I hosted a bridal shower in the banquet room for my sister a few weeks ago and Eric was our server that night.  He went above and beyond to make sure all of our guests were comfortable and taken care of.  He even offered to help hang some decorations that were out of our reach when he easily could have looked the other way and stuck to his "typical" duties.  Several other guests mentioned throughout the evening how impressed they were with his attentiveness and professionalism.  We loved going to lake pointe before the shower, but after this particular experience I'm convinced we will be hosting future parties here as well.  Thank you for helping to make our night perfect!
