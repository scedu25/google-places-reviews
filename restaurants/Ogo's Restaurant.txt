Text: They have really good Walleye on their buffet. Waitress did not refill my water glass though. Nice place! Most nights are better than this.

Text: 25 feet of all you can eat buffet. Decently priced, albeit a mostly generic menu as far as buffets go, but a great atmosphere and even better dinner specials make this place pretty great. Good old homestyle cooking

Text: My husband and I are very impressed with the amount of variety and the taste.  We went years ago, right after Ogo's came to Keokuk and didn't really enjoy the meal much.  We are so happy we came back!  
Delicious food, friendly staff.  Highly recommend!
