Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament
Rating: 4
Text: It was almost as cool as I remember it was when I went 20-some years ago. 
Downsides:
* Turns out my wife's allergies were really effected by the hoses (not sure if it was the horses, themselves, or the pollen and stuff from the stable they spend most of their time in)... so if you have allergies, you'll probably want to take some medication ahead of time. 
* Wasn't in love with the baked chicken. (For some reason I thought it used to be fried chicken.)
* Alcoholic beverages can be a bit pricey. 

Upsides: 
* It was really quite entertaining. It's clear that they all put in a good deal of time rehearsing the story and practicing the fights. The fights certainly weren't as fast-paced as something you'd see on TV, but I think that's to be expected (no professional stunt doubles, editing, or retakes), but the sound system really amplifies the clang of the weapon hits, so younger kids will be entertained. 
* Kind of the same as above but I felt it was worth it's own point: I really liked how they have the swords throw off sparks when they hit each other. (Maybe not the most realistic, but it definitely adds some extra flair to it!) 
* A bunch of the games that the knights perform are quite real tests of skill (like putting the tip of their joust through a small hanging ring while riding on a horse), and it's a nice mix between these games and the story parts. 
* I really liked the soup and the bread. 

All in all, it's a really fun treat for younger ones, and still plenty to enjoy for the adults. Probably not something you'd want to go to more than a couple of times a year, but still worth doing at least once.

Text: We always have a lot of fun at Medieval Times. The food is always served hot and is actually really good. The servers are friendly, polite and try to stay in character as much as possible. The show itself is well performed and the crowd really gets into it each time I've been there. If you have young kids expect them to beg for something from the stores in the foyer before going in for the show.
The king announced the names of all the people there for special occasions like Bday's, Anniversaries etc... 
 Overall I think the cost to go is pretty reasonable for the experience and dinner.

Text: My family went to the matinee today, and it was fun. Our team the red team won! Our server loved his job, it was really happy to see. He wasn't just doing the motions, he enjoyed it! Thanks for a good celebration.

Text: My girlfriend and I came here with our 4 year old son. Every single one of us had a blast! You get plenty of food through out the course of the show and the staff was very friendly and did exceptionally with handling young children. We had my son knighted by the king before the show began and he (along with my girlfriend and I) had a blast. Making this experience fun for the entire family.

Text: Fun family place to take the kids.  We came for dinner and show and it was totally a fun time.  Kids loved seeing the horses and knights in the show and rooting for our team.  We didn't win this day, but a good time was had anyways.  The food was great, it's a hearty meal for sure.  No utensils here, just your hands.  We upgraded to the celebration package and it was worth it.  It's a touristy type place so be prepared to pay for the souvenirs.
