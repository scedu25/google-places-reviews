Russell's Triangle Cafe
Rating: 5
Text: A "down home" family oriented restaurant.  The food is served fresh and hot.  The waitresses are experienced servers.  The portions are large and if you leave here hungry, that's on you.

Text: An amazing little hole in the wall. The food is not very expensive but quite good. They serve burgers that are nearly a pound big and have some amazing onion rings. I have really no complaints other than it was a bit boring on the in side. At least in the non smoking room
