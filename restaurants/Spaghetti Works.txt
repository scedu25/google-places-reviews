Spaghetti Works

Text: We were seated right away in a Fri after 8:30 pm. We all ordered the special, shrimp scampi. The salad bar was excellent and fresh.  Our server was cheerful.  The shrimp scampi was tasteless and very watery. No garlic or butter flavor. Will try the place again but will order something else.

Text: The food was decent. Though my wife's meal had chicken that was really chewy. They didn't seam to care too much and only gave a few dollars off for our inconvenience. I wouldn't go again.

Text: I've gone here ever since I was a kid, and I absolutely love it. The old feel and the delicious food is unforgettable. You also have bottomless pasta so you could order a plate and take some home with you! Can't wait to go back!

Text: This place is a staple in Omaha.  We had 1 in Kansas City and it closed year ago.  If I make a trip for more than a day, it's 1 meal stop.  The pasta is great and I always forget they have a salad bar.  Lot's to pick from.  These days a gluten free option is always important and there's is a good substitute.  I'm not ones that needs gluten free, but had to try it and was impressed.    The build your own is always my pick.  I've never had the desert because face it, you never have room.  I thought I would splurge and try the cheese cake.  That thing is huge!  it could feed 4 if you only want a small portion after a big meal..Great choices and always come away satisfied.

Text: I loved this place when it first opened in 1975 I believe. I was 15. I haven't been here since then. It's still a wonderful place to come to and enjoy good food and ambiance. And to recall past pleasant memories. Thank you for not changing to awfully much.
