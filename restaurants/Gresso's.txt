Text: Very friendly place by being welcomed by many employees upon entry.  Food was delicious for we had Italian sub, waffle sweet potato fries and quesadillas. Only negative was the small amount of alcohol in the drinks. Atmosphere is heightened by an old bar.

Text: Half of our order was missing and when I called to speak with management they not only interrupted me mid sentence, but also argued saying they sent the whole thing and want picture proof....(how the are we supposed prove with pictures that half our order is missing, by the way?)

What the heck happened to the customer is always right?  Spending 5 minutes on $3.00 worth of food would've made for a happy customer...I've NEVER had ANY type of business blatantly argue with me and straight up say I'm lying.

Edit: Come to find out, it was the driver's mistake and I STILL won't be back after this treatment. Customer service goes a really long way.

Text: Had a good time. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and able to handle my group, who were fairly rowdy (Sorry guys). Thank you for the hospitality.
