Text: Very pleasant dining experience.  Waitresses are very friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  I had the Marley burger which was cooked just like I like it and the Marley fries are the bomb-diggety!  Our grandson enjoyed the BBQ flat bread pizza.  Especially fun on the 'live' entertainment evenings.  Beautiful atmosphere.

Text: The worst restaurant I have ever been to.  I wouldn't even give them 1 star.  We went for a party and the wait staff was overwhelmed by a large crowd.  After we ordered our food they came back 20 minutes later and told us that they ran out of hamburgers.  Then they came 20 minutes after that and they ran out of pork chops so the people who ordered a $10 meal had to pay for a $25 dollar meal.  There was one waitress who called us rude and told us never to come back.  The owner hid in the kitchen and refused to take responsibility
