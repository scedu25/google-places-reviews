Kona Grill - Kansas City
Rating: 5
Text: Always a great place to go to on the Plaza! One of my favorite spots in Kansas City, Missouri. Kona has such a great atmosphere: When the weather is gorgeous dine outside on the patio or sit at the sushi bar and watch the chefs in action while you enjoy the tranquility of the massive fish tank! Or, you could take a seat in the cozy dining area and enjoy a meal with family or friends. The food is always great! I recommend the pulled pork sliders and of course you have to try their amazing sushi! And save room for dessert, because their desserts are amazing as well! I love this place! It's great for a quick lunch break too!

Text: Rude service during happy hour as always. Acting like you're an inconvenience for existing. It took a group of five of us 2 hours to get our food at drinks when we sat at the bar. The bar tender, a lady named Brianna almost made me leave. She yelled at us for returning a chair we borrowed. I felt completely unwelcome and I will never go back. Happy hour isn't an excuse, the other bar tender was super sweet and tried to apologize for her coworker.

Text: A good place to meet friends for drinks, sushi and happy hour.  The sushi is Americanized but good, service is usually prompt and attentive although tonight the server was slow and a little off.  Prices are average until Happy Hour and then they are great with 1/2 price sushi and appetizers, drink specials.  Happy Hour will fill up FAST on weekends so get there early.  There is also late night happy hour from 10 to close in the bar area.
