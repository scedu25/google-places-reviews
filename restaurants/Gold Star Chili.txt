Text: The waitress was very nice a decent server.
The food was not very good the spaghetti had been held too long in the steam table and some was dried out ,the onions was not chopped properly pieces the size of a quarter plus stale , the hot dog was cold which is typical of this restaurant. The manager in a loud voice chastising the help did not make for a comfortable meal.

Text: Their backyard burger is so yummy! Unfortunately that is the only thing I like from their, as I got one of their chili's; a three way, and it wasn't that great. It had an overpowering taste of cinnamon, and I know they use cinnamon in their chili, but it was overpowering like they had used a batch that was a mess up. My mom loves their chili dogs, though.
