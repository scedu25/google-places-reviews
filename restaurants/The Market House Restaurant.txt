Text: We were there with another couple on a Thursday and it was meat loaf special day. We were seated where we asked, garden-like area in back. Very pleasant waitress got our drinks right away. We all ordered the special ($7 ea).  Meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, and toasted thick garlic bread. It was plenty for us. We all liked our meals which was served promptly.Two shared desserts then we were done. Our waitress was attentive, nice, and helpful. We agreed, we will be back.

Text: This is a cute restaurant tucked in a small upstairs room in downtown Galena. The place is small so reservations are highly recommended. The drinks were delicious and the owners were nice. We did not eat there so we can't comment on the food, but next time I visit Galena I would like to come back and eat there.

Text: Excellent food and very nice friendly staff. I had the all-u-can eat fish. It was nice and crisp and the breading was great.

Text: I would have given 5 stars, but the server was rude to us, i ordered a drink, she made the rude comment and tone of "your license doesn't look like you" instead of asking if i had any other identification.....my license has a picture of me right after chemo therapy and i was hairless, now i have some hair, and it does resemble me, but there are other ways to verify it. 

They do have great food, and do recommend going for dinner.

Text: This is a very nice Restaurant with home cooked meals and a Special every day of the week.  Last time in I had the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  It was HUGE!  Reasonable pricing with great friendly service.  I will be back here
