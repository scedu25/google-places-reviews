Wings Over East Lansing
Rating: 3
Text: I've had the best wings and worst wings of East Lansing here. Its a lottery. I'd recommend it once, but between two bad orders and waiting an hour for a pick up (at noon on a Sunday), I can't say it's a must try. I find myself looking for other options the more I order from them, because it gets annoying dealing with this kind of consistently. I'll probably go to BWW's next time even though it's 3 times further and it's given me food poisoning. No joke.

Text: The in bone wings are breaded which is fine but it will be soggy if you don't eat them immediately in store. Need to rotate oil more you can taste the dirty oil in them. If they tried they would be better but imo don't waste your time just get bdubs. Higher quality all around

Text: My first experience; late Sunday delivery. Wings *absolutely* as advertised, jumbo, with Jamaican Jerk sauce. Could have used a bit less sauce in the to-go container, made the bottom part a wee bit soggy. Next week planning on trying ribs - wish they dry rubbed them. If the ribs are like the wings, will bump this to 5 stars. Great job, guys!

Text: Fast service but not always friendly, food is always great. Would recommend for anyone looking for delicious fried foods at a reasonable price. Typically only a 15-20 minute wait for pickup.
