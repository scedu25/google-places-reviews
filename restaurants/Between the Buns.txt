Text: I had the half rack pi ribs well done. And they were amazing. Sauce was good n ribs was just right... Beans had a lil too much onions and could have used a lil more juice, but still good. Service was fast and friendly. Worth the drive.

Text: Service was less than average. Requested golf tournament be put on one TV of three showing the same football game. Was told bartender had to do it. By the time she quit visiting with those sitting at the bar and changed the channel, the tournament was over. There were two holes left when I made the request. For the most part, your Sunday help is marginal at best. Didn't use to be that way. Can you say Applebee's? Don't let that happen.

Text: Food was good! Atmosphere felt suspect. They allow smoking INSIDE the establishment. I felt like I stepped back in time 15 years!

Text: Bar food. It's good and has curb side take out. But sometimes it takes a while for them to come out to you.
