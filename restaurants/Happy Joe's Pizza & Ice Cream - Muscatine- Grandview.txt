Text: Great service. We were there first thing after they opened and the guy was nice taking out order and making sure we had everything we needed. The food was fantastic. I love the taco pizza here and have to get it every time I'm in!

Text: Stopped after 12:30p for lunch.  Food was on buffet. Doesn't appear to be frequented by locals at lunchtime.  Same food there for entire meal.  Buffet closed at 1:30p. Very friendly and accommodating staff, just not a buffet stop of my choice.
