The Blue Heron Restaurant

Text: I had the breaded Lobster tail and it was fabulous. I also had a marvelous New York- style cheesecake. Even the bar creations were perfectly made. My server, Heather, was delightful. The Blue Heron is a world class establishment, from the greeter who seats you when you arrive, to the owner who thanks you for coming when you leave. Ordinarily I would say this place is pricey, but the food, the service, indeed, the experience at The Blue Heron . . . worth every farthing!

Text: Famous for its batter fried lobster tail. And it does not disappoint.  Lovey lake views from hilltop site. Romantic venue.

Text: My family has patronized this restaurant for over 40 years.  They first attended when is was the Potted Steer.  Unfortunately, this is a great memory of the past.  The past three visits to this restaurant has been substandard.  It is living on a past reputation.  The food has become average, is overpriced and the decor is also 40 years old.  Worst of all, the service has been consistently slow.  When we asked the hostess to help she snapped at us, which is entirely unacctpable.  They forgot to turn in the order for my son which took an additional 20 minutes for chicken.  To top it off when I received my credit card statement I was charged for our meal, plus the table next to me.  Save yourself the trouble and let this place go under.  There are a number of other restaurants in the area for this price and less you will be happier with.
