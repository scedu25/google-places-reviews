Text: Great Beers, Food and Relaxed Atmosphere. Drank a few, sampled/tasted some others, came away satisfied. Pizza was delicious. Service was superb. My waitress/bar bistro took very good care of me. Several beers hit the spot -  the MacTawisch Scottish Ale was notable as was the  Hopaluia by Spilker Ales. Funky atmosphere, very inviting, down to earth.
