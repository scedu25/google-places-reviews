Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: The portions were generous; however, the food was very underwhelming. I expect highly seasoned and garlic when I eat Italian. The food was bland and borderline. I have enjoyed this restaurant in the past but will unfortunately not return for another meal. The server was very friendly and made you smile with her bubbly positive attitude. This meal was just not worth the money or wait.

Text: We've had 2 great visits here to date, but today has been the worst. A table of 6 took an hour from being seated to get our food. On top of that, one order was wrong and another completely forgotten. I've retracted my 5 star to a 2 due to inconsistency of service. We're practically the only ones here. A bit of a shame, to be honest.

Text: The food is good and plenty of it. The Sangria is my all time favorite. I could drink it every night. The chocolate cake is awesome. The wait staff is polite and extremely helpful with food and drink selection. Good food, good drink, great atmosphere. Just bring your friends and have an awesome evening.
