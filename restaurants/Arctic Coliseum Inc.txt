Text: Two rinks, a skate shop, and a decent bar. I've played hockey at worse! Kids programs are cheaper than Ann Arbor and coaches are great!

Text: Great place to meet up with others, especially if you have any kids. You can watch the hockey games through giant windows all along the restaurant, very cool! Great food, as well as a fun atmosphere! Pool & foosball tables, & a couple of arcade games to distract kids. Will definitely come back again soon, highly recommend stopping in here!

Text: The food was decent, but the waitresses were phenomenal. Super sweet to my daughter, who had just earned an ice skating badge and wanted to tell everyone about it
