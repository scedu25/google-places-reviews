Text: Great place for a quick breakfast/lunch if you're waiting for your dive or are exhausted after a thrilling dive. 
We went for a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes and a toast. The omelet was amazing - just like how we make it at home. The veggies in the omelet were great. The potatoes and toast were a great combination with the omelet. Loved the taste and the seasoning on potatoes. 
Definitely can be visited if you're around the area, even if you're not skydiving.
