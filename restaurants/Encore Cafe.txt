Text: 1st visit for us & we were delighted! Food was excellent! Even my very picky mother loved it! Great atmosphere though not your typical Asian restaurant decor. Definitely going to come back to eat here whenever we're up to visit my Jayhawk daughter!

Text: I use to love this restaurant but in the last few months service and food has really tanked. The hostess staff is absolutely terrible and unhelpful. I did a carry out order and when I arrived to pick it up host was busy socializing instead of working. When I called back and reported my order was wrong she just said there was nothing to be done about it I even offered to take the meal that was incorrect back in she just said the ticket was correct and there was nothing else to be done. Talked to Sarah one of the managers and she said I could have it remade I just had to bring the messed up meal in

Text: I really love this place.. The food, drinks, and atmosphere. But I've had better service at a McDonald's than every  time I've eaten at this place. They really need to get it together. It's a shame the service is so poor for such good food!

Text: Friendly staff, great selection of food, but they changed their menu and they don't have bok choy anymore which is saddening. The price is fairly good for what you get but some of the itmes, especially appetizers, are just a little too high for the amount you get. I like the atmosphere other than it's always a little too cold in there. Quality is really good but I'd say it just might possibly has gone down (only slightly) within the past year.

Text: We had a late lunch at Encore and it was really very good, especially considering how very reasonable the price was. Our server was great, as well. We'll definitely go back.
