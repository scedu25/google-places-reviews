Text: Great service and friendly down home atmosphere. My particular favorite is the hot roast beef sandwich. One of a kind place. I live in California and whenever I'm in the area I stop in. Best hot beef in country in my humble opinion ?Betty is a sweetheart. This type of establishment going away and will be missed. Hopefully Betty has someone in training to carry on the tradition and the recipe for the hot roast beef sandwich!
