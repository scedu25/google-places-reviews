Text: Terrible customer service. Delivery boy was a young punk who couldn't find my house. He had to call for help - which I am more than happy to give. When he still was not able to find my place, he thought it was appropriate to blame it on me. Evidently, it's my fault he wasn't able to read a map - as the exact address was provided. 

Pizza order was correct, did arrive timely and was hot.

Text: I have ordered from here a few times, always fast, good service, will deliver what you want, just ordered last night at 12:30 am and pizza was here in 20 min or less.  Might have been a little overcooked, but it was thin crust, so maybe just had to do with that, no biggie, still tasted great.  I couldn't ask for anything more from a late night delivery.  Pretty much the chik fila of pizza for the area.

Text: I was requesting a scheduled delivery b/c we used to order everyweek behind the front desk of the hotel that i work at.  And the first gentleman took my order and payment info and hung up.  So I called back and the second gentleman advised me that they didn't not give discounts for individuals working at the hotel. Unfortunately I myself have put over 26 different orders in and each time we received our discount as we were supposed to. So I asked him to cancel the order.

Text: Terrible, called for a delivery, he asked what my phone number was, I had forgotten it cause its a new number, and before i could even say hold on a sec let me look he hung up on me. What a Joke, atleast pretend to give damn about your job.
