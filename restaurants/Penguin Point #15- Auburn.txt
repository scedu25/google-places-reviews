Text: Horrible. The staff has no idea how to make an order correctly. They messed up the same order 2 different times. After going back the 3rd time the manager refused to make up for the 2 mistakes and hardly gave the time of day claiming she needed the receipts to refund or even give the correct food then walked away.

Text: Good food and great people. The employees there are a great group.  And they always make sure that your food is hot and fresh. Really needs to get the AC fixed, it's been "out of order" for the past two summers now.

Text: Food was just not good. Got a jalapeño burger combo and for the price it could have been better. Probably one of the worst visits there.
