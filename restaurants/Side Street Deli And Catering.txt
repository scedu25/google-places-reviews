Text: Several times I have had hot cinnamon rolls made for a meeting or just wanted to share them at work. They are delicious! Service has always been great! Busy is a good sign! So many items on the menu to recommend and still want to try myself! Breakfast, brunch, or lunch! Catering even scheduled for our May event!

Text: A very nice sandwich shop that has good food and coffee. There are few places like this around town and worth the stop. The staff is always friendly and prices are where they should be.

Text: Really nice staff and good food. Always really loud when there are a few people in the lobby so we always take our food to go. Wish they were open on Sundays.

Text: Great little place to eat. I wish everything want served in a "to go" container.  When they have pastrami it is the best.
