Text: Great food, no doubt about that, server was pretty awkward.  Didn't return for about 15 minutes so another server took over.  Previous server finally returned.  Kept giving him the benefit of the doubt.  Food was great! went to pay for my meal and then ended up paying for my own and some else's $58 meal with a simple sorry being the fix... Terrible customer service.  Good thing I wasn't someone who freaks out about that stuff.

Text: Went on "pizza night" and sadly disappointed. Burnt spots on the mozzarella. Nice price but when the flavor isn't there might just go ahead and skip it. Had a couple adult drinks which were typically higher priced for sport bar booze. Server was nice and pretzel bites were good. Overall meh...

Text: We are here every week for trivia. Pretty consistent over the last year. Have yet to have good service. Constantly waiting on drinks or refills. Tonight we ordered food an hour ago and we are still waiting. Very frustrating how this 'busy' night isn't anything new and they still can't figure it out.
