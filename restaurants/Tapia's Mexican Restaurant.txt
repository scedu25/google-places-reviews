Tapia's Mexican Restaurant

Text: When we drove up, we questioned going in as it didn't have much appeal. Upon walking in around 3pm it was a peaceful and quiet atmosphere. I'm so glad I got the honors of enjoying this place. The service was superb! The prices perfect for my tight budget. Nice job guys, thank you?
