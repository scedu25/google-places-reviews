Text: Was pleasantly satisfied with my first visit here. The atmosphere was super nice, kind of a diner mixed with a bar. I went for lunch and had a sandwich on their pretzel bun. Best sandwich I've had in so long! Great service, great food. I'm definitely going back and would recommend to others too!

Text: Tasty! We stopped for lunch. Nice atmosphere with a patio for outdoor seating. We were hoping the Hot Sicilian was hotter (not spicy at all) The vegan chili also lacked flavor. But salads were perfectly dressed and very fresh. They served us bread with our meal with delicious, soft, spreadable butter. Nice touch! We didn't stay for dessert but they all looked wonderful.

Text: Nice restaurant with friendly staff. The food was delicious and the drinks were spot on. The muscles and chorizo-cod were cooked perfectly. Expect to pay $60 or more for two.

Text: Great, first time I had soba noodles, what a pleasant surprise. They were served cold with Asian dressing, herbs and nuts. Oh with spicy chicken thighs on the side. The smoked fish tartines are a lovely way to start.
