Text: The fries were amazing.  They were hand cut. I had the pulled pork and it was delicious.  It was a little to dark inside.  But I would definitely go back.

Text: Food was amazing! But what really intrigued my friends and I, was the bartender, Bruce! He was PERFECT! Fast, efficient, and just all around great! Although he was super busy, he never let our cups go dry, and was on top of it! He recommended different beers that we had yet to try, and we were not disappointed! Plus, his blood Mary's were SPECTACULAR! We definitely plan on returning on a regular basis because of him!

Text: Mary Jane's has the best atmosphere and the food is great. The wait staff is always super friendly and do a wonderful job every time we go. We've never had a bad experience there and refer a lot of people. Go hungry because portions are pretty big!
