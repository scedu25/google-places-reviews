Text: The sandwich we ordered was so large that my husband and I could very easily cut it in half and share it and be fully satisfied. The wait staff was very helpful and offered suggestions of their specials at hand, and repeatedly came back to the table asking us how things were or if we needed anything. The Fisrt Street Grill was very clean, and unpleasantly decorated appropriately for the environment.
