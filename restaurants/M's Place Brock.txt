Text: Looks like an old deserted shack gas station. You'll be ASTONISHED if you ever stop in to eat! Homemade food like your mama use to make! The Friendliest people you ever met, One overworked gal runs the place. Tenderloins & burgers best I have EVER had at a Restaurant! And they are reasonable as well. The few  times I go to Memphis...always stop here 1st. If ya blink you'll miss it....15 South...just after the S curves & the cemetery on the left hand side....Vittles Paradise!!!
