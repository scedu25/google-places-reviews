Text: Last 3 times we have been there pizza was not as good as usual. Pizza was cold and had to be ran through the oven again twice this has happened. Ordered a large and got medium. Than tonight we ordered family night special and got a small bread stick and pizza was barely warm. I didn't have the heart to tell them. Don't want to complain about the pizza all the time.

Text: Some of the best pizza I've ever had and Logan was awesome. Manager should recognize him for his efforts. Had a group of 20 come in 30 min before close and he was very professional

Text: Greek salad is epic. Good pizza. Large tables for groups, booths with high backs for private feel.

Text: Been eating their food for 20 plus years. Food is uniformly good, reasonable pizza. Good thin crusts, and good value. Family that owns business is very community oriented.
