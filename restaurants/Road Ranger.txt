Text: I just filled up my rig and this place is clean tonight and the staff was very pleasant.  It still has some old school feel to it.  I took this picture from across the highway sorry if it's fuzzy

Text: Urine on toilet seat. Toilet paper on floor. Seat cover holder empty with exception of a dirty pull-up stuffed in it. Sanitary napkin trash bin over flowing. Food counter filthy. Floor looks like it hasn't been mopped in years and carpets in serious need of a vaccum. The people however are very nice. I didn't dare purchase any food here.

Text: An oasis on the side of the I-44, gas, trucker stop, Subway shop, decent restrooms but lots and lots of flies. It was 3pm and the Cinnabon station had "been broke down" as told by the totally uninterested tall dude. 

The cinnamon rolls were just sitting on the side of the showcase and I guess I should be grateful the guy wasn't interested in wrapping them up to go.....they were covered in flies. 

Lots of beer, ice and good to go, gas was $1.96 a gallon.

Text: This place is filthy and a health hazard. The fountain drink dispensers have mold all over from improper cleaning. The staff is friendly enough but literally risking your health over a Coke isn't worth coming here. If you can help it I'd recommend going to the next truck stop along the way
