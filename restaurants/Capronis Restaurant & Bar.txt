Capronis Restaurant & Bar

Text: Small portions on sides, especially, and fairly high prices.  No draft beer to speak of.  Seating along river is too tight.  The man behind my husband kept banging his chair into him but he couldn't move in any closer.  If they could remove just one table, it would make it more comfortable.   

Now, for the good news.  The food was very good as was the service.  The biggest complaint is that the salad, which is served family style, had too much dressing on it.  It was a delicious dressing but we all would have preferred it to be served on the side.  Bread was great!  Served on a cutting board while still warm and with a plate of oil, vinegar and herbs for dipping.  Also, veggies were very good but one spear of broccoli is a bit sparse, as I mentioned before.  If you like scallops, I would recommend them.  You get four tender and sweet sauteed scallops in a lemon butter sauce.

Looking forward to do it again, with out the time constraints. Loren

Text: Came from Portsmouth , Ohio for the first time. The waitress was fantastic, as was the food and service. I learned not to put much stock in the bad reviews I read. We WILL be back. It was a wonderful anniversary dinner.
