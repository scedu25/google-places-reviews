El Bait Shop

Text: After being away for 8 years on a return trip. It's still the best place in town to get a beer! Never a dull moment and the variety is amazing. I remembered it when they had just over a 100+ on tap. This has best selections of beers around. If you want to experience the Iowa Brews, don't go anywhere else, Iowans still know how to rock the house with the best of Brewers! Don't miss this if you're passing through, you'll regret it.

Text: Beer selection out of this world. Helpful staff know what they're doing without being beer snobs. They can talk the talk or dumb it down on a moment's notice.

Text: Above average for their nifty old school menu items, Remind me of the 60's and 70's. Usually good service but it takes a little bit to get your food. It always hot and tasty.

Text: Great spot, right across the street from the Hampton if you stay there.  Amazing beer selection, lots of local brews and other craft beers.  Good menu, had the shrimp tacos.  Was a bit disappointed to only get 2 small tacos, was hoping for 3 based on the $11 price tag.  They were delicious though!

Text: I frequently eat at this restaurant's adjoining restaurant Miller High Life Lounge. Both are owned by the same company and both allow orders from each other's menu. I often get the double cheese burger at Miller. This time I also got the double cheese at El Bait. The burger was dry and overly smokey. I am not sure what went wrong but I don't think I will be back to El Bait. I have been to Miller since and ordered the cheese burger and it was excellent.
