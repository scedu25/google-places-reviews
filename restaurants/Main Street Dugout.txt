Text: Sandwiches were very good, great fries. Husband can't stop talking about the Big Melt! Clean, friendly, busy little place. Glad we stopped. Homemade pies look delicious, we didn't try them...too stuffed!

Text: 5 stars!! Definitely! We were traveling through on our way to Colorado and this place was a little gem in the middle of no where! We were looking to stop for lunch for a better place than usual fast food and were blown away! Amazing options for pizza, sandwiches, and even the kiddos! the staff were amazing and I had the Reuben pizza!! Sounds had but it was one of my favorite pizzas I have ever had! the kids had the taco pizza and just got a kick out of that combo. I will definitely go out of my way to go here again! Service was good and the people were kind! A great place to eat!

Text: GREAT food and service, especially for such a small town. The menu was extensive, prices were very reasonable, everything came to our table pretty quick and the service was great. If I'm ever in that area again, I'll definitely stop back in
