Text: Nicest place I've seen, in this part of town.  Great server!  Good ambiance.  A little noisy, partly because there was such a big crowd.  Obviously a popular place.  Others enjoyed their meal, but I didn't care for the Asian type salad I had.  Very large Bar.

Text: Amber at the bar was awesome, very helpful with beers and food menu. Sampled a few beers and got some awesome food. Came for work out of town and was a great choice for lunch. Will eat here again!

Text: Plenty of options on menu. Has both a sophisticated and sports bar theme. Roomy tables...not scrunched. Will be going back, especially for Sunday brunch.
