Text: First time visiting this restaurant and very positive experience. Interesting and affordable lunch menu. Delicious white fish burger and black bean burgers. They even cut the sandwiches and served on separate plates so my husband and I could sample each.

Text: Fantastic meal. The rack of lamb was prepared perfectly. Salad was excellent as well. Only complaint I have is the creme brulee, while it could have been very good, it was served cold rather than at room temperature. If they would have pulled it out of the cooler earlier I am certain it would have been fine....the service was very good as well.

Text: Our family loves Four Roses! The menu always has old standbys in addition to a variety of interesting meats, fish and vegetarian entrees. The rolls are the best around and the desserts are incredible. The staff are great, especially Brenda and Chuck, and everyone makes you feel very welcome. They have Nowait which is great because they are always VERY busy. Four Roses has a neighborhood feel to it...cozy and friendly. If they could improve the tight parking they would be perfect!
