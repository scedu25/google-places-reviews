Text: We were traveling and came in 10 minutes before closing, and felt a bit bad about coming in so late. Kelvin was our waiter, Damion was the kitchen manager, and they seriously gave us some of the best service of anywhere I've ever been. We were the only people in the restaurant, we are in here right now 40 minutes after closing! We've had incredible service! This is our first time at a Max and Erma's... Wow! We will be back! Such a neat experience having great service and conversation.

Text: First time eating there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to dine here
