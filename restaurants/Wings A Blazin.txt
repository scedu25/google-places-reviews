Wings A Blazin
Rating: 2
Text: I love the different options of beer I can't find in any other place. That said MOST, not all, of the staff suck at people's skills. The wings have nothing truly special and the sauces' variety and flavors are mediocre. If you like hot wings, this is not your place. 
This is a honest, cerebral review as I visit the place relatively often for the beers. Cheers!

Text: The atmosphere is really cool. It has an airplane theme and they did a really good job with it. The food left a lot to be desired tho. Service was great.

Text: Great place to go while visiting Hermann. We stayed a block from there and walked from our hotel minutes before closing. When we noticed we were going to try something else but they insisted we stay. We looked over the menu, asked for recommendations on a few things got our order promptly and refills over and over. We stayed 15min after close and everything was great. No wait, no loud talking,

I can understand that if you went at a prime time that service would not be as great but that is common with this type of place during the busy hours.

Text: The beer selection was vast, but there was no beer menu with descriptions. You had to make your decision based on the name of the brew, alone. My husband ordered a vodka tonic and didn't get a vodka tonic. We took one look and told our waitress "that's not a vodka tonic". She responded, "no. It's a gin and tonic. We don't have vodka." (Something she could have mentioned when he ordered a vodka tonic). We can only assume she hasn't had either of those drinks because it was most certainly not a gin and tonic either. The food was mediocre, the environment was neat.

Text: I liked the atmosphere. I ordered a chicken cheese bacon pasta. It was very rich. The waiter warned us about this. My husband ate the whole order. I took most of it home. If you have high colesterol, you may want to pass on this dish, but it was a good combination.
