Text: My family loves it here. It's old and needs attention. It could be a nice place. It's dark inside. The parking lot is dark. Its not my taste.The cinnamon chips are good.

Text: Very nice a friendly. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Not fancy but not trashy either. Food is great and filling. Portions a little small but extremely cheap.

Text: Oh holy hell! That is NOT Mexican food. That was the worst sludge I've ever had the displeasure of paying for! I had a million red flags go off when I walked in the place, but thought I had to give it a chance since people were raving about it in so many reviews. Absolutely disgusting in every possible way. My body rejected it pretty violently also. I'm still in shock that people like this place!?! It reminded me of when my mom tried to make Mexican food and used every processed and out of the can ingredient possible. Seriously though! How do people like this!?!
