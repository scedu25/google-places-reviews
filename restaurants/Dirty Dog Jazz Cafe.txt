Text: Entertainment was great!!! The food was mediocre. Hence the 3 star rating. Our steaks were lukewarm, our sides were cold. My father-in-law's steak was terrible. Nothing but fat. The entertainment takes away from the fact that the food is not great. Which is a shame. Make the food great along with the entertainment and this place would be a gold mine!
