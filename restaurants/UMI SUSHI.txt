UMI SUSHI
Rating: 2
Text: We ordered take-out and were disappointed. The food tasted good, but it seems like they're purposely being cheap and giving you as little food as possible. First of all, this is the only sushi place I've ever been to that doesn't include miso soup or ginger salad with your order. We got it anyway, being hungry. I paid nearly $40 for three specialty rolls plus salads for two people. At any other Ann Arbor sushi place, the would leave us feeling satisfied at least. But here we are, both still hungry and $40 poorer. I don't think I'll be returning.

Text: Just tried this place the first time.. pretty disappointed.. rice is old.. rolls that are supposed to be hot are cold and taste like the stuff on top has been sitting out for hours.

I called in to complain .. and I never complain and I never write reviews .. maybe 4 in my life.. when I called in the guy just said I'm sorry didn't even offer to fix the situation

Text: Excellent sushi. Service was attentive, friendly and respectful. Prices on the high side for specialty rolls, but service and product make up for it.

Text: 5 stars is not enough. This place is super dope. Sushi Man Taylor is the man! The staff at this is place is incredibly friendly and the service is incredible. I highly recommend you go here. Pro tip: sit at the bar and say Hi to the guys making your sushi ;-)

Text: Awesome lunch specials that come with miso soup and salad. Quick service. Opens at 11 and is slammed by noon on weekdays. Friendly and always fresh tasting.
