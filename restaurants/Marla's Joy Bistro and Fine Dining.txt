Marla's Joy Bistro and Fine Dining
Rating: 5
Text: Delicious food and fresh-brewed tea (hot and cold).  A variety of sandwiches are offered in the morning and afternoon, as well as a choice between mulligatawny (my favorite) and cold strawberry soup (a close second).  Friday and Saturday they serve an evening meal as well, offering two entrees that vary from week to week.  Soups are not available in the evenings but tea is.  Iced teas are unsweetened and flavorful.  Among the hot teas, Chai latte is my personal favorite.

Text: Food does not get any fresher than this place. The atmosphere is quaint but not stuffy. Cozy is best to describe this place. No one in North central Kansas is doing anything close to what they do here. Stop in and your stomach will thank you!
