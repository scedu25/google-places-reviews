Smelled great on the way in the door.
Real smoked meat here!  
Had the Texas twister I think.  It was a ton of meat!  Chicken, couple of ribs,  a smoked pot roast,  pork loin, ham, rib tips, baked beans, potato salad and Cole slaw.  For $15. 
The flavors were deep. The table bbq sauce was Texas type. Very good with the  meat. My wife had t he sliced meat meal. She and I couldn't finish. Made a meal out of the left overs.  
The server was new and got mixed up. 
But things happen. 
I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.

Text: An amazing experience. The best bbq I have had in the 40 States I have visited. Wait staff is great. Helped with our toddler who was being fussy. Prices are very affordable. Only two kinds of sauce..... Because that's all you need!

Text: Their lemonade is extraordinarily amazing, the service was perky and enjoyable. Their Texas Toast is mouth watering. Their cottage cheese was better than any other I've had. The dessert of the day when I went was the turtle pie, and I would lowkey die for it. Will be back! ??? Dani was our server and she was really sweet and prompt.

Text: I good place for the money. I always get the low carb options so turkey with no bread and a side of veggies. The turkey is always good but the veggie side is sad sometimes. They run out of veggies so you might get a lot of weird veggies in one cup. I don't want radishes in my veggie cup! I've had the pork which is dry half the time but compare this place to other quick fast food places and the quality and price are much better!  Compare it to BBQ in places like KC and this place would be lucky to hit a 3. But for Boone.. it's good.
