Text: Not a fan of chain restaurants.. but they made me a fan.. HA HA! Anyways the food is great! The portions are a little small so me and my brothers usually order extra but that's okay with us. The waitresses are usually very friendly and the managers are absolutely amazing! The place is usually pretty clean and the bathrooms are as well. Not very busy on the week days. Slightly more busy on the weekend. People should come more often!

Text: First off, prices..F**k me! expensive? yea, thats an understatement! Portions are great... for a cat maybe. I've had appetizers that are more filling than their course meals. However, food is great and service is average. Place needs a good cleaning, its dirty. The bathroom...smells like a Mexican jail. Lost my appetite just walking in there. Also at night, place is way too dark inside, trying to store bats or something ? Lots of parking. Waiting time is pretty good. Need to lower their prices.

Text: We had big team party there (around 30 people) in one of busy weekend. A few people do not get their food for 2 hours while the others almost finish eating. Talked to a rude waiter and had bad experiences in this BP location. However, after I made the complain to manager Shaylon. He response it quickly and  be able to fix the problem. I believe they can improve the services and make sure no such things happen again.
