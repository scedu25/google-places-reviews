Text: I went to watch the fight it wasn't to bad and the food was okay but one of the waitresses didn't come back with my friends change of $14 for her beer and they were charging $15 a person to watch the fight but then there were people standing outside watching from the side walk and one just so happens to be friends with the security they had so while there were trying to shake down people on the side walk for the $15 there own security had there friends watching from the spots.... this was my first and last visit the only reason why they got two stars from me is because our original waitress was very nice and cute but once it got crowded all hell broke loose you couldn't even get a cup of water without getting it yourself.....
