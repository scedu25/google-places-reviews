Text: We were here for 20 minutes with no service.  Had to go to the bar to get drinks.  We then had to write our orders on a napkin and then take that to the bar.  The drinks are aweful.  Absolutely ridiculous!!!

Text: Great local bar.  Good bar food and inexpesive drinks.   Nice place to hang out.  Only complaint is when patrons play country music on the jukebox.
