Text: If you're in the area, you need to stop here.  He'll, even if you're not n the area, STOP HERE!  Great food, great prices, and great, friendly staff.  So glad we were in the area on our road trip.  3 hungry guys on motorcycles were taken very good care of.

Text: The food is not that good. Lots of choices but none prepared well. Prices are average for types of food served. Service was ok. Coffee was refilled frequently. Have been here twice. Hopefully will not go back.
