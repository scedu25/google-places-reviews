Lake Waynoka Restaurant

Text: I had dinner in the summer of 2011. The seating was quick, the server friendly, and the food was excellent. I'm of average build, and the portions were moderately priced for how filling they were. For a small local restaurant inside the gates, this one will certainly be standing for a long time to come.
