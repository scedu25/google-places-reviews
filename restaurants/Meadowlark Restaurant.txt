Text: This was my first visit here and I absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere is such that you feel comfortable but it is classy at the use time.  
Service was topnotch and the food was delicious!  They have certain specials each day too.  Very reasonably priced and many healthy and interesting options along with "typical" fare.
A definite "must visit"!

Text: Phenomenal food. Seasonal menu. Great cocktails. Cheesecake is always wonderful, but I almost never get it because the seasonal desserts are all great too! Big recommendation!

Text: Dined here for the first time and will definitely be back! Loved the atmosphere and wait staff was very polite and pleasant. Had the house salad with Angus beef on top with mustard caper vinaigrette dressing. Light, yet filling, super delicious. And their cosmopolitan drink is the best cosmo I've ever had, hands down! Great place for a date night or to take an out of town guest.
