Text: The best thin crust pizza for miles and best pizza, in general.  The Deluxe is a can't miss! 

But don't miss the salads with diced veggies, the excellent burritos, or the oven-baked sandwiches.

Text: We found this place by accident and SO glad we did...we will be back! One good tip though...cash needed for drinks, can get cash back at pizza window if you pay with card.

Text: The food was amazing! We all loved everything we ordered. I had the beef and bean wet burrito which was great. My fiance had the vegetable pizza which was right up her alley and she loved and our daughter had the taco salad and really enjoyed it. You order drinks in the back and food at the front. It's a great experience and we definitely will be back.
