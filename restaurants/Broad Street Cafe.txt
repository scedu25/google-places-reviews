Text: The best bagel shop in Southwest Michigan. I have been going here for years and telling them they should raise the prices. They never listen and you can still get a bagel and coffee for less than $2.25 if you play your cards right. Go there, meet friends, read the newspaper, and say 'Hey' to my Dad who still goes every day.
