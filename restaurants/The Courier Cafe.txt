Text: Love the charm of this place. We have been going there for more than a decade now. Though vegetarian options are limited, we typically love whatever we have tried there and service is always friendly and great. We went there this weekend for a late breakfast, it was still crowded. We had a long wait for table and then for food. Well, this goes to show the popularity of this place. The server was very friendly and tried to get our little ones food as early as he could because he was getting restless and very hungry. As usual the food was good. Good enough that we pounced on it before I could take any pictures :). I took some pictures while we were waiting.

Text: One of our favorite local places. Made from scratch everything, they also have their own garden, and a menu with loads of options. Friendly and delicious.

Text: We love going to The Courier Cafe, especially for breakfast. Their menu offers a wide variety of options at any point in the day. Some of our favorites include: blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy, burgers, classic Ruben, and their milkshakes. Definitely a place to check out if you are in Urbana. It can get pretty busy on weekend mornings so plan ahead.
