Text: Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Best place in town. Other reviews must've been when they first opened cause now it's awesome. Gotta try one of the many mixed drinks they offer or an ice cold beer!

Text: Liked the dinner special grilled walleye -- nice and smoky. Green beans in the veggies were a little rubbery, but tasted good. Server was friendly and attentive.

Text: Went for breakfast on Friday and Adrienne our waitress was great. Cook got our order correct must have learned  English  or different  cook.

Text: Unless some major changes are made at this restaurant I suspect it will be closed soon. I hardly know where to begin to list everything that was wrong. The  servers were uninformed, rude, angry at one another and just basically did not know why they were there.  Every order had something wrong with it and the food was cold. We ordered appetizers and they were served after our dinners arrived. The chicken wings were my under cooked, we were charged for items we never ordered, one of the meals was served just before we were ready to leave, and all in all it was an incredibly disappointing experience. I highly suggest going next-door and having pizza!  Giving one star is too generous.
