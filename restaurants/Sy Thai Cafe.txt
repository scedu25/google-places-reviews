Text: This place is great, but be aware that lunch time can get busy and you CAN wait up to 25 minutes. And at that point, the spice levels vary by the cook. I would go more mild than hot to be on the safe side. And trust me, I love hot food. Other than that, fantastic place! Highly suggest trying it :)

Text: Great food and pricing! The Sy's Mussels were just $12.xx for 13 of them all delicious. Minus one star for huge rip in the last booth's seat and the server was kind of rough and slammed everything down onto the table.

Text: The food here is a very americanized Thai cuisine, complete with dishes featuring WAY too much sauce (Pad Se-euw, peanut noodles). The crab wontons were almost entirely cream cheese, no crab to be seen or tasted.
