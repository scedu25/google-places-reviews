Text: The acoustics of this place is horrible. There, that's the bad part. Everything else is exceptional. Great food, great staff, wonderful ambience. The house-made sour dough bread is out of this world. You'll be served a complimentary sample of that, along with oil dip, when you are seated. If you are new to Wooster, this is a must.

Text: What a fantastic restaurant!! And it's in Wooster, Ohio?! Food is  spectacular - had the tequila chicken pasta, blue burger, tiramisu and deconstructed ice cream sandwich. YUMMY!!! The friendly service from the host through the chef welcomed us and made us want to return soon.

Text: Nice spot for lunch and dinner. Great menu selection, some craft beers. Their house bread is for sale, try not to leave without a loaf!
