Lucca Grill

Text: Lucca Grill brings back those wonderful memories of the local Manhattan pizza shop. The wonderful smell of pizzas baking and the indescribable sensation that this is a great place to visit old friends and make new ones. The thin crust pizza was delicious and the service was attentive. A must go and a Route 66 legend.

Text: This is a great pizza place with a fun atmosphere. They've been around for a long time. The pizza is a thin crust style. Highly recommend this place.

Text: I've been here a few times and the food has been pretty good. There's a definite atmosphere difference between the upstairs part of the restaurant (it's very disconnected from the main restaurant) and the lower level. If I had a choice, I'd definitely prefer to eat downstairs. This isn't always possible during the dinner rush. The pizza itself is good. Entree portions seem a little small for the price, but that's hard to judge because other "Italian" restaurants in town offer huge portions of very low quality and Lucca is more obviously focused on some attempt at authenticity and quality.

Text: I like their pizza a lot. Not much to the place. Pretty standard. It's been around for a long time and feels that way in a good way though. It's your neighborhood pizza place that hasn't changed and it's comforting. It's a little cramped downstairs but they do have more dining upstairs. 

Update: probably the best meatball sub in town
