Text: Food was not good this evening.  I ordered the Cheddar Burger.  The menu says 'sharp cheddar'..... What it actually is, is an imitation cheddar spread.  YUCK!  The wings were tough and chewy too.  Not good.  We will stick with Potosi Hub's - much better.

Text: This place has good eats. Its a step above normal bar food. Its fairly quite mid-day. They keep the TVs sound off. It gets more rowdy at night. My only gripe is that Jerry Springer was on when I came for lunch. The volume was down but id rather see news or sports scores.

Text: I really do love the burgers, and I love that they have Coors Light On Tap. They have a nice patio and the waitresses are always very pleasant. It's right off the highway and I really love that also. My daughter and I love dipping everything in their queso sauce. This is one of our favorite places to eat.
