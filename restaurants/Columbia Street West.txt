Text: Do you like paying $9 for a well cocktail? Were your glory days in college? Do you have a receding hairline you try to hide with a baseball hat? Do you like reliving the peak of your life with the boys from Beta Sigma Pi? Do you like making fun of people who look, dress, or act different from you? Is your name Chad, Brett, or Kyle? Is your girlfriend taller than 5'11"? Then do I have the bar for you! Are you a normal functional member of society who likes enjoying the company of friends in a relaxed, casual environment? Then go literally anywhere else in the city of Fort Wayne. C Street is a cancerous tumor of a bar with the worst service and a somehow worse clientele than you could possibly imagine. The seventh layer of Hell serves drinks faster, cheaper, and in a much less rapey environment than this dumpster fire.
