Text: My Wife and I camped out at the resort for 2 days during Labor day weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed the fresh air and country setting. The staff were great and very professional. We also had the good luck to be there when one of Ohio's finest bands were performing on the outdoor stage (Smokin' Ham Band). Camping, fresh air, entertainment, and dancing in the moonlight made for a wonderful weekend adventure. We'll be back

Text: My family stayed here for a long weekend Thursday - Monday. The room was very nice, clean, and very accommodating for us. All of the staff were very nice, and went above and beyond to make our stay great. The restaurant was good and had large portions. The restaurant has limited hours as well but they brought a breakfast basket to our room which was great. There is alot of things to do at the resort, and if there is anything i would change it would be 48 hr notice required for activities reservations. I understand why they do this, as it is only been open a year under this management. I just hope the word gets out and they are busy enough to keep staff on hand where anyone can stop by at anytime and do the activities without reservations. Thanks for the nice weekend.

Text: My family and I just spent a weekend at this spectacular resort.   We enjoyed fishing, rock wall climbing, bungee trampolines and especially riding the tubes down the mountain. The accommodations were very comfortable and clean.  The staff could not have been more friendly  and willing to please. We are already planning our next trip back.
