J Ford's Black Angus

Text: The server Chris was very knowledgeable about the food, spirits and wine. I was expecting a modest lunch and was surprised by the price. I judge a restaurant based off of several factors one the host. She seemed aloof, however, she was polite. Chris the server saved the restaurant. He was not only tending bar he was a server. Very polite and respectful. I also grade the restaurant based on the size of the menu. As a rule if there is a smaller menu the chef takes pride in his work, which was apparent by the eclectic options. This place is not ideal for people who are gluten free. The chef does not make substitutions, however, this is a sign he is meticulous about food pairing and choosing the right ingredients. I ordered the lentels vegan options, and the combination of the spices satisfied the pallet with a contrast of robust seasonings and textures. I did not award J Ford's Black Angus more than 4 stars because of the lack of gluten free options and the unwelcoming host. To pay more than $40 on a vegan meal and coffee I expect everyone to be more accommodating.

Text: This was our second time at this restaurant and I can honestly say it is hands-down amazing. The service is top-notch and the food is indescribable. You must try this place. It is not rushed and a little off the beaten path but that is why I like it the most. Carmel Indiana is full of restaurant wannabes and this place should earn a ribbon.

Text: Continues to be my favorite restaurant in Terre Haute year after year!  10 years in Chicago spoiled my palette, but Kelly, Jeff & team keep my cravings in check.  I will definitely be heading in soon for a fix :)

Text: It was our first visit, and we loved it . The staff was very friendly, my wife had the seafood special and she loved it. I had what is quite possibly, the best steak I have ever had.
