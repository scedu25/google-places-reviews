Pizza Villa

Text: The pizza is always a treat and the servers are great. I love the thin crust, it's crisp and tastes good with the variety of toppings offered. I'm vegetarian and there's plenty of choices for me here.

Text: We will never order from here again! We ordered the villa special. The pizza arrived within the time frame they said. However the pizza was liquid! You couldn't even pick up a piece without the toppings sliding off from the water sauce. We called and the manager tried to explain that's how a pizza with multiple toppings is made. He had a new pizza delivered within 30 minutes! An XL pizza should never take that short of time to cook fully! And it wasn't as bad as the first, but the middle was still extremely wet. On top of that the sausage wasn't even cooked all of the way through! We told them how to cook the pizza the second time and they still argued with us that it's just the way it's made. The only positive is the staff was friendly and nice and tried to accommodate us but it did not work for us.

Text: Meh....Bbq pizza was okay. Disappointed with the beer nuggets. I used to get them from a now closed restaurant back in the 80's and theirs were fried a little more so the texture was better. Didn't like how you had to place your food order before being seated as it caused us to rush through selecting what we wanted. Goofy procedure.

Text: The food was meh, our waitress was very nice but easily confused. To be fair, though, we had a pretty large party and she was young. Would I go here again? Sure, if I was out voted by the group to go. The rest of the group I was with reeeally likes their pizza, though. So there's that. Not too impressed but definitely not unimpressed.
