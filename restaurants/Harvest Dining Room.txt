Text: The bacon blue burger and fries were fabulous I had this for supper both Fri. and again Saturday ,however Saturday morning I ate the breakfast buffet ,lousy ,gravy tasted packaged,eggs dry ,boiled parsley red potatoes had no flavor,same for French toast  and the Greek yogurt tasted like sour cream.
My traveling companions didn't like meatloaf. I would advise against buffet but recommend the very ample flavorful burgers.
