Text: Worste service ever! The cousins that work the night shift were talking openly about smoking weed with the other customers. Infront of my kids! Also waited for a all meat pizza, paid 12 bucks for it and the employees were so excited to go smoke weed they handed us a 5.00 pepperoni pizza instead. Of course i didnt look till i got home. I could have paid the same price for a pizza across the street at Godfathers with WAY better service. What a joke!

Text: The young lady working the counter today at round 5pm was rude. Didn't seem like she wanted to be there then gave a much longer time frame for the promotional hot and ready most bestest normally they give a 6 to 10 minute time frame but the young lady rolled her eyes and said 20 to 35 minutes. And the store was almost empty so I assume she just didn't want to make it or something.  Too bad people like that ruin businesses.

Text: The young girl, cant even call her a lady. extremely rude and disrespectful. They forgot my order and got mad when I asked for a manager's name.  Everyone there is rude.  Bring back the old management.  I will be taking this to the district manager.  Then the girl didnt put the top on the wings and they fell out and burnt my lap and fingers
