Text: Yummy, yummy! Just off Route 60 in Mountain Grove, this quaint BBQ joint fills your belly without emptying your wallet. Lots of smoked meat choices, homemade baked beans, potato salad etc. Service was fast and friendly. Gave four stars because does not take credit cards.... luckily my friends had cash or I would have had to wash dishes -- embarrassing --- did not see any signs on exterior door stating cash only. Will return again with green in my pocket.

Text: Fantastic food! Love the informal, laid back atmosphere. It's fun! Prices are pretty good too especially since the portions are bigger than some of the competition!

Text: The 4 of us went to this establiahment.  The food wasn't a disappointment!   We had ribs, pull pork, sausage and turkey.   The sides were excellent.   Service was right on.   The price was a bit expensive but we dont mind paying for good food    We will be back!
