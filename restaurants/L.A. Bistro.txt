Text: If you want gross food in small quantities at above average prices, i recommend this place! If you like flavors that go together (note to cook: this does not include pesto mayo and salsa) or freshly prepared food (unlike the dried out, freezer burned veggie burger i was served), do not dine here. If you don't finish your food, don't expect the lousy servers here to notice. One star is actually too many stars for this place.

Text: Great place for a date night. My husband and I always make our way out here on special occasions or when we randomly start craving their Almond chicken entree. It's heaven in your mouth!!

Text: Great food. Every time I go, the staff is very attentive and caring. You can tell the food is made plate by plate and that each plate is paid attention to before it goes out. Will always come back.
