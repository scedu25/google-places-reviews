Text: Place was cool, good service, good food, good beer, spendy, kinda fancy. Was with children, we were put behind the etched glass day care part of the pub. Big beautiful space for adults, don't let them put you in time out!

Text: Food was ok. Service good. Prices fair. Choices were very nice. The goat cheese salad was good with chicken. My friend had the turkey stack. It was a little hard to eat...it kept falling apart. Not very busy for lunch time.

Text: This is my "go to place" when I want to meet up with friends.  Great flat bread pizzas (happy hour price is best in KC/Topeka area, perhaps best in entire USA) and the beverages are great. Friends and I meet at least once a week for food and great conversation.  Everyone has different tastes but for me, this place is a hidden jewel in the KC, Lawrence, Topeka area.
