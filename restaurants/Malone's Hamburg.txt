Text: Service was good.  The server was very friendly. The food was good.  I had read an article claiming it was the best steak in KY.  I wouldn’t say that but it was good.  The potato croquettes were amazing!

Text: This place was great! Our server Graham was very friendly and attentive. The filet with BBQ was possibly one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. A bit pricey, but well worth it!

Text: Food and service great but they are in middle of remodeling as of 11/3/17.  Done about 11/24 they say.  Considering remodel it was still nice.  Potatoe skins and mini cheeseburgers hard to beat.

Text: Excellent food and service.  A little on the expensive side. Highly recommend the deep fried lobster appetizer

Text: My wife and I spent our 1st Anniversary Eve Lunch here. The food was amazing. The drink I had was also really good. I would definitely come back here again.
