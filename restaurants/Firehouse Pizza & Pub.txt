Text: I'll NEVER go to this one again. We walked in with over an hour left of the lunch buffet. Went up to check what was currently out, all of it had ti be sitting out for at least 15 minutes from how cold the cheese looked and the discoloration of the toppings. I asked the guy at the counter how long it takes for requests and he says there wont be anything more added to the buffet. He hads me a menu to look at for single orders then with tone says "Get away from the counter I have a customer" as someone walks in. Well I walked out and will NEVER go back to this one.
