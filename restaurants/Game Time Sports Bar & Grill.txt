Text: Highly would reccomend to anyone visiting Dodge City! I went in around 6PM and it is a family friendly bar and grill! For my appetizer I got nachos, they were the best nachos I have ever ordered (perfectly balanced with toppings). For my main dish I got their chicken fried steak, which was also the best I've ever eaten! Service was also excellent, my cup never ran dry! If your visiting or rolling threw dodge, try them out!
