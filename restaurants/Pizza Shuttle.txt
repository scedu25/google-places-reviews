Text: The $5 walk in special.is unbeatable, and the crew cheese pepperoni is amazing. Everytime I bring kids, I get side eye from the other customers.  I recommend avoiding dining in if you have a family, even though you can feed everyone cheaply.

Text: The pizza is fantastic, flavorful, and filling.  But the best part is the price, I believe a 6 slice pizza is $5.50.  There are plenty of topping options. We also got the cinnamon sticks which are to die for.

Text: Love Pizza Shuttle! Excellent pizza, kind staff and pleasant atmosphere. I just wish they would accept credit/debit card. So many instances when I want to get a pizza from there but I have no cash or checks on me so I end up somewhere else. Please get a system that takes cards! That would be so awesome.
