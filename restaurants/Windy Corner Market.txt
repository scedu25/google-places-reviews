Text: This is a wonderful little treasure.  The food is awesome.  Makes my top ten list of best burgers.  Find this place if your close to Lexington, go out of the way if you have the time. You will get to see one of the most beautiful parts of Kentucky on your drive and have a great meal.  Don't forget to grab desert for the road.  All the food I have had from here is amazing.  Be prepared for a line during lunch hours.

Text: Food is extremely tasty. The double bacon cheeseburger is ungodly huge. It is a little pricey... But it is overwhelmingly satisfying if you're patient on your food order. Just stop by relax enjoy the company of your friends and family and have some damn good food.

Text: One of the best things about this restaurant is the setting. It's out in the country, surrounded by fields with horses. The food is pretty casual... sandwiches, po boys, burgers and salads. Their side salads are particularly good and can be substituted for the chips that come with the basket type items. The line is often long, you order at the register and then the food is brought to you. They pride themselves in using local ingredients and also sell goods from other local stores.
