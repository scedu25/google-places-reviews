Text: Love weekend brunching here. Love the ample sunlight in the main dining room. Good food, pretty good price as well. I will say, I have gotten an attitude here before from the chef about doing a substitution (I asked for plantains instead of potatoes with my meal). They serve plantains, so I didn't see the problem.

Text: Decent beer selection, Mostly ipas if that's your thing. Terrible service. We got the wheel, a flight of the 27 beers on draft. We had to fight tooth and nail to even get served after ordering and it took an hour to get our flight. No they weren't busy. That came to $100, which is way more expensive than getting a 4 once of each beer separately. Ridiculous.

Text: Average prices, very good food. Nice place. They have a good beer list and some very good European wines. Not cheap, but worth it.

Text: We came with a group and the service was good - friendly and quick. The meal itself was okay. We didn't have any complaints, but the consensus was that we wouldn't necessarily seek Radio Maria out again on future trips to Champaign.
