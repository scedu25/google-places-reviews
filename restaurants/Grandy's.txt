Text: Waited 10 minutes with only one customer in front of me to make my order. Two of the four things I ordered were not prepared and I was told I would have to wait another 20 minutes. I left and went down the street to KFC where the service was great and quik.

Text: Its a southern based fried food home style fast food place. you would think it would be awesome with fried chicken and livers and home sides like potatoes and green beans but it was horribly bland. nothing had any seasoning. not the chicken itself not the sides and the breading tasted liked dried fried flour. It was not good.
