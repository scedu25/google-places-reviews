Text: Beer was good. Service is terrible. I stood at counter (I was only one at counter) way to long before someone came over to take my order. Mind you there were 3 people working  behind the counter and never acknowledged me. 

This was my second experience at this restaurant.  The first time there was no indication that you order at the counter and so I waited at my table for a server for a few minutes. When I noticed someone cleaning a table I asked for a menu and was then informed of the process. Customer service goes a LONG way.

I won't be back nor will I recommend.

Text: What a great place to eat. Been coming here for many years and I've had probably 1 bad experience for a 100. Which isn't bad at all.

Food is pricey but rightly so. It tastes great and the drinks are unique too

Text: Had some excellent beer and a lasagna pizza today! Then while I was there they tapped a new porter that they serve with a bit’o’honey candy!! Peanut buttery with a hint of honey. All I can say is AMAZING! I am usually an IPA guy but this was a special treat!

Text: I was surprised that this was a counter service kind of place. Had to wait in line a bit, but it seems to work out okay. I had one of their home made root beers which was good. I was with men who like meaty pizzas. It was too salty for me.
