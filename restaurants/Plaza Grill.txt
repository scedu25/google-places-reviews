Text: Great service. Waitress was really nice but will NOT interrupt you if you're on your phone. So if you want service, you have to put it down. LOL! The shaved beef open face sandwich with mashed potatoes was REALLY good. Just the right amount too. I was seated quickly and served my drink in about 2 minutes. Full lunch for less than $10!  You don't find that anywhere anymore.

Text: Great Service,  This place has had some bad reviews, My experience was good. Wait staff was pleasant and quick. and the chicken fried steak was very good and huge. My sever explained that a few of the "rude employees" are no longer there. Overall a good experience. Brylee was my server, she was great.

Text: Horrible.  The wait staff was rude including the manager and the owner refused to come out.  The food was cold.  Couldn't pay me to go back.  Don't waste your time or money.

Text: I walked in and all the help was sitting down and everyone acted like they were doing me a favor. The waitress was rude and incredibly slow. I had to get up once to find her and she was sitting up front clipping coupons. The food was absolutely terrible. It was hurried and not fully cooked. Everybody there just acted like we were interrupting whatever they were doing and I'm not going to spend any more money in the restaurant here
