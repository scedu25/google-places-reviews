The Crazy Cowboy

Text: Just tried this place yesterday. The food and service was fine but I was majorly disappointed in my margarita.  There was more ice than drink after a few sips it was gone. The server asked if I was ready for another one and I had to laugh. I'm a real light weight when it comes to alcohol and this didn't do anything but set me back $4.

Text: Best place ever! I was in there yesterday for lunch and had Bobbi as my server. Best service I've had in forever. Definitely an asset to the cowboy. I'll be back, thanks again.
