Text: Went there for dinner with the kids while on a visit. We had the fried avacado ? and macaroni tacos. Food and service was great. I got a gift for it being my first visit. The kids eat here often and love it. Good selection of ?

Text: Was seated, did not receive any service for 20 minutes, finally asked if we could get any drinks or menu's to a waitress who had been busy talking to a few guests. She said "yeah eventually", we walked out. The place once was good but never again.

Text: A little long for the food to come out,  but it was worth the wait.  I got the new duck bacon and brie melt, IT WAS AMAZING!!! Definitely would recommend.

Text: It was good but my meal was a tad expensive. But it wasn't bad.  I don't know if I would go there again. My mother had fish and salad.  I had 3 tacos and beans and rice. We both had tea to drink.

Text: Worst restaurant experience in the last year.  I won't be going back.  Our waitress was fine but they were short on help.  It took forever to get drinks and food.  My wife ordered Beer Brined Chicken which arrived overcooked, burnt and dried out (they comped it).  My Fish Tacos were smothered in some spicy  creamy sauce like I had never had there before.  Too bad it was such a miserable experience as I was embarrassed for the couple we had brought with.  They won't be back either.  They have changed here as I had several good outing there over the last two years.  Why should I take a chance going back?  McDonalds is more consistent than they are!
