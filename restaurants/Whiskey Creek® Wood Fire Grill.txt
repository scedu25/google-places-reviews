Text: The Food and service was more than expected. Friendly service greeted us at the door, the knowledgeable staff helped identify what I was craving. The juicy, Grilled steak was cooked, just as I asked! The Moscow Mule Cocktail was Unforgettable!! If you want, more than you expect, go to whiskey Creek, Norfolk, Ne.
