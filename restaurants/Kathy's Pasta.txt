Text: This is our favorite go to family restaurant in Bolivar. Whether it's just us wanting to go out as a couple us wanting to take the family or wanting to take friends are family from out of town this is always our first pick. They have wonderful outdoor seating when the weather is good and their menu is exceptional. The staff is always gracious and welcoming, if it is not right let them know and they always make it right.

Text: The food is good. You can sometimes wait a while on busy nights. Prices aren't unreasonable. A bit noisy for my taste but that really can't be helped.

Text: We have enjoyed every meal at kathy's Pasta in Bolivar.  This evening they were busy but brought our salads right out, and by the time we finished the salads our main course was served.  I ordered the special, which was a large serving of angel hair pasta with a delicious cheesy, tomatoey, buttery sauce and several plump butterflied and sauteed shrimp.  The waitress seemed genuinely interested in our experience and when she asked how I had liked the food, I told her it was simply to die for.  When she came back she said she told Cathy what I said, and that special was Cathy's favorite special.  Oh, and my husband was too busy downing his big helping of lasagna to speak up.  Seriously, how does it get any better than friendly staff, good service and good food?
