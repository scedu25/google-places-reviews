Text: The staff was very friendly. Manager came out and introduced herself. Food was delicious. I recommend trying the stuffed peppers. You will find them under the appetizers. We will definitely be back to this Bandidos.

Text: Love the new menu. We stopped going when they quit serving iceburg lettuce. Who wants romaine lettuce on a taco? Servers are always fast and the food is great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the salsa. I prefer sauce.

Text: I love this Bandidos the most.  It's always clean and that is important to me as a guest.  Love the 'create your own' menu, and that I can get iceberg lettuce in my menu choices rather than romaine or greens.  The food is always hot.  My waitress, Roxanne was happy to serve me and kept my drinks, salsa and chips filled!  Awesome!

Text: This food is better than authentic! Friendly staff. Good food. And big drinks served in Mason jars. A classic Fort Wayne Mexican restaurant.
