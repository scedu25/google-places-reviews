Text: No toilet seat cover lid thingy. No shortage of hot water! I felt like, Rain Man! Its a good spot. Good service. I'd stay again.

Text: Food and drinks are a bit pricey. The bartender will take care of you and if you have an off the wall drink request they'll happily oblige. I'm happy I dropped in but it is in no way a regular spot due to the price.

Text: Very seldom I give a place a bad rating but this place seriously has a stick up its ass. Between the server telling a customer how orders are taken, to insulting drink choices I'm surprised that it remains in buisness. Food selections easily attainable at any other restaurant in the city. Drinks are highly overpriced. Staff and servers do not treat clients with a feeling of being welcomed. Save yourself the time & money and choose a local restaurant that's welcoming

Text: AMAZING Room!!!! You are given a modern studio apartment with full kitchen and washer and dryer. Huge bed and your own back deck. The staff are great and we haven't even touched on the bar and grill. Really good food and music with the option of eating outside. If you need a place to stay Z Loft should be at the top of your list. I will be looking for this hotel chain whenever I travel in the future!
