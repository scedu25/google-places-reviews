Hibachi Master
Rating: 5
Text: Their service was fantastic. They came often to see if everything was to our liking. The food was amazing and we enjoyed the hibachi. The sake was really good. We got both the hana sweet flavored sake (white peach and apple) and the hot sake. We liked both types of sake. Their pricing was really good for how much food you got. We already want to go again!!!

Text: Very good place for sushi.  Never sat at habichi but have had my daughter's leftovers and we're very tasty.  Only had a problem with the food once, but owner made it right.  Atmosphere is nice a prices are correct.

Text: Absolutely wonderful! Best sushi in the area. Best ingredients, best service, incredible presentation, laid back atmosphere, and best prices! Half price Thursday and Sunday. The saki is actually some quality stuff as well, unlike the other major east side sushi places. Come here, you will not be disappointed.

Text: Our son is allergic to rice, sitting hibachi they cooked his first. They were so accommodating, not to mention the food is also good and the beer is always ice cold.
