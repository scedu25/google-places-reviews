Legends Patio Grill and Bar
Rating: 1
Text: Interior is decent as it's a sports bar but food is not freshly prepared. Hamburgers are made from frozen patties. Sampler platter tasted like the items had been in the freezer a little too long. Costs an extra dollar for tomatoes for the hamburger. Chili was decent. Not worth a second visit. Better food at other sorts bars.

Text: The flatiron steak was delicious. Service on the patio was a little slow and the mixed drinks were a little disappointing. If you don't like sweat bees don't bother sitting outside.

Text: Warning: the blue cheese dressing actually contains blue cheese. I had the Cobb salad for the second time tonight and it was awesome. I have eaten here several times over the last year while staying at a nearby hotel and am always pleased. Food has always been good, even late in the evening. The draft beer selection is limited, but adequate.
