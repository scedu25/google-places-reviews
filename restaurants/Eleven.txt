Text: This is my favorite bar in the whole area~ The bartenders are so sweet, and they make some great drinks!  They really take time to get to know you, and they just seem like genuine people. The music here is awesome.. they played Kerli! 
The food here is good, too. This is a great place to come for the happy hour-- I recommend the calamari!!
