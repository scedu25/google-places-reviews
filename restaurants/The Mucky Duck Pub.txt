The Mucky Duck Pub

Text: Nice small bar/pub. I has the fish & chips.  Fish was very greasy &  bland.  My husband had Bangers & Mash.  He loved it.

Our friends had the lunch special. It had way too much Rosemary seasoning.

They have a.great selection of beers and tea. 

We will likely not return. Server was great.

Text: Quirky pub with quirky landlord. Great beers and cider on tap. Excellent selection of dishes from both sides of the Atlantic. Also has England's most popular dish--curry. Attentive staff. 
Ignore any bad reviews you may have read. No room for food snobs at The Duck!

Text: My wife and I got this place up every once in a while so I can have a full English breakfast.  We have also stopped in for lunch a few times.  Their beers and food all provide a time machine for me to reflect upon when I was stationed in the Midlands.  The full English breakfast will set you up for a great day.  A pint of hobgoblin is a great way to finish a day.  Pick up some British candy or groceries on your way out.  

The owner and staff are great.  They hold special events you can see if you follow them on Facebook.

Text: Great selection of brews, tea, food and all things British. I had the haggis, and it was actually quite good!
And the atmosphere sits perfectly between a typical small English pub and a typical American college-town bar. You'd feel just as comfortable here watching Arsenal or the Hawkeyes. Or maybe even Downton Abbey.

Text: A bit quirky, but this pub has fantastic food, especially bangers and mash, and fantastic beer. They rotate through some and keep solid choice on regular. They've recently expanded their Scotch choices even! The British Foods store inside this pub also has some wonderful teas and British mustard. Definitely my favorite pub in the area.
