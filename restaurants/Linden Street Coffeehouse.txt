Text: Amazing food! My daughter and I came for breakfast. Her face lit up when they brought her stuffed French toast which had the presentation of a 5 star restaurant. We left feeling happy and full. The atmosphere warm and welcoming!

Text: Found this restaurant online traveling back from Kansas City to Minnesota and decided to give it a try. Excellent food. Food was fresh and decent price, cute small town atmosphere. Worth the few mile drive off of 35. Give it a try!

Text: We always enjoy a small detour through Lamoni when travelling on I-35.  We like to get coffee here and maybe see some Amish buggies on the street.  The coffee and service are great!
