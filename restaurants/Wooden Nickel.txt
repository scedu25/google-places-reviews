Text: Went for birthday lunch today.  Waited a VERY LONG time for our order to be taken.  And there was only one other table with patrons at the time.  My husband's sausages were swimming in barbecue sauce and my toasted ravioli was DREADFUL!  Tough and chewy, I was barely able to cut through it.  Salad was so-so with little flavor.  Absolutely will not return.  Seems like 20 years ago it might have been good but has kids running it now, maybe?  And it was dirty out in front.  Yuck.

Text: Went up to have dinner in a rush before work, service was awesome, burger was cooked exactly how I wanted it to be and the price was great. $7.50 for a huge burger (basically had a garden salads worth of veggies to go on it as well) fries which were made fresh and seasoned great and a bowl of stew. Overall had a great visit for a very affordable price.

Text: Service is poor, I've had better food from a microwave, they rank above 1star due to their long island ice tea.

Text: Decent, small bar.  My favorite part is the basement stairwell where apparently everybody pees and no one cleans up
