Steinkeller

Text: My family and I arrived at Steinkeller at 6:45pm on a Friday night and, with Oxford being a college town, we expected a wait. Our wait was 45 minutes... which was much shorter than our wait for food. 

When we got seated we made sure to order food at the same time as our drinks to save time. Drinks came fairly quickly, as did the app (fried calamari) and our 2-year-old's pasta dish; however, my wife's salad (a side salad w/ blue cheese) and my sandwich and fries (TIP: Do not upgrade to fries for $2.00) took forever. 

When our food finally came it was long after the children had finished theirs, which may have been an issue if we didn't inhale our food in five minutes, plus it took a while to flag down our server (who had been noticeably crying multiple times before approaching our table) for a check. 

Long story short... we arrived at 6:45pm and left at 9:45pm! Unfortunately, we didn't experience any one thing that would be reason enough to try again during off-peak hours. The hostess was nice, that's about it, sadly. :/

Text: Went on a slow Monday night. Clean restaurant, good beer selection and authentic menu. Our waitress was very quick and attentive, even made menu recommendations. Will be back as often as possible!

Text: Wednesday night is steak night at the Keller. I had a steak prepared just as ordered (rare--something no other Oxford restaurant seems to be able to do.) Comes with a choice of potato, an onion rings and a salad for under $14. Pair it with a great German beer!

Text: Great food! So glad we tried it! We will definitely come back. The potato pancakes were the best we've ever had.

Text: Definitely wonderful food! Wednesday night is steak night for $15 which is a steal for the amount of food you get for It! The steak was amazing! The service is a little slow but with good friends you won't even notice!
