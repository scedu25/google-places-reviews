Text: Nice atmosphere, good service. Lemon chicken salad was excellent with the "Hot Bacon" dressing. We were offered alternative greens and our choice of mixed romaine and spinach was perfect. 

We were intrigued by hand-made ice cream, since we have to avoid corn syrup. We selected Chai and "ChillyCoffeeToffee" from a list of eight appealing flavors. Not only did they taste great, but their presentation in a sugar cone cup and surrounded by decoratively placed whipped cream and flavored syrup drizzles made them a delightful experience.

Text: Not only is this the best coffee I can find in the area, but the atmosphere of the cafe is so peaceful. I usually hang out for a few hours, just because I enjoy it so much there. The servers are all super polite, as well.

Text: Awesome cafe! They have excellent coffee, an awesome menu, a wonderful atmosphere, and great customer service. Free Wi-Fi here as well. If you buy a coffee mug here you get to keep it on the shelf and then you get free coffee everytime you come in. Great place! Lunch was amazing as well! The workers here are very polite, witty, and personable.
