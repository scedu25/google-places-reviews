Text: Clients took me here not realizing I am a vegetarian,  nonetheless,  I had a delicious dish of pasta and roasted vegetables,  the service was impeccable,  the wine was great,  martinis looked amazing,  and I have to admit my colleagues dishes did have me a bit jealous... desserts were incredible!

Text: David was an absolutely wonderful waiter, the food was fabulous. They didn't mind that I and my cousin shared our meals and it's an energetic environment but still quiet enough to have a conversation

Text: Went for a Birthday Besties night... Excellent service and great recommendations from our server. The food was fresh and served quickly. We didn't even have time to finish our appetizers, we both had the Crab and Shrimp Bisque- AWESOME before our meals came which were the Wildfire's Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut and the Potato-Crusted East Coast Sea Scallops. I would totally recommend the Martini Flight as well as Flight 1 (White Wine Quad) both flights paired well with our meals and keep the conversation fun.  As the dinner came to an end the server brought out the Birthday Brownie Cake and Ice Cream... AMAZINGLY DECADENT!!!

Text: Wonderful dinner with my sons. I had the macadamia crusted halibut, one son had seared tuna steak , and the other had a HUGE burger. We started with seafood trio appetizer, all of us needed doggy bags. Great food, generous portions, and our waiter was incredibly friendly while being respectful of our privacy. ?
