Text: Serves Great Italian food on Sundays,  1 time had 2 chicken fried steaks with mash potatoes and green beans, was awesome,  for about $10.00, took over half of food home in go box, ate 3 times on it. We stop there every chance we get. Service is Great, and Staff are Great! I don't think a lot of People know about this little Gem, but, do stop in and try it, You'll be glad You did.

Text: Great place with many dinning atmosphere options.  There is a rodeo, library, hunting club, museum, and colonial room. Good variation of food choices.  Even an elk burger!  Kind of seems like they wanted to open an Italian restaurant, but then realized they needed to cater to the small county town they are in.

Text: Can be kind of pricey at times but the tiramisu is homemade and lovely to eat Luigi is the best waiter and host you could have food varies from time to time sometimes it's excellent other times it's subpar

Text: Anyone's guess when and if the place is open.  Very very limited menu, not a good place to stop if you want anything other than the daily special.  Friday fish meal is simply not what you want from a small town diner.
