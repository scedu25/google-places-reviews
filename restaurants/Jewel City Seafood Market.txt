Jewel City Seafood Market

Text: Best seafood that I have ever had inland!  This restaurant is an awesome little hidden gem of Huntington.  If you love seafood and can't make it to the beach, this restaurant is the next best thing.  Reasonably priced, great customer service, and cozy atmosphere.  And it didn't hurt that they had Jimmy Buffet as the dinner music!  Highly recommend!

Text: Such great food always fresh and yummy. The oysters are always a fav add in the crab legs and it's a little slice of heaven.  Staff is friendly, I have never left being unsatisfied or full.  If you love seafood you will enjoy this little "jewel" tucked in a quaint little shop with many treasures from the sea to chose from.
