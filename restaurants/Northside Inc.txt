Text: I tried to get propane from them and they were very rude and the hardest place to get anything done. I will never get anything from them I have never been so unwelcome in a new community until I walked into north side Inc.. It was snowing no help or assistance they offered nothing..... this place did not welcome the newcomer.  they shunned me away in the cold..Never again.... I would not recommend them to anybody
