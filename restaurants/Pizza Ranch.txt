Text: Great pizza and desserts. Really nice that you can order your favorite pizza for no extra charge. Plus you get first dibs, it's brought to your table. Family friendly. Good salad bar.

Text: The best chicken around! I know the name says pizza but I swear most people go for the fried chicken. They ask if you want any specific pizza when you initial come in and bring it by your table before putting it out on the buffet line.
