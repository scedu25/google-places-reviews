Text: This is my favorite Chineseplace because of the Hawaiian chicken. I haven't found it anywhere else. Service is Mediocre and don't expect a refill.

Text: Today we ate at kings buffet as we have in the future. Our previous visits weren't the greatest so far as customer service, but today was not good at all.......there were 7 of us, and three of our friends left before us, and paid for the three of them. But we got a check for 7 instead of 4 people. When we questioned it, the manager was insistent that we still owed for 7 and not 4. And despite our calling our friend on the phone to verify that he paid for 3 people, the manager still tried to get us to pay. The manager is BLATANT in his prejudice toward BLACK people, as he has been in the past toward us! We've been very tolerant in the past and still gave him our business, but NO MORE! If they don't appreciate our regular business, then they won't recieve it!......and I will encourage others not to do the same!

Text: A run of the mill Chinese buffet. Fast, decent, moderately priced. Not great, not terrible.
