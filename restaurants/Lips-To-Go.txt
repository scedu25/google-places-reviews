Text: Spicy Dead Chicken Heaven! Budweiser Blue Cheese Dressing so good you're tempted to swig it!! I don't eat at Burlington often. But when I do my face is covered in lip sauce & budweiser dressing!

Text: Had stopped in and ordered Chicken Lips. No problem waiting for 10 minutes. Miscellaneous sizes, no uniform lip sizes which contributed mightily to 3 rating. 
   Smaller sized lips dry, overcooked which was unappealing.
   Disappointed as we have stopped here over many years...and used to be much better.
   I will probably not return.

Text: Lips are breaded and fried strips of chicken breast. The lips and sauce were good.
