Text: After the husker game we went to the restaurant. Waited a half an hour for a table for 6 to open. Then sat and waited for 15 more minutes as the restaurant was by then only half full. Placed order. That took nearly half hour. Waitress was slow and brought out part of the orders then more later. Food was good. Fries lukewarm. I won't eat there again. We ate at the Kitchen restaurant the night before. That service was awesome. Should have gone there again.

Text: Their breakfast buffet is wonderful. Well worth the drive and a great value. A lot of choices, both hot and cold. Very friendly, attentive staff.
UPDATE: Had to remove one of my stars after my last visit on 6/11/17. Service seemed lacking. We kept having to ask for coffee/water refills, sometimes multiple times before we got a refill, and it took quite some time to get anyone to clear dirty dishes from the table. Hopefully, just an off day for the staff.
