Text: I went in for dinner with my boyfriend and tip 10% and they ran after us  to tell us we didn’t tip enough. They demanded us to tip 15%! We tip what we felt the waitress deserved. They were lucky we even tipped at all!

Text: I walked in with my friend and her daughter. Instantly, we were transported to downtown Seoul. It was clear that management is committed to cleanliness and customer satisfaction. Although some of the staff was a bit hard to understand, they were all patient and quite courteous.

We ordered a few appetizers and our meals with our beverages after a few minutes of perusing the menus. That didn't stop them from presenting each course at an appropriate pace to keep us satisfied and interested. Each item was expertly prepared and looked just like the menu, if not better. The smells, sounds, and flavours mingled, hanging on the air and seduced our tongues.

More than that, the restrooms were clean. No issues. No complaints. I will be visiting again.

Text: Very good food.  Cold and drafty seating.  Not an especially welcoming place, nor were the employees.  Maybe they were chilly!
