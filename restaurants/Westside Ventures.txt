Text: A little on the expensive side but it's great for those little things you don't want to drive all the way to town for. Also has great burgers.

Text: Owner is very rude and arrogant. Lori Wilson is a drug addicted selfish person that kicks people out of the store if they disagree with anything she says or does. She banned an 85 year old woman just because she disagreed with her.
Overpriced as well!
