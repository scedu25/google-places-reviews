Text: This was our 3rd time eating at the kopper kettle.We live 5 hrs away so it is a special treat for us.
We got great service from Sonya and her support staff.The chicken was not as we remember it being our last two visit.Did not have a good taste. The green beans were great corn was good mash potatoes good gravy good.
Ice Cream great.
The atmosphere is priceless.
The service was great as well.

Text: Used to love this place.  But there is something much different.   The food taste more like a box meal instead of homemade.  Don't think I will be back.

Text: One of the best fried chicken places in the area. 100 year old Victorian style mansion turned into a restaurant. The chicken has sometimes been hit or miss, size wise, but always very good old style pan / skillet fried. Sometimes the chicken pieces are very tiny like hot wing size, other times they're normal sized chicken. The mashed potatoes and gravy are great, as is the corn, green beans, and rolls.  The servers wear old style uniforms and there is outside dining during nice weather. Good place to eat and a decent price as expected for this type of place and food.

Text: Been coming to the Kopper Kettle since 1978.
I have always had great food and service.  Today I celebrated my 66th birthday with my wife and my mother at your wonderful restuarant. Could have been better!  My mother was very impressed with the scenery and excellent food. Will certainly be back in the near future!
