Text: Went to the one in Greenwood Park Mall.  
Ordered the Veggie/Chicken. 
Got two little pieces of chicken, tons of fried rice.
Veggies were hard and lacking flavor.
Not much stuffing in the egg roll.
over priced. 
Could have went to Sarku Japan, two vendors over, and gotten so much more meat, soft veggies and good rice.
Very disappointed, won't go back.
