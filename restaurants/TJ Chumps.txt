Text: Great food and great service every time, no matter which location you choose. I've never heard anyone complain about this restaurant. I took my cousin there while she was in town and she said it is her new favorite place. Definitely go, you will be a customer for life.

Text: Went to a great little event at this TJ Chumps location with a friend recently.   They were featuring Dayton Beer Company brews at $2 a pint!  Both of us ordered dinner.  Both of us were very pleased!  I ordered the rib basket, over onion rings instead of fries.  It was excellent.   Those ribs were so tender and so tasty, I have to rate them five stars all by themselves.   The service was also five star.  It was a great event all the way around!

Text: I can see why this is such a highly recommended restaurant.  Quick friendly service and the food was delicious.  I got a basket of their baby back ribs basket and was surprised how fast it came out and how it fell off the bone as I touched it.  
In my opinion they could've thrown an extra half mini rack to make it look more like a meal and not an appetizer (in fairness I'm 6'3/ 200lbs). Soup of the day (cheesy potato with bacon and chives) was delicious wish I could make it myself!! 
I was convinced to try their fried twinky dessert and I loved it.  My heart and arteries might disagree ha
Overall greater experience would highly recommend!

Text: Fries came out cold and burger ordered medium was rare at best. Server or manager kept going back and distracting cooks.

Text: It's a really nice place to get a bite to eat and some drinks to go with it. Full bar and restaurant.  They also have a large outdoor seating area, that's three quarters under roof, as well as a full bar. Lots of Tv's to view around the establishment. Daily drink and food specials are available here.
