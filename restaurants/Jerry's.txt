Text: My dads family is from here and we always stop. Best pizza ever! Love that they keep it old school. I remember getting beanie babies here when I was little. I hope they are still there.

Text: Their Reuben is wonderful!  Their spaghetti is TERRIBLE!!! Tastes like someone dumped cups of sugar in it!!  Pizza is ok.  High on grease low on flavor!  But better than Papa George's at least!!
