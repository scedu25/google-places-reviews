Text: Delicious food and friendly service!  We had the black bean burger and the salmon blt.  Both were great.  Decent draft selection, including local taps.  Will be back.

Text: Very nice place with at least 3 different rooms, great bar with crafts on tap and domestic bottles. We were there for lunch so only had sandwiches but they were fantastic and also great service. Well definitely back. Probably a lot.

Text: Great food and good service. It took a while for us to get the check and we walked into the kitchen trying to find the official back entrance. Still, the turkey and brie sandwich I had was outstanding. Others in my party also had good things to say about their food.

Text: Came to have dinner. Waited 5 minutes to be seated. No-one was in the place. Then we waited 15 minutes before anyone came to get drink order. Then another 30 minutes for food when it arrived it was burnt. Will not be coming back. Would give a negative star.
