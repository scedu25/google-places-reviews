Text: We stumbled across this gem during a work trip to Indianola. Every thing was excellent in flavor, quick to get brought out and very reasonable price. The bread bowl was outrageously good with cream of broccoli soup overflowing. The chili was the perfect side dish for my lunch. The cookies...oh the cookies are so delicious. The entire crew makes you feel like they see you every day. Thank you Funaro's team for a wonderful break in the day for lunch...3 days in a row!

Text: Food is homemade and delicious. Good sized portions. Not really cheap ($8-$12 with soda), but worth it if you're in the neighborhood.

Text: Awesome food and great service!  Their bread bowls are amazing! (seriously, it's ruined other places bread bowls for me as I've yet to find anything that compares!)
