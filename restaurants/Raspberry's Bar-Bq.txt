Text: Service was ok. Pulled pork was way too dry with little flavor. Baked beans tasted like a small dish of right out of the can pork n beans. Baked potato was good. We will not be back.

Text: Note: Itz my frist time experience here. From I'm from New London county, Ct.  It's was pleasant. Over all good food. Friendly waitress, we Had the Catfich & Ground Brisket dinners. Co.es with 2 sides. Catfish was good, Ground Brisket was good too. Potato salad was like Nasty. Personally I recommend "NOT to Order it". Its Like if it was like the  pre-made shipped to the  supermarket tub brand.( the taste.Yuck) unless I was starving  I suppose I would eat. Some ppl do like that kind but definitely nt most ppl I knw. They should make it Homemade. My worst made salad would taste way better. Matter of fact I couldn't make 1 bad enough if I tried. Lol. AGAIN Besides that. A GOOD EXPERIENCE,  FOOD WAZ GOOD. PORTIONS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER. FREE REFILLS DEFINITELY  WOULDN'T HURT.  IT WOULD BALANCE OUT PRICE WHEN U MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING SOMETHING THATZ NT TO ANYBODYS LIKING... I WOULD RETURN TO TRY MORE THINGZ ON THE  MENU. BUT NT THE POTATO SALAD.. LOL..UNLESS THEY CHANGE IT.
