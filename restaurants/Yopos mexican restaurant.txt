Text: Very good hot food.  Quick and friendly service.  Tons of food on the plate when it came out of kitchen.  Enough for two meals.  Took home doggie bag.  Will definitely be back.

Text: Visited once. Their chili rellanos are probably the worst I've ever had. The building is also depressing - we sat halfway in the dark.  

Good points: The service was quick and friendly and the bulldog mural was nice.
