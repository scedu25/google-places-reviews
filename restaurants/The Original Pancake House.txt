The Original Pancake House

Text: Service and food were good. Coffee is served in cups (vs mugs). Cups are fine, but need to be filled often to keep coffee hot. The first time I was there, it was busy and my cup wasn’t maintained often enough. My second visit was nice.

Text: Go to breakfast place close to Notre Dame's campus. Coffee is delicious and the portions are GIANT! Feels like home when you walk in. Always, busy but the line moves fast. Worth the wait!

Text: Portion sizes are huge, and great value for the money.  Old timey feel, some of the wait staff have been there forever.  But food is great, sizes awesome.  I have gluten issues, but I throw that out the window when I order the pancakes cause if I'm going down I'm going down eating awesome pancakes.
