Text: Haven't been forever. Used to go all the time but they cook the shrimp way to long & make it tough. Stopped going when the health dept scores were disgustingly low

Text: Never really had a bad experience here. Food has been good, timely and affordable. Most waiters/waitresses were professional.  Been going there since they opened. Will continue.

Text: They serve vegitarian taco salad, which I think is a rare find.  Broccoli could have been fresher, but mushrooms are not canned, which is a plus.  Servicers are friendly and food comes quickly.

Text: The food was not the best. It was on the lower end of what I'm used to in the Midwest. Despite that the people were friendly, and they kept me stocked with tortillas.
