Text: My husband and I have been going to this restaurant almost since it opened.  We always receive excellent service, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  If a dish doesn't taste right, they will fix it in a jiffy.  The dishes have changed over the years, but the flavors have always remained amazing.  My husband would not eat vegetables that had been cooked before we started going to this place.  It has been a food altering experience for him, exposing him to spicy cuisine as well as tasty ways to have cooked vegetables.

The prices are completely reasonable to the proportions and they have an amazing beer and scotch selection to boot.  The decor is understated and peaceful.  The patio outside has lovely foliage, my only issue is that it butts up against Lindbergh so the traffic noise can be overwhelming.

Overall my favorite restaurant in North county to this day.

Text: My favorite is the Bankok Noodle. Everything on the menu is awesome. My entire team carry out lunch about once a week.if you enjoy spicy food to try the spice challenge. Anything about spice level 15 will burn you twice!

Text: Pearl Cafe received the Riverfront Times award for Best Thai food a few years in a row. I can understand why. This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I come here almost weekly. 
I love the Spicy Green Beans, the Pearl Special Spicy Soup, the 3-Flavored Fish,  the currys, the fried rice dishes, the other soups, pretty much everything I've tried. I had the Bangkok Noodles today.
It's all good.

Text: No better place to eat in North County. I'm addicted to Bangkok Noodles with duck. Owner and operator Scott Troung does an amazing job preparing his families recipes. Great beer, scotch and bourbon collection as well. Good friend, great cook, amazing wait staff. I know I sound overboard but it's that good.

Text: Food and service is always great. The beer selection is amazing. And if you are a whisky drinker, they have you covered too.
