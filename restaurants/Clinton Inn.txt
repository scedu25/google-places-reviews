Text: Staff was nice and the jambalaya was surprisingly good. They chill your drink glasses here too, or maybe it was because I ordered a beer but it was a nice touch. If I'm in the area again, I will return. Also, I left my hat there that evening. When I called in the morning, before they were even open, they we're happy to return my hat to me. It had been placed on their coat racks by the evening wait staff. Very friendly people

Text: Attended the Sunday brunch. The food wad very good. Not a big spread but the made to order omelettes make the meal. Nice quiet place for good food and conversation. No rush. Reasonably priced.

Text: Quaint, historic location is biggest draw. Simpler steak and potato dishes are good; more complicated plates are mediocre. Good pasta. Decent prices. Okay overall.
