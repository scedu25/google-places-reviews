Text: This has to be the worst pizza ever. I'm not sure if the people who liked it have never had anything better or what but I went here because everyone said the pizza was good and it was awful. Maybe they were just having a bad night? The toppings basically fell off the pizza and you end up with crust left.. Very disappointing because when it came out the pizza actually looked good.

Text: Walts is the best local pizza place in SoIL. Then again, I might just be biased because it was probably the first pizza I ever ate over twenty years ago. Buffet is perfect at lunch time, but carry out is great also on a busy weeknight.

Text: This place has very friendly staff, the food is great, only gave it 4 starts because of the long wait each time to get a seat.
