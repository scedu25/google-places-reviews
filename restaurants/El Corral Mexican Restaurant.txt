Text: We enjoyed our experience.  We thought the pick three lunch menu offered lots of choices for a great price.  Our food was delicious and we will definitely be back.

Text: Very poor quality food. You're able to easily tell that things were previously frozen. Staff is nice enough, but can be really rude if asked do do anything extra.
