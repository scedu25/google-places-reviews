Text: Food is fresh unlike other restaurants that are similar. Decore is new and clean. Overall a great place to take the whole family or maybe a few friends.

Text: We liked it.  The best selection (large number of entrees) in the area, and the Indian Chicken is just the way I like it.  As buffet fare goes I thought it was excellent and plan to return often.

Text: Went in for dinner on Saturday afternoon , Buffet was old ,left overs from lunch.
Still ate and was gong to enjoy anyways. The Chinese girl that worked our table was rude and yelling at others in Chinese. Didn't want to get me salt & peper told me to get it by kitchen...Lazy.. Didn't tip and will think twice before going again in future..Fall City, Ne isn't to fare for better service and food..
