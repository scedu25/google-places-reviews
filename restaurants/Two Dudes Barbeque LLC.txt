Text: I eat at Two Dudes BBQ on a regular basis. The food is amazing and the staff are divine! The giant pork steak and baked beans are my favorite. Just tried the ribs and I'm now a fan of those too! Great place to eat.  :)

Text: We stopped off I-70 looking for lunch at a locally owned place, and missed seeing it the first time we turned south off the freeway, but found this tiny place when we turned around. The sandwiches are big. I had the smoked turkey and my husband had the pulled pork. Both were good. You knew it was going to be  good when you smelled the smoker when we drove up to the place. That's the first clue for real slow smoked bbq. And we never eat in chain restaurants. We'd rather help the little guys. While traveling, and at home, too.

Text: It's fine. The meats were average, the beans were good. Very good value though. Go ahead and eat here.
