Text: Best local place for breakfast that I've found so far. Server was very nice and attentive. Excellent fries as well. Just be aware they close early on Sundays (1 pm, I believe).

Text: Food was warm. I had one fry that was cold (like out of the refrigerator).  The updated inside look nice but that's all it has going for it. Definitely a place for the older crowd to get coffee and b.s..

Text: Great food and great staff. My family eats here every time we're in town... Usually more than once. Everything I've gotten from here is delicious... Breakfast, lunch and dinner. I highly recommend stopping by.

Text: Ordered special which was beef gravy over mashed potatoes (which was good) however when we ordered,  the waitresses named Sheri told us that it came with one side. When we got the bill we weren't charges for the special, she argued with us saying the special did NOT come with a side dish. So basically we paid for the regular price! She said "well do you want your dollar back?" And threw a dollar on the table. How rude! We won't be back. Talk about poor customer service!

Text: Fine quality, consistancy, friendly staff, good value. You won't leave there feeling hungry. In fact, if you plan on getting one of their awesome pies for dessert, you better order a smaller portioned meal, otherwise you might not have room for pie. A local gem for those who get tired of chain restaurants. Another reason to keep your money local, when possible.
