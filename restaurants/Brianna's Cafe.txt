Text: The food was great. Big servings. The waitress was nice and smiled at her customers. I would definitely recommend this place. We didnt have to wait long. Was way too full to try desserts.

Text: I work at a nursing home 45 mins away. We came down to check out the museum and they recommended Eva's. It was delicious and all the residents loved it as well. Only bad thing was we also had a waitress stand in the back and ignore us even when my Co worker was waving at her, not a small wave either. She pretended that she didn't see us and we had to wait for the other waitress to come around. But all around a great experience.
