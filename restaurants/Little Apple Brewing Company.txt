Text: Went there for a good experience have been there in the past with work associates.  Tonight I took my family and the experience was less to be desired.  If your looking for a good steak this is definitely not the place to get one.  I ordered a ribeye and it must have been 1/2 inch thick and tasteless.  If your looking for a high priced sandwich and/or meal with Luke worm beer you found your type of place.

Text: Six of us ate here tonight and all six of us had wonderful meals, we could not fault anything we had.  All were done to our specific and individual taste.  On top of it all we had a wonderfully attentive waitor by the name if Will.

Text: Excellent kitchen, beer, and wait staff. Came here 5 years ago on business, finally got a chance to take my wife to it. Food is so authentic, unique, a real chef in the kitchen!

Text: Hey this is a good place. However it is second in both beer and atmosphere to the tap house. In downtown manhattan. Beer is good, Waitress is cute, and the atmosphere is like that of a casual sports bar/place to chill. The bathrooms here are.... Ew

Text: Way over priced food. Steaks were not good quality. The only thing good was the root beer. I will never go back!!
