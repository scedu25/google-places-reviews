Joe Sippers Cafe
Rating: 5
Text: Stopped here after 12 hours on the road.  This is a little oasis convenient to route 70. Small but quality breakfast menu; the breakfast sandwiches were delicious.  Excellent coffee,  and good selection of non - coffee beverages as well.  The staff were all helpful and friendly. Ample seating, relaxing atmosphere. My only wish is that it was closer to my hometown!

Text: I LOVE Joe Sippers! I'm nearly addicted to their breakfast sandwiches and iced tea. The breakfast sandwich is packed with flavor and is reasonably priced. The atmosphere is cool, hip, modern, and best of all - clean. If I'm ever asked what my favorite part about Effingham is, my answer will definitely be Joe Sippers. I've never been in town around lunch time to try their sandwiches, salads, and wraps but if the breakfast is any indication, they'll be delicious too. Highly recommend this cozy, quaint, and unique cafe. Also, I love that the owners are Christians and it's locally owned.

Text: This place has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The coffee and muffin disappointed me for the price. The coffee was bland and the muffin was hard as a rock. Not worth coming back
