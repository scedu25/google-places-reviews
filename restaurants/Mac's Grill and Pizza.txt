Mac's Grill and Pizza
Rating: 1
Text: I have eaten at this "Mac's Grill & Pizza" for many years, and it has never been good. The costumer service has always varied from decent to terrible, the food has been overly greasy for years, and I wouldn't be surprised if the place had an infestation or two. The sad thing is it is the  only food place in the town. Other than the new "Stewart's Hardware" restaurant, but that is only open on certain days. I have forbidden myself from eating here ever again do to the fact that I always have some stomach problem after eating the food. So if you go to Valley Falls and want food, do yourself a favor and just buy rations and snacks from the Dollar General and the gas station: Petro And Pantry.
