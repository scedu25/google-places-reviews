Text: Cajun fast food. Order the half plate - which is two entree options served with rice. We had chili cheese étouffe with curry - white bean chili chicken with curry - chipotle Alexia with spinach mushroom.  
Nothing was very spicy - but lots of hot sauce options to liven up your plate. 
Pepsi products or beer to accompany your meal. First time I've seen bottoms up fill for beer.

Text: I've been to several Yats locations and this one a very different vibe to it. The food however speaks for it self.

Text: Look, ettoufes and rice with toppings aren't going to ever be photogenic or insta-foodie picturesque. But don't let that decieve you.  Yats is...amazing.  I'm from San Diego, and every time I visit Indy, Yats is on the to do list!  I've tried every offering they have, and they do not disappoint.  Whether you eat there, take out, or reheat the next day in the microwave to cure a hangover, it all works with Yats.  

My favorite is the Chicken Maque Choux. Don't ask me to pronounce it, just let me eat it. It's delicious.  My wife and I always get the half and half plate, so we get to try 4 dishes.  Mine always end up completely mixed together though, so I end up with a delicious Yats mixto, with a side of buttery garlic bread.  Top the meal with some garlic hot sauce from their sauce bar and you'll be throwing out beads in no time!  

Yats is delicious. Every random time I go it doesn't disappoint.

Text: Yats is always great food, this time was no exception. You must try the drunk chicken.
