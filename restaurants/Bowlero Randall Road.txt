Text: The renovations of this location are amazing! Went bowling with family and friends this past weekend and had a blast! The game room is one of the best in the area with all newer games. We saw someone win a PlayStation 4 along with a lot of other great items in their prize store that you can redeem with points you get. The main bar was awesome with all new flat panel TV's showing sports, etc. We ordered a few pizzas and a few beer towers as the kids played in the arcade. Don't forget to check out the awesome Mustang Convertible that's at the entry way! Join the Clubhouse for great offers.

Text: Bowlero is a fantastic place for kids and adults alike.  We went to the location when it was Brunswick Zone and WHAT a facelift it was given!  It's really modernized with the upgrades and the name matches the new look.
With billiards, 2 bars, more than enough lanes, a fire pit for all your friends to sit and chat around, the amazing arcade, great food and tasty drinks, you could spend all day right here and be satisfied in your experience.  We never seem to go when its super busy (Friday nights usually) so we always get to play the games we want.  Winning arcade prizes is pretty easy with a few tries and the prizes for tickets are actually pretty cool.  The staff is always warm and willing to provide any help.  The place is always super clean including the bathrooms.  
Other places like Bowlero with a similar setting seem to be less organized, less clean, and the employees seem way less happy to be there which equals those employees being less willing to help when they see an issue.

Text: Pro: Great layout, lots of lanes
Cons: Very poor service even with tons of staff. Socializing is more important.
