Text: Made a quick stop here while passing through. Decent menu with variety of food: breakfast menu and lunch menu - sandwiches, burgers, Mexican - all with sides. Service was good and food came out fast. Prices range from $5 - $10 for meals. Great little local place, tad bit out of the way, but worth it if you like to support local business.

Text: There are many reasons why this place is popular with the locals. While they have many good home cooked dishes, their hamburgers are probably the best in town.
