The Fountain On Locust
Rating: 5
Text: This is hands-down the best dessert place I have been to in the US. Ambience is really good. Although the menu provides bar foods as well, I would recommend this place for its desserts. It has a plethora of options and alcohol-based ice creams, which are the specialty of this place. It also has a bar and they provide table service too. Surprisingly, it is a family place and a casual place to spend an evening with friends as well! They have booths as well as tables too. Whenever I visit St Louis, I try to go to Fountain on Locust to enjoy their desserts.

It is very close to the Gateway Arch, just a single long road (about 4 miles). A must-visit!

Text: Would love more variety in food. A Charcuterie Plate would go great here. Ice cream drinks could use a little more blending. This place is fun, great for tourists. Will go back.

Text: Cool atmosphere. Relaxed. Great for adults and still good for kids. The Food was great and the drinks were great too.

Text: Not a place for dinner. It's a bar with a few sandwiches on the menu. Good ice cream though, and service was good. The few sandwiches they had were ok. Nothing special. And they had absinthe, but not proper absinthe preparations (sugar cubes, slotted spoon, etc). Nice decor.

Text: Cool midcentury atmosphere.  Good food.  Would have expected it to be more like homestyle/50s diner food instead of lighter fare/vegan options so that was unexpected but was still decent.
