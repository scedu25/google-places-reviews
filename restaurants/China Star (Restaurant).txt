Text: The flavor and overall texture of the food is good, but the temperature is not. All the food from the buffet except the egg drop soup was lukewarm despite being directly under heat lights. If they had kept the food hot, I would come again. Other than that, the plates/silverware/glasses were all clean, and even though a couple booths are worn out they are clean as well.

Text: Food is cold chicken was mushy and hard at the same time. This place was disgusting.. Customer service was from what appeared to be a 17 year old always on his phone and never paying attention to customers. Never again will i eat from here..

Text: RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE  !!!
Ordered 2 orders of orange chicken to go, when I got it home and we started to eat it we found the chicken to be very tough and we each only ate 3 or 4 bites. That alone I would not have posted this bad review....... but when I called to only inform them of how tough the chicken was (I'm in customer service and know sometimes errors happen and food gets cooked too much or not enough etc ), they were extremely RUDE and told me that is how orange chicken is and they cook it crispy ( i explained i know difference between crispy and tough ). They then proceeded to tell me that I didn't have to order it next time. They are correct because we will NEVER order from them again because of their customer service !! That  is why I posted this BAD review.
