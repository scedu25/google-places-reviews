Heavy's BBQ

Text: Great Service, Great food.  What else can you say.
The barbecue is excellent.   Ribs are served naked and three great bbq sauces are available from sweet to hot.  Steaks are cooked to order just the way you like them.  Must have the corn bread muffin, sweet and fluffy full of down home flavor.  Not a bad item on the menu!

Text: Great service, great food! Went for lunch and was very happy with the visit. We were seated right away and food came out quickly. Staff was attentive but didn't smother you, either. Will definitely be back.
