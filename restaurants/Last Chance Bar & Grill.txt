Text: This restaurant has been recommended on several occasions as a great place to eat, and I am extremely surprised at this. So surprised that it makes me question someone’s judgment when they speak highly of this place. The first time I went here was for lunch during a work day. The place was not busy, but the service was horrible. Slow to be greeted, slow to have our order taken, food was slow coming out. I think our waitress must have been outside smoking a lot. My meal was below average. I just spent 5 minutes looking through their menu to try and remember what I had, that’s how unmemorable the food is. The place smells of deep fried everything. Not the good deep fried smell either, but the smell that makes you think they haven’t cleaned the frier in months. However, the smell wouldn’t surprise you when you see how dirty the place is. It made me wonder what exactly the kitchen looked like. I’m sure if I had seen it, I would not have gone back a second time. Thankfully we didn’t eat there on my next visit. Went again with my family because my wife had also heard good things. We walked in the door, walked around to look for a place to sit, walked back to the outside seating area and not one employee welcomed us. No one even acknowledged we were there. We had to flag down a server to ask if there was a place to sit. She gave me a dirty look, said “sit outside”, and walked away. It was a cool, overcast 60 degrees outside. Needless to say, we left and will not be back. I the name is appropriate, that was there last chance.

Text: Updated rating: arrived and seated at 11:40, by 12:55 our food had not yet arrived.  We asked the wait staff 3 times when our food would be ready.  Finally decided to leave and just pay for the sodas.  The cashier was apologetic and said that the order was placed in the kitchen at 12:05, but the waitresses should have told us that it be an hour wait.  Less that half the tables were occupied, so I'm guessing there was a problem in the kitchen.   Eggs, toast, bacon, and pancakes shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.   Another family had not received their food for a long time too.  Normally the service and food is good...  but it sounded like they had not even started cooking because she made no incentives if we waited and said that we did not need to pay for the drinks.  I might give them a chance but it'll be a long time

Text: If you are looking for a safe Dive Bar with excellent food and friendly staff, look no further. There is a heated smoking area and an open patio besides the smoking area. The Bloody Mary's here are amazing and they run a special on them every Sunday morning.
