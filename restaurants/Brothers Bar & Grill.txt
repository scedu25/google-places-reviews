Text: Went on a Friday night. Wasn't overly crowded. Didn't have any issues getting a drink. Music was very loud. Guess I wasn't drunk enough to really enjoy being there.

Text: How drunk you are by the time you get here will determine how you rate this bar.  It's always busy on the weekends, it's always tough to get a drink from the bar, and it's always filled with a ton of guys.  The drinks are very reasonable but just getting a drink can be chore.  It's your standard Brother's Bar & Grill....not much more can be said.  Way better options on O Street but if you're doing the O Street bar crawl you'll probably end up here at some point drinking a cheap rum/coke and pounding dollar shots (if you can even get served).

Text: Unprofessional overall.
1. Advertised $10 cover charge for PPV event, ended up charging $15 per head at the door instead.
2. Impossible to get a drink; understaffed.
3. Doormen either have no idea what they're doing or are given poor instructions from above.

Text: I wouldn't even have put one star for this review . It won't allow me to write anything if I didn't put a one star . Since that's the lowest you can put . These people would steal money from you. They will change the receipt total and charge you more than what you owe them.  Not worth going here. They don't have sympathy or emphathy for what they've done. I hope this place runs out of business and replace it with something better.
