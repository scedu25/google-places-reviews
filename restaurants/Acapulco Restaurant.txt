Text: Any place that says they are open until a certain time should stay open. They close in the middle of the day and reopen a few hours layer. We showed up 15 minutes prior to their posted mid day closi g and the doors were locked and employees were hurrying for the door.  Customers were inside still eating.  It is obvious that the ownership and employees don't care about the customer, they only care about a job. This would have been our second trip to this restaurant as we live over 50 miles away. We will definitely Mark this one off of our list.

Text: Wait staff was inattentive, as well as hostess.  The food was ok, but the dining area was very dusty and grimy in some areas.  I doubt I will return for sub par service and 'ok' food.
