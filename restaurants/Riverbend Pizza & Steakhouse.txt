Text: I would give 0 stars if there was an option. we went for pizza and guess what? their pizza oven was OUT OF ORDER. we wanted pizza but we got stuck with the other crappy foods from the menu. the fries could have been cooked a bit longer too. I wouldn't reccomend this place to anyone who is looking for a decent meal.
