Text: BBQ is really good a is the sauce.  Buns are  stale every time when i get a pound to go with buns etc.  Also a little costly for no more than you get especially the sides. But overall.... awesome BBQ and sauce.. best around western ky.  They are really slow getting your order together as well.

Text: Came up to check out Amish country. Followed the great reviews and pulled in to a little shack with a screened in set of picnic tables. That's about where the fairytale ends. Only sold pulled pork sandwiches or by the pound. No brisket. No ribs. No cornbread. No greens. Got a half pound with the "hot" sauce and the cole slaw. The nice lady said if there was any problems to let her know. First problem, what excuse for a Pit BBQ place doesnt make their own sweet tea? Second problem, pork was really dry. Not like they compensated for adding sauce, but like it had sat in the crock pots they have on the counter in the back. Third problem, their "bbq" sauce was basically half vinegar, half chili powder. Super gritty. Fourth problem, the place is stupid expensive. Not sure where all the good reviews came from. Must have been good in the past.
