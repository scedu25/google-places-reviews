Text: Took US 36 across Kansas and there are virtually no fast food options.  That's a good thing.  I was looking for a place like the Frontier and the guy at the gas station down the road suggested we try it.  That was a good suggestion.  The food was fabulous and the service just plain awesome.  I have nothing but good things to say about the Frontier Restaurant in Oberlin KS.
