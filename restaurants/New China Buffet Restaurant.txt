Text: Would give five stars if they had actual sushi on bar. Nothing but rice, veggies and fake crab. But otherwise I am a frequent visitor.

Text: Best Chinese in Owensboro if you ask me. I could eat there every day. Some of the staff has a little trouble understanding English. But no matter, their excellence out weighs any negative. Their staff is the nicest of people.
