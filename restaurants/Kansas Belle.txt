Text: My wife and I wanted to do something different for our 29th wedding anniversary. This was a great idea. Didn't know what to expect and was surprised by the professional and friendly staff. The USO show was pretty good and the vocalists hit every note. The food was tasty, could have been a little hotter, still delicious. Lots of drink choices. Also had a handwritten note at our table congratulating us on ouu anniversary. Nice touch. Great trip!

Text: My fiance and I went on the Kansas Belle dinner train February 2017. It was amazing. The staff was professional and friendly. The food was amazing. And the train ride was so fun. They coordinated the music with the time period the cars were decorated to match. We walked through the whole train to look at the different trains and even got to stand on the back of the train. Such a great date idea. We will definitely be back again.

Text: Great time, well with the money.  Had a murder mystery play out between dinner courses.  Staff was friendly and professional, although, archive overall was a bit slow.

Text: Had a great time. Staff was excellent. Good experience except the group of lady's that thought that a very loud and rambunctious birthday party was something to do. Couldn't talk much over the laughing hyenas coming from that group. Probably won't be back if that's going to be the case.
