Asian Buffet

Text: We go a few times a month... Buffet is hit or miss. When they keep it stocked regularly it is very good, but at off-peak times, alot of the food is barely warm and not likely to be refilled. I once sat there for an hour waiting for more teriyaki chicken or beef with peppers to be restocked... neither was. We have to ask for refills, desserts are stale, and we have seen people grab stuff with their fingers instead of using tongs. Takeout is great if you request it all be freshly made. I've seen the workers just go and build the Takeout meal from the buffet table which  often is past its prime. 
All in all it is usually worth eating at if you go between 11am-1 pm or 5-6:30 pm on weekdays, or 11am-2 or 4-7 on weekends. Otherwise, expect lackluster food.

Text: Delicious food, but I suggest getting in earlier than 4 or so. As the day draws to a close, the fresh food slows down.

Text: As I have said before of Leitchfield there just aren't many non-fast food places to eat. As Chinese buffets go I would rate this one below average.  When I was there last week the General Tso's Chicken could have been classified as a soup. Seriously. That much liquid. They don't really seem to have a method as to decide which low serving dish to replenish. The food that is fried or has fried food in it, the fried is usually overcooked. The sushi is not bad. I stay away from the self-serve hand dipped ice cream as I have seen unsupervised children digging around in it. If there were more choices in Leitchfield I would probably avoid this place altogether rather than visit it every couple of months like I do.
