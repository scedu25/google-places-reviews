Text: This place is a meat eaters paradise.  I'm am very serious when I say bring your appetite.  Steak, fish, chicken...everything is delicious but its the steaks that are incredible.  We go every year on our anniversary.  The atmosphere is classy but not too much.

Text: This was mine and my husbands first time at this restaurant and definitely the last. As we were walking in we saw the patio was pretty much empty (maybe about 4-5 tables with customers and 15 empty tables) so we asked if we could sit outside. The hostess said it was going to be a 15 minute wait and because we saw how empty it was, we asked why. She said because there was only one server out there and she wanted to make sure she wasn't "overwhelmed". Because of the wait, we decided to just eat inside. When the hostess seated us, she sat us in a high traffic and claustrophobic table in the middle of the loud room when there were two small booths open. We waited about 10 mins for a server and nobody came so we moved to one of the booths for more comfort. While we were still waiting for a server another couple was seated in the other open booth and got drinks and placed their order before anybody even asked us what we would like to drink. Nobody acknowledged us at all so after another 10 minutes we decided to leave and never come back. The service is awful, I've never been treated so poorly at a restaurant.

Text: At our table, we had Seabass, bone-in ribeye and tenderloin. All the stakes and seabass were fantastic the service was outstanding. The mashed potatoes were subpar, but every other part of the meal and service was great

Text: Good upscale food at great prices. Good service. Meals come with soup, salad, bread, vegetables, and potato. Never had a bad meal from good selection. Walk away stuffed.
