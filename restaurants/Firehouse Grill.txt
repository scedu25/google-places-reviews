Text: Overall the experience was better than good. They were a little slow but made up for it a free appetizer. We didn't even ask for it. Hosts were really friendly so you get a good first impression. The food was very good. I would absolutely recommend it and will go back soon.

Text: I had reserved the private room for a 50th birthday dinner . When I arrived  a half hour before the dinner begun to decorate  i was told that someone called an canceled the reservation. Not true. I was very upset. Unfortunately  we were still unable to get a private  room but we were able to get 3 long tables together  in an area  off to the side. Turned out to be not so bad.  The manager did make up for the inconvenience  with several  delicious  appetizers for all 3 tables. The birthday  girl was surprised. The night was successful after  all was said and done.  The food was yummy. Everyone  was happy . I will visit again  for dinner next time I'm in town.

Text: Great place for dinner and a beer. Good people and friendly service. I like the fact that they have the audio on for the game and not music.

Text: We had a party of 6 and were seated at a small booth.  We asked for a bigger booth and were moved; however, they didn't seem to remember we ordered an appetizer.  The new server did not show up for some time.  We ordered but had to remind the server to give us napkins and silverware.  Although i.had the salmon BLT before, this time it was dry.
