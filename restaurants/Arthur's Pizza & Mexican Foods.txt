Arthur's Pizza & Mexican Foods
Rating: 5
Text: We came across this gem while searching for a place to grab a quick bite. So glad we found Arthur's. Ms Cheryl and her awesome employees made our visit a pleasant one. We learned a lot about the town's history. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat a good meal with people who makes you feel like they've known you for years. We will make it our business to visit again!

Text: Dear God no..

If you have to have pizza in this town, go to the Casey's gas station, at least it's edible.
20$ for a little bitty medium and a soda? Fake rabbit dropping looking sausage and fake cheese are not conducive to return business.
Arthur? I am dissapoint.
