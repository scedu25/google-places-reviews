Text: Nice little Mexican place on the edge of town. I recommend the Quesadilla Deluxe. Good Queso too. Similar to El Rancherito, which is on the other end of town.

Text: Love my Paurta Vallarta!
Our "go to place on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays..well just about any day we need chips and salsa.
We love the food and the familia feeling we get with the waiters and waitresses.
We are slowly learning the names of them all.
