Tienda Leon Grocery Store & Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Very fine casual dining Mexican restaurant.  Walking into the building, immediately one sees the idea they want to create a festive environment. Chips and salsa where exactly what I wanted... Better than the average chips and salsa I find in so many places. My wife said her chimichanga entree meal was very good and my lunch special #4 tasted superb. We had good service but did not feel smothered by someone hanging around our table too much. Overall, it was a very enjoyable midday meal and it was priced reasonably.

Text: The food is authentic and fantastically delicious!! The portions are generous and, to my thinking, under-priced. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault! The service is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive! The atmosphere is intimate.
