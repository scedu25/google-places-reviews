Giant City State Park Lodge & Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: They have great food and great service. We were told it could be over an hour before there would be room for our party to be seated, however they were ready to seat us in less than 15 minutes. The food was quick to come and we were never waiting on more food, drinks, or anything they serve. We never had to ask for something to be brought out, our waitress was quick and on top of things. Also, great food. The potatoes are magnificent and the fried chicken is incredible. I highly recommend going for a Sunday afternoon lunch.

Text: It's a state park lodge. A beautiful one at that. And they are known for the fried chicken dinner. My wife and I both were loving the sound of prime rib, BUT we stuck to the chicken for our first Giant City Lodge meal. We loved it, and they have some good draft beer so it's a five star meal. It was a busy Friday night and Deanna took great care of us.

Text: The lodge is beautifully rustic and comfortable.  One gets a deep appreciation of the historic value this location offers.  Staff members are kind, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Our "Historic" cabin was small yet adequate and comfortable.  The lodge restaurant served delicious food by a friendly server, at reasonable prices.  I recommend Giant City Lodge.  My wife and I will definitely visit again sometime soon.

Text: We came in for the endless chicken dinner and were not disappointed! The food was delicious, and the servers were quick and kind! It wasn't a super busy time, but there were others in the restaurant. There were 5 beers on tap and we enjoyed a Bison beer which was really yummy. Good deal for endless food ($12 per person) and even better if you come for lunch Monday - Thursday ($9 per person). They also have a kids price but I can't recall what it was as we had no children in our party.
