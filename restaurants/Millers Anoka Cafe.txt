Millers Anoka Cafe
Rating: 1
Text: The food is very good. Made by one cook, the owner, Dave Miller. Who now closes the restaurant on mondays and tuesdays and has hiked prices. Things have gotten strange in the past months and a close family friend was yelled at outside the restaurant this morning by the owner that she was unwelcome. Quite similar to the atmosphere when it was Cal's, only it appears the present owner prefers to have his outbursts with less of an audience. We will not be returning to Millers. -Christy P.
