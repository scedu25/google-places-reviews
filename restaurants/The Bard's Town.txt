The Bard's Town
Rating: 5
Text: I really like this bar. Tonight we're enjoying live music with our cocktails and dinner. If you are looking for a good time and delicious food, you can't go wrong at "The Bardstown". The Highlands area is worth going out of the way. Very friendly staff and great service.

Text: Went here for some theatrical performance. We sat down at a table downstairs while we waited for the performance to begin upstairs.  No one waited on us. We never got drinks, menus, nothing.  The place was tiny, filthy, and crowded.  So many choices to eat and drink on bardstown road, this will not be one I return to.  The performance sucked, too, by the way. Don't bother.

Text: I really liked the vibe! It is a place for everyone - all ages. We came for appetizers and drinks and we're entertained by Trivia Night - seemed like a lot of regulars were there.

Text: Went to the HBO Roast of Jon Snow. We ate beforehand, and our waitress was great. She was timely and even brought our food upstairs to the roast. The roast itself was the funniest thing I've ever witnessed in person, and I've been to see some great comics (Dave  Chappelle, Daniel Tosh.) Well worth the price of admission. We will be back for sure.
