Text: I've been to Melange 3 times, the first time in 2015, it was excellent(service, food and drinks). Second time in late 2016, drinks were good appetizer(duck nachos)was cold. Entree was ok, dessert was very good and service was good. Went tonight, service was good, drinks not so much,  dessert was awful(tres leche) entree(Lobster tail) had potential but it was SUPER SALTY!
One thing thats consistent here is good service.
