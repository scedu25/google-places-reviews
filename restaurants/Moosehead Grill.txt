Text: Enjoyed our experience & meals.  My son said his burger was amazing.  My wife and I had the pasta dishes....Pasta Rustica I believe it was called.  We had a toffee bar cheesecake for dessert.  Onion rings for appetizer.  Portion sizes were large, food tasted great, good prices, lovely atmosphere (Rustic).  We'll be back.

Text: Food is great, very big portions if you go away hungry it's your own fault.  The pulled pork is one of the best I've had (besides my own.). Well worth stopping

Text: I grew up in Amherst, and used to think very highly of Moosehead, however, my visit recently has definitely changed my opinion.  I went in for dinner around 7, and we were one of 4 or 5 tables.  The whole time, we felt very rushed, which was odd because their hours would indicate that they closed at 8:30pm. Later we were told that they wanted to close early because business was slow, that's why we were being rushed. In addition to the awful customer service we received, both of our order of ribs were burnt and the vegetables were rubbery as if they'd been reheated. Overall, even though we are repeat customers to Moosehead, this experience will definitely make us think twice about whether or not to return in the future.

Text: Recommended by a good friend. I almost gave it a 1 star but I will try another visit down the road. The food took 25 min. That's from the time we actually ordered. We probably sat for close to 10 min before the order was taken. 
The food was just ok. I didn't feel it was particularly full of flavor and fresh. I had a Cobb kinda salad. My brother had a burger. He said it was a bit dry and no flavor. 
The other thing was the prices. They were a bit high. 2 people. 2 drinks. Salad and a burger, 31.00 before tip.
