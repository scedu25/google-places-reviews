Text: If you haven't been here, drive to this family restaurant now. It's a small family restaurant on main St, and it is delicious. The rib meat just fell off the bone when you picked it up. The BBQ sause and jam is made in house if I am correct and they were very good. The service was very good and the waitress was very kind and made sure we had exactly what we needed. This family restaurant is a delicious and excellent place to eat. It is also a very cozy and quiet friendly place.

Text: Best Fried Chicken Ever! The server told us that they were known for their fried chicken. It was full of flavor, perfectly crispy and still juicy. This will be a regular stop on our way to Fort Collins from now on.
