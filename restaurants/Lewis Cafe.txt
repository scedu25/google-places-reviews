Text: Serving great food and service in a comfortable casual environment since 1938. My two favorite items here are their heavenly omelets and legendary hamburgers. Everybody has their own favorites but those are mine. I look forward every time I visit Lewis Cafe in downtown charming St Clair.

Text: Cute mom and pop shop. Food was okay. Good coffee and homemade desserts. A bit busy but probably because it is the only edible restaurant in the quaint town

Text: Lewis Cafe is one of our weekend  go-to's for a great breakfast when we are motorcycling.  The staff is friendly and hard-working.  The food is very fresh and satisfying.  My favorite is the Lewis Cafe breakfast sandwich.  I order it with a side of sausage gravy..  Their pork sausage is fantastic!

Text: The breakfast is top notch. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing in the morning. Ideal cafe. Only thing that could make it better would be an outdoor patio. 5/5!
