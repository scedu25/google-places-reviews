Text: The BEST Chinese food around!  Sauces, appetizers and soups are made fresh in house. --Not frozen from a food distributor. Entrées are made to order. Love this place ?

Text: One of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at recently.  Food is not pre-made but service is fast.  Can accommodate groups to an extent.  Staff is friendly but not all speak English well and can lead to confusion on orders at time.

We love eating here.
