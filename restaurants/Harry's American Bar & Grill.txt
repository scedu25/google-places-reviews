Text: This is my late night go to! Only wish they had a bigger late night menu, something with a salad but that does not stop me from going here. LOVE the bomb burgers. Matt gets the slider sampler. Fast and casual, great patio even in the winter. Great place to meet friends. Love that this corporate concept is located here in Lexington.

Text: Inconsistent , had a rude waitress the other night, after spending over 125$ , she missed counted our drinks, and made us look the bad guy, drinks here suck, better off going to Tonys for drinks and apps, drinks there are stronger, you actually get what you pay for.
