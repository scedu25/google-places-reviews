Text: The meatloaf is very plain, green beans tasted liked canned and the Mac and cheese tasted like it came out of the box. Not the homemade style I was expecting. The restaurant was way too busy and crowded. Overall not the best experience. The chicken meal my husband got looked really good for fried chicken and his portion was generous, unlike my meal.

Text: Excellent meal! Fresh warm bread to start, homemade peanut butter and apple butter on the table. Hubby had Amish sampler, I had Monterey chicken, both amazing! Reasonable prices, more food than I could finish. Excellent!!

Text: I had the meat loaf, mashed potatoes and green beans.  Excellent.  Request more of the sweet sauce they put on the meat loaf.  I did and it was great.  We went early to avoid crowds.

Text: Had a great meal here today for lunch. Had the sampler was very pleased with the meal. Have to say will probably get chicken and noodles or meatloaf next time as the meatloaf was very good.
