Text: We rented The Upstairs for an anniversary party and it was perfect!  Everyone loved the venue and it was very affordable for a "no service" party.  Brought our own food and bought alcohol at the bar downstairs.  We were very pleased!

Text: The Grill always has great food and great service and is always clean. I recommend the steak burger and Prime Rib. They are my favorites.
