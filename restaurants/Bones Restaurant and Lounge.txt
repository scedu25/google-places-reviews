Rating: 4
Text: Bones is a fun place to drink at, but you never really know what the crowd will be like... the deck is huge and relaxing.

Text: The food was standard (mediocre) bar food. I liked the onion rings. I have only been in on Saturdays, so I can't speak to the rest of the week. I like the karaoke, but it can be a pretty redundant selection, especially if they are slow and the host sings every other song. I like the deck and air to escape the cramped interior. The bartender was pretty nice. When they have a dj, it is more fun. Twenty drunks singing Sweet Caroline at last call is a funny sight.
