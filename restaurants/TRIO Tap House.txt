Text: Great food and service.  My husband had the Chicago dog and waffle fries and I had the chicken on foccacia bread on which they let me switch the provolone for blue cheese crumbles with a side salad.  The chicken was pan seared to perfection. The salad was fresh with lots of veggies.   The dog was excellent as well  as the waffle fries crispy on the outside and meaty in the middle.  Our waitress was attentive but not intrusive. Perfect lunch!
