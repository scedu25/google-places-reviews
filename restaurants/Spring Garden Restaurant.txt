Text: The wait staff are always quick to seat you and get your drinks. The orders are up fast. I just wish the mashed potatoes and the veggies of the day were hot. They are NEVER hot!! I love the broccoli-cheese soup on Fri. I wish it could come twice a week. The food is very good and that is why we like to eat there as often as we do.

Text: There's very rarely waiting on seating even when it's crowded. The service is prompt and considerate. If there's a problem with your order, bring it to their attention right away. They'll do their best to correct it. They're attentive. Our table is almost always cleared of unnecessary items as soon as possible. Our glasses are kept refilled. The meals are generous in portion. We usually bring a box or two home. Although we don't utilize it as often as we should, there's a card of daily specials. There are a variety of items to choose from on the daily special menu. The prices are reasonable for the budget conscious.
