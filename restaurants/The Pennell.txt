Text: This is our favorite lunch restaurant in Butler. The menu is small but that actually adds to what we love about this place. Food flavor always exceeds our expectations and the breads and salads are fresh and unique. Portions are so large that we usually split it if we are ordering a sandwich or salad. Reuben is stellar. Cool aesthetics. Look forward to an evening visit. The bar looks terrific and I have heard from several others that the steaks are just terrific.

Text: Didn't have much selection, and some of the things listed on the menu were not available. Pretty expensive for what you get.
