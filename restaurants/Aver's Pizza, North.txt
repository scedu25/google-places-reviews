Text: Amazing pizza, cool people, and excellent service. Specifically, they were able to accommodate an order of over a hundred pizzas with only a 24 hour notice. Not that I suggest doing that yourself, please be kind to your friendly local pizza place and give them a long heads up on large orders like that!

Text: They have the best customer service plus, they're bacon and pepperoni is the best around. Honestly, I think they deserve more

Text: Amazing food, service not so much. Just got off the phone to change my address for an order and the kid on the phone had to get a managers help. Manager went nuts and I could hear over the phone her complaining of my "incompetence"
