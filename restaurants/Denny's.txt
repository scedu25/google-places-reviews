Denny's

Text: The service was slow The Establishment was not busy. Cooks don't know what an over easy egg is ,crispy hash browns they weren't soft they were chewy. The sausage biscuit and gravy had 3 pieces of sausage in it the biscuit was raw and my ham steak was well over cooked! Denny's is known for their breakfast and their day shift cooks are usually their best these guys didn't have a clue I will never eat at that Denny's in Carbondale anymore and that was my first experience

Text: Had to remind the wait staff we were seated for over 15 min and hadn't had a drink order taken yet. Then the food took forever to come out my omlete had been way over cooked with lace on the edges! We will not be back since they changed managers this place terrible. Terrible service and food.

Text: Out of sugar so I couldn't have sweet tea with my meal. In 30 minutes we witnessed the manager go outside to smoke 3 times. They burnt my toast so they remade my toast but they didn't bring it to me until I was already finished with my meal. Good food, bad service!
