Text: This place has some of the best food in the area. Specials are always a good option and the regular menu does not disappoint. There is a nice bar to enjoy a cocktail and they will pair a drink with your meal. I get excited for the fall because they make the best apple crisp ever. Good prices, great service. If you are looking for a nice, quiet, but great place to eat, go here. The regulars might let you snag a table ;)

Text: This is the 2nd time at the wonderful place...tonight the wife and I each had the T-Grill burger w/cheese and a salad, amazing burger! The salad dressing was "French" and made in house great! Dessert was the Coconut Cream Pie, first bite was the best I ever had, reminded me of my grandmother's. The server was a real sweet young lady w/long black hair, kept our drinks full - this place is the "GREATEST"
