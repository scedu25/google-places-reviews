Stop 50 Wood Fired Pizzeria

Text: Perhaps the perfect restaurant. The food and staff are superb and the owners are genuinely friendly and welcoming, taking time to visit if possible during your visit. A few things to note if someone is reading this review thinking about trying this amazing establishment. The parking lot is small, use Google Maps to view the area. The prices are high but it is a dining experience worth it. The ingredients are of the highest quality and the price is justified. Don't be in a hurry, remember it is a experience. Try to show up before rush hour, even the greatest customer service can suffer when they are busy. This is a true Artisan crafted pizza so remember that going in it is not your typical pizza joint. We tried the apple, prosciutto, white cheddar as a example, unbelievably amazing. Never dreamed we would like it.  What the owners have created is a dining experience that rivals any fine dining establishment around. If you are adventurous and have time to soak in the ambiance of this perfect place. Stop 50 is a hidden gem. Lastly, if you have kids get the meatballs they will love them. Hope this helps anyone thinking of trying place.

Text: This place is amazing. The staff are very friendly but not overbearing. The firestick appetizer was incredible. The only bad thing was it didn't replenish itself. The pizza is some of the best I've ever had.

Text: It is way off the beaten path.  We discovered this place looking for pizza on Google.  Now it is a favorite. Nice atmosphere and view of the wood oven.  Also there is a good patio area.  The service is always great and friendly. It is not chain pizza.  It is a light thin crust with a variety of toppings.  They always have seasonal offerings for a fresh adventurer.  We always enjoy one off the menu.  It has prosciutto, pistachios, mozzarella with rosemary. No tomato sauce just Extra Virgin olive oil.   They do offer a plain pepperoni as well.  The Firecracker is a must have spicy creamy dip paired with the crispy fire roasted bread sticks.  Prices are reasonable.

Text: We have a beach house near here and in Michiana and it is less than 5 minutes away. Pizza and salad are excellent. Pizza crust is delicious and has only three ingredients; yeast, flour, water. Any other decently good decently good restaurant requires going to New Buffalo, which can be a 15 minute drive.

Text: I've been a fan of this place for a while. They have the best pizza in the Michiana area. It's a phenomenal crust. This last trip was a bit disappointing however. I had their vegetarian pizza which had been good in the past but was less flavorful—the sauce seemed a bit less plentiful and the veggies didn't have much flavor. Also, I question the seasonal vegetables here sometimes; they often aren't too flavorful for a pizza. Yellow beans certainly aren't a great choice —not much flavor and really need a quick blanching to make them not seem raw. 

I'm be back but I'll be more selective in the future.
