Text: Breakfast is "impossible" to make after 10:45am. I got there at 10:40am and strained some french toast out of them. It was below average, and my side of bacon was more like strips of saline gristle. My wife said her sandwich was inedible. Indeed, her stomach was empty, but she left her plate full. I wouldn't recommend this dump unless you like it salty or bland and you want to help this state inch out it's obesity rating. Sadly, I've still had worse. 2/5 stars.

Text: Graciously accommodated our crowd of 13 campers. Pastries were top notch. Blueberry muffin delightful and cinnamon roll one of the best I've ever had. Very friendly locals striking up conversations made experience even better.
