Text: Quiet place to have a quick meal, food is good but a little pricy. Side items of different potato's almost $6 and half orders only available on two of them. I got 3 chicken tenders which were good but very small for $5.99. 10 wings just under $10 was ok and they were good.   The fresh cut curly fries are good just make sure to get them well done.

Text: Order the wings with the bones - they were very good. Plenty of sauce.

Text: Service was good. But I was looking forward to my fries, and they were undercooked.
