Text: I just went for some ice cream. Service was a little slow, considering there was nobody else in the restaurant but i was in no hurry. I just ordered a vanilla cone dipped in chocolate. Price was alright (2ish dollars). Got the cone and it was covered in this weird light brown coating that really didnt look like chocolate at all. Bit into it and I'm pretty sure it was literally just coated in wax that had a very very small amount of chocolate mixed in. The ice cream was pretty good but I was disgusted with the wax coating. It ruined the cone and I had to pick it off with my fingers. How could they possibly think they could pass that off as chocolate? If I wanted to eat a candle, I wouldn't have gone to an ice cream shop. I'm sure there's better stuff on the menu, but I was honestly really turned off by this experience.

Text: They were very slow and a bit over priced for the portions and after I ordered and paid it took them 20 minutes to tell me that they were out of what I ordered

Text: I really like this place! I like the broasted chicken, and  the tenderloin sandwich  both good choices. Prices are fair  the reason I didn't give it five stars is because  the night cooks aren't always as good  as the day cooks and they run out of things at night a lot.
