Grunauer
Rating: 5
Text: Upscale German food in modern setting, Grunauer is one of my favorite places to eat. The wine and beer list is extensive and the staff is well-trained and helpful when needing advice on what to pair with your meal. All of the side dishes are authentic. I especially love their house made sauerkraut. When weather permits the outdoor patio is magnificent, looking over union station and the train tracks. Wonderful bar, wonderful restaurant.

Text: This please hits ALL THE MARKS! Service, ambience, and incredible food. It’s the best restaurant experience my wife and I have had in at least a year. We strongly recommend: If you haven’t tried it yet, make sure you stop here in KC!

Text: The veal sausage is light and tender, for a sausage - absolutely delicious. Their sauerkraut is a nice mix of sour with an undercurrent of sweet (very mild, almost imperceptible), and with an occasional bit of bite (pumpernickel seeds?). Very fast service, nice ambiance. Reasonable prices. I'll be back!

Text: A true Kansas City find! Truly amazing authentic German and Hungarian food. The service is impeccable, with highly knowledge and attentive servers. Kids are happily accommodated, and child-friendly meal suggestions are gladly made. Easy to walk to from Union Station, and near public transit. Not inexpensive, a family of 4 can expect to pay $100. Worth every penny!

Text: I love this place. I have been here many times for many reasons from small private parties in the upstairs dining room, casual dinner in the restaurant, lunch at the Wünderbar, after work drinks in the Biergarten, whole restaurant buyouts, or  just drinks at the bar. The food is always great,  the Hungarian goulash is a favorite of mine. They have a great selection of German and Austrian beers on tap, as well as a good selection of similar wines, and a nicely curated spirits selection.
