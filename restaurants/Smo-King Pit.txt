Text: Just finished a terrible meal. I had a pound of rib tips, fries and a house salad. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The salad was crisp and fresh. The fries were so hot and fresh I had to wait to eat them. The rib tips were hot and smothered in bbq sauce. It was the most terribly delicious food I have had in a long time. I'm sorry I just couldn't find anything to complain about.

Text: We've been here before and I usually get the chicken but last night I got ribs. I will get those from now on. The best ribs I've ever had! Super tender and delicious. I got the sauce on the side and the sauce is outstanding. My understanding is they make it themselves. I asked for my fries to be crisp and they were perfect. What a gem this place is and the people there are super nice.
