Drake's Paddock Shops

Text: Big place, cool atmosphere, good food but a little overpriced. The place was packed but the food still came out pretty quick. The menu had a decent sized offering of bar foods mixed with sushi and sashimi. The spicy tuna roll and rainbow roll were good. No fishiness in the taste or smell so I was very pleased.

Text: I am so sorry I came there for lunch. My birthday was Saturday 21. I was very sick with the flu. I this move here from Atlanta Ga. I love you guys black bean burgers. I waited out at the bar out side for about 10 mins. So I went in side. I wish I wish had went some where else for my bday lunch. Have a nice day.

Text: We took a nice and easy walk over to Drake's from where we were staying at the Drury Inn. Based on other reviews from Google, we picked it because of their fun menu options (sushi, burgers, and kid's menu chicken tenders were delicious) and because they don't allow firearms (thank you!). Great food, excellent selection of tap beers and local bourbon, and other drinks. Very kid friendly, nice patio area, and above-average service. Would definitely come again when we pass through town next time!
