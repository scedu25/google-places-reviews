Text: The food is always freshly made, delicious and the staff is courteous and fun. The lasagna is amazing but the rhubarb pie (only available a short time during the summer!) is out of this world!

Text: Located inside of the Topeka Shawnee County Library, this is a good place to grab a quick lunch or snack if you are working hard and the time gets away from you. I think the food here is a bit overpriced for what it is, but I'm chalking that up to the convenience factor of not actually having to leave the library to get some food. The food is pretty much what I would consider cafeteria food, and is just ok, but not really good or great. In my experience, the pastry options here have been better than the meal offerings.
