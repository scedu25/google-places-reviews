Text: My friend and I just dropped in here because it was our first time in Pontiac. Amazing experiance. The food was beyond excellent. I had the shrimp Alfredo and my friend had the chicken Alfredo. The shrimp and chicken melted in your mouth and the sauce was so rich and flavorful. Our waiter was so friendly and attentive, you didnt have to ask twice for anything. The prices are so worth is for the quality and quantity. Also, I was so excited to here some nice country music playing, it made the ambiance ever more fulfilling. We will be returning.

Text: Food was good. Ordered from the breakfast menu at 4pm. Seems like a big hangout for the local elderly crowd. Lost my appetite when the waitress dropped the check on the table when she brought the food. Not cool!
