Text: Yummy BBQ,  Semi-funky environment, very down home and cool, with great beers. Even the salads are quite tasty. Counter order to be brought to your table. Their BBQ sauce is so good you can but it on everything!!

Went in with excitement, having heard many good things. I was told by the staff that if I wanted a seat for my child (2 yrs), I could walk next door and ask to borrow one from a different restaurant. This is not customer service; they might as well have asked me  to clean the tables and floors before I sit. Due to the rude reception, I was not inclined to give patronage and thus am unable to judge the food. Again, the rating given is for customer service only. I recommend you try the place and judge for yourself. Just don't be surprised if you come in the company of a toddler and aren't well received.

Text: The Burbon Slushy was fantastic. They also have a Rum Slushy that tasted pretty good too. The place had a decent crowd so I am guessing the food is amazing but I will try that on the next visit.

Text: Delicious and a great atmosphere. Even the smoked tofu is awesome, as are the bourbon slushes!
