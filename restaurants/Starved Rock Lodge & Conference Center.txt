Starved Rock Lodge & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: Really beautiful anytime of year. Another wonderful trip, all staff were amazing. Food, drinks, and set up were exceptional and kept in tidy condition. Only complaint is wishing there was a sound reduction/ proof barrier instead of the cloth to deter the noise from other guests during function.

Text: The location was perfect for a conference. It has a beautiful view and atmosphere, which is a nice change from the typical stuffy hotel/conference center. The food was amazing.....breakfast, lunch, snacks. Restrooms were located conveniently nearby.

Text: Nice getaway that's not too far from Chicago suburbs. Hiking trails are right next to the lodge for easy access into the park. The rooms inside the lodge are nice and have that woodsy/ cabin feel to them. Actual cabins are also available. Overall had a nice experience!

Text: Took an easy 1.5 hour drive to visit the park for the first time. Hiking was great and paths lead right from the lodge. Veranda cafe food choice is small but the pizza was delicious and we got to sit out and watch the sunset. Breakfast in the lodge dining room was lovely and relaxed. You have to try the fudge and ice cream from the gift shop. It is locally made and very delicious. The lodge and rooms were all clean. I will certainly come back.
