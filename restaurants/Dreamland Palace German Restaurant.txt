Text: This is a laid back experience.  If you're in a hurry, you won't enjoy it. The food and atmosphere is great.  Don't make any other plans, just come for a good evening of food and beer in a seemingly German experience.

Text: Normally my experience here is really positive. But when I went on my birthday my disappointment was worth noting.
The potato pancakes were absolutely horrible. Way overcooked and zero flavor. Of our party of 5, only one dish was worth the price.
And the waiter was probably the worst I've ever had anywhere. I've been a server before. We all have bad days. But this guy needed to just go home.

Text: Was there last February for dinner. Food was good but the service is too slow. Tried it again today. Waited 30 minutes for a table. Seated finally, then after 10 more m8nutes of not even a drink order we left. 2 bad experiences in a row is enough. Will never go back,

Text: Old deutch culture lives in this amazing restaurant. The dishes are all traditionally German and the servers are professional top of the line. Best service ever. No higher praise!
