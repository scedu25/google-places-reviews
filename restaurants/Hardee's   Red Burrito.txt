Text: Stopped in for a "quick" to-go order while driving to KC.   It took over 20 minutes for them to fill the order, and then once we were back on the road my wife noticed her Chicken sandwich had not been cooked thoroughly and it was still raw in the middle.  What a disgusting excuse for a restaurant.  Don't waste your time or money stopping at this location!

Text: Horrible... Ordered a burger and a hot ham and cheese. They put Mayo on the hh&c not the burger..... Half filled fries. 16 min wait. And there was NO ONE Infront of us. But waited 6min before anyone took our order. Lady working was very rude. Never again, from out of town. They didn't answer when I called either.
