Text: A little run down on the outside but very nice on the inside. The food was good but it took 40 minutes to get two pork sandwiches. There were only 5 other tables seated at the time, can't imagine how long it would take if they were busy.

Text: Great restaurant, steeped in history and nostalgia. Everyone I know, keeps going back for the memories, poor boys & garlic butterine. Go big or go home and leave your diet at the door, is my philosophy when dining here! Hopefully it will be around for generations to come!

Text: My husband and I  selected the poorboy. Which was very good.  But we had to purchase the fries separately and the cheese , which we both got for the sandwich,  and onions are not included in the price of sandwich.  I asked for soda and he got a beer.  Our dinner was close to $40.00 not including tip.  1.50 each for cheese, 1.50 for grilled onions and 3.00 and something each for fries.  Too much money for a sandwich, fries and a beer.  We won't be back for awhile.

Text: The poor boys & fries here never disappoint! The fried chicken is also excellent. There's nothing fancy here but if you want great food in a clean family friendly environment as well as fast & friendly service, this is your place.
