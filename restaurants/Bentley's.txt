Text: We have been coming to the lake for many years we have never eaten at Bentleys before. We will certainly be back! Traditional steakhouse with wonderful service and food. The wine selection was good and not too pricey. We especially enjoyed the Murphy goode Cabernet with our steaks. My husband had  Pepper steak with a baked potato that was put together specifically for him by our waitress. She did it perfectly. I had the filet and fried shrimp with roasted potatoes and enjoyed every bite. The warm rolls were tasty and I highly suggest the Mayfair salad dressing for your salad. After dinner we went outside on the patio where a wood burning fire welcomed . Beautiful views and beautiful settings outside. A great evening in celebration of our anniversary.
