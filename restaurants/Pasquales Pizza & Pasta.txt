Text: Pasquales is great. It's been open as long as I can remember and the food is always delicious.  The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's a Morehead classic that you have to visit at least once if you come to visit.

Text: Good food but has the slowest service in all of Morehead.  Expect to wait even when they are not bisu.
