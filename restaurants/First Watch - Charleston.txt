First Watch - Charleston
Rating: 5
Text: Great food and wonderful staff/owner. We went there 2 mornings in a row during our weekend stay in Charleston, and this morning, our daughter decided to be the stereotypically terrible toddler. After disrupting the whole restaurant, my husband and I took turns eating and walking her around outside. Went to pay the bill, and the owner came out and gave us a free meal card, because, as she put it, "we all have these days as parents." Several other staffers smiled warmly and agreed, "we've been there." Extremely grateful and determined to pay it forward today. :)
