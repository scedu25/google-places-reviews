Text: We love eating here.   Sam is by far a top notch waitress.   She never forgets what we drink or what we order to eat.   She's very friendly.  And treats her customers with respect.   The cooks are awesome.   Everything is cooked just right.  I will recommend Quick Dine to anyone who asks,  "Where's the best place in town to eat? "

Text: Great Chinese food! thats right Chinese in a burger joint, but they have two Chinese ladies that can really put out some great food for a reasonable price. The menu is very large and usually have a special of the day, occasionally they bake some desserts, a must for the hungry traveler, a lot of city folks stop here regularly.

Text: Went for Breakfast and was way overpriced. When food came out was undersized for price. Waitress tried to fix the issue and had them make us another order of pancakes to make it worth the $5.50 short stack of pancakes that was only 2 pancackes that wouldn't  even fill the inside ring od the plate.  Biscuits  were the square frozen kind from grade school.  I wouldn't recommend anyone go here for breakfast.
