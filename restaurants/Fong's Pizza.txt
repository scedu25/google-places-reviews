Text: We ordered the Thanksgiving dinner pizza. So good! Waitress was super friendly and funny. Fun atmosphere. Only a about a 5 minute wait for 2 of us! Will definitely be back next time we're in Des Moines.

Text: An incredibly unique treasure for Des Moines.  The food is great, service fast and friendly, and drinks tasty and strong enough.  Their seasonal pizza right now is awesome!!  Turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberry.   So good!!

Text: Great place to grab a slice of interesting/non-conventional pizza in the heart of Des Moines! Really quirky and eccentric atmosphere that I really enjoy. The restaurant feels kind of squeezed into a corner- reminds me of San Francisco. I highly recommend the crab rangoon pizza! We also love the honey garlic pizza

Text: Absolutely amazing pizza.  I get sick of the routine pizza chains and this place is awesome.  I have been back 3-4 times now and love the different types of pies they have along with a great atmosphere.  Great place.

Text: One of my favorite pizza places here in  DSM, the staff is always very friendly. I can't remember the exact time but late at night they offer slices! Also have a great drink menu...
