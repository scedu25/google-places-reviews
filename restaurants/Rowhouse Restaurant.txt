Text: The food was great. The atmosphere was fun thanks to our servers. I though it was going to be in a newly constructed row house, but the row house is historical and full of charm.

Text: A definite must for the Topeka area! The Rowhouse made our first anniversary  a truly special occasion. My husband and I have completely different taste and yet we found that we both enjoyed the majority of the courses.  The staff went above and beyond to make our time here special.  I highly recommend that you look over the preset menu before going and reservations are a must!  I was skeptical of portion sizes and even had a back up for my hubby to pick up some food on the way home just in case.  Happy to say that we were so pleasantly full we could not eat another bite.

Text: I have eaten at the Rowhouse Restaurant several times.  Always excellent.  Recently I have been diagnosed with severe food allergies.  The talented Chefs @ Rowhouse modified several menu selections to accommodate myself and a guest. This is a must try destination restaurant.
