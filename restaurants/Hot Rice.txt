Text: I've been here a hand full of times i feel the food is slightly over rated. The portions are decent. Doesn't accept credit/debit cards which isn't convenient.

Text: Looks to me like the only negative reviews are people that are whining about  not being able to use their plastic. Smh. Cash allows them to make money without stupid credit card and check fees and people that pass off bad checks and stolen cards.  As for cold food, people are delusional. Food is always hot. Maybe not Hot Hot but for ready to eat it is perfect. Been going there ever since it opened and I have not once had an issue.
