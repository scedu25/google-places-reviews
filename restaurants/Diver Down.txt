Text: This is a nice place to go. Golconda has a pretty decent amount of restaurants. They vary from Subways to diners. This is a bar/restaurant combo. The place is a little too dark for my liking. The staff is friendly. One thing to keep in mind is that they get busy on Friday because of their all you can eat fish special, so get there as early as possible. It does take a while to receive the food but you can order appetizers or salads are almost instant as a side. There is a pool table in the bar area. It is clean for a bar which is good. It is on the more expensive side but it is well worth it because you do get a lot for the money. So I recommend this place for any Golconda visitor.
