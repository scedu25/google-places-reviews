Text: Food was excellent! The kitchen staff did a fantastic job. Our waitress couldn't be bothered to do her job. We had to get her attention to get menu's, she did come get our order without us getting her attention. Our hot food came out correct. Our dessert did not.

Text: Good food. Friendly service. Limited menu mainly burgers and pizza not any other sandwiches.  Interesting decor. Will be back when in the mood for burger or Pizza.

Text: Great good, a very helpful and kind waitress. Prices looked to be on par for small town diners. They have a large assortment of floats and deserts. I ordered 2 extra beirocks to take home before tasting as I am sure they will be good. Has a old time diner feel from times past. And the beirocks were perfect! Makes me wish I loved nearer as 2.3hrs would be a bit of a drive just for a diner.

Text: The food was hot, but slow to arrive. It's bland, and nothing special. The soda was extremely sweet, almost overpowering. The service is absolutely terrible if you are from out of town. That was made evident by the lack of service our table received to the others that were chatting with the staff. No refills were offered, and I had to ask for my check. I Will not be a repeat customer.
