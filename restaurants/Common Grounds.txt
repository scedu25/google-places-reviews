Text: Small town restaurant with a pretty generic decor. We arrived at the end of breakfast time but we're still offered breakfast menus to order from. The omelet was watery and under cooked in its interior and the decaffeinated coffee seemed pretty weak. The hot cocoa was good. The loaded hash browns was a gloppy pile of food that just didn't appear to have had much care in its preparation. Waitresses were too busy setting up a table for a larger group they were expecting to check on use regarding the meal or if we needed anything. When we wished to depart I had to go up to the counter and have another waitress get our check so we could pay and depart. Not exactly easy to find and not exactly good food with not exactly helpful staff. If someone asked me if they should eat there I would probably say "not exactly"

Text: Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Good coffee, too. A MUST eat at place, to put on your list. Breakfast is the meal I have most often here, and everything on the breakfast menu is great. I should know....I've had it all.

Text: Swear to god has the best steak. Not even comparable to G&D steakhouse or coltons or any other steakhouses that I have eaten at. I had the t-bone and also tried some of the strip that my cousin ordered. It was juicy and tender and you didn't even need sauce. One problem that I had was even though there is a huge party table, it still was not big enough for our 15-20 person group. Also salads are great because they are huge! Deffinitely reccomend that if you are in salem you should stop by for a bite to eat.

Text: Great people place. 2nd time visiting from out of town. Family owned vibe with a home style cafe menu.
