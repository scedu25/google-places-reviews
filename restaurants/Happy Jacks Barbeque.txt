Brisket burger...back bacon grilled onion and cheese.  Ribs are very good and you can order them by the bone. I will time my trip through Holyoke to ensure I don't arrive during their break in the day (I think they close 2-4).  If this was closer to home I would go more often.

Text: Damn good ribs. Definitely tasty! Worth the stop if you're traveling through. "Jacked up" is the way to go. Two days in a row and far from disappointed!
