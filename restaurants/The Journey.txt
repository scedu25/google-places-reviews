The Journey
Rating: 4
Text: GO for lunch, under $10, mostly the same food as in the evenings, which costs you $20.  They have absolutely amazing coconut shrimp.  Salad is bad, don't eat it.  Sushi is pretty good, some of the other fish and chicken is decent, just not exceptional.  But decent.  But load up on that coconut shrimp.  Place is clean, they're polite, food's decent, and coconut shrimp is so awesome.  Oh, heads up, they don't have coconut shrimp on weekends.  Don't know why, but in the evenings they do have crab legs, so go for it.

Text: The food is terrible. It isn't just "not great". It's disgusting. I got one plate and didn't finish it. The fish was lukewarm and tasted terrible. The sushi was the same quality as gas station sushi. This is the kind of seafood that makes people think that they hate seafood. Do not go here if you've never really had seafood because it will make you hate it. Do not go here if you have had good seafood because this isn't anywhere near that quality.

Text: Lowering my rating from 4 to 2. When my Wife and I first ate here the food was fresh and hot. A great place. Lately not so much. Service is still decent but crab legs have gotten smaller(maybe seasonal?), food quality is average and frankly the restaurant hasn't been as clean. We gave it a couple more tries and decided we don't care for it anymore. Bummer...used to be one of our spots.

Text: This has to be one of my most favorite sushi buffets in the Indy area. It is always fresh and a huge selection. And for the price of $9 lunch through the week, you can't go wrong! Plus all the other standard Chinese food staples, a chocolate fountain, crepe station, Mongolian grill, and more. This buffet is worth what you pay for and more.

Text: All you can eat seafood and crab legs. Sushi, prime rib, and lamb as well. Make sure to go for dinner as lunch is still on the pricey side and the selection is limited.
