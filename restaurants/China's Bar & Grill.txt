Text: Well what a hidden little gem right in middle America! Found this place by accident, the food was so amazing! We were also amazed by how quick the food come which exceeded all our expectations. This Chinese restaurant seems to have done their homework where cuisine is concerned as we revisited for an Italian night which matched up to the quality of any spaghetti bolognaise  we have ever tried in Italy! Well done you guys, keep up the great service and yummy food!
