Text: Cool atmosphere, but prices r a little high. I bought Budweiser & a shot of Hennessey, wit a $10 bill & got a quarter back! The beer i know is $2.75 that means the shot cost me $7 bucks! That's crazy. It wasnt even a nice shot either. True story.

Text: Surprisingly good here.. I'm not usually one for bland pub fare but this was pretty good and at a reasonable price point. Could use a slightly better tap selection but they had a decent local selection here. Nothing fancy but not bad.
