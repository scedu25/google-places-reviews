Text: Love their Happy Hour drink prices and of course the variety to choose from. Sonic blasts are great too. Food is good when they get the order right and it's freshly made; that is about 50% of the time.

Text: Stopped going there for six months last year because orders always took too long, we're wrong more than half the time, or parts of orders were missing all together. Went today and voila! Wrong sandwich, had to remake it, then wrong side item, no public restroom to take child to, no napkins in one if the sacks, music too loud over speakers and had to shout to be heard to place the order. More aggravation than I want to pay for.. Guess best solution is not to go at all. Can't recommend.
