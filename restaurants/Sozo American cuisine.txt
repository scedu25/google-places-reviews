Text: Waitress made suggestion. . . Blackened Chicken on sourdough! Excellent choice! Great food, atmosphere (a bit up scale), EXCELLANT VALUE. We were passing thru on way home and found on our phones. We enjoyed it!

Text: Waaaaaay over priced for the quality of food that came out of that kitchen. Came in and spent over $160 and we can't get free bread with our meal?! The evening cook there needs to be replaced. We went on a Thursday night and it was just terrible food and service! Don't waste your money, this isn't fine dining.

Text: Wonderful menu, quality food, 2nd visit for us and we'll be back even though it's a 4 hour drive! Don't skip anything, the bread, crab bisque, we've tried 4 entrees now and they were all prepared with so much care. Finish with dessert! Bread pudding is our favorite so far.
