Buckingham Smokehouse BBQ
Rating: 5
Text: I've eaten here about 20 times and it's consistently a pleasant experience. The waiters are friendly and the BBQ is as good as it gets, east of KC. The bar is never crowded. It's a perfect place to watch the game and enjoy some quality grub.

Text: The pulled pork was delicious. The brisket is thinly sliced and good, but not truly tender and melting in your mouth. The BBQ sauces are very good, as are the Texas toothpicks (fried onion and jalapeño spears lightly battered and fried). The deep fried corn on the cob was amazing, and the sweet and regular fries were very fresh and delicious. We were a large party of 5 adults and 6 kids. Our server was friendly, helpful, attentive, and quick. I definitely recommend Buckingham Smokehouse!

Text: Told me to would be quick, I live a min away. Food was ready. But cold? Sandwich bun fell apart. And rude phone conversation when I ordered.. normally it's warm when you sit down and eat. Crappy experience
