Text: I sat in a booth for 15 min. And did not get any service then a couple sat in the booth behind me and within 5 min. Someone was taking their order. The menu was laying in the middle of my booth....I got up to leave and "the manager said have a nice day" I turned and said"I had not even been waited on and continued out the door. This was one of my favorite places to eat. Not anymore

Text: Great side Caesar salad. Fantastic mushroom penne pasta dish - very tasty!! We were with a large group and service was excellent. It was a very warm evening and the AC could have been a little better, but I realize it's an old building. Good parking available also. This place is an asset to Marion for sure!!

Text: Neat old brick warehouse turned into a tasty Italian restaurant. Great food, service and ambience. One of our favorite date night destinations. Love the warm bread, oil and herbs to start and the wine-sauteed mushrooms are amazing.
