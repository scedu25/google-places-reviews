Text: This was the best Chinese buffet I've had in three States. I definitely recommend if you're in Marysville. Now, it's Chinese BUFFET. Don't go expecting top quality made to order Chinese food and soup. But it was super delicious for buffet food at a decent price. I go every time I'm in town. I've always left full and happy

Text: Amazing Buffet Chinese restaurant. Everything was fresh, and so delicious. They had sushi and crab legs! Everyone was supper friendly and it was very cheap!

Text: Barely edible. All of the sauces were too sweet, the chicken was breaded heavily, the sushi rolls included only 3 varieties & they ran out (and didn't supply more while we were there). The crab legs were cold & I didn't see anyone eat the roast beef - take those off the buffet and improve your Chinese basics for the $10 charge.

Text: Poor quality of food. If you're a gambler feel free to gamble your health here. Not again for me.
