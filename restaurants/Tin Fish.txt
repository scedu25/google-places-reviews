Text: This place has great seafood. We have tried several things on the menu and they were all delicious. I wish that the dining experience was as good as the food is. Medal tables and paper plates, styrofoam cups and plastic forks and spoons. Oh well you can’t have everything , because the food kicks ass.

Text: It was great food, had to wait a bit, but it was an off day and they weren't expecting so many people, a person had called off. So it took a little longer to get our food. But we're were not disappointed. They didn't skimp, or cut any corners. The food was absolutely delicious.

Text: I had often heard how good this place was and had to see for myself. We went on a Saturday night and we're quickly seated. The meal was good and I'll leave it at that.
