Text: Took the whole family and there was plenty to choose from on the menu. If you are a margarita lover this is the place to go. Rocks with salt is the way I go. You feel mighty nice from the first one and the flavor is perfect. Most sacrifice flavor for making it strong but here you don't even know it. They have a salsa bar to go with the nachos. You just can't go wrong with Salsa's. so get off the couch!!!  Eat drink and enjoy today!!!
