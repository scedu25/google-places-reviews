Brick Oven Pizza
Rating: 1
Text: My family went to brick oven pizza a few years ago and it was amazing. So we figured while we are down here might as well go there. We got it delivered to are hotel room. The nachos we so hard that you couldn't not eat. We got the chicken bacon ranch pizza and the pizza was awful. It tasted like a frozen pizza. We also ordered the cinnamon sticks and we noticed that they had a garlic taste to them. So we go to the pizza place and told them about are bad food and what they said about the cinnamon sticks will surprise you. They told us they are made with garlic butter and cinnamon. Since garlic butter is their only butter. Less than impressed. Never going back.

Text: The staff that greeted us was so friendly and made us feel at home. There was a certain pizza we asked for and they got it out on the pizza bar in no time! They also have friend chicken rolls and some vegetable sides, and a salad bar. It's really inexpensive and great food and service! Was a great hit for our kids!

Text: The pizza was so so. The guy who served us and made our pizza was a little off. He kept talking about werewolves and turning into one through supernatural power. At first we thought he was joking or trying to scare us, but once we figured out he wasn't kidding and he actually thought his girlfriend was changing into some creature we were very unnerved. The soda cups were small.

Text: Pizza was not that good. I've had better frozen pizza. I did not try the chicken. My wife had 1 mojo and they accused her of eating off of my plate to save the cost of 1 meal. She eats gluten free and I'm sure most of there food is not. Would have enjoyed eating around the fire much better.
