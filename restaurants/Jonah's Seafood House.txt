Text: This is my second night in a row coming here. The service has been excellent both times and the food was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend eating here, specially if your from out of town like me.

Text: Doing my expense account and found out the bartender added $2 additional to the $3 tip I gave him on an $18 lunch after I ate at the bar.  My company will not reimburse for anything over 15%, so I know I did not make the mistake on my end.  

Not a big fan of thieves!

Text: I was here for a free investors meeting in the downstairs room.  The was a nice riverview.  The food was not very good and seemed to have been prepared well in advance.  I have been here for regular dining and have been well satisfied despite the pricey menu.  I am allergic to shellfish,  so it is not high on my list for eating out.  They have a nice new gift shop and a friendly staff.

Text: The deep sea scallops were so good, I almost forgot I was in the Midwest. I ordered mine grilled and would definitely recommend that option. I substituted my salad for the spicy gumbo which was on point. I chose the sweet cheese au gratins as my second side, and it was a sweet & tasty.

Dining at sunset with the view across the water was cool. They open the window shades as the sun drops behind the trees so you can fully enjoy the sunset! Ask for a seat with a view!

Text: Checked out the new food store. High prices but good quality.
Ate at the Oyster Bar. Food and service was very good, as is usual. Had a Manhattan and was delighted with the mix and the price.
