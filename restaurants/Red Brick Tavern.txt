Text: Came in at 7:30 asking the waitress if she could accommodate a crew of 9, we we're travelling from out of state and hungry. We were promptly told that they "could" accommodate us but there would be a one hour wait. the Dining room was empty, except one or two couple eating. We got the hint, they wanted to close (9pm) and didn't want to feed nine. Thanks for losing business. FYI, the place smelled of must, the wallpaper must have been from the 1930's and I wouldn't have trusted the food.

Text: WENT THEIR BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY. UNDER STAFFED ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. THE ROLLS WERE GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE CINNAMON ROLLS. LONG WAIT FOR FOOD, I THINK BECAUSE THE KITCHEN MESS UP. SERVICE WAS GOOD THOUGH. IF YOU LIKE SPOOKY THRILLS YOU WILL LIKE THE TAVERN BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT IN 1837. BUT OVERALL JUST AVERAGE BUT UNIQUE.

Text: It's a quiet intimate place to eat it has a musty smell as soon as you walk in but that's part of its charm
