Text: Mini-golf course is awful. If you are trying to decide between mini-golf here and at Malibu Jack's, go to Malibu Jack's (I cleverly went to both places to compare).

Otherwise this place seemed fine and the staff was nice and helpful.

Text: What a fun place to visit. I took my nephew 11 years old and we played 3 games - boy was that enough for me. Next time I will wear dark clothing so as not to too visible in the black light and I'll bring a towel with me as you really work up a sweat running around the fort. BTW don't even trust your family when there is a everyone for himself game.  Fun, fun, FUN!

Text: Not bad. The laser tag was fun and great for large crowds. The arcade was nice and they weren't too expensive and they had a good deal of 96 tokens for $20. Which is nice when you have multiple people playing. The staff was great, Helpful, and funny. The snack bar was just that basic snacks. Didn't taste the food though. The kids enjoyed the bumper cars but the track would be great if it was bigger. People from my group did the putt putt but I did not. I didn't hear any complaints though. Overall and fun experience.

Text: My students had a great time! Good viewing area for non-attendance. Sadly, ticket machines did not work well and a few arcade games too. Staff was helpful...thank you!

Text: Haven't been in a little while (been working) but I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone I know. Good place to kill off some time while having fun in the process
