Los Bravos Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Very good food with generous portions. Can be very busy and a wait during busy times. Prices are reasonable and service is good. Sometimes difficult to communicate with staff but easy to get around with using numbers and pointing. Recommend.

Text: The building is nice.  The food is bland and flavorless.  There are about 8 other mexican restaurants within a short drive, and most of those have better food.  However, none have a better building!
