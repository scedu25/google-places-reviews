Text: Very good food, cool wilderness atmosphere. Burger was excellent served with quality ingredients, chicken sandwich was also very good. 14 beers on draft. Give them a try you will not be dissapointed.

Text: The food is very good and the atmosphere is truly unique. The décor involves a lot of taxidermy, so those uncomfortable with that should be aware.

Text: A destination all in itself. A very unique menu and that is just beginning. Parking is tricky as is seating ( go left for quieter ) but the experience is well worth the hoops of parking....parking tip go around building.

Text: We love Westwoods! We have eaten there a few times and it is always excellent! It's hard for me to order anything outside of their famous 'snowshoes' because they are so delicious! The gaming area is nice and comfy as well with lots to choose from. I would highly recommend!

Text: The food is very good: pub food with a wild game twist in a hunting cabin styled setting. The homemade chips are among the best I've eaten. Taxidermy animals are mounted everywhere, and animal tracks are stenciled on the parking lot and walkways.
