Text: I am giving this place one star based on price.  Food is good but how do you spend 35 dollars on lunch not including tip.  This lunch consisted of two sandwiches, two cups of coffee, and one piece of pie.  You don't even get a pickle with your sandwich.  A side of chips is like 2.75.

Text: The service was great! BUTT the prices are over the top!! The tenderloin was great but the bread / NO and the gravy ruins the tenderloin , which this part we did not eat! The blueberry crumble ?? Really not appealing at all ! So $60 for two tenderloins, with gravy, fried pickles, French fries (limp) , a beer , water, blueberry crumble (small) plus tip,!  NOT worth $60

Text: Holy Tenderloin!  This place rocks!  The decor is very small town, well preserved feeling with great (and I mean the best I've ever eaten) tenderloin sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable, service is great and the atmosphere is rocking.  HIGHLY recommend.

Text: The monument burger & tenderloin were surprisingly good, but not for the price tag. The onion rings were extremely salty and kind of overwhelming. 
The service was friendly, however the wait was longer than we should have had, given that it didn’t appear to be busy.
Overall, the experience was less than okay. Three stars only because our waitress was nice.

Text: Really nice home - town cafe with an upscale menu.  The pork tenderloins are HUGE!  (and delicious).  Comfortable booths or nice spacious tables so that seating is not cramped.  Everything here is homeade including the mashed potatoes. The pie looks wonderful but I was much too full to try it.  Next time I am trying the jerk seasoned burger with pineapple and red peppers.  Yum!
