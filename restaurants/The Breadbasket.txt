Text: Consistently excellent food both Sunday noon and Friday and Saturday evenings. No music so there is some chatter without the white noise. Not nearly loud enough to be offense.

Text: I always end up getting the soup and salad buffet. Their chicken noodle soup is excellent. Strawberry rhubarb pie is great too. It's pretty basic inside, cafeteria style, but the food is always good.

Text: Family restaurant with a salad bar and buffet. Menu is robust with plenty of options for everyone. Bierocks are my favorite thing on the menu.
