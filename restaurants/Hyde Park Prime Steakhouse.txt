Text: Great food - as expected.  But it wsas very surprising to have a restaurant staff go far out of their way for me, my husband, and our two little girls. We had a table in the  middle of the restaurant and the girls (2 and 9 months), were behaving but we were worried they would be a distraction to the other diners. So we asked for our entrees to-go.
Our waiter would have none of it and arranged a beautiful private room for us to enjoy our dinner without the feeling of imposing on other guests.
The manager checked on us and we ended up with a great dinner, which is none too common with two little kids. 
A lot of high-end steakhouses have delicious food, but not all of them would go out of their way like that for a nobody.

Text: The BEST food EVER.  I've never had 
Such a tender steak. And Paul is the best server!  Super attentive, and makes sure every thing is perfect. Not only did he make sure the food was fantastic, he made sure our group had a great time with conversations! Would give him, and Hyde Park 10 stars if I could!!!  Will defiantly be making the 2.5 hour drive back down to eat here more often!!!

Text: Could not ask for better service. The steak we had was some if the best I've ever eaten. We splurged for the Hollandaise add on which was perfect. Did not have room for dessert but they looked great.

Text: Most of the food was average, the dry aged ribeye was so tough I gave up on it.  In the end they took the steak off my bill and it was still over  $200 which would have been fine if the food was good.  I couldn't get out of there quick enough.  I should say that my son enjoyed hamb chops.
