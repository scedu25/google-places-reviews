Charleston's

Text: The service was attentive and knowledgeable. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado sandwich with brussel sprouts for the side.  It did take a bit longer than expected to receive my food but it did not seem excessive.  The atmosphere was dark, but pleasant.  The interior was a beautiful mix of wood and brick.  The exposed rafters above one area were raw wood colored which was an odd contrast to the ceiling in other areas, but not a big deal.  My sandwich was delicious, the chicken was thick, but not so much as to make it difficult to eat or overwhelm the sandwich.  The chicken had a light sweet flavor that blended well with the tomato and avocado.   The brussel sprouts came in a bowl with a buttery garlic broth.  They were well cooked and good sized.  I came away from the meal and the greater experience fully satisfied.

Text: Food was good, service was friendly; had two stouts. Note to others: do not try to eat fish & chips and drink two stouts right afterwards. Too much food.

At least, that is my opinion.

Oh yeah. I went here for my mother's birthday. She enjoyed Charleston's, as well.

Text: Charleston's is YUM! I strongly recommend the Oven Roasted Chicken, I subbed the baked beans for a side of broccolini and was not disappointed. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were incredible... We were seated right away, but hear that is unusual as they're always packed. The service was friendly and the atmosphere great!

Text: Charleston's is an excellent restaurant! Their food is very good and the staff is great. The only drawback is the noise level gets a little high when the restaurant is full, and it usually is.  Should this minor issue keep you away? Absolutely not! You'll get a great meal and have a wonderful time. That's why the restaurant is almost always full!
