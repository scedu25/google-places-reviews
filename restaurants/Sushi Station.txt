Text: Creative place to eat... Good variety.

Better quality than I expected.

Easy to overspend though!   Never did see the illusive $1.25 white plate!

For something  different... Try the coffee jelly... Can't explain it... Just try it.

Text: Place was great, flavor was on point and there was some interesting rolls. The Texas and Southern rolls with BBQ shredded chicken were better than I would of thought. I will be back.

Text: Not one of the best Sushi places in Chicagoland but courteous staff, and reasonably priced food. Not top of the line Sushi though.
