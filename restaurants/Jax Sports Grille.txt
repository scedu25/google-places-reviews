Text: I've had a great experience every time I've come here. The food is pretty good, and the staff are really compassionate. This is my go-to place in Garden City.

Text: We went to Jax for lunch today. I don't normally post reviews or anything but this has happened several times now. Our waitress took our drink order but skipped someone at our table several times, the other waitress finally got the drink and she took our order. By the time we got our food it was time to leave. The whole experience was over an hour. This is not the first time this has happened. I can say that this will more than likely be the last time we visit Jax unfortunately.
