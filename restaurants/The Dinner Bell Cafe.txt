Text: Great, filling comfort food with staff more friendly than family. You'd have to travel several miles to even get a morsel otherwise. You'd have to go 50 miles to get anything like competition.

Text: Poor options on food.  Very basic very small town cafe.  I guess the community is just lucky to have a place to eat out.  But the restrooms were clean.
