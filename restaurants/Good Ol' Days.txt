Text: Great small town feel. Food was very good. You get a lot of food for the cost of your meal. I would recommend the fried chicken. Waitresses where nice and very helpful. Very good experience. Me and my family will definitely visit again.

Text: Had the Family style Chicken dinner. Was about 3 stars on taste. The reason for the 5 stars is because of the homemade pies that they sell. We bought a Coconut creme pie to take home and after trying a piece that evening we were very happy with the taste of it. We will definitely go back for more pies in the future. Good job to this mom and pop resteraunt.

Text: This is a fun place to stop.  The food was delicious.  My husband had chicken & dumplings.  He said it tasted just like his mother's.  The faucets in the restroom light up!!!  Never seen that before.  Service was a little slow, but we were ok with that.

Text: Food not good.  Only chicken would reorder.  Nachos cold cheese no flavor found cheap short cuts.  Side dishes could be improved
Serve good

Text: Horrible to go service tonight. Ordered chicken strip dinner with fries and homemade chips, toasted ravioli, cheese sticks, and French fries. She took my order and repeated it back to me. Got home and didn’t have cheese sticks or extra order of fries (charged for them) and the toasted ravioli sauce was thrown all over the to go box. Called and she said she didn’t hear me say cheese sticks or extra fries even though she repeated back to me. We live 20 minutes away so I didn’t go back to get the corrected order. Very disappointing because we usually really like this place.
