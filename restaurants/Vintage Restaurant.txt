Text: Disappointed to say the least.  I remember why we hadn't been back here in several years.  It was Saturday night at 5:00.  We were seated right away since there were only about 10 other people in the place.  Took our drink orders & brought drinks right away, but then no one checked on us for over 25 minutes.  Finally we got more drinks & they took our order from a menu that has very few choices.  It took 30 minutes to get salads & 55 minutes later we got our food, soups, & appetizers all together.  We repeatedly asked for crackers, croutons, bread, etc. and never received anything.  The place was never busy.  Just very lousy service.  Appetizers & soups were cold.  Steak was OK, but nothing great.  Chicken was good but overpriced.   All in all, there are much better places to eat in Hermann.

Text: Very cool atmosphere, and on the grounds of one of my favorite wineries. On my latest visit I ordered the schnitzel with a Jaeger sauce, German potato salad and red cabbage. The schnitzel was too thick and had some gristle. It was also a little greasy. The cabbage and potato salad were both pretty bland. I was looking for that little vinegar bite, and it just wasn't there. Jaeger sauce was very good. You really need to get these three menu items right!
