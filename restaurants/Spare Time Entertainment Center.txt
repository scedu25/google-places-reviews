Text: Great fun. Love the bowling. Great craft beer selection. Laser tag is fun but twice as expensive as it should be. Half the price and we'd play multiple rounds. Keep it as is, probably won't play again.

Text: Bowling is great,  the arcade is one of the best in the area. But DO NOT eat here. The service is always absolutely terrible. We are never helped in a timely manor and routinely have to approach the bar to either order, ask for refills, or request our check.

Text: Fun place, the owner is very active in updating equipment and activities.  Good food, cold beer smiles and strike friendly lanes!
Frandor is a great location.

Text: Bowling was fun, arcade was average. Food was disappointing, laser tag had the dumbest rules ever, and the employees were incredibly rude. They didn’t want to redeem my tickets, and when I tried to complain about laser tag, the employee sat and argued with me.

Do yourselves a favor, go to Zap Zone.

Text: Had a very nice time. Good pizza too! I found it to be adequately accessible. They have a small ramp at the end I'd the lanes but it's a tight squeeze.
