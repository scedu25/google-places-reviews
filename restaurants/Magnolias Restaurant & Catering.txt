Magnolias Restaurant & Catering
Rating: 5
Text: Literally the nicest place you will find within an hour drive of Macomb- hands down. You can go casual, or you can dress up for a nice event here. The food is wonderful and Lisa always works to provide original and creative foods and desserts for dining in or for catered events. In fact, she catered my wedding in downtown Chicago- a selection of some of the best cupcakes I have ever eaten and I am so sad to say, I only got one...AND I WAS THE BRIDE! They were the most popular item at our reception.

Text: Magnolias is a wonderful restaurant!! Where else do you find such a friendly out-going owner!? There is a reason this business has lasted over 14 years and has received awards in such a small town. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone trying to impress that special someone or something as simple as a few drinks at their bar!!

Text: I love Magnolia's specials. There is always something new, interesting and fabulous to try.  The food and the atmosphere are great.  I have been to tons of events catered by Magnolia's and at The Forum.  They have always been top notch.
