Text: This is now one of my favorite places to eat. I go there whenever I am in the area. It has the best grilled salmon of any place I have even in the U.S. And I have eaten salmon all over. The manager after about 15 minutes came out and apologized for my meal taking so long to prepare. I thought it odd because I didn't think I had been waiting that long. My wife and I were having a good conversation. When the dinner came It was great. The manager came back and said because the meal was late there would be no charge. I objected but saw that he was going to make sure I didn't pay for the best salmon I had had. When the waitress brought the ticket not only had my meal been compted but my wife's too. I made one more attempt to pay for the meal without success so I ordered two pizzas to go. GREAT FOOD GREAT SERVICE GREAT PEOPLE.

Text: Food was just ok.  Pizza is surprisingly underseasoned and overpriced bit not terrible.  The service however was atrocious.  Timing of apps and entrè was off and dirty dishes were stacking up on the table.  The guy disappeared for a good 20 minutes after we were clearly done then came back and said he had gotten busy.... there were only 4 other tables sat  and at least 5 servers hanging out shooting the breeze.  Id say don't spend the money on this place.

Text: Service was great. Chopped salad delicious and huge. Pizza(mushroom, pepperoni, sausage) good but crust a bit tasteless.
