Text: Such a cute wonderful place. I love "It's a Wonderful Life" so the theme of the place is winner in my book. I ordered a George Bailey, and I can say it was the greatest dessert I have ever had. Maybe it was the kind staff, maybe it was the wonderful atmosphere, or maybe it was just being with good friends, but one thing for sure was that everything was just right. SO GOOD.

Text: Friendly, quick service!  Our cheeseburgers and hand cut fries were some of the best we've ever had! Our banana split was a delicious, generous trifecta of ice cream flavors generously covered with all the traditional toppings and finished with nuts, whipped cream and a cherry...so good!  We'll be back!

Text: Great atmosphere and food! Hope to see one of their dinner shows sometime. Only downside I would say is they are a little more on the expensive side for their burgers and other food. But it is very tasty.
