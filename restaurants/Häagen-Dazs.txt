Text: Total Ripoff and customer service is awful. If I could rate this store negative, I would do that. I ordered a dazzler for my 3 year old for $9 and the person making it put 2 scoops of ice cream instead of 3 and filled the cup with strawberry, blueberry, and whipped cream and then chuckling with his buddies in the back about what a great job he did cheating customer of there money by not even giving a portion that a customer was paying for. My son was running away in the mall so i simply paid the cashier to go grab my son and later realizing that i was completely ripped off when i started feeding my 3-year old the Sunday. The store has too many attendants but the quality of customer services is awful and looks like the the attendants are trained to serve a lower portion. It was a complete turnoff.
