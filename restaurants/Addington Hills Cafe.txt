Addington Hills Cafe

Text: Excellent cafe to visit if you are looking for a place to eat just outside of downtown Battle Creek. Addington Hills Cafe has a very elegant look to it. I had the salmon quiche and Mediterranean Flatbread and they were both amazing!! The entire staff exceeded expectations during my visit. A side note, which is always important to me was the cleanliness of the bathroom!!

Text: The food is incredible,  the ambience is relaxing although a bit cramped, the service is excellent,  the decor is unobtrusive. Go for the food, enjoy the wine list, relax in the comfortable surroundings.
