Text: I had the most wonderful Texas burger on Texas toast! The toast never got soggy from the BBQ sauce or hamburger grease which was a huge plus and the burger was cooked perfectly. The sweet potato tots were deliciously amazing. I can't believe I've never had these before!! The workers were nice and accommodating to me with my 9 month old son. So friendly!

Text: Rich in flavor burgers and amazing crisp, seasoned fries. Clean facility and fun staff. One negative is they ask for a tip before you receive service...

Text: Solid lunch choice in downtown Indy. The burgers are average but topping choices are excellent. The burnt cheese is both tasty and novel. Waffle fries are outstanding. Very quick service for a reasonable price.

Text: Great spot for a quick lunch!  Burgers, fries and shakes (plus new chicken sandwiches).  Got in at 11:45am and beat the rush.  Service was fast and friendly.  I was able to find a seat quickly and wait for my number to arrive.  By the end of my meal (12:10) the place was PACKED but food still flowed out and tables turned over quickly.

Loved the fact that my shake came out when ready, NOT waiting on the burger too.  Got the Burnt Cheese: a nice crispy burger, homemade pickles, onion, tomato, lettuce, special sauce; then 3 pieces of cheddar cheese BURNT.  The sweet potato tater tots were off the hook.  Try the Nutella Shake, much better than just a Chocolate Shake.

Give the Burger of the week a look, lots of great option over the course of the year PLUS you can always build your own with tons of options on the chalkboard!
