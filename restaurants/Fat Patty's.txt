Text: INCREDIBLE! We visited here when my nephew graduated from Marshall and I would have never thought such a inconspicuous little place could be so good!  I almost walked by the entrance! We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was expected since the place was getting the after graduation crowd. We had a party of about 10. They got us seated and the server from the start was amazing! Everything was so yummy! The loaded fries were my favorite! The burger was perfect! Before we left town the next day, I joked about going there to take something back with me. I knew it would not survive the 4 hour trip so I'm counting down until I can visit again! Even my 10 year old mentions it randomly with that food drunk look in her eyes. lol

Text: Heard alot about this place and thought we would give it a try.  Food was terrible and while reviewing our bill there was items on it that we never ordered.  When questioning our waiter he said the table across from us orders accidently got added on.  Plus nothing like eating across from someone wearing no shoes.
