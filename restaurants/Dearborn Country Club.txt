Text: Loved the clubhouse, the food, the beer and the staff I encountered. However the course itself is extremely hilly and wavy. Which of itself is not all bad but the cart paths are treacherous and in need of repair.

Text: What a fabulous place to go.  Had Sunday brunch there.  Wide selections to choose from.  Although there were many people there, you could still hear yourself talk.  Prices were good, plus they give you a senior citizen discount off your tab.  Definitely will go back.

Text: Good food, good price, comfortable surroundings...Woody's has some excellent specials...Sunday nights it's all-you-can-eat fried chicken served family style with green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, slaw and biscuits...not sure if it's the best fried chicken I ever had, but it's wayyy better than the usual places (I won't give their name, but their initials are K F C)...on a prior visit I had a steak dinner special that was terrific and my mom usually gets pork chops or meatloaf and says they're both delicious
