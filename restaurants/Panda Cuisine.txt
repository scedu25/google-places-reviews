Text: Being a vegetarian, I ordered a noodle dish with vegetable, they brought me a noodle dish with pork. I asked them to take it back and bring me the correct one. Sure enough, they came back with a vegetable one, but when I started eating, I noticed little pieces of meat in it. When confronted, they admitted that they had taken the meat out of the one they served me first and added vegetables to it!! I could not believe it! That's it for me. Even though I was a good customer, i would never go back there.

Text: 1st they have American Chinese buffet food which is not real Chinese food. Sushi is from Japan y'all two different countries who very much have two different cultures. The so called Chinese food which is really American Chinese food on the Buffet is best I've had in Lexington. They also have very real Chinese dishes that you can order to eat real Chinese food for yourself or with your Chinese friends. They have always been very nice to myself, wife and our friends. I have been to China myself and ate real Chinese food. Also my wife is from China, so when she says it's good Chinese food then it's good Chinese food. :)

Text: Wow, Just Wow!  I spent two months in China in 2000, and have traveled the world extensively. If I stay anyplace for longer than a couple of days, I will eventually get around to trying their local Chinese restaurants. Yes, its my favorite food!  

To get to the point, I have been to many Chinatown's throughout the world: London, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Mexico City.  My point in providing the history is to emphasize that I have eaten alot of Chinese food from practically everywhere!  I am simply blown away how great Panda Cuisines food is! 

Better food than alot the places I mentioned. Wow, I can't believe that I can eat these authentic Chinese dishes here in Central Kentucky!
   
Honestly, I had never even heard of Panda Cuisine until a few days ago, and I am so glad to have found this place, I plan to be a regular customer from now on.   Go here and enjoy their amazing food.
