Text: We visited on a slower time on Sunday.  My husband asked for extra well done wings. Once they were delivered and looked barely cooked, when we mentioned it the waitress just said sorry and walked away. She finally came back and offered to have them recooked.  Was disappointed that she didn't do that in first place. Our drinks went empty several times though those who were drinking alcohol didn't seem to want anything. I guess if you have a higher bill you get a better service. Had to ask for cookies twice though other tables just had theirs delivered.  She said she only gives them out to people who ask because too many are wasted. Service was not up to par this time.

Text: Best Wings Around. Try the sweet hot damn breaded wings. Hot enough to keep you at Bay but sweet enough to make you keep eating.

Text: Family friendly dive bar atmosphere, if there is such a thing. Fried veggie appetizer was good; watch out for boiling juice in the pickle spears! Fish and chips and pulled pork were both very tasty. Good selection of craft beers, not a huge number but good range of choices.
