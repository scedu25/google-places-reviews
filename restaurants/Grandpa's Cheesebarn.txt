Grandpa's Cheesebarn

Text: If you haven't been to Grandpa's Cheese Barn, you are truly missing something special. Located right off Interstate 71, you cannot miss this place. Aside from assorted cheeses, which would seem logical as implied by the name, there is a wide selection of other foods that can be had. But the real hidden secret is the homemade ice cream. There are sandwiches to be tried, sure, but the homemade ice cream is absolutely wonderful. The prices overall are a bit high, as you would expect for such specialized food, but well worth it. When I get there, I usually purchase some of the jellies, jams, and peanut butter. Watch out for some of the Wasabi foods. Talk about spice!

Text: Wish it was larger and arranged differently . So many people looking and paying at same time makes it conjisted. HOWEVER the place has the best selection of cheeses and condiments. The ability to taste the cheeses is a great selling point and gives you a chance to try cheese you normally would never think of buying.  Had a 17 yr old and a 7 yr old with us and everyone walked away with their favorite.

Text: Delicious cheese varieties (so many cheeses!) and all sorts of dips, sauces, and baked goods for entertaining. Also a charming gift shop and a candy shop across the parking lot. My only critique is that the curds, while very tasty, are not compressed to the point of "squeaking" on your teeth as you bite into them. Regardless, this is definitely worth the stop off the interstate, or is even a great little destination itself!

Text: Went for lunch here at 1 p.m. the place was not crowd at all and had SLOW, SLOW service! It took 45 mins for our order, which was two Steak Sirloin Wraps with fries. The table had a vent above it which was blowing cold air down making it chilly and when we asked to move tables our waitress seemed pretty lost in where we should go until I asked if we could move to the table she was leaning on. Kelli, our waitress, was hard to find when we needed something. I asked for a box, which took about 10 mins to get, once she returned with it I then had to ask for another one because she had spilled beer in it. When I asked for another box she asked why and when I told her why she kinda huffed at me. The food we had was alright, very under seasoned. Glad I live in Cleveland and never have to visit this establishment again.
