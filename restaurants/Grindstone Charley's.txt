Text: We were seated immediately by the hostess and she took our drink order. She brought back the drinks immediately. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come to us.
I ordered a medium well steak witch showed on their menu to be slightly pink when it came it was definitely well done. She came to the table maybe one time. We went up to the counter twice to get her. She did offer another steak but by the time she came to the table mine was about three-quarters of the way gone. She never brought us our bread that came with two of our dinner so I had to go up and ask for it and she said that it'll be there soon which we were done eating pretty much when it came to the table.The manager came to the table to ask and I explained the situation and he didn't charge me for My steak dinner. Other than that all the food was great and the bread was the bomb ! absolutely loved it!
