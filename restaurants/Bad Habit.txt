Bad Habit

Text: We ate here on a Saturday night and it was not too crowded, but I don't think there were any major sporting events airing on TV, so that may change things. Although it wasn't packed, it was still busy and very noisy. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and my wife ordered the Cheese Enchilada. She said it was very good and it was a larger portion the covered the plate. My food was served hot and fresh but the bread was a little disappointing. I thought it was supposed to be garlic toast, but it was just a slice of bread. 

It appears to be a newer building and it has plenty of parking. It was very clean and the servers were friendly and efficient. The prices were decent for what you get. I would certainly eat there again.

Text: Good strong drinks! Hit for the price, they need to be. Slow waitstaff, but extremely friendly. Their sirloin is just as expensive as the good steak houses in town, yet it came out looking like it was George Forman’d and then microwaved. Not a good grilling at all. Nice big TV’s. Kinda weird to be closed on a Sunday. Especially during football season. It’s especially frustrating when I left my wallet there and no way of getting to it until late Monday.

Text: Just passing through and stopped for dinner. Food was very good. Mushroom Swiss burger and the BLT...which had a TON of bacon. Staff was friendly and service just a tad slow, for us. Open and airy atmosphere with TVs in all directions. It was slow when we arrived Friday evening but filled quickly, while we were there.

Text: Had the Philly with side of hash browns with onions and cheese.  Delicious.  Beer cold.  Service was great.
