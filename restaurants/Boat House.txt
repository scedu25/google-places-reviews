Text: We were eating a late lunch so no one else was there. The inside is nicely decorated and spacious. There were four of us and since it was so late in the day, we chose to split two tenderloins. We also split half orders of onion rings. This resulted in us being charged full prices for essentially two sandwiches and an onion ring as a side. The price of this meal was $37.00, before the tip. We consider this to be on the expensive side. The food was good but I would caution you to be careful as to how you order.

Text: This is the best place to go for wings. Smoked and smothered in a different kind of hot sauce with a sweet hint in it. Love them.
Interesting decor. Not a boring place.

Text: We ordered onion rings, had a lot but you could taste the old grease they were cooked in. I had a baked potato loaded. The brisket had a funny taste plus most of it was fat and grissel. The potato was dry too. My husband had the pork tenderloin sandwich, he wasn't impressed with it either. We drove an hour to eat there, won't do that again.
