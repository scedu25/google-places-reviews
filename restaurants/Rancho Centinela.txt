Text: So glad they open early for breakfast now.  We were there this morning.
They don't have a breakfast menu but apparently can fix about anything you would like.  They call it an American breakfast but I asked if they did any Mexican type breakfast meals and mentioned chilaquiles.  The waitress said they could do that.  Not only did they do it, they produced an over the top plate of food.  And the best part, is you can order breakfast all day long.
