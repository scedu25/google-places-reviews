Formosa Restaurant

Text: I've never had anything but good experiences when I've eaten at this restaurant. The food I've ordered was always good, regardless of what it was. The staff has never been anything but attentive and friendly. And the prices have always been reasonable. Formosa has been in Columbia for ages and I can see why it's stayed in business for as long as it has. It was here before I moved to Columbia in 1995 and I hope it will be here long after I'm gone.

Text: The food is good but the place is kind of strange.  It's very silent so it can feel really awkward.  It feels like you should be whispering.  Also, if you're super picky about a restaurant looking put together and extra clean, this place isn't for you.

Text: Interesting second floor restaurant in downtown Columbia. Great food. Might miss it if you don't know it is there. Stairwell is a bit scary.

Text: I've had their food as takeout and think it actually tasted better that way than inside the restaurant.

Text: THE ABSOLUTE WORST F****** CHINSESS FOOD IVE EVER HAD. and I’m not being sarcastic. My fried rice was CRUNCHY!!!! Not cooked. Not even a little bit. And the chicken in the rice was like rubber and raw? I’m probably gonna get a disease from it. Not to mention the sautéed beef was more like sautéed s***. Never again. Please for the sake of God do not eat here. I’m pissed.
