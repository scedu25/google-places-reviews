Text: The comedian we saw was hysterical ! He really made it worth it ! The wait in line was ridiculous when we purchased our tickets ahead of time online. The minimum purchase is a rip-off and is ridiculous in my opinion, also. 
The location is nice and parking wasn't bad! The staff was busy and wasn't overly friendly but wasn't rude.

Text: Great Comedy! Great atmosphere and great service, but the food isn't great. If the food were better we would eat there more often.

Text: Always have a great time out there. The acts are great and we always get more free tickets than we can use. Its a bit pricey but its a comedy club and if you don't expect to spend some money when you go to a nice place then don't go to a nice place.
