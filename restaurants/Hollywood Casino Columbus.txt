Text: It's fun make sure you bring extra money time flies. Play max bet on slots to win. Buffet very good however on pricey side on weekends.  Take two restaurant good.  I do wish they would bring back some of the slot machines they had when they opened.  Grease, Michel Jackson, the hangover, sex and the city and Elvis.  Those were the best ones wish had more like that.

Text: It's a casino! I enjoy their buffet and the staff are very polite and helpful. The casino itself is clean and well lit in the parking lot. Plenty of parking, garage parking available and valet services offered. There are a couple of different restaurant options, which offer a variety of food and price ranges. Also note you must be 21 to enter!! No one under 21 is allowed to be admitted.

Text: Fun place to visit. I'm no gambler, but the penny slot machines are fun, the buffet is nice, and the free coffee is good. Live entertainment is  nice, too. But they could use a second electronic Black Jack machine, like they had at first. Even though the machine has the obvious advantage, it's still a fun game. Overall, the casino is well maintained, aside from the strange "old rug" smell that hits you in the face, upon entering the elevator lobbies.

Text: I have been going here for over four years. I like the parking because it is under roof and always a great place to park. The Food is outstanding. After all that it’s time to go and do some Gambling in the best of best. Tables are always hot and so are the Machines.I enjoy myself about 3 or 4 times a week.
