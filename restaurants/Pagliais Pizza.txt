Text: Pagliais Pizza has deep roots in the Carbondale community as one of the best places to have pizza in the Southern Illinois Area.  The pizza has a wonderful ratio of crunch and dough.  The toppings taste fresh, and there is definitely enough cheese to satisfy you cheese lovers.  Make sure to get the deep dish option, as it is the best in my opinion.  Bake time isn't too long, and you can always order a pretty good salad to eat while you wait.  Servers are attentive and professional.  They know the menu and are ready to answer any questions you might have.  This well above average pizza place is definitely one to visit.  Family friendly and they welcome groups.
