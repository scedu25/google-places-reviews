Text: Barely any meat on the pizza. Had an email for Veterans to get a free buffet and they didn't honor it.  Both my husband and I said, "I feel like I'm eating in a dive."

Text: I love this place it has amazing pizza and powdered sugar brownies! I love there arcade! I do wish that you didn't have to pay for coins because my mom and Papa sometimes say no because there is a machine you get the coins out of and it cost a dollar for like 5 coins. But i love this place! I had my 5th b-day party there and I am 10 now and still love it!?

Text: This was the worst. The staff was not polite, there was no pizza up, we had to wait for like 15 minutes.  My husband ordered wings and it took them like 30 minutes to bring them out and then they were not even got. Then when the pizza did come up it tasted horrible.  It has really went down hill.
