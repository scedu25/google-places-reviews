Text: Loved the food but hostess had attitude when we asked for silverware/water for our guest that was in bathroom when we were seated.  Feel like they nickel n dime you a little- charge extra for chips/salsa (1 set is free), $1 extra for to go cups (the cup doesn't cost even 25 cents), $1 for sour cream, charge dinner prices at lunch on Sunday etc.  I was just glad they didn't charge for water.  On the plus side, they were the only place open in this town!
