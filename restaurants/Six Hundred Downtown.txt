Text: Pizza was awesome!!  Our service was very good also.  However, we were disappointed we couldn’t all sit together, there were plenty of tables that could have been moved very easily to accommodate the 12 people we had.  I asked the man who sat us, but was told it couldn’t be done. (??)We traveled 1 hr to celebrate a birthday.  We will be back, but probably not with a large group.

Text: We had a great lunch. The American Muscle on Detroit crust was so good. Of course the garlic knots are the best anywhere. Our waiter Zack did an awesome job and made the experience even better.

Text:  Great food, garlic knots are three bomb. The on tap beer selection was of good variety. 
 Our service was outstanding.  this was our first time her her time to describe each pizza type.  And as pizzas came out to other tables showed us the Detroit , original,  and thin pizzas.  
The atmosphere was really cool.  Upscale but casual.  You could easily see in the kitchen and the 2 wood fired ovens.  
Great date night spot.  We stopped on or way to see our  St.Marys RoughRiders scrimmage the Chieftains in football.

Text: Despite not having any lasagna and only having one crust available it was still a great experience.  Easily the most flavor packed  pizza I've had the pleasure of eating. Very kid friendly with prices and the unique idea of giving kids a ball of dough to play with while waiting was very memorable.

Text: I was very impressed with this place. My husband and I recently just moved here with our children from Illinois. We have been looking for a pizza place to "call home" and we have indeed found it. The staff was more than friendly, they accommodated to us (as we have two children in high chairs) and the food was absolutely GREAT! We decided on the Garlic knots for an appetizer, and Chicken BBQ Detroit style pizza. The garlic knots we ordered with garlic butter which our kids LOVED. As for the pizza; the BBQ sauce was sweet, the chicken was tender, and the crust was THICK and crispy. (Which is the Detroit style pizza. They also have Chicago style and then their Signature crust as well) It was perfect. Not only was the food good, but they also brought dough out for the children to play with while our pizza was cooking. Oh, and they have coke products. Which is an A++ in my book anyways! We will DEFINITELY be returning!
