Text: They cook the food in front of you if you choose to sit at the grill. They put on a show for you as well while cooking. And they involve you in it as well. The food is good and you don't get bored waiting for it to get done.

Text: The sushi was just okay. It was not cold which it should of been. It reminded me of sushi that had been sitting out awhile.  The tempura was very good and the service was very good.

Text: Now named IchiBan, the food is great. A lot of fun having the chef cook right in front of you. Huge portions. I always have lunch for the next day.

Text: Food was okay but not fantastic, long wait time to seat and for the grill to get going. Pricey for the small amounts of actual meat you get. They fill you up on rice and noodles.
