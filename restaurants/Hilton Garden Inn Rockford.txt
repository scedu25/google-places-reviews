Hilton Garden Inn Rockford

Text: This is one of the best run hotels I've been to in a while. Check in was a breeze. The staff are efficient and professional. Everything is clean, well maintained and well stocked (i.e. there were always towels in the pool). We spent hours in the pool area and the kids had a blast. The only thing I could possibly complain about is that the wifi was a little spotty.

Text: I can't speak highly enough about this hotel! Especially the staff...They are the BEST and they treat you like family! Lourdes and Louis are the best! The food is really good,  the rooms are always clean, the beds and pillows are super comfy and the I love the water pressure in the shower! I miss it every time I go home! lol The pool is awesome as well as the exercise room. It has everything you need for a great workout! Stay here, you will NOT be disappointed!

Text: It was a beautiful room with nice amenities. The breakfast buffet was very good with tasty omelettes. I am at another hotel as I'm writing this review while I am traveling for work and I miss the Hilton Garden Inn.

Text: Great hotel! Staff is super nice and friendly, the rooms are cleaned and renovated. They have Keurigs in every room, so I will recommend to bring your favorite coffee. The pool area is the best, My kids loved the pool.
