El Ranchito Mexican Restaurant

Text: The food is not impressive here. It doesn't have much flavor and some items are really bland. They have lost a lot of customers over the past couple years. It used to be packed all the time. This place floods almost every time the river and Frene Creek come up. After the flooding, you never see any replacements or construction work of anything that was under water. And it usually doesn't take too long for them to reopen. I often wonder how they can do that because you never see anything replaced. Before changing hands, they "recycled" the chips that weren't eaten after being served to each table with the salsa. I don't know if that cost cutting trick is still being used, so I always skip the chips and salsa.

Text: We loved it. Friendly server. Good queso and salsa. Delicious burritos! Pork, chicken and beef were all good. Margaritas were too sugary. Tone back the mix a little bit! Still good though.

Text: Tacos and burritos are good ("good", not great).  Anything else is pretty bad.  Crust on items that are fried (like chili rellenos, etc.) is soggy and not appealing at all to look at, place really needs to work on presentation.  Taco salad was more like a taco soup (the shell and whatever is in the bottom turned to mush by the time you get to the bottom).  Talked to the cook about a complaint and she was very rude, terrible customer service.

Text: Entrance is handicap accessible, but ALL tables are past a set of stairs that are in no wheelchair accessible without lifting the wheelchair up past the stairs which is completely ridiculous. Food tasted ok.
