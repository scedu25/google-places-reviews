Text: Made a lunch reservation online with ease, though not sure if it was necessary. Waited less than 5 minutes to be seated. Waiter was very pleasant. Had the brisket philly with fries. Loved the brisket and string onions! My son has the kids’ mac n cheese and loved it. Pretty big servings as we both didn’t finish our meals.

Text: We have come here for special occasions through the years and have noticed food quality has decreased while prices have increased.  We really want to like this place but the overall experience the last few times has been "so so".   Service is usually fine, but taste has not aligned to the price of the meal in my opinion.  Also, everyone used to get tasty rolls and several types of butter.  Now, you have to ask the server for the rolls.  If prices were lower I would rate it 5 stars.

Text: Every time I come in here I have to wait forever for service. I been here a third time now and nothing has changed. Service sucks but the food is delicious. I am just going to get to go orders for now on.

Text: Excellent food and service.  I must admit when I saw the menu with no prices, my first thought was...... "This can't be good!" The prices were not outrageous. But the food was! Will definitely be back.
