Text: My all time favorite place to eat. I've been going here most of my life. I would recommend everyone try the chicken first of course and then the steak. I also love the cheeseburgers and the pie. They have the best homemade food in all of Kansas. Love the service and love catering by them. So nice I'm home visiting so I can eat here tonight. Love love love it here.
