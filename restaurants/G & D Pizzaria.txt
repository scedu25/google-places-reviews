Text: Love this restaurant. They remember us and are always so concerned over whether we were happy with the food and service. Only two complaints: I wish they cooked their fries a little longer and they're always so busy!

Text: Great pizza and I love the salad bar. Great place for families, but for whatever reason they don't have a changing table in either bathroom.

Text: Went there on My lunch break!..... Great service, they were pretty quick even though they were pretty busy. The cheeseburger was good and their fries are the best!!!
