George's Pizza
Rating: 4
Text: We stopped at George's for lunch on a Sunday.  Not much open in Pella on a Sunday.  George's has a good menu selection but we opted to order pizza.  After a look at the drink menu we decided take our pizza across the street and eat at the Cellar Peanut Pub.  George's was a bit on the dark side.  The pizza was good.

Text: Good food with great service and food atmosphere.  Pizza is great, steak is pretty good for the price, fast kitchen and attentive service makes this a great place to eat!  Cell service on Verizon does get pretty poor in the restaurant so you've been warned...you may have to put the phone down and talk to the people at your table!

Text: My son and I shared a pizza with chicken on it. Pizza was good but the rest of my family did not seem impressed with their menu selection.
