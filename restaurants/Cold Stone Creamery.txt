Text: I've come here a few times. The ice cream is good, but last night the girl working the counter forgot the hot fudge on my dessert. The staff sometimes seems checked out.

Text: I've been here quite a few times, and will always be my go to for an ice cream hankering. I live about 20 minutes away, and it's well worth the drive, especially for a bike ride. The ice cream is always the best around. 
I've never tried their special treats, but my wife loves their truffles and fudge (although fairly pricy).
Conviently located in the heart of Aggieville.
