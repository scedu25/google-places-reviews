Text: Nice Cozy place. Nothing fancy but a good meal at a fair price with a great table by the river!

Text: I've been here twice and had a really good experience both times. The view is nice, the staff was pleasant and the food was 3-4 star, so I don't understand why people are downing the place. It's like one of those hidden treasure of a place. I'm going back.

Text: Our family has been dining at Marti's place for years and have never had a problem. They are full on most weekends so it can take a while to get a table, but the kids feed the fish off the outside deck by the river while we wait and have tons of fun with it.
Our food has always been great (try the cod it is the best) and depending on how crowded it is the service is fast. 

If you want a out of the way place to dine while watching the birds out your window as the river flows by, then Marti's place by the river is for you. We recommend Marti's to all our friends and have had them drive 2 hours just to bring friends to eat there after we took them there.
