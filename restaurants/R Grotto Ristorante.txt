Text: Ordered a pizza online today at 4:24pm. Got an email saying it would be done "around 4:46pm". Got there around 4:47pm and no one got to me until 4:52pm, as no one was around. She went to check if pizza was ready, it was not. I got my pizza at 5:15pm. 30 MINS LATER than predicted! This makes me think they didn't see my order and made it right then and I had to wait for it. That's pretty poopy...Not doing that again. Pizza was good, not too oily, but took way too long...way too hungry for that.

Text: Been eating this pizza for 40 years. Consistently great. I stopped trying to make ribs at home when they started serving these. Fall off the bone fantastic. Always start off with chicken nuggets - hot, with blue cheese dip. I can't list it all. Try everything.

Text: So far everything I've ordered here has been really good. The last being a clam pasta. Super awesome. The calamari & mussels are really good as well. Generic wine selection but what can you ask from a pizza place. I'm glad they even have wine.
