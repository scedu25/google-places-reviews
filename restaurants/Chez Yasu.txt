Text: A cute little French restaurant with delicious food and charming staff.  It is definitely worth looking over the dessert menu when it’s offered; I recommend the crème brûlée.

Text: Nice cozy place with good, friendly service. Gave it a "3" because of check problems. I read elsewhere that people have been overcharged so I carefully reviewed my bill and sure enough found we had been double charged for wine. 
Go for the food/atmosphere but look for overcharges. Check your bill carefully.
Probably will not return.

Text: Overpriced and food was below par. Bland potatoes and Seafood crepe was horrendous....the green beans were undercooked...i could easily make a better meal.
