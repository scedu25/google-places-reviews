Bucceto's Smiling Teeth

Text: What happened?  Good food just slightly overpriced.  Didn't mind because better than most delivery in the area.  However, recently we have called and there is always an hour and a half wait.  We have been hung up on several times before getting the chance to place an order.  Tonight we decided to try again.   They assured us it was a 45 minute wait.  An hour and a half later our food was so cold it had to be reheated in the oven.  On a $40 order the manager only offered $3 off.  Won't be doing business at this Bucceto's again.

Text: Delicious and fast take on Italian favorites. Pizza and Stromboli are excellent, with plenty on fresh toppings. Pasta and sauces are divine. They have great salads and a couple creative low carb options. Service is usually fast and friendly. Yes, this costs a little more than the cheap college delivery pizza places, but well worth it. Our kids love it and ask for it by name.

Text: My god,  this pizza is great.  Fresh out of the box,  cold, heated up in a microwave,  is all good.  If only you guys were in Cincy, you'd make a fortune.

Text: Oh my God they have such great food! It was excellent quality Italian food! It is a bit pricey but its worth it. They have great flavors for there food and a great family friendly environment. The service is good. All in all I loved it. The entree was quite enough but the desserts are pretty good too.
