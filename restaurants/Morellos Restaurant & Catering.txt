Text: Most people aren't aware that there is a bar in the back. Their beer on tap is magical. Sit back have a couple and order an appetizer. They're pretty big. The food is ok. Not as good as it used to be. Beer makes up for it. Nice atmosphere. When they have live entertainment it's usually very good.

Text: Just bought a Philly steak and cheese sandwich with fries to go. The sandwich was good but the fries were burnt and disgusting. Sad since I paid $2 for 10 burnt fries(we're not talking big fries either McDonald's $1 menu fries have more volume than these did). I've never stepped foot in that place and don't plan on it any time soon. Probably won't ever order anything to go again as well.

Text: Oh so good. Their Pizza is really good. They have a great lunch buffet with a fresh salad bar. The Italian beef and Pork tenderloin sandwich are very good. Owner really seems to care.
