Super Smokers BBQ
Rating: 3
Text: We have been there previously and it was good but we went this holiday weekend and did not like our meals.  My husband and I did not like the meat or side dishes....and the service was not good.  I took the meat home, and the dog would not eat it....and she eats everything. Maybe they did not have their usual help?   I will give them the benefit of the doubt.   Not sure....but will probably not go back anytime soon.

Text: Best smoked ribs I've ever had! Didn't need any sauce. True smoked flavor throughout.  Nice family owned place.
Great value for the money.

Text: Very friendly staff, but the food was really sub-par. I wasn't a fan of the sauces. They were all very strong, which I normally like; however the flavor profile just didn't agree with me. Others may enjoy it though!

Text: Good meat. Sad they were out of 4 items but such is life.  Unfortunately for us, not one of the bbq sauces offered were really that good. The Kansas one was the only we remotely liked.  We took it home and added our own sauce to it.  Mac and cheese was good. Potato salad not so much.  Idk if we will go back.  Service was very friendly and may be the only saving grace really.

Text: It is one of the better places for pulled pork and ribs.. you will find value if you go for the specials on offer.. and you go there for what  they are famous for... if you want a pizza or something else go elsewhere.. their speciality is hog meat... period. ..
