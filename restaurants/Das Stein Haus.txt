Text: Owner Helmut made our group of 14 most welcome. Service was a bit slow to start, but exemplary once they got to us. Good food, and I love the atmosphere. Obviously a Jeff City icon.

Text: This place looks like a hole-in-the-wall, but the food is Euro-Gourmet.  Best French onion soup of my life, full of homemade croutons and topped with plentiful, toasted cheese atop.  Sausages appeared to be filled with tender, slow-roasted beef.  Interesting flavors, large portions and high quality touches throughout.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

Text: Excellent authentic food and atmosphere. I love German food. We were a party of 6. I was the only one who had experienced German food from working there some years ago. We had everything from Roladen, to sauerbrauten, to smoked chops, to genuine bratwurst and real goulash. Best German food outside the Deutschland. Helmut we will be back.
