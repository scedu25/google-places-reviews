Text: Nice atmosphere. Split the fajitas for two, there was plenty of food and tons of toppings for them. But my only complaint is that the fajitas were not very Mexican in flavor, it’s stated on the menu that they were made with (soy sauce and teriyaki) but gosh did they taste like Chinese food.

Text: Not bad for a small Kansas town.  The specialty was a sopapila so I ordered one!  Yummy comfort food and very reasonably priced

Text: Nothing fancy about the premises just darn good food.  Live in Oregon but have to make Parkhill at least once every visit.  Been eating here for well over 30 years.
