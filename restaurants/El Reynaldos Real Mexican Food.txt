El Reynaldos Real Mexican Food

Text: The sign doesn't lie, this is a real Mexican food restaurant! The food was great and prices reasonable. I'm part Mexican and from California and this place reminded me of home. My only complaint is that the salsa wasn't spicy at all, but the flavor was great!

Text: Great food. He's a cook. I want more. Go there skip the fast food. $10 meal you can not beat.
