Text: Worked here for over a year. This place is a joke the kitchen is absolutely disgusting and I've seen food dropped many times on the floor and they just dip it back in the fryer and serve it. The person who plates the food and some of the fry guys are usually chewing tobacco while working and nobody ever wears gloves hardly when prepping food. The owner comes in and cuts steaks with no gloves on as well and sometimes wears open toe shoes. His son goes in the kitchen and cooks food in the fryers and on the grill when he knows he's not supposed to. I have many pictures of the unsanitary things that take place in this kitchen not to mention a video of live maggots in the kitchen because their employees are too lazy to clean stuff up.

Text: First visit, we stopped for lunch on Labor Day... 

Tthe band echoed off all the hard surfaces. When you cannot talk, its too loud. The food was good, so that gave them a three-star

Text: Well worth the drive from Quincy. The jalapeno hashpuppy appetizer is an absolute must.
