Text: The food is great and the morning staff are awesome. But both times we ate here in the evening the waitresses were very rude. There were two tables occupied other than ours and it took 15 minutes before we even got menus. Service was quicker in the morning when it was packed. Doesn't make sense.

Text: Well, the first day we went there it was great! OE Eggs were perfect, hash browns were superb, and bacon was big and crisp. Biscuit was good! First day rate Would rate it at 4.5 only because we had to flag the waitress down for more coffee. Second morning was a bust! Hash browns were burnt on the edges, the over easy eggs were over well done. Bacon was good, biscuit was good but had to flag the waitress down three times for more coffee. Different cooks we were told!

Text: An unexpected surprise. We stopped in after dealing with Eclipse traffic all day and just wantwd food. We were met by a friendly waitress who provided great service. Portions are huge and priced well below similar places. The liver was tender and tasty, mashed potatoes and gravy were delish, and the ice cream for dessert was free! A really great value for a very tasty meal.
