Text: Best local wines, the whiskeys are all great, and the other spirits are also high quality, particularly their gin and vodka. Very friendly staff who know about the product and are eager to share their knowledge. I highly recommend it.

Text: Attended Cedar Ridge for the first time this weekend for a wedding and reception.  I enjoyed trying their multiple whiskys while my wife took a liking to the first wine she tried.  We left with 3 bottles of whiskey and 3 bottles of wine!  The food was simply amazing with great flavor and left me wanting more!
