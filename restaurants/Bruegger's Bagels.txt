Bruegger's Bagels

Text: My visit today was underwhelming. I got the pastrami sandwich today. They put butter on the outside of the bread and didn't hardly toast it at all. The girl literally grabbed a pinch of coleslaw to put on the sandwich. I had to ask for more and even then it didnt cover the samdwich. It said on the sign "all classic deli sandwiches come with a side of coleslaw". When she rang me up I pointed this out as she didn't give me one. She did grab it, but filled the cup less than half full of coleslaw and proceeded to charge me an extra $1.99 for it, which I didn't notice until I got to my car. Lame experience overall.

Text: This place used to be great but when we went there today we got stale bagels and the egg was hard since we were going out of town we couldn't go back for a refund. She even sold us two half plain bagels as two whole bagels because she wanted to scam us.

 The Bruggers in Coralville is a thousand times better and they have more then cheddar cheese. The wifi did not work and the cheese on the bagel was stale. The management was rude and crude and they refused to give us a reciet this location should be shut down. -Also the wifi is not free it supposed to be but the lady behind the counter would not help us connect. 

I'm not going here again
