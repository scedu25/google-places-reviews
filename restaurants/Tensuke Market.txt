Tensuke Market

Text: It’s a neat little store, good for those knowledgeable in Japanese foods and for those without. Store associates are super friendly and respectful and things are very fairly priced.

Don’t forget to try the lunch boxes while your there!!

Text: Gotta love Tensuke! This is the place for all your Japanese/Bubble-Tea/good eat needs. This is a must go to if you live near here, or if you live in Columbus in general. Just go!

Text: I stopped in for dinner two nights ago and ordered the Shrimp Tempura ramen. For the past two days, I have not been able to eat and have felt 
incredibly uneasy.  First time I have ever visited this restaurant and it will be my last.

Text: Fresh meats and seafood products as well as interesting treats. I like to think this is my regular place of business for grocery shopping and my goal is to try to find something new each time I get in there. Staff is very pleasant. Prices are great for their quality (though sometimes I catch myself comparing to Wal-Mart, but that's more of a me thing). Also connected to a sushi bar and noodle shop which are quite possibly the best in town.

Text: I have been shopping here for well over 20 years, they have expanded their store over the years and the selections for Japanese groceries are vast.  Their fresh seafood is fresh, sashimi is always fresh and of very good quality that shines through.  The staff there are all very friendly.  Highly recommend this place.
