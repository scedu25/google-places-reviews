Text: Hadn't been there in a long time so we called another couple to see if they might be interested in going for a half smoked chicken.   It was very tasty.   Didn't have to wait long for food to arrive and I ordered the German potato salad which was served warm ... and was the very best I have ever had outside of my own family's recipe.   We will most definitely not wait so long again to go for good food.

Text: A great tavern. We go Monday for the best smoked chicken around. Saturday night's prime rib is good too. I have never ordered anything that want served piping hot and freshly prepared.

Text: Went on a Saturday afternoon. Not crowded, took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our food. Nothing special ordered. Cheeseburger was over salted. Ribeye sand. was under seasoned. Wedges were - 2 orders overcooked and 1 order overcooked. 
Waitress, half time bartender, didn't know if they had waffle fries ever, though, they are pictured on the website. Also didn't know if they had Corona. Which they didn't. 
Might give it another try if I'm every back in that area.

Text: Doesn't look like much and it's out of the way but service was good and the food was above average. Excellent cheeseburger. Worth a little detour to visit.
