Text: If you love Saint Louis style pizza, and you like the convenience of pulling one from the freezer to the oven without having to order and go pick it up. You have got to try this pizza!. We  love. Bought some through a fundraiser and now we are so glad we did. We love the provel cheese. We actually love all cheese! But this is St.Louis style.

Text: I bought a pizza from a fundraiser and couldn't have been more happier with the taste. Never been a big fan of TJ's and even if I was, they've got nothing on this place!
