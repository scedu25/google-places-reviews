Text: On a rare occasion I will write a one-star review, but this has been a disappointment for the last time.  The staff and our waitress did a fine job, I just wish I would have said something. We were a table of eight and only one person was satisfied with their meal.  Mine tasted like it was a leftover that had been microwaved and splashed with bottom shelf brand X barbecue sauce.  My wife's ribs were flavorless except for a heavy coating of salted char.  Even the side dishes were tasteless.  I can do much better at home.  This was our final trip here.

Text: Great food and service. I had smoked chicken and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Beer is very cold. Loved it and plan to come back.

Text: The food is really good.    The price for portions seems to be on par.  You get a lot for what you pay for but it's good.   Don't waste the food.   :)

Text: Awesome atmosphere and friendly staff! Fish bowls for beer was great. Had the ribs and they were on point! Will definitely be returning.

Text: If you haven't even been, it is a "must go place" if you like diamond in the rough, hole in the wall bars. Everything about this place is great.
