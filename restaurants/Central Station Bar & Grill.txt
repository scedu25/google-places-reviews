Text: The bouncers and wait staff are always fun and agreeable. Coupled with the lights and music, it makes for a great atmosphere. Except for the manager... she could use a happy pill. I always smile and offer a kind greeting, but I've never had a positive response.

Text: Awesome menu! Building was the railroad freight house in the old days, they have done a fantastic job of including R+R into the decor. You can dine in an original railroad dining car if you want! Great place!

Text: Had eaten here about a year ago and it was good.  Not so much this year. The food seemed to have come out of a can. Sorry, I will not be back unless I hear better reviews.

Text: I got the bacon guacamole burger and fries. The food was really good and the burger was freaking huge. The decor and all of the TV's were awesome.

Text: Good place for food and drinks. I was very surprised at the Carnitas Platter, which became my favorite dish there! Order yours with extra salsa verde.
