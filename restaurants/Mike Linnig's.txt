Text: Always a great place to go. When comparing prices you don't pay much more than you would at other seafood places and you get so much more food that is of better quality. Great atmosphere for families, work outings or celebrations. They do have a bit of a wait, just know your food is made fresh to order. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.

Best seafood in town! The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. It has fine dining in doors with the waiters and waitresses. It also has casual eating indoors and Outdoors with picnic tables, a beer booth, and other alcoholic beverages. In the casual dining area there is enough paraphernalia on the wall to keep the conversation rolling about look at that and look at the head on that, and look at the size of that for hours.

This place is usually packed, but that's because of the good food and good service. Its been in business for more years than I can count. I believe over 50 years..

 There's usually some kind of event going on there, car shows, things to go along with the fair, their own activities and promotions. I can't speak highly enough of this place. If you haven't been there, put it on your bucket list.

If you don't know what you want or you can't make up your mind , I highly recommend the seafood platter, it has a little bit of everything on it from frog legs to scallops,fish, crab cakes, and more... My last suggestion is to get the onion rings....wow.

Text: Took my Mom out for birthday dinner and this was her choice (not surprising). She had the Pan Fried Oyster plate, I had the fish plate and wife had the fish nuggets. As usual, great food with enough left over for tomorrow. Sweet tea was good but the beer could have been colder.
The outside dining area was packed (not unusual when the weather is nice) and it was  "bike night". Lots of beautiful Harleys to look at and some good dinner music to boot.
A four ? visit overall. But you've only got about six weeks before they close for the season. Better get by there before mid November or you'll have to wait until mid January for opening day.

Text: Some of the best seafood, and biggest portions in Louisville. The fish here is excellent, just about everything in there is great! They have really good frog legs, I highly recommend the scallops, they give you a mountain of onion rings and they're really good. They're so large you only need one order for two people. They have casual dining in the outer restaurant. And they have a little more fancy restaurant with waiters and waitresses in the back. Nice and classy. They have an outdoor eating area. It has picnic tables and totem poles carved out of trees. Going to this place is an experience. Don't go there for a quick bite, although you can. If it's your first time there, it's an experience. You'll be amazed at all the stuff they have on the walls, giant turtle shells, fish that the linnig's have caught on fishing excursions. It's a sight to behold. If you go there on a weekend, be prepared for a wait. The reason is there food is good, the atmosphere is good, and if you're a regular you know this. Believe me it's worth the wait!

Text: Saw some mixed reviews here, but a great many of my colleagues rave about this place.  Had a friend in from out of town and decided to stop here on a glorious summer day for lunch before heading to Knob Creek gun range.  Ordered the sampler and ate in the wonderful, shady outdoor dining area.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Prices was extremely reasonable for the variety and quantity.
