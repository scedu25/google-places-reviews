Cricket's Cafe

Text: It was a great experience. The food is very good, reasonably priced, and the portions are a good size. Our server was very attentive, checking several times for drink refills and anything else we need. The employees were courteous and our wait time for our orders was short. I highly recommend this place.

Text: Very clean and friendly staff but our food was not good. I had the fish basket and there was a very overwhelming lemon taste in the fish. My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy and didn't even eat them because there was a very strong herb or spice taste that was not what you would expect with biscuits and gravy.

Text: Cricket's Cafe continues to be one of my favorite places to eat out.  The food is great and, many times, served before I can be seated.  The people that work there are super friendly and they are there to refill my cup before the coffee has a chance to off. They get a FIVE STAR rating from me.

Text: New management for a small cafe. Menu on caulk boards, but has paper menus if needed. Give order in front & sit with customer number on table. Food is brought to you. They make their own potato chips. BEST I have ever tasted! Better than French fries. Have Network access. Very casual dress. Nice workers. Liked it.

Text: Stopped by for the first time passing through and was not impressed. Cashier had an awful attitude about changing my drink size. Cost $11.50 for a chicken salad sandwich, potato chips and a medium drink (they called it a large but it was a not a large cup). The croissant was soggy and falling apart, the chips were cold and old. My fiancée ordered a chicken cheese philly, didn’t realize until we were down the road she was given a beef steak philly instead. To top it off, no napkins in the bag. Very disappointed.
