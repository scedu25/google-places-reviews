Text: Amazing staff. Incredible food. Don't know what you want to eat? Ask your waiter. They know what you need.

Text: Seems to be a nice place. I was watching a waiter carry food to another table threw the windows reflection and I then noticed him give the back of my head a dirty look for no reason. Makes you wonder what could happen to your food.
