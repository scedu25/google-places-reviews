Text: My family has owned it for over 30 years now. They have worked hard for over half of their life to keep this place going strong. Some reviews on here talk about service when busy. It's a small town and staff is limited due to being so close to a big city. It's extremely hard to find hard working dependable and honest staff that cares about their job and cares about the guests who make it possible for us to keep the doors open. So because of this when it is a busy weekend, we do our very best, especially with large groups it's going to take a little extra time to care for them. People shouldn't judge on 1 bad experience they have until they give it another try. Please remember it's extremely hard to compete with the chains in the city and we really appreciate our small town regulars and anyone else who decides to give us a chance.

Text: We Have great food, from Italian to Mexican and homemade stuff. Soups are all made from scratch, as well as our chicken and noodles. We will be celebrating 32 years in February. If you’ve ever had a bad experience and have only been in once, please come try us out again.

Text: If you like going back in time to a quiet, simpler dining experience, this might be the place for you.  Simple, small town fare, served in a quiet small town venue.  No pretention.
