Text: I ate there twice. The last time was during the fair. Horrible place. Food was cheap but prices were not. Paid over 15 dollars for a steak that was 1/4 inch thick and full of gristle. Mushroom appetizer had ice in them. Never again.

Text: So disappointed, restaurant was dark in the middle of the day, even the restroom.  Food was greasy, but the coffee was great.  Had always wanted to try Creek side, but won't go again.
