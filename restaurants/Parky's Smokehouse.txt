Text: Good BBQ at a reasonable price. Not going to set the world on fire, but for central Indiana, you could do worse. I was leery of the way they shred the brisket like pulled pork, but it was moist, flavorful and a good mix of fat and lean. The sides are excellent. The coleslaw and beans being standouts. Will definitely go back.

Text: By far one of the best BBQ restaurants I've been to in a while. I had the Ribs and Wings and i ate every bit I could. 

I didn't have to wait to be seated, my waitress Anise was very courteous and dilligent, and to top it all off I didn't have to wait forever to get my food. 

All in all I would say I was very satisfied with the service, food, and atmosphere of this restaurant. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves BBQ, and maybe looking for something to treat yourself with.

Text: Stopped in for a quick dinner and to catch up with a coworker. The seating was ample and the noise level was low. It was actually a good environment for casual conversation. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The meat was tender, the bun perfectly toasted, and the fries were cooked to just the right crisp. I was a little disappointed with the spicy sauce. It seemed to get lost on the sandwich such that you wouldn't even know that you put any sauce on it. The only suggestion I might have would be to trim the pork a little better before shredding it. Quite a bit of my sandwich consisted of chunks of unrendered fat. Overall a good meal and the service was fantastic. I will definitely be back if I'm in Lebanon and am in the mood for BBQ.

Text: Good BBQ with healthy portions. I'd list the staff above average. They we very friendly and took good care of us. I was amazed with the mushroom basket. It was loaded unlike most places were each person gets just a couple of them. Clean and comfortable place great for dinning.
