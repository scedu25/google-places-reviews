Text: Aaron Lewis was 5-Star and so were most bartenders. The venue it's self wasn't amazing. The tickets said 10pm even though the show started way earlier, view of the stage kinda blew and they packed up all merchandise before the end of the show so we couldn't buy a tshirt.

Text: Great bands and a very fun atmosphere! Drinks are inexpensive and the line dancing is super fun to watch and participate in if you're in any way coordinated.

Text: First of all shout out to the staff our first concert here I tripped over some stage wiring the staff came right over to check on me. The bar staff is very quick and friendly although the drinks can be a bit pricy for a blue moon and mixed drink 17 bucks. Plenty of seating around a dance floor where you can stand next to the stage and the bar also has a riding bull with pool tables! Very nice country atmosphere with something cool lit up everywhere you look! Being from Pittsburgh I just wish we had a place like this!!!
