Text: Not only am I not from around here, but my family and I have high standards when it comes to restaurant, with us all working in the food industry. We had pulled off the high way looking for a place to stop for dinner on our way back from vacation, and had seen Baby Bull's, knowing that nobody in the family has been there we decided to go with that and give it a try. We walked into a very warm welcome by an older lady by the name of Pam. Next Pam sat us where she thought was best, but gave us options too (this won't happen all the time because of the business). Next our waitress didn't take more than 2 minutes to get over and get us our drinks along with our bread and butter. This young lady goes by the name of Danielle, she was very kind, understanding, and respectful. She didn't rush us at all! And we had gotten all of our food within roughly 10 minutes if not a little earlier than that. Our food tasted AMAZING! All the workers there had made us feel welcome, and very relaxed. If I could rate this place more stars I would. I couldn't recommend this place any more than I am now. Well worth the money that we spent, we will be sure to go back on our vacation.

Text: Very slow service!  Food took forever to come out! Waitress spilled a soda all over me! Don't blame her. As I blame the cramped conditions of the restaurant!!! Not alot of space for movement at all!!! Now back to the food.  I ordered a skirt steak and eggs meal. Steak was terrible and very small!! Had no flavor no taste!!! Up by our house.  For that high price! At least you get the whole cut of meat! That fills up your plate!!! This is the first time in my life. That I ever left a restaurant still hungry after my meal!!! Sad. At $14.00  I should feel full!!! Not a good place. Sorry.

Text: Highly recommended if you're just passing through. Great breakfast served anytime. Quick service despite several large groups. Staff was very polite. Looks like a hole in the wall, but you won't be disappointed.
