Text: Just got back from bowling here. Did have fun because the people I was with. However there was a major lack of communication between us and the employees. We were first told 3.75 per game for 2 people. Later we decided we'd play multiple games. I went paid for 3 more games. Then after a game and a half. We get told that's all we paid for. Then the manager tells us its 3.75 per person for one game. Just wish we would've been told this in the beginning instead of 3.75 per game.

Text: I've never bowled here but I have traveled from Macomb, IL just to get my bowling balls drilled here! Scott has drilled 5 balls for me in the last month. He's great with kids (as I bring mine with me). He's a kool, funny, pretty smart dude. He's very knowledgeable when it comes to booking and where to place the holes for best results! Will refer anyone and everyone I know to come here for his services.
