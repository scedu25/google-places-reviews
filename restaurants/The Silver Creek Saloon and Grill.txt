Text: Horribly disappointing stop. 11:30am on a Friday while not really busy the (not very presentable) middle aged waitress/bartender was so awful we ended up walking out without ordering anything. When I asked for a menu with prices she said they didn't have a drink menu at all. Rattled off very vague prices quickly without stating any types of beer. When I asked what size options were there she had absolutely no idea (though she knew they only carried one size). She got rude with me & walked off. Making herself unavailable to be ordered from or bothered again. The less than a minute we got interaction from her consisted of giving us dirty food menus. We obviously weren't worth her time.

Text: Food is really good. Best fries ever but they charge extra to substitute with meal instead of chips! That's ridiculous. Would have got 5 stars. Also takes long to get food but worth the wait if your not in a hurry
