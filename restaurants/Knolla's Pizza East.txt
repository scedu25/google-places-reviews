Knolla's Pizza East
Rating: 5
Text: Knolla's is consistently the best pizza in Segewick County. This location has comfy booths available but can be noisy if there are kids. Worth it.

Text: So yummy! I love getting their lunch special-- it's such a good deal. Get there early for lunch because they are always busy.

Text: Best pizza in town and best local pizza I've ever had. INCREDIBLY generous with toppings, wonderful crust that's not too greasy. Perfect pizza for all occasions.
