Text: This place was awesome. It was my first visit but the other three people I were with they had eaten there several times before. It was busy but the great service kept coming and coming. Very attentive fast paced service by the waitress and when your glass was getting down to about half she was right there to see if you needed more. The food portions are huge very huge and the prices are  very reasonable I am impressed with this place and the quality of everything. Thank you to all the staff.

Text: Great atmosphere and solid service, but the food is the star! Best fried cheese ANYWHERE! Pasta con broccoli is a winner! Love this place. Worth the 45 minute drive from home.

Text: I can't say enough about this place. We had my husband's retirement party there last night and everything was perfect! The venue was awesome and several of our guests commented on how perfect it was. We were outside, but it was covered with plenty of fans and seating - very comfortable! The  wait staff assigned to our party was amazing - no one had to wait for a drink, they were upbeat and friendly, and they always remembered what everyone was drinking. The food was delicious and we never ran out. I truly can't think of anything negative about our experience and highly recommend Seamus to anyone thinking of having an event.

Text: They have the best fried cheese in town! Good food. Nice staff. Great place to meet some friends and hang out in the bar and watch some sports ball.

Text: The food here is delicious, with great portions and huge burgers and sandwiches. The place can pack up in the evenings and on the weekends, so plan ahead.  But its worth the wait for fried mushrooms or cheese.
