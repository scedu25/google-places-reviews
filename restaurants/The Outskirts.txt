Text: There is no reason this place isn't packed every weekend. The food is amazing. It's great quality and you will crave the appetizers after the first bite. Staff is very friendly. Atmosphere is odd with a skating rink right next to your table but that also adds some eccentric and fun vibes. 
The French fries....oh my, I hate French fries but I'll be darn if their fries didn't slap my face with crunchy and salty heaven tastes. Ahhhmazing, seriously. The sage gravy, what is sage gravy you ask, get over there and taste it. You'll literally fight for every bite if you plan on sharing an appetizer. Yes, it's that good. Have fun, eat out, drink a big girl drink and let loose.

Text: Always a great experience here; I have a fair amount of food allergies and they are always very accommodating for me at The Outskirts. Food is always consistently good. Try the bbq brisket sandwich; its fantastic!

*Also, if you love live music,  Outskirts has a ton of good bands that play live shows (bands from local rock to big bands like Alien Ant Farm, etc.!)
