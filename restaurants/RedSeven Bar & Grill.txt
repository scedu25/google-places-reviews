Text: Excellent food and service. Never been disappointed with any visit here. Lobster Mac and cheese is to die for (high end twist on comfort food). I always choose this restaurant for special occasions when I need a quick go-to. I'll definitely be back again soon.

Text: This place was truly great. My husband and I came in this mid-afternoon. Our server was on top of everything, made sure our food was good for us. He made conversation with us and joked around with us. Our food was great! My husband got the ribeye, what he calls, "a man's steak," and he enjoyed it all. My Americana Burger was delicious! Thank you for such enjoyable food and a great afternoon! I'm sure this is one establishment we are gonna come back to!

Text: The filet and bacon wrapped shrimp were perfect. First time here and I will be back for sure. Service and atmosphere were almost as good as the food.

Text: The service was pretty good here. Everyone was very friendly but they messed up my sisters order. Even with that mistake the food was really good. They let me put a fried egg on my burger which if you havent tried that before this is a great place to try it. The atmosphere is pretty cool and its a nice place to just chill.
