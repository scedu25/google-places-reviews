Happy China

Text: We ordered from here last night. The delivery was quick, the food was hot, and neat. Above all, it tasted great! We got the crab rangoon (they're generous in size and content!), vegetable lo mein, Fresh Broccoli with Garlic Sauce (amazing), Hot Bean Curd (kinda tasted like hot and sour soup, our kid loved it), House Special Fried Rice with no pork (they actually put a good amount of meat in their fried rice!). They were very generous and gave us a free order of their sweet rolls. They were so good! We will ABSOLUTELY order here again. It is obvious they care about what they serve.

Text: Don't go here if you're in a hurry, I waited 30 minutes for fried rice, took it home (2 minutes away) and it was cold! Worst service I've seen in Lexington. Try another place, thankfully there's plenty to choose from. 2 blocks down Winchester Rd past Loudon is a really good Chinese place to eat that has good food and service...and it's only a couple minutes down the street.

Text: Unless your desperate for their cheap buffet prices, this is the last place you want to come eat, and honestly I wouldn't call this Chinese food.

Text: Ordered the buffet had to wait for food to be cooked and put out on buffet bar. I noticed they don't clean out the previous food pan even if it's dried up. They just dump the fresh food on top of dried up noodles.the price I ok at $5.50 including drinks. But you get what you pay for.
