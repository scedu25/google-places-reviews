Text: I've been to several locations including a new location in Indiana and I've had great service and great food at all locations, until today.  The silverware was dirty and they had to bring us three sets until they found a clean one. The tables being served alcohol that were seated after us were served first and had several rounds of cocktails before we received our food, which was cold.  We weren't given all our food, or even butter for that fact, and had to keep asking for things.  He did finally offer to bring a fresh warm dish after I showed him how cold the food was by literally picking up the skillet and putting my finger into the middle of the food. There was no offer to have a manager speak to us or offer to make things right.  The server was too busy to be bothered with us, and kept walking by to take care of the two tables that were clearly going to have a huge bill just on alcohol. I felt bad for the table sat by me with two ladies and a baby because he was even more absent to them and the wait was becoming too much for the baby. It's close enough to a lot of other great options so I'll head to those before I eat at this location again.  In general, try Wild Eggs other locations, they really are a great chain option for breakfast or lunch.

Text: Excellent, breakfast,  not being from the south I wanted to try the chicken and waffles, a southern staple.  Being raised southern Colorado when they asked me if I wanted the hot sauce on the side I said no, if it had been any hotter that would have been a mistake.  The spicy chicken was offset by the sweet savory waffle and it was delicious! 
My husband had the Wild Western Omlet and he said that it was the best breakfast ever.  The staff was friendly,  attentive and efficient.  We will definitely come here next time we are Louisville.

Text: Great food. It is usually crowded, even on a weekday morning. But there is a good reason. Their food is awesome. I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is friendly and the restaurant and bathrooms are always clean. They have vegetarian and gluten free options. Also great options for kids. You will not be disappointed!

Text: Was looking for an authentic southern breakfast experience while briefly in Louisville, and Wild Eggs definitely delivered.  Friendly and super accommodating service as well!  I highly recommend the nashville hot chicken waffle (though if you're not into REALLY SPICY things, get the hot sauce on the side! The server was kind enough to do this for me since I apparently looked weak ;) ).

Text: Ordered the Kelsey Brown and apple bourbon compote crepe. Both were outstanding! The Apple bourbon compote crepe offered a delicate delicious sweetness  with the Perfect Blend of tartness to create a refreshingly light but scrumptiously Savory sweet brunch entree.   
The Kelsey Kentucky Brown was the perfect marriage of Turkey and bacon with Mornay sauce topped with  diced tomatoes and an egg on the side.  
I Can't wait to return two this establishment to repeat this dining pleasure.
