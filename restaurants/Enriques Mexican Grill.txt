Text: Stopped in while out exploring on a Saturday afternoon. Was disappointed to find that they don't serve beer, but the food and service was good enough to warrant five stars. The tamale's were particularly good.

Text: I've been here several times.  The food is okay, but getting service is sometimes difficult.  Four groups were seated after us.  All were served before us.  A waitress finally came and asked if anyone had taken out order yet.  Nope!
