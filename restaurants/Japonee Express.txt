Text: My favorite lunch spot near campus. Free miso soup! Their lunch bento boxes are a great deal. The boba teas are great hot or cold. Fast service and they do takeout. For less of an express feel try their fancier place downtown!

Text: This is one of my favorite lunch spots near campus.

The lunch bento box is a great deal, coming with rice, a small salad, two gyoza, half a California roll, plus the entrée. If you get the chicken tempura bento box, you end up with a lot of food for just $7.50. The chicken or pork katsu is also pretty good, but not nearly as much food. 

Also, everything comes with free miso soup. The soup is pretty bland as far as miso soup goes, but hey, it's free. 

The sushi, katsu, tempura, ramen, and kimbob/kimbap/gimbap are all pretty good, but not spectacular. 

If you like the big fancy expensive rolls, you can get two for one on them any time.
