Text: Blah... A bug flew in my food... I like the rustic feel of the restaurant,  the server was attentive but,  or food was cold.  The biscuits and gravy taste  like chili Mac.. weird.. the potatoes taste line they had been sitting it for a while. the French toast was good until a bug flew in my food.  It was a couple of them hovering around our table.  And we still had to pay full price.  Soo.... pretty sure I won't be returning..

Text: Half & Half is so cute; I'm glad I got to finally eat there! (It's very busy on the weekends). Their biscuits and gravy tasted like tacos (I mean that in a good way) and is easily one of the best in the city. Our server (I think his name was Jason) was SUPER good and refilled my coffee very quickly. 

Great service, great food. Definitely go there!

Text: Hostess skipped us in line, had to wait an hour to be seated. She said she would call our phone, but didn't. Said she yelled out for us, but we were waiting right behind her and never heard her. Ordered coffee while waiting and was given a dirty spoon to stir with. Ordered the BBLT with egg whites only and received the full egg. Sent it back and it was obvious that they just had cut out the yolk and put it back on my sandwich with runny yolk all over it still.  They comped our meal, but ruined the experience.

Text: We finally got a chance to try this place. We got in line online, where we were told 45-60 minutes. It ended up being closer to 90. Once we were seated and ordered, our food too another 30 minutes. It was good food, just not sure it was work the wait.
