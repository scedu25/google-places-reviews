Buck Burgers & Brew
Rating: 5
Text: We went in on Sunday evening and had great appetizers, great burgers, and great beer!  Dakota was our server and he was AMAZING!  If we ever go back we will be requesting him,   he was on point and went above and beyond! He found out my husband was retired Navy, thanked him for his service and bought him a beer with his own money!  What a great experience!

Text: We had the fried Brussels sprouts and they were delicious! Also ordered the pulled pork nachos which were great. The Buck salad was huge and very good. Hannah was our waitresses and she was the best. We loved Bucks!

Text: Excellent burgers! The beer cheese soup was very strong in the beer department, but we are not a beer family, so maybe if you are it would be great! We sat upstairs and there was live music, great time!

Text: Good burgers and brew. Very reasonably priced, and expect a wait on nice days. Kid friendly. Even had some live music upstairs the day we were there. Cool inside and clean bathrooms. A great place for a burger and beer.
