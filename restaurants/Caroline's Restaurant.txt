Text: Came in on a quiet Friday night. There were 3 tables total with people at them, a few at the bar and 2 servers that I could see. It still ended up taking over 20 min for our server to bring our drinks, and another 15 before she came back for our order. Overall terrible service with a server who couldn't answer any questions about the food, we heard the next table from ours complain about the same thing to the manager, who then purposely avoided coming to our table (she rushed by and in passing asked if everything was ok. "Good? Good.")

And then the food - horrible for the price. We were expecting a great meal based on the descriptions and expense. I've never had such dry, tasteless pork. (Although my friends prime rib was not bad). Had the manager stopped by I would have sent my food back for the first time ever. As it was we were sick of waiting for the server to check on us and just wanted to get out of there. Went elsewhere for dessert because I was still hungry! Won't be going back, obviously.

Text: Failed to meet expectations. Good food, but not as good as the price would suggest. Morning omelette was overdone and served with dry ham chunks. Dinner was a tenderloin and smashed potatos. Far too much salt, on everything. Steak ordered medium rare, arrived med. well. Nice and juicy, tender and flavorful cut. Asked for Maker's bourbon in my drink, got Jack Daniel's. $30 for a fairly small serving of steak and potatoes-- and $6 extra to split it.

Text: Very nice little restaurant. It is pricey so keep that in mind if your planning on going. But the atmosphere and staff are nice, and the food is good.

Text: Excellent food and service. Tenderloin was cooked to perfection and the best I have ever had.

Text: Portion sizes are small. Potato wedges and spaghetti that we had was delicious but the hash browns reeked of some dressing that did not appeal to us. Desserts are amazing.
