Text: This is a hole-in-the-wall... just the way a good restaurant should be. 

Food was EXCELLENT. 

Service was a little slow, but I don't care. 

Can't wait to come back.

Text: I’ve always wanted to try this place and I was not disappointed. The restaurant itself was small and quaint and the service was excellent. Our waitress was very busy but still friendly and extreamly helpful with explaining dishes on the menu. I opted for trying the salmon rice ball, pickled plum rice ball, green tea, and stealing a piece of my boyfriends sea urchin sushi. The salmon was incredible, for how simple it was and the pickled plum tasted exactly the way it sounds, fruity with a sharp tangy tast from the pickling. I enjoyed it. The urchin was questionable but I don’t like briny foods so, that doesn’t really count. I also got a bottle of plum wine and it is delicious! I will definitely be coming back.
