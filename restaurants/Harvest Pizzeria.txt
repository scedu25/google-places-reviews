Text: Really enjoyed their pizza! The dessert is maybe even better, it's hard to say.. The space being limited is the only difficult part of the whole experience but I'll be back for sure.

Text: Great Pizza. Excellent salads. Good people. A great place to hangout and have good food. Their logo says "Local tastes better". True.

Text: What a place! Great staff and food. Good vegan and gluten-free support — today they had vegan chorizo and vegan fennel sausage… and so did I. Sunflower greens and plenty of other rather unusual toppings are available, too. Marvelous!

Text: Got the Meatball Pizza and was very impressed. Just walking into the restaurant and seeing the cooks make the food right behind the counter, you know that the food is going to be good. Very impressed with the service and obviously the food, that crust is amazing! They even have gluten free options which weren’t bad as well. Great place to eat if you are craving pizza!

Text: Great Salads, Great Gourmet Pizza. This is one of the best pizza's in Columbus, which isnt saying much but they have great non-traditional pizzas with fresh ingredients.  Very small venue so go early for lunch. Service is wonderful, with friendly staff.
