Text: Great place. Always go during happy hour for awesome prices. While their beer selection has dwindled away from my taste in recent years, it's still great. Their food is amazing also. Never had a bad experience in my 20+ times going here.

Text: Great place to enjoy an evening with friends. The beer is a pretty steep price, but considering that i go there to enjoy myself with friends occasionally I would absorb that cost, and not have much. Food is excellent! One of a kind fries and burgers they know what they are doing, and do it well. Thanks for being apart of Findlay.
