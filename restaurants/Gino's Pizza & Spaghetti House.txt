Text: We went to the ginos in danville wv tonight. The food was delicious. It was prepared exactly the way we ask. I was in crutches and they said sit and we will come to you and get your order. So attentive to our needs. We will be going back.

Text: Great food and friendly staff, but when it gets busy they are slow about cleaning the tables. But the food is well worth the wait for a clean table.

Text: My husband called to place an order & as soon as someone answered, they put him on hold. After 20 MINUTES, I called Tudors to have them to either hang up the phone or to take my husband's order. The girl in the background when told to pick up the phone was "omg!!" Then was rude as hell to my husband. He called corporate to complain. Worst service we have EVER received & all we wanted to do was order food!!
