Melanie's Kitchen Asian Cuisine
Rating: 5
Text: This is the best Asian food in Northwest Kansas. Just leave I-70 and mosey your way to downtown Quinter and you'll find Melanie's Kitchen on the West side of Main Street. All the food is homemade by Melanie and she does not use MSG in the food. Not only is the food fantastic, so is the atmosphere and service - friendly and clean place to eat! Enjoy a Wednesday or Friday date night or night out with the family at Melanie's Kitchen!
