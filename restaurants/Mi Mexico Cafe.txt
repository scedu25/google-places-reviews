Mi Mexico Cafe

Text: The staff are friendly and remember you and your orders when you come in frequently. The same owners and menu as Gran Rio, but while Gran Rio looks a little more fancy, I find that the food at Mi Mexico is superior. Fluffier rice, perfect salsa every time (ever time I go to Gran Rio I get a tomato sized chuck that didn't get grinded up). My favorite Mexican food joint in Hannibal!

Text: Good food and good service.  I had their yolandas, which was quite good. Staff was nice and they went out of their way to get milk for my son even though they were out.  I'd definitely go back again.

Text: WORST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!! The food was soggy and had a terrible taste. It was very rude that the short old ugly monkey who cleans the tables was criticizing every customer that walked in. He thought that I couldn't understand Spanish just because I look white. He cussed a lot in Spanish and had very poor customer service. The guy who criticized everyone is the oldest guy and has a flat top with some gray hair. Before he opens his mouth, he should look at himself in the mirror.  He stopped growing right after kindergarten, yet he still talks trash as if he was Mr Guatemala. If you're going to talk trash at least say it to them in English and don't be such a short coward.

Text: The manager here is very rude. Literally threw the check on the table before we were done eating. Drink refills but only if you flag them down. Good food, horrible service.
