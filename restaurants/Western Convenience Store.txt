Text: Some of the 1st signs that a truck stop is in trouble and failing are when the truck stop shuts down the restaurant and repair shop.
I won't be surprised if they close the doors for the gas station within the year.
On this morning the gas station did not even have any hot dogs on the roller grill, or even any type of warm breakfast sandwiches out for sale!
I didn't check the coffee pots but I'm willing to bet they weren't made either.
So sad, this was once a pretty decent place to stop.
Hopefully this place makes a quick turnaround and becomes great again.

Text: This location was bought out by another company. They have reopened the restraunt with Good Food and are working to restore the buisness. Maybe I will give them one more try.

Text: Dirty and un-kept. This place is filthy, picture of pump below, the washroom was just as filthy, in all honesty hint another gas station if you don't need feul to bad, the yard was roughly and filled with potholes. Staff were friendly but it cant make up for an unpleasant visit.
