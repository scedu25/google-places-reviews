Text: Service has improved a bit. Server was polite but still a bit unorganized. Great beer and food was good. I like their wings and the 402 burger was tasty. It would be perfect if the burger had some pink in the inside.

Previous:
Completely ignored. Stood there for 20 mins and no acknowledgement and kept taking of refills instead of balancing new orders and refills.

Text: We love this small, veteran owned business!  The Cardinal Pale Ale is top notch!  We always have great food and love sitting on the patio.  This business offers several specials different nights of the week.

Text: Good beer, but everything else sucks. Menu is boring, food preparation and presentation is awful. Service is poor, either understaffed or just terrible, snotty attitude.

Text: Great microbrewery & restaurant. While I'm biased towards Upstream Brewing, this place is giving Upstream a run for it's money. The beer & food quality is impressive. Sarpy County has itself an impressive microbrew gem.

Text: Service was good. Seems like the menu has changed since our last visit - fairly limited.
