Text: Great food and drink prices. Owners take a great deal of pride in their bar and it shows in the quality of food and service they provide.  Great place to take the family or go out drinking with friends. Highly recommend checking it out.

Text: I guarantee that this speck of Nebraska has the coldest bottled beer in the Midwest. A touch of ice in the first sip lets you know that it is seriously cold beer. Good food too. And remember this little town of Otoe has a history. Founded by German immigrants the town was named Berlin. The Third Reich, the war; people of Berlin chose to rename there nice town.
