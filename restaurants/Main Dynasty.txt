Text: I've been ordering from this place since 2013 and they have quick, thorough service. It's not a sit down spot though there's ample seating for it. By far the best take out Chinese in the area ?

Text: Good food but atmosphere is a bit dry...more of a "take-out" type restaurant.

Text: Very good Chinese - probably my favorite in the area. Wouldn't want to go anywhere else

Text: Excellent food at a reasonable price for the portion size. I have had several of their entrees and appetizers at different times and have never been disappointed. If they delivered, I would eat from here every week. SO much better than Panda or buffet places.
