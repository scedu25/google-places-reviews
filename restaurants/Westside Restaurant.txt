Text: Horrible service. Forgot my fries after she said they would be out. I finally told her after I ate my chicken fried steak that they could keep their fries. She didn’t even say anything. Then the other waitress brought my ticket and didn’t say a word. I went to pay and told them I didn’t get my fries. No discount, no I’m sorry, nothing! Just have a great night! Never again.

Text: The breakfasts? are very good, although the last few times we ate lunch / dinner it was nothing to be excited about. There is no "love" in preparation of the food, seems like they are just going through the motions.
A big help would be toasting the buns for burgers and sandwiches.
Coming from a family owned restaurant myself, I can see several easy fixes to kick it up a notch.
Wait staff seems very nice.

Text: We came in last night for dinner had hamburger steak and chicken sandwich.  Both were wonderful.   I especially loved the potato salad.  Came back for breakfast and it is just as good.   Hometown place with friendly service.

Text: Small town diner. It's been around for 30 years I think. I actually waited tables there for a short time as a teenager many, many moons ago. Their soup is phenomenal but every else is average at best. It's been through many different proprietor's, cooks and wait staff.

Text: I haven't eaten here for almost 15 years.  The food is still amazing and we had the best waitresses every. If you in O'Neill or passing through, stop in. It will be worth it.
