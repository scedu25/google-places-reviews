Text: The server chewed gum open mouthed the whole time we were there. When one person (party of 8) asked for a refill, the server didn't bother to check anyone else's, so we had to ask for refills individually. Never did get a refill on the chips. It took so long to deliver our meals the first person was done when the last plate arrived. I can say the sauces were excellent, but the ground beef, rice and refried beans were lacking flavor. It just doesn't compare to what I'm used to.
