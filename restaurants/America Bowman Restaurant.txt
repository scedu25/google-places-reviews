America Bowman Restaurant

Text: Overall good food (green beans are the exception). Priced reasonably with a selection of house brews to compliment. Also home to what was the World's Largest Ball of String. On the weekends, your dinner receipt doubles as your cover for O'Malley's where you'll find terrific live entertainment in the old brewing cellars.

Text: Probably one of the better restaurants in Weston but not worth the drive unless you have plans to go antique hunting or visiting other area businesses.

Text: Great Irish pub atmosphere and food. Group of 4 had Scotch eggs, Shepard's pie, bangers and mash and fish and chips. All washed down with local brew. That's a good lunch!

Text: Good Turkey sandwich.  The dining area is somewhat dark during the day.  This is rather cozy.  If you rather enjoy the sunlight they have a nice patio.
