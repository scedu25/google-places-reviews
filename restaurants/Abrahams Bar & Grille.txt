Text: Not good.  Place was empty and menus really limited.  I thought hubby n I were going on a nice date and there were only like 4 dinner options, which were very pricey.  Menu is more that of a diners than a nice restaurant.  Mudslide was icy rather than creamy.  Won't be back.

Text: I give 2 stars because the music was good...bartenders are rude but at the same time this is a locals bar which looks like everyone knows each other from high school. I ordered my drink which was $6 and the bartender said $8 to try and get a tip I said open a tab she ignored me for the rest of the night. That being said the other bartender was okay I asked for a double she said why don't I finish my drink first. My total came to $18 I gave a tip of  $22 cause everyone has to make a living then all of a sudden she was super nice.

Text: Stumbled across this place looking for a place to watch a Badger game coming back from St. Louis.  Excellent food and great service.  Unbelievable home made soups and the fish fry was great.  My daughter had a burger that was huge and fresh ground beef.  Son loved the chicken wings.  Very affordable and a very nice salad and soup bar.  We will definitely be stopping in again.  Unfortunately the Badgers didn't far well. :(
