Bowlarama Lanes
Rating: 5
Text: We really enjoyed these lanes. We went on an afternoon when not many leagues were practicing and had a great time with my extended family bowling. The lanes were clean and the computer scoring system worked well.

Text: I like bowling a couple of times a year and the Bowlarama meets my needs.  The place is clean and never crowded when we go during the week.  I do believe they have a heavy league night so that may be an issue.
