Text: The owner and other store staff are very friendly and well knowledgeable. They're very interested in teaching newcomers, and they offer discounts and specials for regulars. One of the best stores in town.

Text: The place was dirty looking, all the tables where dirty and there was flys flying around.  They microwaved my sub instead of toasting it and the meat tastes like it is lower quality than Subway, and im not a huge Subway fan.  Just ate here and I wish I went with my gut feeling and just left when I walked in.
