Text: May fit some people's likes.  Limited menu.  If you want reasonable quality wines on the menu go elsewhere.  Hamburger cooked as ordered.  Good onion rings, too.  House made chocolate cake was great.  Service was friendly and helpful.

Text: My Monday Night Football group has been coming in for over 25 years.  Great service, great food.  We are treated like kings.  Hamburgers are the best.  Wings cannot be beat!!!  Group goes away each week full and happy!

Text: Food was nothing special, could have gotten it from Schnucks freezer section. The "waitress" named Casey was very unprofessional, not friendly at all, couldn't get the order right and honestly dumb. Would never recommend her or this place to anyone.

Text: Food was good, has been better.  Don't know what changed.  Dining area was dirty.  Had to clean our chairs off before we sat down.

Text: The Jerk Wings are the best wings they have. Service is always friendly and fast even when busy. Beer is cold and they have a good liquor selection. Tuesday is $5 burger and frys night. They are great.
