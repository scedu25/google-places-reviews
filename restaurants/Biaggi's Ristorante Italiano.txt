Text: We had a great dinner with excellent service. Our reservation was in and our table ready upon arrival. We will dine here again soon. We travel 60 miles and it is definitely a worth while trip.

Text: The food was very good.   Our waiter was very prompt and helpful.   However after we entered the restaurant it took several minutes for the hostess to a knowledge us.   There were 3 groups and all of us were a bit put out about it.   There were many tables free.
