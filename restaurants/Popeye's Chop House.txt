Popeye's Chop House

Text: Best food experience in a long time!   Had to wait because it was our first  time here and did not know it's best to make a reservation, even on a Wednesday!  Still we were seated and  treated royally.  Everything was prepared well and tasted good.  Took one hour to drive but well worth it. (St.Louis' wealth of restaurants only ten minutes from our home.)

Text: A 2" thick fillet grilled to melt in your mouth perfection with crisp sauteed fresh green beans and squash. Combo ranch and poppy seed dressing (my request) on  a fresh salad, topped with crumbled blue cheese?.  Photo op black bear in the bar and fantastic wat staff. It's in the middle of nowhere and so worth the drive!

Text: The prices are way too high !  30 dollars for a new York strip steak is ridiculous and it's nothing special.  Tuckers is a bigger and more flavorful steak at a more reasonable price!!  We will be going there from now on.
