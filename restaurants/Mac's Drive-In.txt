Mac's Drive-In

Text: The Onion rings were great. The rest of my food was, well I shouldn't have paid for it. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was non-existent. When you go in for the first time do not go alone! Go with someone who has been before, or ordering your food may not be such a "fun" experience. Do not listen to the locals on what to get unless it is the main special. The pizza burger... Just get what you normally enjoy else where and judge for yourself. I won't be returning.

Text: The food was excellent and the unique way of ordering by telephone from your table and picking it up at the kitchen was great fun. The potato salad was exceptional!

Text: Always a must when we visit McCook!  This place is awesome!  A sign of a great burger joint is a full parking lot and people waiting for a seat just to eat a hamburger.  People that give Mac's less than a 5 star rating may just be having a bad day.  Never disappointed in my 30 years of eating here.

Text: The chicken sandwich was delicious. The people were very friendly. Prices were fair and after receiving the food I felt value was definitely awesome. I'll be going back.
