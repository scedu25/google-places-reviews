Big A's On the Riverfront
Rating: 5
Text: Five stars for being just what we expect a good burger bar to be (don't expect fine dining).  Lots of deep fried favorites,  good wings at a fair price,  and burgers cooked the way we asked plus the option for either an 8oz or 4oz burger and lots of other menu options.  Plenty of drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers Mon-Fri during happy hour.  Big plus that it is non-smoking before 9pm, especially for a place at the north end of the St. Charles Historic District.  Was a little disappointed that a pint of Guinness was $5.75,  but outweighed by all the plusses. We'll be back many times,  no doubt.

Text: Big A's wings are AMAZING. The Memphis dry rub is seriously so delicious you have to try it. The prices are totally reasonable and there's quite a bit on the menu to choose from, it's mostly pub fare. They have pretty cheap drink specials each day too which is a plus. The place is kind of narrow, the tables near the back feel a little "hallway"-ish but that doesn't stop me from coming often. The staff are always very inviting and make you feel at home. Try anything on the menu with the "A" next to it and you won't be disappointed!
