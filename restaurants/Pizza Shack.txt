Text: Wonderful experience. Sign says "we make memories". My (almost 15 year old) asked for an extra large memory. The owner came out and made him a balloon animal Lol. Very personable staff.  Food is excellent. Atmosphere is one of a kind. Would recommend anyone passing through this area to stop. You won't be disappointed. Well worth passing by the franchise pizza place.

Text: Food was good so was the service. It had mini puzzles and trivia to do while you wait for food. The bathrooms were a bit crowded, and the wood seat had stuff carved into it but other than that, awesome!

Text: Great thin crust pizza.  We enjoyed the trivia cards at the tables while waiting on the pizza.  We plan to stop in again.
