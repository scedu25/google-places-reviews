Texas Roadhouse
Rating: 5
Text: Even though it is a chain, I always enjoy Texas Roadhouse. It is always busy, and a bit noisy, but the food is really excellent. Management at this location has it going on. When I did call ahead seating, the hostess on the phone was very pleasant and thorough. Our server was outstanding and also very pleasant and knowledgeable. It was nice to see the manager stopped by the table to check on our meal.

Text: A couple of my coworkers and I visited this new location a few days after it opened, and the place was packed. However, the wait ended up being shorter than stated, the food was excellent, and the service was wonderful. It would have been understandable if our waitress had been a bit harried and/or short, but she took the time to make sure our orders were right and remained friendly the entire time. Since this location is just down the road from work, I have no doubt we'll be visiting on a regular basis.

Text: Steaks are always cooked to order, staff has always been nice, and the prices aren't too bad. Sometimes the cuts aren't the best, but that isn't the fault of the location or the staff here. Great place to go if you don't want to spend a ton.

Text: Great food, modest prices. The only reason I held back from giving 5 stars is because our waitress could have been a little bit nicer/friendlier.
