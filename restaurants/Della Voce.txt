Text: As a restaurant manager of over 10 years, I understand completely the ups and downs of the business. Our waitress was polite and her service was phenomenal, however from the moment we walked through the door, our experience was not good. With three tables full (on a Friday night - plenty of open seating) the bartender said in a snotty tone that he recommended we have a reservation.  The food we ordered was over priced and over cooked and the Manhattan had so much bitters in it that it was undrinkable. We will not be back. I love the idea of freshly cooked good food, however if you are going to charge $25 for a plate of food, you'd better be on your game. Especially on a Friday night.

Text: Five stars because the food is amazing, customer service is (usually) right up there. I didn't have a good experience this morning; a lot of items were unavailable and the bartop was closed for the bloody Mary bar and I would not have gone in had I known that, so it's a bit of a combination of busy morning and expectation management on my part.
