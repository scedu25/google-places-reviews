Text: In general I noticed the food lacked flavor and we had to constantly add salt to it, but it was good (not excellent). For the quality I got I think it is a bit pricey, but it they fixed the flavor issue then the price would make sense.

Regarding the dishes.... The calamari and short rib were fantastic and are highly recommended

Text: Went in on a Saturday for lunch, not crowded at all. Service was a bit slow for how empty the place was, but the phenomenal food made up for it. We had a grilled chicken Cesar and the eggplant parmesan. The salad was very good but the eggplant was to die for. It was thin, crispy, and covered in their delicious homemade sauce. I would highly recommend!

Text: This is one of the best places in Ann Arbor!...and underrated!  It's a nice Italian place with great food and good prices.  We have definitely paid more for worse, less satisfying meals in A2.  

Max was a great server!! The manager, James, came over and asked us how our meal and experience was.  

I really appreciated the attention to detail and the attentiveness to the customer.  We will definitely be back!!  Great job!

Text: My wife and I go to Gratzi as least 2 or 3 times a year. Great atmosphere and food is off the hook. We get the chicken Marsala. It is to die for. I think the first time we went there was about 25 years ago and we plan to go back many more years. Love this place.
