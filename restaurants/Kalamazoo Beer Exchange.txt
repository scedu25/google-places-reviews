Kalamazoo Beer Exchange

Text: A great place to sample several craft brews (5 oz samplers on up) and enjoy better than average bar food. Love the pear, goat cheese, walnut salad. 

There are a few homeless panhandlers around, but they are polite and won't bother you much except for spare change. 

Note that if you can't walk up a flight of stairs or down one (bathrooms are in the basement) the handicapped elevator is a pain. Pool tables, old-fashioned pinball. A neat place architecturally. Free parking in visitors lot.

Text: Had a lot of fun! It is definitely a unique and exciting concept where the prices rise and fall. It's great being able to try out an expensive beer for a significantly reduced cost.

My only quarrel is the service gets a little slow at the beginning of the market. Sometimes you can miss out on great deals because the server is not able to make to you.

Text: I was pretty blown away. Food was on point, beer prices were fair and even better during happy hour. Waistress/bartender Logan did an amazing job and she was very personable. Theme and style of the place was very unique and the beer stock market made trying new things both a fun and money friendly adventure.

Text: Good bar with a great concept. Lots of fun trying to"play the market" on beer. Servers were very nice and has a good atmosphere. Also had a complete separate dining area if you don't like crowds.

Text: Great food. Great beer selection. Excellent service. Fun atmosphere. Came at lunch so didn’t experience the exchange part, but definitely will return next time in Kzoo.
