Text: If there was an option for zero stars, I would definitely give this grill one fresh zero. I can't really talk on the food, seeing that it never came. The parking is very akward. There are only five spots in front the establishment coming of main strip. Now let's get to the service. When our party walk into the establishment, we were not met with any hostess or greeting of any kind. We sat down confused and our waitress for the short time that we were there for,  was completely rude. She was curt and impatient.when we cancelled our order she tried to argue with the manager to make us pay for food that we didn't eat. Overall a terrible experience.

Text: Bartender didn't know any standard mixed drinks.  Prices are high here too. It's good for the quick beer in summer for brew week, that's about it

Text: Honestly, as an alumni going to an "alumni grill" I expected much better customer service. Hell if the college ran the bar it would be better. Giving 2 because I know the potential is there. Food was below par  and customer service was poor.

Text: Was empty the night I walked through with minimal customers. But understandable when they required ID to enter when everyone in the group was over forty years old. Pretty sad that they were empty on a Saturday Night when other places were packed and doing brisk Buisness.
