Text: What a charming place to stop for a delicious home cooked meal!  The restaurant is in a cute little house .  On the porch as you enter are flower pots with pansies and a row of miniature rose bushes across the front.  We had fried chicken with mashed potatoes - a very generous serving - vegetable, roll and salad.  Dessert was lemony and delicious!  And we enjoyed a visit about our home town, Newman Grove, with Shirley who graduated from there 79 years ago!  It was great!
