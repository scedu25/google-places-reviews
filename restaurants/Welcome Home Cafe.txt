Text: Very sweet staff. Home/granny style cooking. Almost everything seem like a fair price, some of the entrees were a little higher but they have a wide variety of choices. Salad bar was fresh even though they weren't too busy. And a bonus fresh chocolate chip cookie at the end!

Text: You definitely get your foods worth. Quantity and quality. A little more expensive but you get your food worth and taste really good. Worth it's price. Recommend if you have a little extra money to spend.

Text: Great experience. Hospitable and friendly service, and good food. The fries are amazing, and we were surprised with free chocolate chip cookies at the end. Very happy we decided to try a local place instead of going to a chain.

Text: Fast and friendly service with great home style meals. Stopped here on my way to Denver and on my way back. Great place for a quick bite when you've been on the road all day.
