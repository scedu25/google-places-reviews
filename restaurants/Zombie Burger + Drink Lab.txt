Zombie Burger + Drink Lab

Text: If you like fried greasy food this is the place for you. I can feel my arteries clogging every time I go here! They have some really interesting burger options and a fun atmosphere (zombie themed). I LOVE their cereal and cake shakes. Warning: they are extremely rich and filling! I can't finish a small burger and a small shake there. A little more pricey than your average burger joint. I enjoy the Undead Elvis! If you're brave, maybe you will too!

Text: This place is amazing. Great decor and atmosphere, delicious food, and yummy shakes. We’ve been here twice and it’s now a tradition every time we drive across the country. We usually sit at the bar and the service has been great. We’ve had nachos, fries, burgers, a salad, several shakes and everything was fantastic.

Text: My wife and, I ate here for the first time, since it opened. And it reminded me of the good old fashioned hamburgers I use to get at the diner in my small town. If you grew up eating at those small town diners . You'll definitely love this place. Fries were great too. Excellent staff and servers. I recommend this place to all. From in town and out of town.

Text: Great food.  Delicious shakes.  Fabulously themed decor.  Friendly and enthusiastic staff.  My girlfriend and I love this place.  We make a point to pass through Iowa everytime we cross the country just to come here.

Text: Certainly unique and special to Iowa! I think the East Village location coupled with the unique restaurant atmosphere/theme makes it most enjoyable in the summer and fall when you can sit outside. I also think the separation of services is a great idea too. You can either choose to dine-in and have someone wait on you or order your food at a different counter for faster service and dine in that way. Very conscious of customers time. 

The food is okay though, in that the specialty burgers are too overwhelming in flavor so I always only get the "Zombie Burger" which is just a basic burger that I could get anywhere (minus the zombie burger sauce). The names are clever though and always makes me laugh. 
Zombie Burger is not exactly the best place to go if you're health conscious and want less greasy food...Never tried their salads though. The shakes are over-rated, in my opinion. Too expensive for a small cup of basic ice cream shake topped with cereal. That being said, I never consciously make the decision to eat there...only when my friends and family want to.
