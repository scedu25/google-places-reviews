Text: Great experience! We went during lunch time. There is a guarantee that the food will be ready in 20 minutes or your food is free. We were like yea right but the food was out on time. Not only was the food worthy of a picture but it was delicious. Our party of four were all very happy with the food. And to top it off our waitress was great. Once we were done she said are you ready for dessert. We thought we had to buy something but every meal comes with a cookie. It was s chocolate chip cookie that was the best we ever tasted. So the next time we are in Kansas we will be sure to stop by Houlihan's again!  Thank you!

Text: Good service. Good food. Good portions. A little pricey for what you get. Good for family dining or groups. Definitely worth the trip and would recommend.

Text: I really appreciate their gluten free options, especially the burger buns.  The service is usually great (every place had turnover).  Food is always prepared well.  Locally owned franchise and the owners are super nice people.
