Text: Most Hoosiers are familiar with a breaded pork tenderloin. To those who aren't,  please let me explain. The cook takes a portion of the pork loin and hammers it flat to tenderize the meat. To thick, it will be about as tender as beef jerky. The cook then breads the loin either in a mix of flour and spices or dips it in a batter solution. The loin is then fried to a golden brown and served on a bun. A good loin is usually about twice the size as the bun. 

The CB makes one of the best breaded tenderloins I've ever had. 

It is worth a stop if your travelling. They also have a family side so the kids may come as well.

Text: Historic bar with a great selection of their own beers  (try the Diesel Oil Stout!) as well as many rotating guest brews on tap, including nitro taps.  Great comfort food and bar snacks, many with a German influence.  Family seating available.

Text: Nice selection of local craft beers featuring their own label, Powerhouse.  BTW Powerhouse is Indiana's oldest brewery.  Friendly wait staff.  Very much a blue collar pub.
