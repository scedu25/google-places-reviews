Text: Got the Dinner for 2 with a huge sirloin steak for under 35 bucks!! The steak was WOW AMAZING!! No A1 sauce needed for this delicious and juicy steak!! Gets an A+ from us. Will definitely be making a trip back here. Great service also!!

Text: It was a middle of the spectrum dining experience. Definitely not worth the prices on the menu. That being said. The establishment was clean. So, 1 star for that; the staff was polite...theres the 2nd star; finally my steak was cooked perfectly, though lacking somewhat in the flavor department...and my son's burgers were huge and tasty from what I gathered...that's what got this restaurant the 3rd star. Overall, it was a disappointment for what I paid. But, if you are looking for a good (but pricey) burger this is the place to go it seems. P.S. The salad bar is Not worth the extra money!

Text: This place was recommended by a local person.  The service was very good.  The salad bar was basic, but high quality.  The steak was juicy and very good.  It was not the best flavor I have had, but was cooked correctly and served piping hot.  The baked potato was top notch.  The only knock was that the steak was not as flavorful as I have had in other places.   It was a good value for the money and I recommend it to anyone.  The deer on the wall was spectacular....
