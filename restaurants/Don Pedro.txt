Text: Never been to Effingham. Came here for work. Had a terrible experience at another place so I left and came here. My waitress was AMAZING! Had the cooks surprise me with a meal and I was very pleased! If my journey brings me back to his town, I will eat here again for sure!

If you are in Effingham and looking for a good Mexican restaurant go to Don Pedro. The food here is authentic and you can eat with confidence.

Text: Don Pedro's is Authentic Mexican food. Best Homemade Tamales in Corn Husks. Lilly and her Staff are awesome! You can eat other Mexican, but if you want the best come here!

Text: We enjoyed our dinner @ Don Pedro veru much. The food was superb. Flavors were exquisite.  Not all the items ordered tasted the same which is sometimes the case @ ethnic restaurants. We arrived early so we had great service. We observed the staff arriving before the crowd & liked that they were well staffed. The dining room filled up fast before we left. Our first experience was wonderful.

Text: I ordered a simple dish: Grilled Chicken, Rice & Beans, With Avocado, and No Cheese.  Well, I got cheese (which I'll eat but hate because it's melted into my beans) and I didn't get avocado (which is the only reason I ever order Mexican).  This is a two star deduction.  

The chicken itself was not a whole breast but strips that were not grilled.  This is a one star deduction.  

When I called to inform them of the various mistakes, they did not offer me a partial refund or to deliver the right meal (or even the avocado). This is a one star deduction.  

Why did they end up with two stars? Because the raw jalapeño were truly fresh and crunchy and, most importantly, SPICY!
