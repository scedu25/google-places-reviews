Text: Very solid food was happy with the sandwich and fries I ordered. There sandwich selection made it hard to pick! Wasn't crazy about some of the beers I tried on the sampler, but that's to be expected at any brewery. The restaurant and bar area had cool historic decor. Would definitely try this place another time and get some more brews!

Text: Let me tell you what I got a blue cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had hands down. Excellent top of the line beer. It is always a delight to go to any one of these inside of the Oliver House.

Irma was our server. She is wonderful! I loved conversing with her! So sad to hear she's leaving! 
Wonderful experience overall!!

Text: The beer was fantastic.  Great selection.  Finally a brewery that wasn't hop heavy on every beer!  We'll done... The reason for the 4 stars.  Food was decent, had a burger and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but decent.  Service was okay, slow on the refills.  Quality of food (presentation, and quality) need a bit of help.  Would go again, but for beer and appetizers only.
