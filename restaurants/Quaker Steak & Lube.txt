Quaker Steak & Lube
Rating: 5
Text: The food here is great.  I had a burger, my wife got the ribs, and my boys got chicken wings, and everything was very well done.  The Lube Chips were wonderful as well.  The staff here was very inviting and fun.  This was a very cool experience getting to see all the race cars and bikes all over the restaurant and getting to look at all the pictures.  A very fun place for dinner.

Text: This place is amazing. Hands down the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!! This is coming from someone who has definitely eaten their fair share of burgers. The staff are friendly and are always making sure you're taken care of. The manager is awesome and very friendly. It's great to see employees who take pride in their work. This place is as amazing as it is unique!

Text: This place is great!! The food was delicious, and the servers were great! They were friendly, fast, and helpful with food recommendations. Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars, is the hostess. She was rude and unfriendly when we walked in, literally threw our menus on the table, and stalked off without a word. If it wasn't for her, this would have been a perfect dining experience.

Text: Excellent service, wonderful atmosphere and great wings. We came here all the way from Atlanta to try the "Triple Atomic Challenge". Wings are hot but manageable. Absolutely a must try for hot wing lovers.

Text: I love the decorations here. The car and motorcycle memorabilia adds a lot of character. The staff is all right, and the food is decent. You may get a little distracted from the dinner table conversation if you're a big fan of old style cars.
