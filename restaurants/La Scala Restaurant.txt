La Scala Restaurant

Text: LaScala was an amazing venue to have our wedding. I absolutely LOVED the space, food, and all of the assistance they provided with decor, etc. 
Our wedding was perfect and the price was on-point.  There are no hidden fees or costs which was appreciated. 
Not only did we have our reception there, but we were also married in the venue. I'll add some pictures, if possible. Absolutely unforgettable!

Text: I am not sure what they are thinking.. the pasta is always overcooked.. the sause tastes like ketchup, meatballs are gross.. this isn't italian food.. I wish I could bring my home made sauce in and have them taste it.. It's a great atmosphere and maybe good for a glass of wine.. but that's about it..
