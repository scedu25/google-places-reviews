Text: A deli that's attached to a butcher shop. How could this not be delicious? They made a very solid pastrami and sauerkraut on rye. One of our friends like it enough that he went back for a second sandwich. If you're in the bustling metropolis of Iola, eat here.

Text: Best place in 100 miles to get fresh meat. We drive 3 hours to stock up from there.
