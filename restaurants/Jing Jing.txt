Text: Very friendly and polite staff.  Food is pretty good, egg rolls and crab ragoon were nothing special or that great.  Pretty decent options on Buffett.  Quiet music in the background made for a relaxing lunch break.

Text: Stopped eating there because I kept getting sick and the food was always stale and cold. The service has gotten worse. Not worth it, go to Ching Dow.
