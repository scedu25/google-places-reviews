Text: Best pizza in town. Lots of toppings, not greasy, made to order, and prices are right in line with chain stuff. Ryan takes great care of you.

Text: Ryan (the owner) and his entire staff are the friendliest around! You will enjoy their entire menu ad nothing is pre-cooked but is all made to order.

Pizza King on Poplar Street is my favorite of all time. The pizza is fresh, hot and delicious!

Text: Pants down the best pizza in town. The owner is a really nice guy and makes perfectly delicious pizza in a quaint little pizza joint. I eat here once or twice a week. I would die without it.
