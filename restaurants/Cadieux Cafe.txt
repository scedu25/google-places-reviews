Text: The feather bowling was a blast and everyone had a great time.  We stayed for dinner and food was very good, especially the muscles.  Would highly recommend the Cadieux Cafe for a group outing.

Text: You'll never go to another place like it. I recommend Wednesday night karaoke. You never know what the crowd is going to be like bit you will always know Tom (the karaoke host) will show you an epic time.
