Text: I recently had Pit to Plate Barbeque cater my wedding and they did a fantastic job! The food was delicious and we got many compliments on it. People really liked the food truck idea and the service was great. Thanks for doing such a great job and helping the day go so smoothly.

Text: Some of the best southern barbecue and sides anywhere. Friendly staff. Beer list meh. Prices on the high side. Decor needs a refresh with comfort in mind. As of October 7, 2017 the restaurant has closed. They continue to cater and their food truck can still be found around town.

Text: Awesome little nugget in the middle of Mt.Healthy. Great sauces, great food, good service for a Saturday night! I devoured the Pulled chicken sandwich with mac, chips, and corn. With an ice cold coke to wash it down. A must visit!

Text: Delicious! Tender flavorful great service did I say how great the food was?? The sauces all made there are full bodied. Even though you really don't need the sauce the meet was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend Pit to Plate for lunch or dinner. Check the catering menu too the bring the party to you.

Text: Good, not great, local BBQ establishment.  They have a small dining area which makes this place better for takeout in my opinion. They have a bar and karaoke on some nights. Could be a good place for a smallish gathering of friends.
