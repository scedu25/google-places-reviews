Text: Nicest couple that own the place. Would stop there on my way to Tulsa and enjoyed talking to them as much as eating the good food. It's a four and a half hour drive from Lincoln, NE and I seriously have thought of making a day trip just for a Beef Burger and good conversation. If its open and you're in the area you must stop in...won't leave without a full belly and smile on your face.
