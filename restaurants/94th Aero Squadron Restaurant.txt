Text: We went for the Sunday brunch. The service was good and our waiter was attentive. The food selection was good as well. The ambiance and decor is really cool. The place gives off a feeling as if you were at a quaint bed and breakfast.

Text: The view and atmosphere are awesome.  Their brunch buffet is, ok.  The food is made well, but its very boring.  Its safe, but for the money, I'd look at other options.  Maybe their dinner is better.

Text: Great staff and food. Prime rib unbeatable. Wish they would raise their prices a $1 per entree and use the money to clean the dining area carpet. Ruins the dining experience.

Text: It is a bit overpriced for what you get, but the food was excellent. Had a Groupon and that was my motivation to go. Bathroom was disgusting, but the theming of the bar was nice.
