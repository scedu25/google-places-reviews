Text: Had the most wonderful lunch at the Gandy Dancer. The food was so beautiful and delicious from the appetizers to the desserts and to dine in such a gorgeous building just completes your meal. The food is a bit pricey but you won't regret paying for such an awesome lunch or dinner.  The wait staff is so accommodating and wonderful, they make your experience so much more. The bathrooms were very clean. You will not regret choosing this wonderful restaurant.

Text: Brunch is a REALLY good deal, in my opinion. Come hungry because the All-you-can-eat spread is impressive. Location and ambiance are very cool as well. I need to check out lunch and dinner.

Text: Our food was not prepared properly and we had to send it back. They brought us out new a dish, but it took an hour and half to be served after ordering. They didn’t offer to bring us a drink, or anything to make it right. Food was very good though.
