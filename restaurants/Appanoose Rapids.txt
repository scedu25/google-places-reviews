Text: Inauspicious downtown location, but the food is worth it.  Varied menu for rural Southeast Iowa.  Two of my favorites are crab cakes and French onion soup.  Presentation was very nice as well.
The beer menu is full of local choices and fun to explore.  The menu is smallish but pleasantly solid.
Sunday and holiday brunches are quite good.
Waitservice is friendly and accommodating.
The location is a step back in time.  The big original bar is lovely and the very oversized brightly colored ads hung on the walls are a lot of fun.
Definitely check it out!

Text: My wife and I were in town overnight and went here for dinner. It was a Thursday evening and wasn't too busy. Service was outstanding. 

The food was excellent. We shared the catfish dinner with mashed potatoes and ordered an additional side salad. Portion size was very generous and the above order was just right for the two of us. We would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone!

Text: This was my third time eating here. Each time the flavors have been delightful and different. It's refreshing to find a place that skillfully prepares dishes that are not the typical American food that saturates many restaurant menus in the area.

Text: Good service.  Neat building. If the food didn't come from a can or frozen bag, I would be surprised. It tasted like canned Alfredo sauce, canned French onion soup, and frozen vegetables. Edible, not enjoyable.

Text: Had fabulous late lunch of Thai peanut chicken salad. The only thing I'd omit are the crunchy noodles.  My partner had a tuna special which he loved.  A great spot, excellent decor & service.
