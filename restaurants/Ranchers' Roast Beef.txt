Ranchers' Roast Beef
Rating: 5
Text: We came in and had an excellent meal. At the time, the restaurant was transitioning from the Rax Roast Beef brand, but had expanded their menu significantly. I recommend them to anyone looking for somewhere in the area to stop and eat. We will be back when we're in the area.

Text: Unfriendly service here. The kids who take your order could at least pretend they are happy to take your order. A girl from the back came out said "would you stop that, its loud back there!" (I was absently mindedly tapping my knuckles on the counter). She wasn't polite about it. The food is average.
