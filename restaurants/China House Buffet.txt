China House Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: Always enjoy my meal here, have a good selection of foods on the buffet and even better items off the menu. Friendly staff and good prices. I was sorry to see they quit serving beer but I understand it wasn't what most people were there for.

Text: Not very impressed. Bathroom disgusting and food not very good. My wife liked it but I didn't. To each their own opinion.

Text: The filthiest, dirtiest, unclean and unsanitary place ever, and a little bit run down. You don't know what you're eating cause everything tastes yuck.
