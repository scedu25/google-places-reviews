Text: Had a great pie "High Plains Drifter". Creamy garlic based spicey pep pep supreme-ish. Fella named Clopz007 makes the best za. 
Fast deliveries, especially the guy with NY Yankees hat cruising in that hot rod Toyota!

Text: I get the pizza often on order up and they have great deals. If you want something good for one person go with the appetizer quesadilla where you can choose 3 free toppings.  However, DO NOT GET THE SUBS! At least not the Phat Philly. Mine was more like a panini it was so thin and they put NO CHEESE on it even though it says it comes with cheese ( also, duh, come on its a Philly). I will still order from there because it's cheap, but pizza is their forte for sure.

Text: 9 points for originality alone. Like 3 of their pizzas of chicken tenders on them. I mean come on. Always had great and reliable service with them. Their dessert sticks are AMAZING!

Text: To be honest, pretty not great pizza. But hey, it's cheap. The salad is actually pretty good in that they give you a lot of vegys beside the cheap lettuce. I'll probably just get Domino's next time but I don't think it should get the harsh criticism it has gotten.
