Text: Had a wonderful time here on a business trip. Andrea at the bar took very good care of me and was extremely professional.   She is a great server and even better bartender. I highly recommend!!

Text: Been there several times on the way to Iowa or Nebraska.  The food is good and affordable.  The service is usually good.  It was marginal on  our last visit.  The waitress seemed non existent.  We ended up spending too much time there due to the server and getting to our destination late.  That was frustrating.  If they can keep a decent wait staff, it should be a good place to continue to go.  The food is there.

Text: Great service and the food was amazing! I ordered the deep fried cheese for an appetizer, and the chicken pot pie for my meal. The broccoli cheddar casserole for my side was DELICIOUS! I already want to go back.

Text: Cheddar's is a high-quality and affordable choice- one of the best casual dining restaurants in St. Joe despite being a chain.
