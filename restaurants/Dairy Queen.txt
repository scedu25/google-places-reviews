Text: Today my friend and I drove six hours to Atchison kansas to watch the solar eclipse. We stopped at this dairy queens to eat lunch. My first impression was that the establishment was very clean and neat, especially with all the business they had  at the time. There were only two people in line ahead of my friend and I so we were in no hurry, but another cashier came up to the counter quickly and opened another register to help with the line. The cashier that took our order was very kind and sweet and rang up the order perfectly. We got our food very quickly and i was amazed we didn't have to wait long because like i had said before they were very busy. All of this was great service and deserving of a good review in itself but what really surprised me was when I heard their manager George, saying encouraging words to the entire  team, he was saying things like "great job guys, lets keep up the great work!" not just once but i heard him say things like this several times during our visit at the restaurant. That is an AMAZING manager, I am very impressed with the entire service of our visit and if i ever go through Atchison kansas again I will not hesitate to stop and eat here!!!

Text: I have gone here several times as I go to College at Benedictine just down the street, and so far I have no complaints.  The food is good (especially the ice cream and shakes) and in general they are prompt.  Would recommend over just the standard McDonald's type of meal.
