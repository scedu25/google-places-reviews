Text: This WAS always our go to, consistent, 5 star....something changed in 2017.   3 tries and consistently: limited to no flavor even when asking for extra spice,  greasy rice, sparse vegetables, overcooked chicken and seafood.  Disappointed and off our list .

Text: Being it difficult to leave the store at times, it's great that we can order out food online. They are always on time and the food is always good!
