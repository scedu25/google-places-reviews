Text: I love Roscoe's.  Good variety of items at reasonable prices. Tried all the variety of taco fillings and was pleased with all of them. The sauces are made to please with heat levels from mild to a good spice. Definitely my go to taco place now.

Text: Roscoe's has some of the best burritos around and I love the vibe and the location. And, I can eat vegan here!

Update: here for dinner tonight. Glad to see Roscoe, himself, greeting guests and keeping an eye on his business. Thanks for being awesome, Roscoe!

Text: It's been over 15 years since I last ate here and it's still as good as I remember it. Best hidden taco stand you can find.

Text: I always like Roscoe's. Doesn't matter which location. Nachos are great! Workers are friendly. Also, always a great music selection playing. A+

Text: The good here is nothing special. I don't understand the hype. It's expensive for normal, horrible tex-Mex food. I just don't get it.
