Text: We LOVE it! We were celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday & the waitresses made it so special. The salads are like none other & the pizza is fantastic too! We have been enjoying the food & family atmosphere here for more than 20 years. Our out-of-town friends & relatives look forward to a meal here when they are visiting.
