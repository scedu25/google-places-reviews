Text: I was looking for an upscale restaurant on the waterfront to take my wife. Drove from Port Clinton all along the lake and was told to got Cheesy Frankies in Vermilion. We finally stumbled upon your place. What a wonderful experience. You were gracious enough to seat us outside, It was beautiful. The food was fabulous. Love the lobster bisque. Hope to be back soon.

Text: We can't say enough about this restaurant.  The staff (including the owner) were extremely hospitable.  The food was the best food we have ever eaten in our lives.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting.  We appreciate the dress code because it provides for more of an upscale experience.

Text: Everything is top notch there; the ambiance, the service, the view, the choice... The best is the food of course and the selection of wine. Just be ready for a bill that aligned with such high end experience. Too bad it's a little far away for us otherwise we will be there more often ... but in the other end it's good for my wallet!!

Text: Everything about this place is amazing! Our waitress had to be one of the best waitresses I've ever had. My family and I loved every second. I got a vegetarian platter that was as delicious as it was beautiful.

Text: You wouldn't think there would be fun French food in Vermillion, but I was impressed. An excellent wine list, mind-reading servers, dockside location, it has the whole package. There's no tasting menu per se, but you can assemble one from the appetizers (including the specials, which are truly special, if sometimes pricey). Apparently there are three establishments at this site, we ate on the patio which was perfect for a temperate summer day (though bathroom accessibility could be a problem if stairs are out). The indoor restaurant requires a jacket for gentlemen (and no shorts for ladies) but there are other options if you don't feel like dressing up. We were there for three hours, closed the place down but never felt rushed for a minute. That's professionalism!
