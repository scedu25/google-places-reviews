Text: The only reason we gave four is because of atmosphere--just not a "bar" kind of girl. BUT food was great, service was friendly and yes it was worth the trip. If I lived here I would definitely be a regular!

Text: Horrible customer service (or lack thereof). But the food was amazing which made up for it..I'll order carryout next time, they don't have a kitchen so the whole place gets smoky and it's overwhelming.If you go here get the fried pickles! Best I've ever had. I'd like to go one night to check out how their bar service is, they had a few arcade games and some pool tables so it might be a fun bar. I took my kids for lunch today so I didn't try any drinks this time
