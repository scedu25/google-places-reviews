St. Charles Place Steak House and Banquets
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I have lived in St Charles for 5 years and FINALLY made it to St Charles Place. Honestly, I set my expectations low and was expecting a mediocre dining experience. 
But we LOVED it!  The dining area has a unique and charming ambiance.. vintage meets old school meets cozy. We were lucky enough to land a table near the fireplace. 
Our meals were delicious and prepared very well. Very tender and juicy filet ?  
Our server was busy with several tables (including ours, typical Saturday night) but he was very friendly and upbeat. 
The owner made his way to our table and thanked us for coming in and engaged in a brief conversation with us. 
We felt like appreciated customers and overall, we absolutely recommend St Charles Place! We will certainly be back!

Text: Relaxed atmosphere. Service was top notch. Food was delicious. Had to wait on Friday night for main dining area so we chose to eat in the bar. Good Decision.

Text: The decor is so outdated that this can't be considered upscale. It does offer good food but it just seem pricey given the overall setting. Steaks, wine and appetizers will keep you coming back but you will also wonder if your great-grandfather's dandruff and shed skin from his visit at opening night still live in the carpet. Not to fear, though, service is still good and the overall experience will make it worth it. Give it a shot.
