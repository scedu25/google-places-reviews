Text: Our waitress was awesome. We never had to ask for refills on drinks. Emptied a glass and she was right there with a fresh Coke. Food tasted great.

Text: Potato skins were cold. Waitress forgot to put in order. Overall visit was hour and a half. Food wasn't worth bragging about. Won't be back.

Text: Smoking section is intrusive and disgusting even when seated in some parts of the non-smoking section. The "mex" entrees ordered weren't good.

Text: Food is hit or miss, service is usually pretty good. Ask for Mac on the weekends. Smoke is the big drawback as this location features an open smoking section.

Text: Staff is always friendly. Food is always very good. Weekend evenings and Sunday lunch crowds are often large but wait times are normally acceptable.
