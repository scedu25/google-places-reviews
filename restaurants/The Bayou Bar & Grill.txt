Text: 8 dollars for a bowl of gumbo that was to much broth not a lot of ingredients. Potato skins terrible bill was 15.73. Don't drive that for food and atmosphere sucks.

Text: This is my families go-to when we want gater tail and a steak that you can cut with a spoon.  The dipping sauce for the gater is phenomenal as well as their fried catfish and crawfish.
