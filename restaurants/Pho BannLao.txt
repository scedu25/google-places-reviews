Pho BannLao

Text: What a pleasant surprise! Driving to Kansas City, found it on the map, and decided to try it out, based on average Google reviews. We are from SE Asia and are pretty picky about good food. Well, Pho Bannlao does not adjust their flavors for the midwestern palate. We had Thai items from the menu, and they're excellent. The mango sticky rice dessert is fabulous! The owners come from Laos, and a lot of the decorations (wood panels, etc.) are from Laos, and absolutely gorgeous. Good value too!  Don't miss it!

Photos are steamed dumplings & spring rolls.

Text: The papaya salad was sweet and spicy and salty. Great app to share. We had tom yum soup and pad khieng. Very good!  Service was great.
