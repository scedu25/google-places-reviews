Big Ed's BBQ

Text: The brisket was really good. The service could not have been worse.  Walked in, no one said a word. There was one couple in the restaurant and me.  I asked if I should just take a seat. The waitress said “The menus are on the tables”.  I think that’s what she said, she was looking the other direction. I asked for ice tea with lemon.  The waitress said “No lemons” and just stood there with her pencil on the pad while I looked over the menu. Very uncomfortable.  The tea was a bottle of Pure Leaf.  The side of beans was unsatisfactory.  Too bad, because the meat was as good as any brisket I have had.

Text: This guy knows his barbeque. The flavors aren't nuanced, the meats are cooked just right and fall off the bones (when there are bones), and the sides are equally tasty.

The restaurant is simple and clean with quaint decorations.

The owner is a fun man who treats you well once you show that you are enjoying yourself and his labors. The service was prompt and friendly.

Text: Even though there weren't many other people here when we visited this place seemed very laid back and the staff was very friendly. Food is okay. I think they could add a few more choices to their menu. Also very over priced.

Text: Didn't get a chance to try the food. Customer service sucked. 1st attempt no answer. 2nd attempt,  I was asking questions about the best deals and the menu because I have never been there. Response was "come look at the menu then" and he hung up. Customer service- no stars.
