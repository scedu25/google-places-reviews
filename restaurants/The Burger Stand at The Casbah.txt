The Burger Stand at The Casbah
Rating: 5
Text: I had the Classic Burger (medium) with a little bit of their spicy BBQ dipping sauce thrown on for good measure.  OMG.  I'd dare say it was probably in the top 2 or 3 burgers I've ever had!  It was so juicy, so flavorful, I have a hard time finding words to describe it.  This is our first trip ever to Lawrence (for the 2017 eclipse, and I'm not sure we'll ever be back this way) but let me say this... if you ever find yourself anywhere near this neck of the woods and you like a really good burger, you owe it to yourself to read hit this place.  You WILL NOT regret it.

Edit... I just ate again tonight at Kenny’s Burgers in Plano Texas and can confirm, The Burger Stand at The Casbah is the best burger I’ve ever had.  Kenny’s is good, but not on the same playing field as The Burger Stand.  I wish I could speak to the consistency of The Burger Stand, but having eaten there only once, I can’t.  Tonight I ordered a burger at Kenny’s cooked medium and it was at medium well at best... if not well done.  I can still taste the tender, medium burger I got from The Burger Stand.  I’m starting to miss that place.  Can anyone from north Texas recommend a similar burger joint?

Text: Eaten here about six times in the past 2 months, consistent quality and taste. Very good and not too expensive. Comparable to Five Guy's in price but with more selection and better quality meat.

Text: Great burgers, less than brilliant method of placing your order.  A long line of indecisive patrons coupled with a lone, chatty cashier. It took much longer to order my lunch than it took to cook and eat it. Well worth the wait.

Text: Best burgers on Kansas. Large beer selection. Great fries and pickles. They have all the sauces. Lots of seating.

Text: With the stop for an alcoholic milk shake and great burgers! They were extremely busy but the line was quick and we got excellent service by the cashier. My burger was cooked perfectly medium rare but barley found a place to sit.
