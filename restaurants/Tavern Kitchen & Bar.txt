My wife Shelley and I split the sampler platter and it was Phenomenal! She raved about the salad and wanted mine. I plan on going back soon with my son and having sushi and dessert.

Text: This is my wife's and I favorite date night spot. Great food and great service every time we go.  I never understood depth/layers of flavors before coming here.  We have all of our special occasions in their private rooms.
