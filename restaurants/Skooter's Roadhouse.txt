Text: Got here about 1:30. Only one waitress that I could see. There was an event going on in the attached room and outside do I don't know why they weren't staffed better. It took at least 15 minutes for the waitress to visit our table. Once she took our order, everything was timely. The crowd started clearing out. She was a good waitress and the food was very good. I had the margarita flatbread. Yummy!

Text: When they first opened they had a large menu, the food was always good and the service was decent. The last few months though, the menu is constantly changing and being downsized, the service has been poor and the food is disappointing. We live in the neighborhood and they have a nice outside patio so we like to come here (as long as we're gone early to avoid the troublemakers) but won't be back for a very long time. Don't know what is going on there, but hopefully management will figure it out and fix it quick.

Text: I saw a very good show here.  It's a country bar, but the "concert area" hosts all sorts of performers.  The night I went (for a Prince tribute band) the place was packed, but I never had to wait long for service.  I found security well organized.  Bouncers were abundant and active, but all them were friendly and helpful.

Text: We were there for a music recital.  We were there for nearly 2 hrs before we had to track down a waitress. Front dining room was empty, with waitresses standing around.  When we finally got our food, it was, cold and it sucked.  That place could be a gold mine if it was managed correctly. We ate tthere once before, food sucked then too
