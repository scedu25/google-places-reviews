Al Basha Restaurant & Grocery
Rating: 2
Text: The service is nice, but I've had an upset stomach the last couple times after having eaten here, so eater beware. Lamb wasn't particularly good. Falafel was very tasty and crispy though. Know that the portions are enormous here and padded with lots of rice. One dinner plate is easily enough for two people.

Text: I can hardly believe that service this good even exists anymore. I just moved to Noblesville 2 days ago, and I was excited to find that there was an Eastern market in the area. However, after I gathered all of my groceries, and went up to the counter to pay, the machine wasn't working. The man apologized and told me to go ahead and take as much as I wanted from the store, and I could come back and pay for it later when the machine was working. Did I mention that this was my first visit to Al Basha? I'm a total stranger to the man, but he still insisted on me taking whatever I wanted and returning later to pay for it. You can't get better than that when it comes to service. His trust and kindness has truly affected me.

Text: Great place and good food. I was a restaurant owner for the same kind of food. I was impressed with the quality of food that was prepared mostly from scratch unlike many of the same. I have been there many times and no issues or concerns.
