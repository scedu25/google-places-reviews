Text: Holly was our server. She rocked! Present when needed and left us to eat. Helpful with our navigation of their menu (tablets).

Stuffed pizza was amazing! Had onion straws a beer and a specialty drink (bourbon bumblebee?).
Highly recommend this place!
Our 46 minute wait was only 22 minutes long.

Text: First time coming here.  Ordered pepperoni pinwheels for appetizer.  They came out fast and we're delicious.  Ordered the detroiter pizza.  It was very good.  The pizza took some time to come.  Our server was very attentive.  They have TV's in the booths and use Ipads for their menus.  I want to go back and try their stuffed crust pizza.
