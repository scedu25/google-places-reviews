Text: I'm in Columbus only once a year but First Watch is a "must" go for brunch every time.  Excellent and unique menu. Nice staff. I sat at the "community" table and had an enjoyable conversation with my neighbors.

Text: Always so great. Seamless experience. They text you when the table is ready. Beautiful fresh food, teas and juices. I was torn between the egg white and Turkey omelet and a chicken avocado chop salad with some kind of really cool bread. The server suggested the salad and was so right. Loved the iced green tea. Jes had biscuits and gravy but wasn't thrilled with it as she didn't realize it had sausage. We never had to request refills or the check. The hostess was inviting and personable. I love first watch. I've gotta get jes back though so she loves it the way I do.
