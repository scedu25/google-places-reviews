Text: Anytime I want to enjoy family time while eating,  Route B is where we go. The service is great. Even though the food is not always the best, I'll still go back for more. There might be a few things I would change. I think that non-smokers should not have to walk through the smoking section to be seated.

Text: We have been going here for a few years. Now that we have a little girl, we have started taking her. Everyone there Loves her, she says Hi to everyone, she has a blast there. The Girls are always nice and the service is fast. We mainly go for breakfast.

Text: I was wandering like a camel in the desert when a few miles away this belly dancer told me about Route B. I can affirm that I found water, plentiful food, beautiful women, and much pleasure at Route B. Always trust what a belly dancer tells you. Route B is like a magic carpet ride of good breakfast fixins. Lunch looked good too, but I had breakfast and was much satisfied.
