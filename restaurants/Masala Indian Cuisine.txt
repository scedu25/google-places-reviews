Masala Indian Cuisine

Text: Masala is hands-down my favorite Indian restaurant in Lexington. The servers are always friendly and attentive, and the food is excellent. I've never tried a dish I didn't thoroughly enjoy. They never scrimp on portions, so I always have left-overs to enjoy the next day. If you're there for lunch, I recommend ordering from the menu rather than eating the buffet. By doing this you can choose your level of spiciness so the entree is more tailored to your personal taste.

Text: Always great curry (excellent. I am half Indian and been everywhere and this is hands down my favorite curry in town), always great service! Buffet is great and has a nice selection. Dinner is even better- get your favorite buffet dish at dinner and you will see what I mean! Eat at Masala!!

Text: I have always been leery of trying Indian food just because I'm never sure what would be good and didn't want to pay a lot for one meal that I ended up not liking. This place changed my world. Hands down, some of the best food I've ever had. You walk in to a bar full of all kinds of different Indian food so you can easily try it all. I highly recommend this place for anyone new to Indian food especially since you will be exposed to many different kinds of dishes.

Text: The sauces are good, but the chicken in two different dishes was quite dry. The pakoras were too simple. I enjoyed the samosas, however.
