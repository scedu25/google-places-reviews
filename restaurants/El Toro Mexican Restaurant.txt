El Toro Mexican Restaurant

Text: Delicious food. Guava margaritas are a treat. It runs on the expensive side of Mexican food, and the restaurant is generally very cold. Try to come during happy hour because drinks are expensive.

Text: Salsa had good flavor, chips were maybe a little burnt.  Tried the Tacos de Carne Asada, my standard when judging a new place, and they were great. Had the rice instead of beans which was also as expected.  The tacos were served with what appeared to be a cilantro sauce but it didn't have much flavor.  Ordered a side of house hot salsa instead and was glad for it.  I'll be back.

Text: Normally I have a nice meal at this location. Today the waitress came and gave us chips and salsa. And without even asking what we would like to drink or given us water disappeared for 15 minutes.  When I finally located her she was at the bar talking with the bartender. We ended up leaving due to lack of service.
