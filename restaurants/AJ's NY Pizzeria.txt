Text: Our favorite pizza place in Manhattan. Always friendly and the food is delicious. Nice choice of toppings for your pizzas but alternatives such as salads, pasta, and calzones. Get the pepperoni bricks... they might change your life.

Text: Im not expecting anything crazy like real NY pizza in Kansas or anything, but at $16 for a “specialty” pie....you should atleast be better than Digiorno.

Excellent pizza. Weekday lunch specials are pretty good. Staff don't often give the impression they care of your existence but you go there to eat good pizza not make friends. I frequent there weekly and enjoy the shaded patio seating when it's not blazing or freezing or something is falling out of the sky.

Text: My wife and I come here because it's the closest thing to a good slice of pizza that you're going to get near Junction City Kansas.  Sauce is good but a little on the sweet side.  Pies come in a wide range of types but tend to over cook it.  Garlic knots are what they are "we're in Kansas".  But there's been a few times that if you give the staff taking your order, more than one item being ordered, they forget to fulfill that order as if you never purchased it.  We asked for garlic knots and 3 different kinds of slices of pizza trying them out and they forget 2 of the three slices.  If this wasn't the only close thing to real pizza that you could get near Jumction City Kansas I wouldn't come back.

Text: My family and I eat here/order from here fairly regularly.  The food is great and I love that they have Pizza by the slice. The outdoor seating is great as well!
