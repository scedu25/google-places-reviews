KOTO JAPANESE STEAKHOUSE & SUSHI
Rating: 5
Text: Very Japanese food and decor. It's like being in a little restaurant in Tokyo, except they speak English and are happy to serve you. Nicely worn in, not the typically overly flashy style we get in the states. Genuine attention to detail with my lunch special salmon over braised thin sliced carrot. Nice touch.  If you were Japanese it's the kind of restaurant your friends would all agree upon. I almost wish I had more time here in Fort Wayne to try some more menu items. But, I do want to go home. I wonder if I'll have time to try the tempura.

Text: This place is just wonderful! The food is amazing and have been getting even better since it opened. They have great choice of alcohol including many different types of sake. They do serve Coca-Cola here. The portions are very large, enough for dinner and tomorrow's lunch. The sushi choices are vast  and the sushi chef makes it quickly. The wait staff are always so nice. They will give you accendote if the store is a little slower. They have great stories to share.

Text: Great hibachi grill with regular dining option. Standard dinner show with their own twist on fried rice and salad dressing recipes. Great sushi menu. Good for groups. Would visit again.
