Jack Stack - Overland Park
Rating: 5
Text: The lighting in the establishment is a bit dim, but it's easy enough to adjust to once the food arrives. The food itself may also seem a little pricey, but it's worth every penny. We had ordered the Roundup (basically a sampler platter for two) and everything in it was delicious, even the cole slaw.

Service was impeccable and prompt (we came in a little after 5 PM, right before the evening rush hit) and our waiter was a gentleman. He was very courteous to us and gave us everything we needed when we asked for it. We will be back.

Text: Ohhh man. This is a go to place when in Overland Park. The food, superb. The wait was lengthy and, had there been more than the two of us  it would have been 30 minutes.  As it was, there was immediate seating at the bar. Our server was funny and humble, showing up when needed and giving excellent and honest advice.  Great food, certainly. But it's the environment that meant so much on this trip.

Text: This was our first time at Jack Stack. Everything was top notch from beginning to end. Hostess was bright and cheerful with a great sense of humor. Our server Heather really knew her menu and was very helpful when deciding on drinks. She was on top of everything the entire time and was very friendly. I would request her in the future. Service was quick and the food was outstanding. I highly recommend!

Text: Jack Stack has some of the best Bar-b-que in the Kansas City area. Which is saying a lot. They have been featured on the Food Channel and there Baked beans were given the title of Best Side Dish in America. Great place with friendly staff at all 3 locations. I prefer the original on Martin City, MO, but you will have a great experience at any of the locations.

Text: The food was excellent and Steven was a wonderful at the bar. I mentioned I was from out of state and here for work and he gave me suggestions on my days off. When I asked about local beers he not only gave me great suggestions to drink with my food pairing he suggested to take the beer tours. I plan on coming back here when I'm in town again for work.
