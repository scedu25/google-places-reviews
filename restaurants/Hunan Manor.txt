Text: I used to live downtown in 2010 and though I've moved I would still drive down there to get Chinese food from the Hunan Manor. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is so good. You can get full off of very little but it always leaves you coming back for more. This place proves that you don't have to be a hole in the wall joint to have good Chinese food!  Bring your friends! It's great!

Text: I tried this place at the old location and was kinda grossed out by the fact that it just didn't seem that clean. The food was never very good--tasted like they might be keeping the left overs in the fridge over night and just reheating it. After they moved I thought I'd give it another shot. Too bad, the place looks a little better but the food is the same old blah fare it was before. Maybe worse. I thought I was gonna get sick after eating there. Oddly the place is always busy, I guess some people just don't care what they put in their mouth. There are much better options for lunch downtown. Avoid.
