Text: Great little local owned BBQ joint. Was fun and the owners were friendly. Food was great and prices were fair. $1.25 is a bit much for a can of soda, but get water - it's better for you! Can't want to try them out again.

Text: The food for the most part was aswesom! Great sweet tea and the best lemonade! We got two sandwhiches (pulled pork & the big red) both were great, but our loaded fries looked like they had sat out for a bit and the fries were soggy! Other than the fries, I'm in love will most definitely be a regular customer!
