Text: Some of the best pizza & pasta in town.  My wife and I love this place.  Their thin crust is to die for.  Very pleasant dine in atmosphere as well.  I strongly recommend.

Text: Worst pizza ever.... ordered a thin crust, all the toppings were on top of the pizza sauce and a thick layer of cheese on top. Not baked properly, everything was just falling off when you lift the slice. Empty place not even a single customer inside.
