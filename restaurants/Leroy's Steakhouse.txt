Text: Really good steak. Service was fast. Waitress was attentive but not overly. Prices are very reasonable. I'll be going back to try the ribeye next.

Text: Love eating here.  We have our favorites and rarely look the menu.  Fabulous homemade food. Doesn't matter if it's called Rawhide or Leroy's,  the recipes are as delicious as I have remembered since childhood.   Prices are reasonable,  portion size big and a comfortable place to enjoy a great meal!
