Southridge Mall
Rating: 4
Text: Very cleaned up gathering of stores accessible only from the outside entrances.  This is not a walk-around-inside mall.
The Target has just been completely remodeled and is actually very nice now.  
It's worth a stop if you happen to be on the south side of Des Moines.

Text: Much cleaner than the old Southridge. Even though you have to walk outside the transition through out the store is much smoother. Lot less children being Hooligans and a lot more people being busy.

Text: Easy to get in and out of the mall. Decent selection of stores. I love that the mall is not crazy busy, and they have a nice children's play area

Text: There are not a lot of shops in this mall. The shops they do have are pretty cool. Some better than  others. I noticed it was warm wherever we walked inside the mall and the a/c did not seem to be on which concerned me for the animals at the arl. If you are just wanting an indoor place to walk this is a great place to go but if your wanting to shop it's not the place to go
