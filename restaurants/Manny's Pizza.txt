Manny's Pizza

Text: Great Midwestern style Mexican foods. They cheat and serve ballpark style nachos though. Can't speak to the pizza. Service was fine and restrooms were clean.

Text: Not the best pizza. Their taco salad and nachos were good. I think they should not market themselves as a pizza parlor as it is not their best product.

Text: Not always in the mood for Pizza. When I am, and I'm also in the area, I try to grab some Manny's! Don't forget about the Taco's. The new building is worth a visit too if you've never been and is very family friendly!

Text: Absolutely some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life! On our honeymoon and stopped in on the bike! Chicken bacon ranch pizza was delicious! Oh and the loaded cheese fries are to die for! The staff was so friendly, nice and out of this world kind! If you haven't been hear to ride to Poopy's, Iron Horse or Galena you're missing out completely!!!
