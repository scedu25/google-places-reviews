Bamboo Buffet

Text: Food was old already at 3:50p on a Monday for full price and changing the line out wasn't happening during the first 25 minutes. Afterwards only 3 dishes were changed over another 35 minutes. Food quality and safety isn't being quite followed here.

Text: They have a little more than the smaller buffets to offer. Had lunch just shortly after it opened.  Had never seen everything so full! Lol over all not bad

Text: Lots of choices and fairly good food. Large salad bar and they now have covers on the hot food. Best time to eat is when they are slightly busy because food is fresh. Lots of seating and the lemonade is great!

Text: I would not recommend it. The staff were all sitting around and there aren't very many booths without duct tape on them. Don't eat the cheese seafood item it was disgusting and I almost threw it up immediately. I definitely won't ever go again.

Text: Food was cold and hard. What wait staff works here because I saw 2 people the one at the counter who gave myself and my husband an attitude especially when he asked for a possible military discount. The only reason he asked for that was because we were spending almost 30$ on a buffet. That's ridiculous!!!! The only other person we saw sat at the north playing on his phone the whole time. We only ended up eating one plate each and still hungry. Very very dissatisfied and would not recommend
