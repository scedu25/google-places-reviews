Text: We went in at 8 they close at 9 there was hardly any food out whatsoever and the food that was out was cold and stuck to the pans. Our server sat on his phone with his friend the whole time never asked us for refills or how the food was.

Text: Place wasn't even busy, had less than 10 people in the restaurant. Took 20 minutes just for someone to see if we needed refills. Good food kept us from giving this place a 1 star review.
