Text: It should be a zero. They're racist, disgusting Nazis who own, run, and are employed here. Do NOT eat here and support such blatant dispicable behaviors. They think being "white is right." Disturbing sentiment in 2017. They are stuck in the days when racism was more open, but it was UNACCEPTABLE THEN AS IT IS UNACCEPTABLE NOW.
