Text: Wonderful home cooked meals. The feel of the place is very family orientated.  Very unique and antique. Home cooked style desserts. We will definitely be going back to catch Sunday buffet.

Text: This place has the slowest service you will ever get. We have been waiting for 30 minutes and nobody's even took a drink order. The locals tell us its overpriced but average food.  Not many options in town  but try to find another restraunt!
