Text: I ordered the Seafood Mixed Grill and the Pardon My French. This is the first place where I have ever been served MOIST scallops...these were not dried out! Crab salad was delicious. The shrimp were perfectly grilled with just a bit of zip, and were not dried out like some grilled shrimps. The salmon was also moist and almost flaked just by looking at it! I'm not a big salmon fan but I would eat this salmon again in a heartbeat. The potatoes and grilled asparagus were an excellent combination with this dish. A mild sauce as well as a spicy sauce come with this entree; both are very good but I opted for the mild. Even the biscuits and honey butter before the meal are melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Pardon My French is a sweet yet somewhat tangy martini, pleasant to all the senses and perfect for someone who prefers sweet over dry. It paired very well with my entree. Go alone and fall in love with the food, or take your loved one and let them fall in love with you all over again--you can't beat the food or the mood in this place. My dinner and two martinis brought my bill to nearly $70 plus tip, so it's pricey but expect to get what you paid for...excellent food, service and atmosphere.
