Text: Great food. Nice atmosphere. Great service. One downside is the bar and men's restroom are not wheelchair accessible. Luckily I had friends help me up and down the three stairs.

Text: This is a wonderful night out. The meal was outstanding. We came at prime time Saturday night so there was a 30m wait ~ we didn't have reservations. It was worth waiting for. We were invited to have a drink in the bar while we waited. They had live music the night we were there ~ a wonderful and fun three man band. A terrific evening ~ we highly recommend this place. Very nice.

Text: We were told the wait on Friday night would be about 45 minutes. It was just the 2 of us. Larger groups came in and were seated before us. Same size groups came in after us and were seated before us. We had to ask twice about getting seated. After 1.25 hours we were finally seated. People seated after us placed their orders and were served before us. Server was overworked and not attentive. I ordered sour cream with my baked potato and had to ask for it when my potato was served. No lemons were brought to the table - for a fish fry. Not the first time we have had a bad experience there, but will probably be the last.
