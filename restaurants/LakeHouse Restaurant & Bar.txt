Text: Beautiful views of Lake Michigan. Wait staff attentive, not overly so. Food arrived piping hot, lovely presentation. Tasted delicious. Ambience very relaxing. Will definitely come back when in the area!

Text: The view of Lake Michigan and the structure of this restaurant are lovely.
Food was fresh (went for late lunch), and well prepared.
Generous portion, but this is priced a bit higher for the ambiance.

Text: My husband and I both agree it was worth trying this place out but it just isn't for us. The food was good but not great. Not a fan of the Bruschetta, very oily and lacking in flavor - the Shrimp Alfredo made up for it. The service was good.

Text: Not to shabby. The peanut chicken skewers we're good, lake house burger was good slightly over cooked but still good. The coleslaw was very good that came on the sandwich.
The reason for 4 stars is the price was just tad high for what you get. 
Our server was very good and prompt, especially for a table of 13.

Text: O Boy! Loved this place! Great service, nice and polite. Wonderful view and patrons respectable. Not an overly posh setting but surely a great place for an occasion no doubt!
Loved the salad, done great! The Black and Blue Ribeye was just delicious! Loved every bite and a nice assortment of tropical drinks , wines and beers to go with it!
Seated right on the patio immediately on a sunday night and everything served-up promptly.  
Acoustic music was delightful! Will be back! Thank you Lake House!!
