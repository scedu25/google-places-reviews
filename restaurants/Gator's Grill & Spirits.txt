Text: The worst service and food experience we have had in a long time. Such a disappointment! What happened to that AWESOME resturaunt I remembered? It wasn't the waitress's fault either.....

Text: Their mashed potatoes tasted like instant and drinks were overpriced with no refill. Turkey sandwich was okay - service felt rushed. Perkins would have been better. Perhaps, I'll try it again on another trip.

Text: Great sports bar. Family dinning. Good food. Prime rib on Fri & Sat. Friendly staff. Great place to catch a game. No PPV events.
