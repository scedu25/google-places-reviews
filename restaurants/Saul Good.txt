Text: The food was fine but nothing to go Gaga over. Our server started great in the beginning but after our food came we really didn't see her again until she brought the check. Maybe things are better at the other two Restaurants

Text: The most original menu and some of the best food ever.  The atmosphere is great and there's a full bar if you just want to come in and hang out.  Classy and casual.
