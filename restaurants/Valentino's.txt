Valentino's

Text: We arrived about 10 minutes after the brunch buffet was over. That was a disappointment for us, especially since the buffets were still stocked. It would have been great if we could have dined from that instead of ordering from the menu for $29 for the 2 of us. There may have been only one other table of customers in the restaurant so it wasn't like they would have needed to add more. Plus, it would have made more sense than throwing all that good away.  It was good enough for the employees to munch on. Valentino's is a rare treat for us since we are quite a distance from Norfolk.  It was our loss for not getting to the restaurant earlier.  Just a suggestion to let patrons dine from the buffet even after it is done, better than throwing all the leftovers away.

Text: There was spoiled salad dressings on the salad bar. After 2 dressings I gave up. The pizza & bread sticks were good.

Text: Delicious pizza, but a little pricey in my opinion. Beyond that the buffet is pretty good and the staff is nice

Text: Mkay so I'm pregnant and craving and I mean CRAVING spaghetti and meat balls. Wasn't able to come before 9. Figured I'd be good before they closed, right? Because it says that they are open until 10pm. Get there 2 mins after 9 and still thinking we are in the clear because the buffet is still completely set up. Get booted out because they close at 9. Forgive my raging hormones but I am livid. Change your closing time on the website!!!

Text: Valentino's has always been good. Hours posted here is misleading, M-F is 1100am - 2pm & 5pm - 9 or 10 pm. Lunch & dinner hours. I hope they bring one back to SE SD like Sioux Falls, or Yankton.
