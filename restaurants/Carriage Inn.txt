Text: It's a great place to get pizza. Located at the end of Main Street, the owners are very friendly people who make solid pizza. They specialize in a thin crust style pizza whereas The Post offers a more traditional crust. The Carriage Inn also offers a Gluten Free crust if that is what you want. They have a good sauce to cheese ratio whereas The Post tends to get very cheesy, but some people really like all that cheese. They also offer homemade desserts that are probably the best in Tell City. There are specialty cupcakes on show by the cash register and occasionally cakes.
