Sake Sushi

Text: Sake sushi has so many options. We always get the all you can eat buffet. It is a great deal. So much sushi to choose from and if you don't like sushi there are plenty of other options for you. Food comes to your table hot and fresh so you never have to worry about how long it was sitting in warming dish for. Amazing. I wish all buffets were like this. The service is usually quite good but there have been a couple times where items I ordered never arrived at the table. All in all I would highly recommend.

Text: Friendly staff. Great selection. Fair prices. Sashimi isn't limited either. My favorite is ordering the vegetable dragon and enough sashimi so I can put then on top of the rolls.
