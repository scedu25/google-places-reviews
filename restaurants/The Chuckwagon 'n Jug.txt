Text: Gregg and Dawn have a diamond in the Rough! But it has the best burgers in the Mid-west. The hospitality is outstanding and wholesome! They made our 3 day stay in town very memorable! Food was fantastic! They are work in progress, always trying to improve the place. Great addition to the town! Came in as guest, left as Friends!
