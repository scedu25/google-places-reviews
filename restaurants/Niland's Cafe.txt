Text: Had a reuben and it was delicious! Everyone liked what they got. Super cute interior. Has like a little museum with history about the area on the walls of the restaurant.

Text: Had the Niland burger. It was okay. The service was okay. Pretty much every part of the experience was, "okay". It is important to note that none of it was bad; just that none of it was particularly outstanding. I've heard the pies are good, but I didn't have any.
