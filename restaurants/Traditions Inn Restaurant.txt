Text: This is a lovely change of pace. They are open for lunch, and have a small menu, with daily specials added each day. The meals are beautifully prepared, and filling without being overwhelmingly large. The building is beautiful! Also, I love that they have a tea set they bring out for little girls, complete with little cookies.
