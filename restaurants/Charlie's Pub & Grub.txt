Charlie's Pub & Grub

Text: This was a fabulous place! We were visiting from out of town and picked there to eat. Great atmosphere, great food, great service. Only downside was the seasoning they put on their dry rub wings. Much too salty, get them sauced instead. The chef salad was delicious!! Will definitely go here again if we are in the area.

Text: Charlie's has a great beer selection if you're into that sort of thing. They also have the standard faire. The burgers and sandwiches are good. Great outdoor area with cornhole and some comfortable seating. Service is fine.
