Kelsey's Steak & Seafood

Text: I expected it to be better than it was. Salad was nothing more than lettuce and croutons and they only give you about an ounce of dressing with it. I've had better steak at buffet places. My server let my cup run dry 3 times. And didn't give me the correct change on my bill. Just because of her poor service she received a $2 tip on a $30 bill. Should have just went to Taco Bell and ordered steak burritos.

Text: The acoustics, or lack of them, assault you first.  They don't know the meaning of ambiance.
The waiter must have trained at a fast food joint.  No class or ability to serve humans.  The shrimp cocktail was alright but served with only four shrimp and a tiny piece of lemon.  The large filet mignon $$$ that I
ordered...the waiter said it would take an hour if I didn't allow them to butterfly it.  What is THAT about?
It was lousy and this place calls itself a steakhouse.  The baked potato was undercooked and the "salad"
looked like someone had dumped it onto my plate from a leftover plate.  Just a few scattered lettuce
pieces, one cherry tomato and five croutons.  The forty-eight dollar bottle of wine was good.  I had been here once before and their hamburger was very good.  I will never go there again.
