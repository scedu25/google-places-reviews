Text: This is a wonderful surprise. I have never been to the Price Hill area of Cincinnati and had no idea this gem was here.

After seeing this on Burgers, Brews and Que, we popped over to check it out. We decided to try the Sunday brunch. There are many unique takes on traditional comfort and breakfast foods. I had the Hangover Cure (big fluffy biscuits, sausage gravy, potatoes, arugala, cheese all topped with a sunny side up egg), it is pure genius. The Mrs. tried the spicy chicken and Serrano corn waffle, delicious.

As you can tell the food is quite good, but the view is also great. Perched at the top of what used to be one of Cincinnati's inclines it looks out over the city and the river. 

There was only one minor negative, we both had  mixed drinks and they were a bit watered down due to the amount of ice in the glasses.

If you are close enough, you have to check the Incline Public House out. We have to drive about an hour to get there, but we are definitely heading back soon.

Text: First, they have gluten free pizza crusts and the pizza is great.  Second, they have a gluten free bun for their buggers.  I just finished one and it was great too.  Big and fat and juicy with a toasted bun, cheese and bacon.

The staff were very, very pleasant and friendly.  Beautiful day and the covered deck overlooking the city was wonderful and relaxing.
