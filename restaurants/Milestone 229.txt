Text: I took a group of college students here while on a trip to Columbus and I couldn't have asked for a better result. The service was great and the food was great as well. Unfortunately I was only able to grab one photo of the food but it is definitely a picturesque meal. I got the "Braised short ribs" based on the server's suggestion which is a tortellini dish with a delicious sage butter sauce and heirloom tomatoes. 

With six people dining, two appetizers and a few desserts the bill only came to $200 which is about $33/person. Very reasonable for the quality of food and service, our server never let our drinks run out and was more than helpful with suggestions and general questions.

Can't complain about the view either, if you sit outside you can either sit near the road and view the river and people in the park or you can sit by the fountains and view the water shooting around and kids playing.

Text: Hands down, this is one of my top two favorite places to spend time with family and friends in all of Ohio! Not even kidding. The endless gorgeous views of downtown Columbus including the confluence and water park compare to none. You can eat inside the beautiful restaurant or out under an architectually wonderful canopy. Dress is however you are and there's room for strollers if you were walking around downtown with your babies! The selection of food for everyone is amazing and so is the food presentation! All of it melts in your mouth, prices are very reasonable, portion sizes are generous, staff "gets" what customer service us all about and the drink selection is equally awesome! Milestone 229 allowed our family to showcase some of the best Columbus and Ohio has to offer to our family who visited here from Germany this weekend!!! ???? Oh, and Valet parking is another score!!

Text: Fantastic spot for dinner. Sits right in a park with a splash pad so bring the kids. Food is fantastic. We had the crab cakes and the special which was a hanger steak. Both were delicious. The steak was requested medium rare and was actually served that way, unlike many restaurants which err on the side of overcooking. The desserts were not as good as the entrees unfortunately. The pineapple cake was dry, but the syrup and pineapples made up for it. We also had the cookies and cream, which was amazing, but the cookies were a bit dull. Service was as good as expected and overall we had a very good experience.

Text: After reading the reviews and hearing great things about Milestone 229 we decided to give this place a shot last night. We sat outside at the bar which was very nice. After a few moments the bartender Jess greeted us and brought us waters and menus, then came back after a while and we ordered a carafe of sangria. This took almost 10 minutes to get but I understood. They were busy! And rightfully so, the sangria was great as was our calamari appetizer. We ordered a pizza at the same time as the calamari but after about 25-30 minutes after the calamari came out, I ordered a salad (also delicious!) because I was starving. Once we had been waiting for the pizza for nearly an hour I asked Jess if she knew how much longer it would be, and she informed us that our pizza had never been put in. We decided to go elsewhere to finish our meal because it was very windy and kind of chilly so we didn't feel like waiting for the pizza.  She never apologized for the pizza delay. :( we will probably give this place another shot in the future because everything we had was great, but working in finer dining, when you go to another finer dining restaurant you have expectations of service (but also an understanding of that working in the restaurant business and how tough it can be) but my expectations were seriously undermet.
