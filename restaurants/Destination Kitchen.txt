Text: Destination Kitchen is a gem in the Norton Community. The stone-fired pizzas, desserts, and coffee are all top notch, and certainly something one would expect to find in a larger community.  The ambiance of the building has an modern industrial feel. I enjoy browsing through their high-end kitchen items in the store.  This is my go-to for meeting up for a cup of joe. If you're ordering pizza, our favorite is the Brick Oven (loaded with different sausage and meat). I would love to see it open later and serve craft brews with their pizzas. Especially on days that you might want to catch a basketball or football game on TV.
