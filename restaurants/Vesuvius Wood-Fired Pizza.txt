Vesuvius Wood-Fired Pizza
Rating: 2
Text: The wood fired oven is greatly appreciated, but the pizza must be carefully placed in a place without cinder. Also, although it might be due to the American taste, the salt on the crust is not really needed, imho (and in the humble opinion of the entire Italian population ;P). The ingredients are very nice, and, overall, the margarita is nice.

Text: Very good personal-sized pizzas. The second time I went the dough was a little undercooked. Watch out for the blackened crust on the bottom; it doesn't taste bad (gives it a good smokey flavor), but it can make a mess.

simple fresh ingredients.  A hidden casual gem.

Text: After I finally tried this place, I couldn't believe I'd been going to Mongolian Buffet (next door) for so long when I could've been having this pizza, maybe the best pizza I've ever consumed in Iowa, the whole time. If you like pizza, check it out. 

The menu is full of "classics" including a really great Margherita pizza. They also have a more modern section of pizza options, like Hawaiian and Buffalo. The ingredients are all fresh. You can watch the employees make your pizza and put it in the oven. The crust is the perfect amount of crispy and bubbly, with a sprinkle of sea salt. 

I can't rave about this restaurant enough. It is highly overlooked, but don't make the mistake doing so yourself!
