Text: One of the best Thai in the area, great food and atmosphere.
The folks there are great. Always very polite and fast. Still our favorite place after 6 years going there every week or more

Text: I go here just about every week, and keep coming back for more. Everything I've tried has been incredible, and the workers there are super friendly. If you're into spice, make sure to request the spicy pepper powder they have.

Text: Best Thai place around. My favorites are Pad Kee Mow and Pad See Ew with 3 spicyness level! Their duck curry is also a close favorite. Don't forget the mango sticky rice if you're lucky.

Text: Great food. Expensive compared to other Thai I have had. I am confused why rice is a la cart with the Curries.
