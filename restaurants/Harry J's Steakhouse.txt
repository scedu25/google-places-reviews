Text: Great service and great food!  Some of the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Steaks never disappoint and add a couple of reasonably priced drinks and you've got a great night out!

Text: We ordered the fried cauliflower and fried mushrooms, they were awesome. The porterhouse was perfect. The sweet tea was great, not too sweet. We will be revisiting soon!

Text: Always enjoy eating here.   The Chili is almost as good as my own.   Never had a bad steak or burger and the fried Chicken is excellent.    Be ready to loosen your belt.

Text: The best steak dinner we've had in a long time. The steaks were so tasty, food was served in a timely matter and nice and hot out of the kitchen. The service was excellent and the waitress was so cute and always responded to my questions with a "yes Mam". Loved it! We were blown away that the couple we chatted with while waiting for a table had paid our bill. What a pleasant surprise. People in MO are the Best. Thank you for making our visit one that we will always remember. We were camping at Cuivre River State Park on our way to Union, MO for the eclipse. We were celebrating our 38th wedding anniversary and wanted a nice steak dinner and was told Harry J's is the best.  It will not disappoint.

Text: Good meat and potatoes kind of place.  The place isn't the cheapest but it says right on the menu that they would rather explain high prices than poor quality.  Everything I have ever tried here was good.  The steaks are good and tender, the burgers are good, potatoes are always fresh and fluffy, excellent appetizers. Can never find a fault with this place.
