Text: The Chef, (as in graduate of culinary arts) makes his own breads daily. All fresh meats, never frozen. A killer menu with great variety and not your run of Mill recipes. Desserts are made fresh daily. Try the chocolate bourbon pecan pie. Generous portions too.

Text: The decor is dated.  It has a varied menu and the blue plate special was OK.  Nothing special though.  The service was good.

Text: Chicken fried chicken... Not on the menu, but excellent.  Daily specials, steak fajitas are very good.  Full bar, drinks might come in a mason jar...

Text: My favorite sit down Restaurant in Buffalo, Missouri. I personally eat the Ribeye steak when it is available but you can't go wrong here. Try it you'll like it.
