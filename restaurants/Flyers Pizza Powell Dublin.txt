Text: What a great place! I ordered a pizza and was late picking it up... they where going to make me another one ! It was my  fault and they still wanted to make sure they had top quality. What a great buisness! Best pizza ever!

Text: Wonderful food and great service.  I gave Flyers a chance after experiencing way too many issues with Donatos.  I am very happy I made the switch as the food has been great and delivery has been very prompt.

EDIT:  While I still appreciate the quality of the food and overall service, I am removing a star because this company has serious technology issues.  It has changed the back-end ordering system several times.  I am unable to place online delivery orders, AGAIN.

Text: I've been ordering Flyer's the last couple of weeks for work and they have great lunch specials. A very generous stromboli lunch special for only $6.59 which includes stromboli, chips and cookie. Staff was very friendly as well. Would definitely recommend to friends.

Text: Love the Stromboli. Good thin crust pizza too. The owner is always friendly.
