Text: Definitely wouldn't recommend, first time eating here I had the  beef and broccoli. Beef tasted very bad and had a chewy/gummy texture.

Text: It's amazing. Its quick and cheap. They always give you large quantities of food and they deliver. I wish they would deliver to waco ky because that is where I live. That's the only problem I have with Tsing Tao. They also give you reusable containers so it's nice it's not weak styrofoam and you can re heat your leftovers in the container it came in.

Text: Egg rolls are half the size of what they should be. Have lived in Rhode Island, NY, and Colorado and they are all twice as big. Look into changing how you cook your fried wontons because yours are very bland. I think it may be the oil and wrappers you use.
Lo mein is pretty darn good though
Very speedy delivery, food was hot and fresh.
