Text: This was such an amazing experience! I had dinner here on my birthday and cannot say enough about this place! First, the ambience is perfect. Nothing stuffy or pretentious about the decor, just warm and welcoming. Exposed brick around the walls of the bar and beautiful contemporary art hanging in the dining room area. White table cloths and a small candle on all the tables. 

The service here is some of the best I've ever experienced. We were offered still or Sparkling water upon arrival as soon as we were seated. Our waiter was so attentive and professional and we were very attached to him by the end of the meal. 

I ordered the 4 course meal and my date ordered the steak special. Everything was plated in the most delicious and beautiful way. The meal was one of the best I've ever had. They even placed a candle on my desert plate! I can't wait to come back.
