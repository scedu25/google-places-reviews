Text: The food Is mediocre at best.  We walked in to a sign that said eat everything you take.  We should have taken the hint.  The food was hot and plentiful.

Text: Good chinese buffet if you get there early for lunch. Prices are excellent. Nice variety for a small place. Atmosphere could be improved.

Text: Use to be the best place in town especially for a buffet. However at some point over the past couple years it's been a steady decline not only in quality of food but the customer service and management is absolutely horrific at this point. Between the nickel and diming on things like house hot mustard sauce. When you order $40+ in food but charge me for ordering something that's totally free when I come in but I digress. After tonight and being told that 8min was to far for to drive when trying to order 30min before they close was to far. They scoop things in a box off a buffet and send it for delivery. I think I will stick to China buffet from now on and hope you decide to as well.
