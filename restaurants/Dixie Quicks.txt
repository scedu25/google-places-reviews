Dixie Quicks

Text: Extraordinary food and service in a one-of-a-kind venue. Dixie Quicks boast not only some of the Midwest most amazing southern cuisine but inhabits one the area’s  more interesting and diverse galleries. Today’s Brie & apple omelette with a side of grits was nearly as amazing as my favorite menu selection, sexual chocolate flapjacks. In addition, today’s gallery exhibit was a photographic mixed media dedication to the recently passed co-owner that brought me to tears. 
I’ve never had a bad meal over the decades and in their multiple locations. I encourage all you Omahomians to hit the highway for 5 minutes for the best meal around.

Text: Love this place! We didn't have reservations but they were still able to squeeze us in after a brief 10 minute wait. The place had a good crowd for a Thursday night. We enjoyed the burger and the grilled vegetable salad with chicken. Kids had the chicken and cheese quesadilla and the grilled cheese from the kids menu and all of it was a great value for the amount of food served (all came with delicious sides). The food was delicious! Council Bluffs is so lucky that this restaurant has chosen to call CB home!

Text: Upscale version of a greasy spoon.  Generous portions of comfort foods with the care of a professional chef.  Price is a little more than we would typically pay for brunch.  $30 for the food pictures.  Still it was tasty and we enjoyed the experience of dining in an art gallery!

Text: I love the location and atmosphere of Dixie Quicks. It’s a place I take my friends and family when they come in town. The food has an upscale hometown flare but the service is consistently slow.

Text: Unique dining experience in a wonderful atmosphere. The good is wonderful and the service had always been swell. The art gallery is hit or miss, but much art is that way. It is on my list of places to take visitors from out of town.
