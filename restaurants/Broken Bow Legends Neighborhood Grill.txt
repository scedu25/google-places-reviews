Text: Pulled Pork sandwich had a unique and delicious flavor.  I like Cole slaw and their's again had a unique style with a slight kick to it that was just right.  The steamed broccoli was cooked to perfection  - hot but still a little crunchy  (nothing worse than mushy vegetables).  The waitress was nice, helpful and efficient.  Prices are fair.  I recommend going.

Text: Food was very good along with being very reasonably priced. Service was good and the staff was very friendly. They just started serving early breakfast so in my estimation things will continue to improve and become a Great addition to an already successful venture.  Good job Legends.
