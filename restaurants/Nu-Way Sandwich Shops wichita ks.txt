Text: Nuway has unique burgers at a affordable price. I personally enjoy their rootbeer and supreme nuway combo. Their Taco Salads on Wednesday are very good too. This is the only nuway I go to in Wichita because it needs the business on Harry street among all the other restaurants.

Its always a relaxed feeling when I come here for lunch almost every day now. I really have no complaints.

Text: Had never heard of a crumbly burger before so we gave it a shot and it was pretty good. Fries and onion rings were choice, the root beer was lightly carbonated and heavy on the vanilla. The service was excellent.
