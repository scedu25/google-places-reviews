Text: Really good food, but leans toward catering to the elderly.  Don't ask for a side of bacon unless you want 2 shriveled up pieces of fat!  Rest of food very tasty and decently portioned

Text: The food is above average but the price is great. Get a large meal for under 10$ total for one person. The menu is quite small though. Overall not a bad place to grab something to eat. Oh and the wait time seems to be low.

Text: My husband took me there tonight, for Mother's Day. We got there just before 8PM. There were only 7others there to eat. The service was so slow, they were to busy into there clean up. It was probably 10 minutes before she even came to our table. My husband ordered a chicken dinner, and I ordered a ham and cheese sub. The bun was so stale, that I could not eat it. The ham and cheese made about 6 small bites. The man at the other table wanted more to drink, he had to walk up to the register,  and ask for a refill.  There was no one on the floor taking care of the customers. I could not wait to get out of there. I don't care to go back again.
