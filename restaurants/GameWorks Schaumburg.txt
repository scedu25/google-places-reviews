Text: Good arcade for older kids and adults. Most of the equipment is in good condition but if you go at a busy time, intermittent network problems interfere with swiping your card to play games. This isn't a great place for younger kids that want to play redemption games. They're overpriced and the ticket payout is very low. Plus, most redemption games are geared towards school-age kids, none for younger kids 3-4 years old. The XD game experience on the first floor is really fun for older kids and adults. Most of the first floor is redemption gaming and the second floor is traditional arcade games: shooters, fighting games, driving games, music games.
