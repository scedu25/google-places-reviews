Text: We found hair in our breakfast. At the table we showed the waitress and supervisor our full plates and the hair in the food. We explained we would only pay for the coffee. When we went to the counter the supervisor rang us up for the whole meal. We had to explain ourselves many times. The place is dirty.

Text: Charged me a dollar for not putting onions and cheese and adding extra peppers on an omelette. Menu says they charge 34 cents 
extra for adding items. Mediocre food. Okay service.
