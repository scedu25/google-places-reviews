Tequila's Mexican Restaurant

Text: Food was not good husband ordered a combo that had burrito and chimichanga etc soggy and over microwaved. Nothing but bland meat in all orders. Everything is microwaved I had to send food back cold in middle. Fresh is not a thing in this restaurant. Also back of the house looks dirty. Unless you know what real authentic fresh Mexican food is you will rate this place good but it's horrible and you can tell effort in food is not put in. Will not come back. Growing up in a Latin community and trying Mexican food and making it you notice what's real and what's not what's good too. Server was rude and had stains all over her shirt. Disgusting place.

Text: Our favorite Mexican place to eat!  Fast friendly and clean!  You can't go wrong here,  always satisfied! And one of my favorite things is individual salsa bowls! Eliminates the worries about double dipping or adding salt to the community bowl!

Text: The food is pretty good but not in terms of other similar restaurants. They don't wear gloves when they dip their whole hands into the buckets of salsa and cheese sauce to fill up the bowls. I also saw one of the workers hawk a loogie into the bucket of salsa. The writing in the stalls of the men's restrooms make me not want to go back there. 2/5
