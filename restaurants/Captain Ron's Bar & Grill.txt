Text: Nice waterfront bar and grill. Good good and drinks. Plenty of car parking and boat docks.

Plenty of beach area and several play areas for kids. Nice atmosphere for just hanging around to have a few drinks and food.

Text: I wanted to say a big thank you to one of the male bartenders working at the outside bar on Friday night 8/18/17. There was a big thunderstorm and we were unable to get a hold of our Uber driver and this fine young gentleman kindly took us home in his personal vehicle back to our place on lake road 5-33. Kudos to an awesome and caring staff of Captain Ron's. We will be back soon. Thanks again!!!!!

Text: Great boat-up beach-bar on the lake.  plenty of options for all.  Outdoor bar, beach, sand volleyball make an enjoyable 'day-trip' - The restaurant food & service were great as well.  Highly recommend Captain Ron's to anyone looking to Bar-Hop by boat.

Text: They did not fill tables that were empty because they were behind in the kitchen. We had a party of 7 and would have been more comfortable sitting at the table that was empty the whole time we were waiting almost an hour. I know this is typical wait at a lake restaurant but it was a little after 2 in the afternoon. The food was average. Our waitrese Kailey did everything she could to make it right. After we are seated it was another 45 minutes to eat. We are leaving restaurant and it is almost 4:30....management might want to look at turnover when tables are available since we stood at bar waiting drinking water.
