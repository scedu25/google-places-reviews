Domenico's Italian Restaurant
Rating: 1
Text: We never really got to the point of eating food, but I still think that the experience needed sharing. From the entrance that had misspelled Welcome sign in Italian, to the hostess everything seamed off. Once we entered the restaurant we felt unwelcome. Hostess was very rude and made us feel like we have to be grateful that she is taking the time to put us on the waiting list. We ended in the waiting area ordering drinks. During that time we thought that it would be a good idea to explore the menu so we asked for one. Menu items were not exactly Italian, but hey if you give it Italian name maybe you can sell it as such. What was supposed to be 20 min wait turned into 45 min wait. At that point we decided to leave the restaurant and eat elsewhere.

Text: I had not been to Domenicos in several years, but took my family  there tonight.  The drinks, food and service was great. Large portions were well prepared.  They were served properly by Tony.  All restaurants should have Tony.   He was funny and attentive. We all loved the experience.

Text: Delicious food, but don't receive much for the price you are paying. They made my uncle's drink wrong at the bar and then made him pay for a new drink they didn't make correct the first time! Very pricey and upscale. Be prepare to spend at least $30 per a person. Great place for a date night, but not a place to bring kids.
