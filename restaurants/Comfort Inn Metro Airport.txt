Text: It was an overall good experience, but have had a better time here before as I have stayed here every year the past 3 years, once a year when traveling for a Michigan football game. Arrived half an hour early and had to either pay $20 for early check in fee or join choice rewards at what was said to be free, but later charged $3 to join. But having to be even given those options are a little crazy when we arrived early because we had reservations to a fancy restaurant in a couple hours and there were four of us having to get dressed up and ready. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, but my experience the times before were better than this.

Text: $250 credit card deposit is kinda steep, but excellent beds and great linens. Very helpful staff. Very small bathrooms. Basic continental breakfast with fresh made waffles, but no bacon, sausage, or eggs. The breakfast attendant was outstanding!

Text: Clean modern rooms, a little on the small side but ok. Staff: friendly and efficient. Wifi was sketchy, but was up  more than down. They have a nice little restaurant / bar just off the lobby. Food was good, bartender and server very friendly. Pizza was good - it took 20 minutes but I was warned it would take that long when I ordered. Other food came out faster. Decent beer and liquor selection.

Text: This Hotel keeps getting better. It is under new management and folks are working hard to improve. Always have a good sleep here. Restaurant good and breakfast is available at 0400. They could diitch the piano music in public areas, really annoying. How about some Motown?? ;)

Text: Staff was helpful and courteous. Room was clean and bed was fairly comfy. Wifi worked great. The best part was the in hotel cafe. Food there was surprisingly good. Would definitely stay and eat there again.
