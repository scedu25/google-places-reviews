Text: I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries. With onion ring appetizer.   The onion rings were good. The fries were got and seemingly fresh. However, the burger was dry and tasteless and the bacon was way over done. All in all, I only ate about half the burger and less than half the fries. Very disappointed, don't plan to go back. The waiter was good about drinks and other things we needed though.

Great job on keeping the excellent quality of the food and service for as long as you have!
