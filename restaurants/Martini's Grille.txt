Text: Our family come here about four or five times a year to celebrate birthdays. We each have our favorite dishes but we all think the food is great. I have tried several different things and tonight my husband and I did the $30 Tuesday night special Italian grazing for two. It was fabulous! We have always had great views and great service and great food here.

Text: Great atmosphere! Servers are personable.  The steaks are my favorite.  I love the tuna stack and the white cheddar bacon pizza.  For your first visit you have to try the chicken lips and the pasta carbonara.

Text: This is the nicest/classiest place you'll find in the tri-state area.  Excellent food, beautiful views, and top notch service.  We have NO problems driving 1.5 hours from Quincy to eat here on occasion.
