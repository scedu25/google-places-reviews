Inn & Spa at Cedar Falls
Rating: 5
Text: We had a wonderful experience here. Very comfortable. Looks like a lot of work, thought, and detail went into converting some of the buildings into a vacationing spot. Friendly people on staff. Delicious food. Nice location for experiencing various hocking hills attractions.

Text: Had an amazing stay at the Inn & Spa at Cedar falls. It was a very peaceful weekend. The food at the restaurant was lovely, and the staff was very kind. Our cabin was beautiful and clean. The cabin was decorated in such a way that it felt like a home away from home. Perfect view of the woods through the many windows and on the back deck. Hiking on all the trails in Hocking Hills and then coming back to a cozy cabin was wonderful. I recommend the Inn to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.

Text: Neat little gem in the Hocking Hills. Sorry it took us 40 years in Ohio to discover.  We had lunch out on patio; my daughter and son-in-law spent a weekend lodging there. Good walking paths there and more nearby.

Text: Food was really good and good service, but the menu was very limited. Only a few options for dinner, either soup & salad, flatbread or a burger. 5 stars if they were to expand the menu. But the live music was also really enjoyable.

Text: So cute and quaint. Small menu but good food and drinks. Not much space for large groups but perfect date night spot.
