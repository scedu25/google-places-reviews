Text: Brunch was stupendous.  Service was great,  outside seating was nice.  Mushroom omelette and Benedict were standouts. Maybe a touch high on salt. Dessert was amazing and breakfast drinks very, very good. Will be back.

Text: The duck was out of this world. The mystery wine flight was a fun conversation guessing the grape and region. The flight also had some nice wines to it for the price.

Text: It was pretty good. Food was good and adequately portioned (I would've preferred more). The waiting service was good too. The wine selection was surprising limited though.

Text: Vinology is breathtaking. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I could not be any happier with our experience. We arrived around dinner time and did not have reservations. We asked for a private room downstairs. We were able to get the most perfect table with two seats in the Wine Cellar room, placed at the end and centered. (Waited 2 minutes tops to be seated.) We were greeted almost immediately by our friendly yet professional waitress. She knew exactly when to ask us how we were doing, even poured our filtered water for us when we got low. For our wine choice, we chose, a BIG(bold style wine with heavy weight and richness) red wine, Zinfandel, Girard. As per our waitress' recommendation. I am not usually a red wine fan but this was invigorating, fruity. Our entree was two full portions of Vegan Jackfruit Tamales, presentation was impeccable, many flavors that melded quite nicely. For dessert we indulged in a Vegan Mango Sorbet "cheesecake" : spicy, fruity, airy, hint of chocolatey goodness. Cost is on the higher end; it is a classy place that is well worth every penny. As we went upstairs to exit, we realized it was very noisy and we did not hear all of that chatter while in the Cellar room. Four thumbs up from us for Vinology, this place is doubly a 5 star restaurant. We highly recommend everyone to give it a try.

Text: Went to a wedding ceremony and reception here. The drinks and appetizers were fantastic! The dinner was probably the best wedding dinner I've ever had. Cute place.
