Text: The food here is as good as you can get in a small town in central Missouri.  Katy trail folks should check it out, as it's just a few blocks off the trail.  Good beer offerings, excellent service, good ambiance, everything is delicious.  You can't go wrong.

Text: We waited 40 min for our food before we decided to leave! The restaurant was not busy and we did not order anything extravagant just a salad and burger
