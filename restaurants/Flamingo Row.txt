Text: Loved this place as a kid. However the new building and the food have declined. The new building is an amazing experience for kids. It's colorful and fun, but it's so big and tall, it's freezing, always. The food isn't as good as it was even a year ago. It's still tasty, but I used to be better. In conclusion, bring a sweater and try the fruit tea.

Text: This place was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Its such a neat place and the food was amazing.  The drinks we ordered were amazing.  I got my first tattoo today so I thought it was fitting that I ordered theTahitian Tattoo and wow I could have drank many! The burgers we ordered were the best burgers we've ever tasted,  hands down! If we ever visit again..... we will be going back! The McCoy's...Poplar Bluff, MO

Text: The food was superb, our compliments to the chef and their staff, however, the floor staff and the hostess were uninterested if not distant. We were also lead to understand that our server is/was the only one to offer bread to the tables whilst reviewing the menu. In conclusion, consider take out if an option.
