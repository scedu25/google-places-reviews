Peel Wood Fired Pizza

Text: Was excellent pizza and service. The crust was crispy yet soft at the same time. I had the chicken gorgonzola with wild mushrooms and it was fantastic. Great beer selection too. Minus one star for no sweet tea and limited diet drinks.

Text: Amazing wood fired pizza and calzone.. Dessert of the week specials. Many craft beers on tap. Go early or be prepared to wait. This is a high volume selling eatery, but well worth the weight....I promise.

Text: I love this place. My kids do as well. The food is good and portions are appropriate.   Friendly Staff.  The wait is usually long on Fridays at dinner time.

Text: $8-$10 Beers, $8-10 glasses of wine, $13 and up for thin 14 inch Pizzas that have little to no flavors. Our Margherita Pizza had little flavor so I asked for Parmesan to give it a little more, as my horrible waitress informed me that cost as well, sarcastically. I guess because I asked to see a price list for the beers that pi$$ed her off. She also nearly dropped the Pizza onto our table as I was trying to move the Menus out of her way. Worst service from a Restaurant that I have ever encountered. I couldn’t wait to get out and will not be back.
