Text: Great sandwiches and burgers, the fries are to die for!  Very casual and pleasant ambiance.  Would like the place to look cleaner,  bathroom dirty so I wondered about the kitchen.  My rating is only based on the food.

Text: Really had a great lunch, the ETR fish sandwich was superb. Country Store ambience was really cool. The place was packed yet gave you a homie warm and neighborly atmosphere. And the bourbon chess pie was one-of-a-kind fantastic! I highly recommend a stop at this wonderful restaurant if you're anywhere within 20 miles of the place at lunchtime

Text: Very casual, comfortable and fantastic sandwich joint. Country ham and pimento on rye was very tasty as was the chicken salad. Soups and chili were the perfect accompaniment to the wraps or sandwiches. Breakfast menu also available.

Text: Great sandwich and burger place. Also has a large selection of locally made desserts. Has inside and great outdoors seating. Sandwiches and burgers are larger than most places. The bread is homemade and they offer three kinds on the sandwiches. Prices are above average but so is the food. We have eaten here several times and it is one of my family's favorites.

Text: This delicious deli is a hidden gem!! Worth exploring the back roads of Kentucky to eat there. The menu offers alot to choose from for such a small place. We have never been disappointed with any menu choice. The breads and desserts are made in their local bakery!
