Text: We were greeted the second we walked in the door and were promptly asked what we would like to drink. And they were busy so it wasn't for lack of customers. The staff came by regularly to ask if we needed anything and even took the time to joke around with us a little bit. Loved it there! The drink I had was also great! Good selection of beers and liquors! Very impressed!
