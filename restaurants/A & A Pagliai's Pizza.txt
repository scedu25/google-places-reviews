Text: The pizza is very good the atmosphere looks cool. I picked up pizza to take back to the hospital after one of my kids was born. They're open till 11, which is great considering not much else around there is, but they are not open for lunch.

It's thin crust pizza, tasty, and limited menu. It almost tastes like its been wood fired.

Text: Simply, the best pizza I have ever had. Somehow, the delicious thin crust holds up well underneath their incredible sauce and fresh ingredients. Their sausage is truly amazing. Try the "Palace Special," my favorite pizza on the planet.

Text: Decent pizza, but honestly nothing special. Maybe you have to like really thin, crispy crust to truly enjoy it.

Text: The pizza is good but expensive. The service is excellent. They serve wine and beer, probably pop, but no salads. If everyone at your table orders a different kind of pizza, it can add up to a tidy sum. The pizza is good but the crust is tasteless. I prefer my husband's hand-made pizza crust, which is half whole-wheat bread flour with garlic.

Text: Simply the best pizza in town... unless you hate thin crust pizza. But still, the family run open kitchen and the great service will count for a lot.
