Text: Horrible service, food & price. Loaded baked potato had only cheese & bacon, no butter or sour cream. Rib eye was very dry & tasteless, fried chicken was not fully cooked & still pink & couldn't send it back because there was no one around to ask & waitress never came back once. We had to get up to ask for more drinks, as well as the check  (which was outrageous for the quality of service & food. Lesson learned!
