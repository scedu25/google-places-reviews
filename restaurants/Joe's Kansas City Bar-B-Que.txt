Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que

Text: You will not go wrong here. Ribs are fantastic with a great savory rub. They don’t need sauce. Fries have a great seasoning on them. Brisket is among the best - tender and juicy. The hidden gem for me is the red beans and rice. Absolutely great. If you’re not feeling like meat, try it out!

Text: Positively delightful.  The food was outrageous.  And the staff was amazing.  I didn't like the sound of burnt ends, never having had them before, so I passed.  The kind lady taking orders said "you want to try them" and I said politely "thanks, but I think I am all set."   She gave me a sample and it changed my life!  Burnt ends are now one of my favorite foods.  This place was PACKED!  I got there just in time before the line built up.   11:45 in the morning and a 30 minute wait for BBQ?  Now, I know why.  I will absolutely be back.  Whenever I am within a 2-hour radius of KC, I will be stopping in.  Please, come to NY!!

Text: When the line goes out the door and down the sidewalk it's a good bet something delicious is being served and Joe's KC is no exception. Consistently ranked at or near the top of BBQ restaurant guides, Joe's is now a Kansas City institution. I've never had anything bad and I've been more times than I can count and frankly care to admit.  You'll never, ever go wrong with their signature Z- Man and side of fries. The rings are amazing as well.  If you go anytime near peak hours be prepared to stand in a long line; fortunately it generally moves pretty fast.

Text: It is labeled the number 1 BBQ place in America and one of the top 13 places to eat before you die for a good reason. Located at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, this joint delivers the best BBQ I have ever tried, and as a Texan, I have enjoyed plenty of great southern BBQ. Definitely worth the wait. I also strongly recommend the Z-Man, it truly lives up to its hype. It will be heavily crowded just about any time of the day so expect a line. Enjoy! (Picture: left, Z-Man; right, Burnt Ends)

Text: Fahhget about it.  This place has the best ribs I've ever had.  I didn't know what burnt ends were, but now I do.  They're delicious and should have a much tastier name.  Something more like"smoky-delicious-tender-tidbits".  And if there is only one place to eat before you die, make it Joe's, and be sure you go to the original one, that's part gas station. Fantastic.
