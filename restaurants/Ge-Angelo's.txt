Text: I had their seafood ravioli once and thought it was good, but nothing amazing. I heard several great things about their pizza, so one Friday we ordered a namoteli pizza with hot Italian sausage. I was skeptical about no pizza sauce until I saw the picture and then tasted it. Delicious crispy, buttery crust and great quality ingredients. Most pizzas are way overpriced for what you get, but this is only a few dollars more expensive than a Casey's pizza, with authentic, high-quality ingredients. The hot oil was a nice addition and added a subtle spice to the pizza without overpowering it. I live dangerously close to here and am in a way glad I didn't discover this place earlier, because I would have ordered it so many times. The Mediterranean salad was delicious too.

Text: My experiance: paid almost 20.00 for a small 2 topping pizza. At that price I was expecting a great pizza....i was disappointed. It tasted exactly like a pizza hut pizza :( Conclusion: overpriced, mediocre pies. Save your money and go to Blaze Pizza. Note: the wait staff was super nice though.
