Hampton Inn Manhattan
Rating: 4
Text: Soft comfortable beds, or they can make them firm.if that's what you want. The staff was excellent very attentive and friendly. The pool looked clouded and not inviting. Fitness facilities were fair. Breakfast was good, wish they had good yogurt such as Chobani Greek yogurt. Overall a nice place, would stay again.

Text: It was a good stay at the Hampton Inn Manhattan. When I got there I had to wait a little bit to check in because the front desk lady was helping someone else get into their room who had had a stroke previously. I thought that was very kind of her and I complimented her on her good service.

Text: Location was good and close to everything. Rooms were clean. Service was good too. Pool was quite big for a hotel. Fair price. Not luxury but just what our family needed.

Text: Clean rooms. Fast and courteous service at check-in and check-out. Breakfast was great and the additional touches (signs in the dining area, etc) made us feel welcome.

Text: The conference room was located conveniently in the Lobby. The floor stand air conditioners were loud making conversation difficult. When off, the room became hot and the windows could not be open due to ducting from the A.C. units. Internet was good for our needs.
