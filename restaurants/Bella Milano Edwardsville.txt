Text: Food was very good, hot and fresh.  We got the Family Special for 4 on Sunday  for just the two of us.  There was more than enough for leftovers for two days at home.  Server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Text: This is the most over rated place I have ever eaten, and I've given it plenty of chances over the last few years. Spaghetti and meatballs was terrible, sauce greasy and too sweet, meatballs obviously reheated or a few days old. White sauce pasta too dry and ne early flavorless. Average pizza, puny saladalmost an insult. I will notbegoing to this place again. Forgot to mention way overpriced.
