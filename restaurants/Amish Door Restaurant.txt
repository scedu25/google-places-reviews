Amish Door Restaurant

Text: Friendly, spacious, and fairly decent food. A great place for tourists. I had the buffet and was well satisfied by healthy yet salty options. Not a good place for low salt diets but that's true for almost every restaurant.

Text: This is the best Amish restaurant in my opinion. Their broasted chicken beats them all. Everything is good. I get the buffet everytime and it is always fresh. They are usually pretty busy with a long line to get in but it's worth the wait. Buffet has two kinds of chicken, tender beef, ham, meatballs, mashed potatoes,  noodles, mac n cheese, soup, veggies, salad and desserts. The best bread pudding too! Plus there is a gift shop above restaurant and some out front in a different building.  Enjoy.....
