Text: Would do a zero but can't they come out and tell us our 11 month old baby is to messy because she knocks some food on the floor and even forgot our 2 kids meals we ordered.  Spend $76 will never come back

Text: Service is hit or miss, but what do you expect from local teens? But the food is great. The onion strings are really good and they will give you a ton! It's a diner so foodies might feel disappointed but it's a great place for a burger or breakfast. Go with that in mind and you will enjoy the meal.

The atmosphere is interesting. Old westerns on old tube TVs and golden oldies music. Not sure if it's throw back on purpose or accident, but it works.
