Text: Great place in downtown Mishawaka. Very good menu and bar. Had the hanger steak and house salad. Both were delicious! Chef Luna introduced herself. Highly recommended.

Text: Underwhelmed and won't be back...The high note was that my father's lamb chops were both good and plentiful...The low points... Only two front of house staff and they were not impressive and because they had to do everything, the service suffered...So it may be less their fault, and more so the fault of Mngt....At one point I noticed one server drinking behind the bar...Too bad he has time to drink but no time to learn how to make a simple whiskey sour...It's my father's drink of choice, and after one sip I knew it was wrong... I tried it and it was one of the worst I've ever tasted.  I worked behind the bar for 11 yrs and was never allowed to drink on shift. He asked for no cheese on his soup and it came out with cheese all over it...The chef kept coming up front for some reason..She wasn't checking with guests about the food so I have no idea why I kept seeing her...Maybe if she had stayed in the kitchen my steak wouldn't have been raw in the middle.  The bread pudding was dry and the lava cake that you can get almost everywhere wasn't even close to being worth $9.50.  Do yourself a favor and spend your evening and your hard earned money somewhere else.. You're not missing anything by skipping this place!
