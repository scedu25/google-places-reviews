Text: 10/10 would come back. Great pizza and friendly staff. Made me feel welcomed from the moment I walked in. I'm not a local, but will stop here every time I pass through.

Text: Pizza was really good, but crust was too tough to cut with knife or fork, so I had to eat it with my hands. The toppings were excellent though! Bartender helpful. Service was good.

Text: Restaurant is very comforting. Outdoor patio is small and seating is limited, but the environment is great. The food was excellent. Servers were very friendly and courteous. Would highly recommend if you are considering getting drinks on a Friday night and looking for some live music or outdoor patio.
