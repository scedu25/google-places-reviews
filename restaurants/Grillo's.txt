Text: The first time I ate here the air filters were so dirty that, when someone opened the front door, the whole building gasped for a breath of fresh air. The ceiling intakes had black dirt all over them and the carpet smelled. But....the food was really good. Since then, things have improved and I have learned to think of it as a Diners, Drive ins and Dives on the food network. It may need some tips from an old restaurant inspector and some TLC, but I've always had a great meal here at a fair price and the parking lot is always full.

Text: This was a tasty little place to eat. Affordable and well. Only 99 cents to add a good sized side salad. And the pie! It didn't taste like you bought it from a grocery store, it tasted like real pie!

Text: Great place to eat at a reasonable price. Friday night all you can eat with five choices and two sides. Two can dine for around $20. Great deal,atmosphere, and food.
