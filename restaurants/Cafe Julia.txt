Text: This place makes some amazing drinks and food and their prices are reasonable! They have both indoor and outdoor seating and lots of it. I also really love the atmosphere here because everyone is super relaxed and friendly and it's close to downtown.

Text: We always  look forward to stopping at Cafe Julia when driving in the area. Located not far off highway. It is clean, good coffee, great soup and sandwiches. Staff is friendly. Outdoor seating available or stay in during the winter and watch the activity on the cities ice skating rink.

Text: Nice made to order sandwich shop with homemade soup.  Nice place to hangout with friends enjoy some summer fare.  Bread tastes like it's made in house as well. Plus a 3rd deck for seating thus plenty of outdoor seating for nice days.

Text: Great coffee, mocha, fraps. Beware the baked goods; their addictive! Loved it! Good thing it's a long drive from home, or I'd be there more than would be healthy. ?

Text: Horribly understaffed.  The line was out the door, drinks took 15+ minutes, food took longer.  Once you FINALLY get the goods, they are delicious, but make sure you have plenty of time, and comfortable shoes to stand in.
