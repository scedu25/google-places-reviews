Prairie Lights Cafe & Bar

Text: The resturant has new management and a new attitude.  Food is good with large portions at reasonable prices.  Daily lunch and dinner specials are real values.

Wait staff is local high schoolers and a little erratic but should settle out with time.

Text: The service was slow and it took forever for a waitress to come back with our drinks. The food is nothing to write home about. A little over priced for the poor service.
