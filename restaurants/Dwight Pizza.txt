Text: We stopped here on our way back from Chicago to St. Louis because of the reviews. It looks like nothing special from the outside, but the food was AMAZING!  The owner makes everything from scratch and the pizza crust was the best I've ever had. We all ordered pizza's to go to take home. Great service too. We will be back!

Text: We stopped here on the way back from Chicago and was so impressed with the pizza and menu. All of us had personal pizzas and loved them! We even purchased half baked pizza to take back with us. This place will not disappoint!!

Text: Stopped here on the way home from Chicago. No clean tables and had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Waited another 10 minutes to put in order. Server brought out food and had to wait for silverware and napkins. Five more minutes and we got our drinks. Server did give us samples of Italian beef sandwich as consultation. Very good pizza. If you want something quick go to McDonalds, but if you've got time go to Dwight Pizza.
