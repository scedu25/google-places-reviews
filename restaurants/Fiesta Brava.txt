Text: The food was pretty good. Exquisite salsa dip. Excellent rice and refried beans. Chili beef tasty though fairly mild. I dinged them a star for service: the food for one of our party of two arrived 10 minutes after the other's.

Text: I hate to leave a bad review but the food was not good. My daughter couldn't even eat her enchilada or burrito. We needed napkins and tortillas and the waiter never came back to ask if we needed anything. We went to use the restroom before leaving and there was no soap. Took 10 minutes waiting in bathroom for an employee to find soap. We were just passing through on a road trip and read 4.8 out of 5 stars and thought it would be pretty good. We were wrong! We should have saved $55 and went elsewhere.

Text: The best place in Custer County to get Mexican food. A little hard to find.
