Text: We started off waiting for a table for about 5 mins even though there were plenty open (they were larger ones but the restaurant wasn't busy). But the staff was super friendly. Drinks came and order was taken right away. Loaded skins came out hot and crispy. Both of us got hot sandwiches, the Philly cheese steak and the French dip. Fries were just warm. Portions were great for the price! Everything tasted amazing and the unique atmosphere made for a unique experience.

Text: Kitchen closed before bar closed, that was too bad, but...
The drinks were a pleasantly surprising strength, staff (Bartenders - Kaycee) was really friendly, prices were good too. Beer on tap included a decent selection of IPAs and a stout. Good place.
Since the kitchen was closed bartenders were thankfully helpful giving a some help finding late night food. Thanks ladies.

Text: Food was great! Great selection of beer, and drinks. I want happy with the Bloody Mary, but that's no fault of theirs... just personal taste. They took it back and refunded us. Low key, family friendly, super casual. My only disappointment was the number of fruit flies/nats. We were situated right by the front door, which attributed to the issue. I'm sure there want any issue further back.

Text: We absolutely loved it here! I ordered chicken wings, and my wife got the whiskey burger. Both meals were outstanding! Our server was awesome, very attentive and our food came out steaming hot, quick and delicious. The atmosphere and beers were also a huge plus here. We will definitely be coming back next year on our annual cedar point trip!?

Text: I got the Cuban, it was huge!! A perfect amount of food right before cedar point so we didn't have to spend more on food and time in lines there! The music was pretty loud for a Saturday lunch, but our service was great even though they were short handed. Definitely will go back whenever we go back to CP
