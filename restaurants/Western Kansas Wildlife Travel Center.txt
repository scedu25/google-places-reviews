Text: It sells a brand of gas that runs best in my vehicles. Prior to Mittens, it was a long way to the next place that sold that brand. Just as I discovered the brand new Mittens, my gas became available at only one place that was NOT even open all night. Now I can utilize Mittens at a better location after leaving the Denver area but before Salina. I like the staff & there is a 24-hour restaurant along with all of the amenities one expects of a modern truck stop.

Text: This is a truck stop that I always make a point to stop at.  The showers are clean with excellent pressure and hot water.  The restaurant is very good.  I usually get the pancakes as they are the main reason I stop here. I had my oil changed here the last time and it didn't take very long and the price is always very reasonable and fair.  If they see any potential problems they immediately advise you.  I've used the shop a few times and haven't had to wait very long when they were busy.  The staff is always pleasant, courteous, and have a keen sense of humor.  As I said, this is a truck stop I always stop when I'm on my way through.  I highly recommend MittensTravel Plaza to anybody traveling this direction!!!

Text: Ate lunch there today because the website advertised a taco salad that looked really good. It was until I found a long black hair in my food. I didn't send it vack or complain because sometimes that can be worse. Won't be eating there again. The waitress however was great.
