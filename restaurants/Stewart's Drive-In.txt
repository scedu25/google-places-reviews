Stewart's Drive-In

Text: Been a business in Marion for decades. Remember going there as a  kid, great memories. Upgrades throughout the years but just as good as when I was a kid. Hope they stay open for years to come so my grandchildren can experience the best Root -beer floats in town !

Text: Service is great, love the rootbeer, but food for the cost is so so.  Coney barely had anything on it and was expensive.  The hot dog wasn't even covered.

Text: I love the classic atmosphere of the place, it brings a feeling like you stepped back in time to an era when so many things were not issues, and looking back, life was good.
