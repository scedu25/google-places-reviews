Lo Sole Mio Ristorante
Rating: 4
Text: I moved out of state and finally had an opportunity to visit my old favorite after moving back.  Still good.  The bread and garlic alone is worth a visit!  My husband had tortellini Alfredo and it was amazing!  I had spaghetti with Italian sausage and red sauce that was very decent, but probably not a standout choice...

Text: I'm from the Northeast and this restaurant is probably the best Italian restaurant I've eaten at West of the state of Pennsylvania. I found out about this place from a man who came into the shop to look at a car so we got to talking and I told them about how it's hard to find good Italian food will he point me in the direction of Lo solo mio. And man he was spot-on. Just a side note no hats pass the bar.

Text: Party of 10 - lunch - food and waitress amazing. Lunch hours. Clean and staff would not let us do anything on our own.  Always wanting to wait on us and be over gracious.

Text: Food poisoning! I wanted to love this place. Came here a party of 8. The place was packed! Be prepared to be there for at least an hour. My husband ordered the special and I ordered the 12oz steak with mushrooms. I split the steak with my 9 year old daughter and my husband ate my leftovers. We were sick with food poisoning for the next day. It was TERRIBLE! If youâ€™ve ever had food poisoning, you know how we felt. Beware!

Text: We love this place! I've never had a bad meal here. You get so much food before your meal even comes that a lot of times we end up just taking our entree to go. It's a treat every time we get to go here.
