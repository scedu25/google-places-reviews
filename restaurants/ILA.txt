Text: Over priced for what you get. The stroganoff has strips of dried out meat and the mushrooms taste canned and very bland. The place is cute and the staff is friendly. But the food is something to be desired. Sorry :(

Text: Open Sundays for brunch, which is unusual in this small rural town.  Food is unexpectedly good and offer some interesting specials.  Has small but pleasant bar.  Wait staff is accommodating and helpful.  Ambiance is extremely relaxed with quirky decor.

Text: Yummy, good service,  so many yummy looking interesting options, and any awareness for their ingredients.  I'll have to go back and try something else.
