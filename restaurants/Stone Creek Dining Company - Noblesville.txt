Stone Creek Dining Company - Noblesville

Text: It wasn't our first choice for dining but it turned out to be a happy mistake! We were greeted by a friendly face and seated right away. Our waiter gave great suggestions for cocktails. Our meals were superb! The smothered chicken and horseradish Dijon crusted sirloin were good enough to make us want to come back again. We would highly recommend Stone Creek!
