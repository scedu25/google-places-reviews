Text: Consistently great food, service and atmosphere!   We've never had a bad meal here and always look forward to going back! The parking can be a bit tight because they are often pretty busy.

Text: Was pleasantly surprised after stumbling upon this place while visiting RedBud MX this weekend. Meals ranged from $10-20 (plenty of options at both ends or the range). Smokehouse plates are a hefty portion. Service was great, quick and polite. Had our food in probably 10 minutes for a group of 4. Will definitely visit again and highly recommend.

Text: One of the best restaurants around! Great seafood options and great cocktails as well. If you like good beer, they have it. The service is good and you will enjoy what you eat. One of my favorite places to dine!
