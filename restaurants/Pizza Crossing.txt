Pizza Crossing

Text: Was in town on a trip and decided to stop here with my wife. Locals suggested had suggested so thought we would give it a shot since who doesn't like pizza right? We ate in the establishment and order a house salad and a large pizza. Pizza was a bit pricey but we had a lot of toppings and this isn't a chain pizza place so that is to be expected. Overall large salad was huge enough for 2 ppl to share. Pizza is cut into squares and is thin crust. Not sure if there are different crust options but none the less everything was great. Food and service were great and we had left overs for dinner. Would recommend anyone to try if ever in Logan.

Text: The pizza and salads are very good. The dining room is a little darker than I like. I suggest looking for a booth with a light above, or sitting by a window during the day. Overall very good pizza and friendly service.

Text: Great local pizza and rustic decor, but if you have a large group , call in your pizza order ahead. There was a large soccer team group that came in after us, but got served right after they were seated. We waited over an hour for our pizzas. They were delicious with cheese all they way to the edge.

Text: Yay for gluten-free pizza!!  On top of it, the GF pizza was GOOD and with something I've missed, crust!  The only reason I couldn't do a 5*, I can be picky on pizza sauce.  I prefer an Herby, garlicky, sweeter sauce.  But, to each their own....But, the service was very friendly and good.

Text: Great pizza.  Great service. They appeared to be short handed on servers, but we were served without issue.
