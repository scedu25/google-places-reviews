Text: If they have the jerk ribs on special,   get them. The deserts are always great.  Super enthusiastic servers,  drinks are really good.  Love going to this place.  Live music on weekends,  it's a good hangout.

Text: Service is great. Owners and staff are friendly and helpful. Great to have some island fusion in the Midwest. Live music is always great! Family friendly atmosphere and menu options available for children.

Text: I went to school at K-State and have lived several places afterwards. In every place I try to find a Jamaican restaurant as amazing as this place. So far no luck! Best jerk chicken you'll ever have.

Text: Great food. Great experience. But don't go when you are in a hurry! This is a place that is laid back and meant to be experienced slowly. You won't get your food as fast as other places, but that is because it is done well and done right!
