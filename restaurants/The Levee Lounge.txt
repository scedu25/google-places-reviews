Text: Beth and Tony we're fantastic hosts throughout our entire stay. Beth made us something different for breakfast every day and it was delicious each time
The room we stayed in was beautiful and clean and really made us feel like we were home. The Mansion is also right on the Ohio River and offered spectacular views each morning. The beer and wine selection is massive, some of the best beer I've ever had and a truly unique wine/champagne selection. Beth and Tony treated us like we were friends, not strangers, and for that we'll definitely be going back. Thank you guys!

Text: A unique boutique and historic hotel situated along the Ohio River and in the heart of the Shawnee National Forest. Excellent food and the best local wine and craft beer selection around.

Text: What a fun place to check out! Lots of beers to choose from, plenty of wines to try and so much to look at! Every time you look around, you spot something different! We'll definitely stop in again when in the area!

Text: Horrible management. Featured wines suck, sorry but Illinois wines are not good, bragging about having the best Illinois wines is like bragging about having the best Italian food in Idaho.  Read the owners responses to negative reviews and you'll realize the owners have crappy customer service and are clueless. You're better off staying in nearby Paducah, much better choices.
