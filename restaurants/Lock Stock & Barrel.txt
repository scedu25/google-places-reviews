Text: A local favorite, LSB has been through a number of incarnations over the years. Around since the 70s, LSB has, like a lot of bars/restaurants, tried to become a lot of things for a lot of people. From being a popular college bar for Milikin students, featuring metal and rock bands, to its current status as more of an adult hang out featuring jazz bands. 

The food is mediocre at best and its decor hasn't really changed since the 80s. Still, this is a good place, worth stopping by for a quick lunch. The staff is attentive and friendly and you'll leave satisfied. But it's nothing to run and tell your friends about.
