Text: Food is bland and over cooked. Never, and I mean never, order a prime rib anything unless it is THE day they have designated FOR prime rib. 

Don't bother complaining about bad food either. The owner doesn't care and can't be bothered to make it right. If the bad food is bad, it must be you because no one has ever complained about it. In fact, he only gets compliments.

If you want to bowl and drink beer, this place is for you. If you want to eat ... go to the DQ on main or the pump off of route 1.
