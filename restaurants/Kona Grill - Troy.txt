Text: Very nice, upscale sushi restaurant. The meal, service and drinks were all very good. Slightly overpriced compared to other upscale sushi restaurants in the area, but not outrageous. The Tuna Tower was very good. Portions are larger then your average sushi restaurant.

Text: Almost worth the money! All food items I've had here have been quite good, but I don't think this place justifies the premium price tag on some items as well as the out-the-door-line when it gets busy here. Good food all around, great atmosphere, good service, just a little pricey for sit-down service for what it is.

Text: Pretty good food. Portions are much more filling than they look, the chicken avocado club is pretty good, but one half filled me up pretty quick. Okay for vegetarians but not that interesting - there's only so much you can do with vegetables and rice, but they do it fairly well. Water and pop stays filled up pretty well. Service is very good.

Text: Good location with a decent happy hour. In good weather you can enjoy the open air at the bar. 
Happy hour can be busy, unsure if the waitress put in my order. Sushi was good, I'd like to try more.

Text: The food was alright, I had the chicken chili and delicious corn muffins as an appetizer. My sister had the tomato bisque, with a side of finger nail. Yes, my sister found a fingernail in her food. Instead of remedying the situation the manager brought out a piece of parmesan and told her that was what was in her soup. It was not. The manager continued to harass my sister and the waitress when asked about it said "You need to stop. Whatever the manager says is what's going to happen." After all that I talked to a different waitress to get the Districr Managers number and that's when they changed their scene. They tried to make it up with free desserts (we were with a party) but the damage was done. Will never have their second rate food again.
