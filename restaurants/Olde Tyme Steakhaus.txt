Text: LOVE visiting Old Tyme when I'm in Olney for work and need to grab a bite, have a drink, and get some work done. So many good things to be had here. I'm enjoying a prime rib salad with little onion ring things and eggs right now and IT'S SO GOOD!

Text: This is a hidden little gem of a steakhouse. The staff is very friendly and helpful the food was really good with a good variety on the menu. It also serves wine and beer as to go with your meal. They also have desserts I can't comment on them because I didn't try them.
