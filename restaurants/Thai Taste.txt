Text: Nice quiet place. All food made to order very good. Waiter very patient in explaining what the entrees were. Will definitely go back. Moderately priced. Wine and beer available.

Text: The food was delicious! The eating area is a decent size but it seems a little long of a wait to get food. I understand that when you are busy then you are busy but only having 2 waitresses serve the entire dining room was the wrong move. But then again I do not operate a restaurant. It took 20 minutes to get drinks and 45 minutes to get food. However the food was perfect. The spice scale seemed a little off compared to the other Thai places I have been. I am normally on spice level 5 anywhere else. Here I am a spice level 8. But then again it could just be me.

Text: Fresh, light, good overall taste. Had heat level 8 which made it just warm. Server was great. Atmosphere clean and inviting. Will recommend to others.    :D

Text: I always enjoy the food here.  Don't expect a quick lunch.  The kitchen is pretty slow.  I waited nearly an hour for my food to come out, but there was an obvious mix up in that case.

Text: Great atmosphere and excellent food. Good lunch value as well. I always get the Cashew chicken and it never disappoints. Service is typically pretty fast, however, the past 2 times it has been a little slow, but hoping that changes. It is the best Thai in Southern Illinois.
