Text: ??? $$ Veggie omelette was very good. Hash browns lacked seasoning - disappointing. Sausage was not very tasty.

Overall, the portions were very generous so dont order too much if you're a small eater. My main dish was excellent but the sides needed work. 

I would give them a second try.
 
Prices: reasonable. Not expensive.
