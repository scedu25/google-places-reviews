Text: Love his homemade food!  An added plus is the staff is always so friendly with quick service.   They only take reservations so make sure you call ahead.  Well worth it.

Text: Amazing. First experience with Indian food outside of New York City. I have to admit, I was extremely impressed!  Make a reservation...it gets crowded fast.  Don't miss this place.

Text: Awesome tasting Indian food for much less than I'm used to paying at other Indian places in St. Louis.  Two Chicken Tikka Masala entrees and a couple extra orders of naan bread comes in at well under $20.  They have spicy levels up to rank 5 on the menu, but you can go higher if you ask-- I've done up to 20.

Text: Amazing food. Fantastic location. I love the fact that it used to be a home. I grew up in a home like that (ranch style) felt very homey. Will definitely go there again!
