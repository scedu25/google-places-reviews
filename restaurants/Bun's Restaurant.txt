Text: When I showed up with my father, an Alzheimer's senior...He was not in the right frame of mind...He had an accident. The hostesses and waitress, Ivy were so kind and helped get a meal to go in record time. Thank you for your gentle and positive behaviors toward us. I feel appreciative to see such strong instincts in your staff.

Text: I took my mom and fiancee there for lunch today for their first time. My mom and I ordered the lunch sirloin which on the menu showed $10 so we ate our food which was great as was the waitress. When we received our check however it showed $16 for the steak. My mom and I were perplexed so we asked the waitress she stated their new system charged us for the dinner portion. Which we were not told at first. We wanted to speak to the manager but instead she sent the waitress back out and only took off $3 each check. Which was not correct. My mom was not happy and asked to speak to the mgr again and yet again she sent the waitress back out. I'm a manager myself and that Is NOT how you treat your guests or your staff.

Text: A very nice small town restaurant.
Atmosphere is good with pleasing music (not hip hop or rap), service is good, food is good, and portions are over generous.
Unlike Polaris, traffic is lite.
A place that I will return.

Text: I wouldn't recommend this for food.  The burger I had, I have gotten better from McDonald's.  When you ask for light ice, that is what you expect.  Didn't happen.  When you ask for no pickles, you don't want them on your plate when you bring the food out.  When they're handed back and you tell them pickles make you vomit... they bring the same tomato and lettuce that already touched the pickles back.  DO NOT EAT HERE.
