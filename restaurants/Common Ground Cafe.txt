Common Ground Cafe

Text: Always a delight to dine at CommonGrounds. The soups and salads are so fresh and the sandwich choice’s are a must to try them all. But after you meet the friendly folks who run this cafe you will leave here knowing what wonderful people there are in this town of Warsaw.

Text: I was staying in the area and looked Common Ground up on the internet. WOW! I am so glad I went there for dinner. The atmosphere is very inviting as well as the staff. I enjoyed a sandwich with some of their soup. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I have. You need to check them out. Very reasonably priced as well.

Text: Very friendly staff and great atmosphere for lunch and dinner. I've come to this restaurant almost weekly for a year now, and I'm satisfied every time! The sandwiches, salads, and soup are all very good. An assortment of drinks are available and they have not disappointed me when I order something new. Come and enjoy the beautiful architecture, music, food, and staff!

Text: This my family's go to place in Warsaw. After over 20 visits at different times with different people, I'm certain that it deserves a 5 star review. The atmosphere is anything but common. The amount of time and attention spent on the details will not disappoint for any occasion. The bathrooms a spotless and the servers are always kind and warm to children. The food is delicious and the price is fair.
