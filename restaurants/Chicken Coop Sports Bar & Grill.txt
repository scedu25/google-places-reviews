Text: Have enjoyed alot of good bar food while enjoying the husker games! That is until today when the game was just starting and the manager come out and turned all the big t.v.s to the oklahoma state game! When confronted why he would do this he said there was a table of 4 that had been there for an hour and wanted to watch the game! This is Kearney Nebraska!  When asked why we couldnt watch the game on the big t.v.s he basically said to deal with it! Very unprofessional and you just lost weekly customers!

Text: Had a rehearsal dinner for our wedding here! They were excellent!! We chose to have a taco bar (but they have many options including plated dinners). We had the dinner downstairs and it was a fun place with pool tables, modern juke box, a few arcade games. The waiter/bartender did an excellent job of making sure no one had an empty glass. Very happy with the service!!
