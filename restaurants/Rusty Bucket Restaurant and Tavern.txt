Text: Standard Rusty Bucket fare. Nice place to go for a casual lunch during the work week. Outdoor seating has shade umbrellas. The buffalo chicken sandwich here is the best I've ever had. Good root beer on tap. Try the float.

Text: We have had a wonderful experience at rusty bucket.  Our waittress Savannah was a joy and we teased her we will just stay all the way through the Buckeyes game with Nebraska.:-)???
Thank you for your kindness and gracious service...We had a father and son next to us....and she was attentive to this adorable one year old.....no matter how messy little ones can be.
We had a great lunch and will return.

Text: This is definitely the "new albany" version of the Rusty Bucket chain. Brick, nice patio and bar. It's definitely a top go-to hang out spot to watch sports for residents. The bartenders are great and get to know you and your order if you go often enough. Food is good - I recommend the chicken tenders and the buffalo chicken.

Text: Service is very quick around lunchtime, so it is a great place to eat during a lunch hour. Everything on the menu is good. Great beer selection, including local/craft brews.

Text: The New Albany Rusty Bucket has consistently been by far superior in taste than some of the other locations (such as the Easton Rusty Bucket). The cooks must really make a difference! It's the same exact ingredients but in Easton they seemingly just heat the foot up and slap it onto a plate;  In New Albany they know exactly how to prepare the different ingredients individually and then put them together to make fireworks.
