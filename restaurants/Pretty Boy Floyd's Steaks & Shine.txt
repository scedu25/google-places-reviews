Text: The wait was a little long but we weren't in a fast food establishment and that is something to remember. The ambiance is great. The food was amazing. I mean Amazing! Everything was nice and hot when served, cooked to our specifications. Couldn't be happier! 5 stars all day long

Text: Very cool place to eat. Food was good service was friendly and fast. The atmosphere and the decorations are defiantly something to checkout as you walk down the stairs into years gone by.

Text: Found this place on Google Maps when traveling through.  Said it closed at 9. We went in at 8:15. Three help staff walked by the "Wait to be seated " sign and looked at us.  The third one actually smiled and said hi.  Waited about 5 minutes and one came back to tell us the grill is closed and they actually close at 8:00. Hmmm, the door is unlocked.  You would think that the first person who saw us come in could have told us that.
