Text: Very fun place. Great beer, family friendly. I appreciated that there was a place away from all the TVs to enjoy time with the family.

Text: CBC is a very nice restaurant near German Village in Columbus, OH.  There is a wide variety of salads, sandwiches and larger entrees.  It's a good place for a nice business lunch.  I think my chicken sandwich was around 15 dollars, so it's pretty affordable as well.

Text: Great food, great service. CBC is one of those hidden gems. Check it out. Try the roasted chicken salad, the nervous pig sandwich, or the tacos. You won't be dissatisfied.

Text: The service was great. The food was good. We sat outside. The patio was lovely. The inside looked nice as we walked through. The food didn't knock my socks off, which is why only 4 stars, but it was a great experience, and we would definitely go back.

Text: My husband and I came in were treated to a very kind, personal and knowledgeable server (shame on me for not remembering his name) and ordered drinks (Mary Jane, and two beers for him, both of which he really enjoyed) and an appetizer to start (AMAZING nachos--HUGE portion!). We ordered entrees, but had a ton of nachos to work through. The manager thought that our entrees took too long to come out from the kitchen (though, honestly, we didn't notice due to the nacho coma) and he took care of our check! The restaurant had already earned a return visit based on the merit of the food/drink alone, but now I will shout it from the rooftops: DEFINITELY go check this place out! I feel very confident that a remarkable experience is offered to every guest, and you will leave with a full belly and happy heart!
