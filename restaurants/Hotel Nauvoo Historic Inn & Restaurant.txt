Hotel Nauvoo Historic Inn & Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Delicious food that tastes homemade. Large dining areas. You do not have to be a hotel guest to eat here for dinner. The bathrooms were clean. It's got a lot of historical significance. They also offer free postcards to send home!

Text: My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Nauvoo Historic Inn in late August. This is a great time to visit Nauvoo.  The peak tourist season is over and the hordes have evaporated.  Our room at the inn was small and a bit cramped with the double bed and desk, but comfortable enough for us as we did not spend much time in the room.  The structure is very old with various additions over time kluged together, yet still in pretty good condition.  Quaint, not quite dilapidated. The wifi worked well enough.

We took the inn's dinner buffet the first night we arrived.  The buffet certainly can be filling and the offerings could be described as comfort food, but we would not describe it as high quality fare.  We weren't unhappy with the food, but never felt inclined to dine there again.  We found we could get just as satisfying meals at the other local eateries for somewhat less money.  Also, where the Historic Inn buffet was still fairly busy with non-resident customers even in the off season, we had a chance to visit with the proprietors of the other eateries who were really glad to serve us as we were their only customers.

Text: We came for dinner and ordered the buffet. We had to wait but I'm not entirely sure why because the dining room is huge and they weren't very busy. The food was all very good. The options were pretty standard American classic comfort foods. Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, roast beef, turkey, a few selections of vegetables, yams. Nothing unexpected. The salad bar had enough variety to make a very good salad, though the only cucumber available was pickled, which I was not keen on. Not a lot by way of dessert, and my husband said the warm apple crisp was not good. But we really enjoyed the food overall, and would definitely eat there again.

Text: Sleep, eat or both. This is a very nice place to visit in this historical town. The good is good though they have limited hours. I love the small town way of doing things so you have to be prepared a little for that but they have very clean rooms, polite service, and a rich atmosphere.

Text: Historic hotel in the heart of a historic town. Great buffet of homestyle food. The place to stay in Nauvoo; we stayed here right after I proposed to my girlfriend.
