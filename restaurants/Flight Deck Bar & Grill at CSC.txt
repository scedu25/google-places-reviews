Flight Deck Bar & Grill at CSC
Rating: 4
Text: This was our first visit to the flight deck. Three of the four of us had the fish fry.  Four nice sized pieces of fresh cod. Homemade potato chips and Cole slaw. The fish meal was great. One person had the salad which they didn't like. Watching the sky divers was great entertainment.  We will come back again. We will also recommend it to others.

Text: Not a good experience. Had to ask to have the table washed before ordering. Ordered the veggie wrap. It was filled with two huge brussels sprouts that were so hard. Had to remove them in order to eat the rest of the wrap. The onion rings and chips were good.

Text: Best food in Rochelle Illinois.  It's totally awesome being able to watch the skydivers land while you eat.

Text: The food is good and the atmosphere is great. You can watch skydivers when the weather is nice. However, your should expect to wait for your food and sometimes the service is really slow. We left once after 45 minutes without anyone coming to our table.
