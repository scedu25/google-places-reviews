Text: Great food, quiet atmosphere, full bar. Jacqueline was our server and she was quick and humorous.  A class act all around. The chef even made a custom pizza for my mom. Was very pleased.

Text: Our friends who now us...know we are food snobs.  I forgot to review this place on Friday.  We actually both forgot our cell phones, I highly recommend that for everyone!  The husband always love the pizza, Sunday they have specials...My favorite has always been the Philly Steak sandwich (no green peppers for me).  Every time we go, no matter what time of day...they are always consistent. 

One negative- stay away from the cheese sauce for your fries...
