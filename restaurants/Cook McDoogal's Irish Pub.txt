Text: Quiet Monday, great staff. Ran out of main dinner item and corned beef and cabbage was average at best. Never heard of sauerkraut in colcanon or bangers and mash. Krauts got mixed with the Micks maybe.

Text: Good food, really slow service at the time of this rating. Price, food, and beer are good but the last couple times I've been there it's been 20 minutes between drinks and more for the check.

Excluding the slow service times I've had no other issues.
