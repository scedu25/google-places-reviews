Fashion Outlets of Chicago
Rating: 4
Text: Expansive mall with a huge selection of stores. Lots of parking available.  Food court isn't that big so good options are limited.  Proximity to MB financial park is good in case you want to go for drinks or some restaurants.

Text: Was fine, but seems difficult to get into if you get there on foot. I stayed across the street at aloft and although it seems easy the entrances are made mainly for people who arrive in vehicles. Stores were good and staff at the ones I went to was super nice.

Text: 10 mins from Airport so handy place  to spend a few hours if you have a layover.  Good selection of shops along wirh a food court. There is a courtesy bus that runs to a local train station which will bring you to and from the airport or grab a cab.
