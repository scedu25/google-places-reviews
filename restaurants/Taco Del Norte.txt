Text: I have never had a bad experience at a Mexican restaurant in my life, and I have been to tons. The gucuamole was blan, had no flavor the "chicken" I requested for my nachos tasted like pork, I had to pick and chose to try and force myself to eat it , while my boyfriend ordered the enchilada which he loves and the sauce on it was absolutely repulsive. I told them I wasn't going to pay for food I had no intentions on eating. Taco Bell has Better food then this place and that says a lot!!! I do NOT recommend.
