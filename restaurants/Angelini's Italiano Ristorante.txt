Angelini's Italiano Ristorante

Text: We had a very unpleasant experience with screaming kids running back and forth to your restrooms. My prime rib has been better on other visits.  Our waitress only asked once "as we had finished our dinner" if we wanted a drink refill of wine. Please request unruly children to be more respectful of others. The parent should have stopped the kids from that behavior AND why would they let very small kids go to the bathroom by themselves. Most likely won't be back.  Try crackers or coloring pages or something to keep them busy while waiting for food. Or tell them to try McDonalds. My complaint to our waitress was answered , "they are getting ready to leave."  In other woods....too bad!  I feel like we spent $56.00 for a bad dinner experience.
