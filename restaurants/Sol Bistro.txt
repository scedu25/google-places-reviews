Text: Had the shrimp tacos which were excellent. Went with a group of 20 and they handled it with little problem. Staff was friendly and nice. Watch out the cornbread is spicy, the kids didn't care for it but their looks were great.

Text: Great servers, unique and delicious dishes, neat and clean restaurant. Salmon is always on point(cooked correctly), can't go wrong with a horseshoe, and try a sampler of guacamole, queso dip, and shrimp/scallop ceviche! Warm corn bacon salad is a must!!

Text: We had a large party last night that came in right after another large group.  Our waitress was on top of drinks & food orders the entire time, and the food (as always) was great.  The chicken meatloaf is my favorite, but I've never had anything I haven't liked here.

Text: Queso best ever!! 3 amigos appetizer, horseshoe, muffins, queso mash & stuffed pork chop all well above average. Flavors done well with a hint of heat was good even to my not so versed pallet. Good service will return soon we hope. Hostess seems to quick and to the point only negative of whole experience.
