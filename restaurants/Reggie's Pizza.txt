Reggie's Pizza

Text: I drove all the way from Manhattan (KS) for Reggie's Pizza and it did not disappoint! They have top notch customer service and the pizza and cheesy bread were phenomenal! I would definitely recommend Reggie's to anyone wanting a quality product. Get out and support your local business! Also, just a quick note, they do have salads.

Text: Super pizza.  Friendly staff.  Stopped on our way to Minnesota.   Too bad parents don't teach their children some manners and how to act in public.  They can ruin a good business fast.
