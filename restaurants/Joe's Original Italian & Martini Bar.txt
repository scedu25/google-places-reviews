Joe's Original Italian & Martini Bar
Rating: 3
Text: Fine dining but in a relaxed atmosphere. Great staff and the food is always amazing! Steaks are the best in the area. Pricing is reasonable for a fine dining restaurant.

Text: Took 3 hours to finish through to dessert. Waitress was rude, blamed my wife for spilling salad dressing all over my wife's white blazer and took forever to bring the check. Food was decent.

Text: The food was good, but the wait staff was not knowledgeable about the food offerings.

Text: Went on a Saturday night and couldn't have asked for better food and service. The bread they brought out was right out of the oven and food came out quickly. I had the seared tuna which was delicious and my wife had the oven roasted salmon over their house macaroni which I would come back just for that. Lived in Peoria for almost five years and can't believe we have not been to Seven until now. Will be back for sure.
