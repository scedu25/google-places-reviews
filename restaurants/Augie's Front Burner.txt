Text: Popped in today while walking around downtown for a little historical site seeing. I had my two puppies with me and I am so glad I stopped! I had the lobster bisque, duck and sangria. Well worth the price and sitting out on their patio was so peaceful and beautiful! My server Alexa was super attentive and wonderful and kept my glass (and the puppy bowl!) full. I would highly recommend both Alexa and the restaurant for sure.

Text: Absolutely unbelievable mouth watering food. It's well thought out and paired with perfection with really interesting sides and salads! Service is exemplary! It is a small restaurant but it is mighty!!

Text: As my dining companion put it, it's remarkable to find a menu so exceptional paired with a decor that...isn't. I've been here a few times. The only food-related disappointment I've experienced was with the fish tacos that were on special last time I was there. Otherwise great.

Text: Lunch service was  HORRIBLE and the grilled quesadilla tasted line salmon because it was all groomed on the same grill... NOT pleased
