Text: I drive from Pittsburgh to come here! The decor is AWESOME! Every table has a phone to "call" your order in. The food is always delicious, and service is friendly. Definitely a must see!

Text: Best pizza around.  Get the Royal Feast.  Breadsticks are unique and also very good.

Text: Clara's/Pizza King's food tastes great. No doubt about it. Some of the evening staff here is lousy and the place REALLY needs updated. You'll like the food but you may be disappointed in the service. We definitely were.

Text: We had pizza here with the family. It  took us over an hour to get our food after we ordered.  The service was not good.  We were all disappointed because we use to love going here when the family gets together. It has changed and not for the better.
