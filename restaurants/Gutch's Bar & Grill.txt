Gutch's Bar & Grill

Text: Serious potential but a few snags holding them back. We have lived in Hays for a while & thoroughly explored it's restaurant scene (multiple times). Gutch's had potential (they have an amazing beer named after them, for goodness sake!) However, after a multitude of trips, they don't quite make "the greats" list. 
Here's why:
Fazoli's level food for exorbitant prices. They are consistently understaffed & they nickel & dime you for every condiment or extra (i.e. you must pay extra for a tomato slice on your burger, or a side of ranch, or a drink with a kid's meal... the list goes on). There is a reason this place almost always empty despite the cool atmosphere.  This place could really be awesome!!  They have a great burger (c'mon guys, just include condiments, it's not so hard), have more than one server on at a time... basics;.. & they'd be exploding with business.!

Text: Being from out of town the front of the restaurant looks pretty unassuming but the food was great and my kids loved their pizza.  It's a bar/restaurant establishment.   We epically loved the Defiance beer in tap.

Text: I love the pizza here! The other food is pretty good too but the pizza is amazing. The atmosphere is pretty nice too.

Text: I got a simple cheese pizza. When I ate it was burnt and bland. There wasn't any seasoning. I also got a chicken fettuccine Alfredo without the chicken because I'm a vegetarian and the meal was still $14 without the chicken. Very disappointed
