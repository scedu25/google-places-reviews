Text: Really good service and food came quickly as well.  Friendly service who treat their senior customers with respect.  A great place to get a good meal while traveling as well.

Text: I've never been to a Big Boy before so can't compare it to others. Our waitress was very, very nice and knowledgeable about the history of the Big Boy chain (my children kept asking her questions about it) and the shakes were really good but unfortunately our food was only sub par. Everything just seemed really dry, not juicy like we had hoped. We all ordered burgers and onion rings and they were all just okay.

Text: Did was awful. The pasta tasted like they just mixed in tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. We ordered dessert and cancelled the order after waiting 15 minutes for simple scoops of ice cream. Overall good service and quality was very poor at this location and I could not recommend it to anyone. You're better off going to McDonalds across the way.

Text: Big Boy was very good! The waiters were very nice! The food was very yummy too. The only problem I had was timing. It took a very long time to get our food. Overall it was amazing and I highly recommend this resturant .
