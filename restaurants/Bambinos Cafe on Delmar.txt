Bambinos Cafe on Delmar
Rating: 4
Text: Very popular place. Good place to get in and out for lunch, if you get in (some times it's pretty busy.) They have accommodated large groups on their patio for more than one group I've been with. Food is fine, but I can't say I have had anything that stood out. But it's frequented by regulars, so it might just be my tastes. Difficult to find parking sometimes.

Text: My mom and I visited Bambinos while we were in Springfield for the day. We thought Google was taking us in the wrong direction and then suddenly there it was!. It's a cozy, little cafe and walking up to the front door we were greeted with the smells of what promised to be a delicious lunch. I got nervous thinking there might be a wait (we were limited on time) but we were able to get a table right away. We received bread, butter, and minced garlic before we even ordered. Everything on the menu looked delicious but we both ended up getting The Diana and were not disappointed. Everything tasted fresh and authentic. And the service was fantastic as well. I have absolutely no complaints! I would eat here again if I'm ever in Springfield.

Text: How could you not love this place!? The girls that serve you are AMAZING and so pleasant. They truly take care of you! The food is to die for cheesy bread and spinach artichoke dip are always fantastic. Weve been several times and have never had a bad experience or less than mouthwatering food. We drive an hour and always love the experience and leave with full bellies!

Text: Tried this spot based off of the 417 magazine reviews. Food was fair priced and fair in flavor. Pasta was Luke warm with cool temp sausage. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was fair also.

Text: A homey resturant that sells Italian food. The staff is very helpful and has a good work ethic. My favorite Bambinos location in Springfield.
