Text: Had the Belly Buster Breakfast and it was delicious! Best coffee ever! My husband had to finish my breakfast; it truly was a Belly Buster. Highly recommend the buffet. All you can eat fried chicken with the trimmings.

Text: Worst hamburger ever,,over done,,,took 20mins to get then chipped a tooth. Hash browns sat in a plate of grease. Manager was rude with no sense of customer service.  Not going to darken this door or recommend it again :-( Going to dentist in the morning, painful!!!
