Text: it is fun if you can afford it. it is rather expensive and if you aren't worried about a budget this is the place for you. paid $16 for two people to play 18 holes of miniature golf in the dark with a black light on. you could make a better course in your garage and backyard. the games are expensive, food and everything else. it was fun and I enjoyed myself until I saw how much I was spending and that killed the mood. maybe your take will be different than mine. enjoy

Text: We attended a party hosted here and that was our first experience here. Nice place. Lots of games for everyone to enjoy. And food for the party was arranged by them which was also good. The party hall is of pretty good size.

Text: Awesome place to go for the latest video games. Also has outdoor volleyball courts, a few bars and a couple places to eat snacks or meals. I love taking my kids here.

Text: Fun place. I was visiting from out of town and decided to check it out with my brother and nephew. Kind of like a Dave and Buster's, but with a better mix of adult and kids entertainment.

Text: Its a lot of fun, but if you're bringing younger kids, go earlier on a weekday. On the weekends or in the evening, it gets VERY crowded, and staff aren't able to keep older kids and adults from plowing through the younger kids. Too many teenagers running amok without supervision. Go karts are the best part!
