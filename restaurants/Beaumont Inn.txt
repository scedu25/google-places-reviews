Beaumont Inn

Text: I've stayed her many times over the years and always love getting back. If you're looking for warm, comfortable, old school charm and hospitality then this is the place. If you like unhurried, relaxed, sitting on the front porch, watching the world go by, then this is the place. If you like good southern food served in a quaint, beautiful dining room that will make you think you're at your grandma's, or served in a tavern that will remind you of your favorite pub, then this is the place.
Come here to relax, unwind, unplug and get away.

Text: The inn is charming and our room clean and comfortable with a good bed and a good shower. 
We had dinner and breakfast in the dining room and both were excellent. 
The staff is why I gave this place 5 stars. They embrace southern hospitality as naturally as breathing.
We hope to come back someday.

Text: A touch of heaven.Relax in Old Kentucky Life Style. The Hotel will draw you from your awesome antique furnished room to explore its hallways and parlors. There are three restaurants a gift shop and a room dedicated  to Bourbon tasting. Then walk the grounds in the evening to give you the chance to take it all in and appreciate your fortunate experience. You have to go to appreciate it.
