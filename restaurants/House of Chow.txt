Text: The service was really great and the staff was friendly. The Beef Stew and Pork Bao were amazing. We sent our tofu dish back to the kitchen but got it back with more flavor. Overall great experience. Will be going back.

Text: Best chinese food in town. Manager is always attempting to improve upon this already wonderful foundation. You will not be disappointed. Americanized dishes test wonderful. Want authenticity? Ask for the optional authentic menu. Try something off of  their delicious tea menu! I love what they are doing here

Text: They refused to seat me because my partner was not there. Their excuse was because it's a weekend and they're busy and in case another party comes so they can be seated. Ridiculous service! There were 6 open tables. Their food is okay, definitely recommend better service.

The new owner is very nice and he has done a lot to update the inside. Very pretty. However...we have been going there for 20 years and it has only been recently that there have been problems. I usually call for take out, but many times the phone is not answered. Last week we ordered our usual take out. When we got it home, the pot stickers had burned through the Styrofoam carries so the were inedible. I called and complained and what really bothered me is that he knew this had been happening and did nothing about it. Its a new chef, we were told. I don't care if the chef was born yesterday, we got our food home and had to throw it away. Of course he offered us a replacement or refund but who wants to drive an hour round trip to pick up what should have been made correctly in the first place. I hope he gets his act together.
