Text: One of my favorite music venues ever. All employees are very friendly. We had a great experience with a security guard I believe his name was Michael. Only issue I have is at a lot of shows they are overbooked and it is hard to find a decent place to stand. Other than that, this is an amazing venue.

Text: We were here to see Kasabian a few weeks ago and had a great time. It was our first show there, but we loved the venue and would absolutely come back. Staff was great, professional and responsive; they kept everything flowing smoothly, with minimum confusion or drama, and made sure everybody had a good night. Bars were easy to get to and drinks were decent value for the price.

Text: Went to the restaurant on a Saturday night when a band was playing in the event space above. The whole building shakes when people are dancing above and ceiling visibly vibrates a couple of inches up and down. Waitress assured us that was a design feature. Food was great, bands on the small stage in the restaurant were good, service was pleasant, but the overall experience of the roof falling in wasn't so great!

Text: Better than expected.  Terrific music, fun time.  Stumbled onto the place when out for a walk while visiting the city.  Band was great.. food was good.  Recommend.
