Text: The owner is such a nice person, very sweet and will help out in the community with items, cards, sponsorship for youth program and charity events. The food is awesome, and beats Subway hands down. A little on the pricey side, but worth the few extra dollars compared to Subway. Sometimes the teenage employees aren't the most outgoing or enthusiastic, but you have that everywhere.
