Text: Friendly staff in pro shop. Fun course to play that has challenges but not over complicated. The grass and greens were all in very good shape.

Text: I had a great time playing here. The course is in wonderful shape and the greens were the best I've played on all year. Staff is very friendly and it's very affordable. Will come back to play often.

Text: I visit my brother in Carbondale every year and we always play a round of golf while I'm there. We played here last year for the first time and will be returning this year because it's a very nice course at a decent rate. And the staff is very helpful as well, which is harder to find than it should be. As an ex-assistant golf pro (quit to be able to play more golf) at an amazing country club in northern indiana, I can say that Jackson County keeps their course in great shape. Can't wait to play there again later this month
