Text: Celebrated my son's 13th bday party here and ordered our meals. The waitress wasn't friendly like usual and when refilling drinks reached over my mother in law's plate and my sons to give me my drink back. My wife and I ordered the Mexican flag dinners and so she got the salad bar and shared a couple chips with my 5 year old step son. When I went to the register I looked at my bill and was wondering about a charge if 1.49. so I asked the lady and so she had the waitress come over and clarify the charge and she's like well I saw you guys shared some chips with the 2nd youngest and so I charged for the salad bar. And so I said he had a couple chips too which the other waitress says well if you go to a Chinese restaurant and try to do the same thing they will charge you for it. I was irritated so I said nevermind I will never come back here and said run my card and I'll leave. The last time we went there had bad service and our food was not fully warmed up and when I talked to the owner he said oh maybe the microwave wasn't working right. I get that my stepson ate some chips but it's not like he had his own bowl of chips and salsa. Spent over 135 bucks between the last two times and that will be the last time we will ever go.....

Text: Food is good. I recommend the Vera Cruz dinner. "Bring your appetite" not to bad for the price you pay. You got to try the Rosada salsa "the pink one" it's amazing"
