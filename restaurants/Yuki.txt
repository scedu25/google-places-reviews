Text: Staff was courteous, prices were as expected for Hibachi, and the Chef was kind.  We enjoyed the sushi as well.  Compared to other Hibachi's/Japanese steakhouses I have eaten at in other locations (not in Topeka) I have had better tasting Hibachi, but my husband and I still enjoyed it.  I am partial to yum yum sauce with Hibachi (which they do not have so that was disappointing!).  They make their own mustard sauce for the rice and whatever else you wish to use it with, but I am not a fan of mustard and didn't care for the sauce so that effected how much I liked the food.  The rice still tasted pretty good though and I ate it, it just wasn't my favorite.  My husband really liked it.

Text: Yuki is the best sushi in town. Jason will take care of you while providing exquisite plates both in presentation and taste. Fresh fresh fresh, with amazing daily specials. Great sake selection as well. Won't go anywhere else in topeka for sushi.

Text: Ate here Saturday afternoon it was excellent. Food was great. decor was very authentic Japanese. The waiter was attentive and very curtious and pretty damn funny. The sushi chef came out himself to make sure we were enjoying our rolls *which were fantastic* and chatted with us a bit. I've been to Tokyo before and this was just like walking into a restaurant there *except Yuki is spacious*. I love this restaurant and will be returning frequently.

Text: Used to be Sakura, I believe. Either way, the food is amazing, staff friendly and always treat us well. There are two sides - a sushi bar with extra seating and a small bar on one side, a hibachi grill on the other, but you can order food items from both sides no matter where you sit. We went to Sakura under the old ownership, and continue to go to it as Yuki and will always love it. One of my favorite places in Topeka.
