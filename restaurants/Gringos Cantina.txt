Gringos Cantina

Text: The food was great. People who complain just bought something they didn't like in the first place. Place is always packed on weekends for a reason. Great drinks and unlimited chips with salsa and sour cream! Love to eat at Gringos.

Text: Prices are rediculously high for prepackaged food. The waitress even told us the food comes already made but the could alter it for us. It was bland and barely warm. I was so excited to try them since all the locals told me its great. I've been here for almost a year now without trying them so I said why not. Waste of 48 dollars for 2 people. The only good thing was good and the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars and not 1 is because their beer was cold and the strawberry daiquiri I ordered was amazing. I will not ever be coming back here. You are warned.

Text: Got the lunch special beef burrito. Was pretty filling. I ordered it take out, didn't have to wait long, and i made it home to a still hot meal!!! Kinda higher priced though for a special. All in all good experience.

Text: Five star hangout!  Not an unnecessarily fancy or pretentious restaurant, but it still gets five stars for consistently great tex-mex and great service.  A great place to bring the family to eat without a lot of drama.
