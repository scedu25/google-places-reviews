Text: After a long day of Storm Chasing about a month ago, this place served us up some amazing food. And the other 5 people in my group thought the same thing. Thank you for your excellent service! I will definitely go back if I'm in the area again.

Text: Great burger. This place isn't much to look at from the outside or inside, but there is always friendly staff and good food. Don't let the looks fool you
