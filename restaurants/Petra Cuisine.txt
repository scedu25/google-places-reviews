Text: this place is sooooo good. I mean like dang it so good but far away from where i live. I live in Blue ash cincinnati and go down to Newport like twice a month. the last time i came to Newport I decided to try Petra. It is really small so i felt like there wasn't going to be a lot for me to choose. however the size does not matter because they have a wide variety of choices. I got the falafel sandwich after the owner told me he was going to hook me up since i am a vegetarian. I am so glad i listened it was so freaking good. I got it with cucumber sauce, tomatoes, light onions, chili sauce, oregano, red roasted peppers, cheddar cheese, a little mixed salad that is homemade, lettuce, banana peppers, light black olives and a little feta cheese. damn it was so good. I will be back! guess one of my trips to newport this month will be there!
