Text: We met our grandson and his girlfriend for dinner tonight for his birthday.  We hadn't been to Sullys in a long time because the last time we had a bad experience of our fish not being cooked all the way done! It was disgusting to say the least and we still had to pay for it!
Tonight our meals were very good.,and also done and hot. I had a grilled chicken salad that was very fresh.  
I hope this is the way it is now.  
Thank you for a memorable evening!

Text: Very poor service. Understood server at end of shift but she couldn't even walk the extra step to reach our table. Everything placed with fingertips on edge. Forgot my order and then covered herself so we felt obligated to buy. First time ever I never left a tip.
