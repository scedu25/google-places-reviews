Angelo's

Text: I came here for lunch and enjoyed it very much. The food for lunch is premade and you go down a line selecting what you want. It makes the process very quick and easy. You can either sit down and have a nice/quiet dinner or take it to go. The food was tasty. If you are downtown for lunch, I would recommend Angelo's.

Text: One of the best Italian places to eat in town. Lunch is quick, easy and delish!!! Waaay more authentic and better food than Olive Garden. Once you eat here you'll never want OG again. Good people too!!! Right on walkway in downtown Evansville! Love IT?

Text: My favorite place downtown for Italian food. Lunch is more affordable.  Dinner is more elegant. Food and service are always good no matter when you go.

Text: I didn't eat I was just in the area and decided to fill out the missing information.  Walked in and talked to the manager.  Really friendly guy.  They have "The Gondola Room"  basically a party room downstairs they rent out.

Text: The food was pretty good, but the manager  (or what looked to be the manager) was kind of a jerk.  First off it's rude to judge your customers based on their looks.  I would recommend not coming in looking as if you have no money, because you'll be treated like so.  Also, he needs to learn how to place food on the table instead of tossing it at you.  We're human beings not animals, also silverware would be nice to give your customers as well.  Overall the service sucked, but if you're into being treated like the common peasant then this is the place for you.  Little Angelo's in Newburgh is way better!
