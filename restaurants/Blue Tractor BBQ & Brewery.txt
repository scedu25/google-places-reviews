Blue Tractor BBQ & Brewery

Text: The selection of their house beers is impressive, 12 when I was there. The carnivore burger was excellent when you add a fried egg. The smoked wings were tasty, but the wife ordered the dry rubbed and said they were too dry and spicy.

Text: Really excited to eat here because I had heard great things. We were told we had a 45 minute wait and went to grab a drink at the bar. Being polite, after an hour we went to check in on the table and they said it would be another 30 minutes. After another 30 minutes they told us they accidentally gave away our table and they'd get us a table in the next 15 minutes. At that point we just left - not worth it :(

Text: Fun, affordable, and delicious. Wait staff was great. Food was great. Appetizer was wonderful (fried pickles with the white bbq sauce). Happily would return to try some of the brews made in house. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for a bite and it seemed liked a cool place to have a beer.

Text: We had just found out my father in law had passed away after his second battle with cancer and didn't feel like cooking so went out. The hostess gave us a nice table in a back corner for privacy and the waitress, Olga, was amazing. Great food and service. The bar mixed a perfect rusty nail, which is uncommon in my experience. The pretzel appetizer was amazing and we loved the mustard sauce that came with them. The chef not only provided a recipe when asked, bit a pint of the sauce to take home as well at no charge. Perfectly cooked food and excellent service. We will come back again for sure.
