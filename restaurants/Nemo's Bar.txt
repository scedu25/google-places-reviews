Text: Service is always great here. Shuttle is always super convenient but now a bit expensive, especially now that they also charge for parking. Burgers are good.  Beers are cold but not cheap. Also not taking CC is a pain in the ass.

Text: Everything was fine I ate outside but the menu there was only about five things on the menu I'm a vegetarian there was not one entree item for vegetarian so I ended up with just an order of fries and a side of coleslaw and that wasn't enough for me I left out of there still hungry

Text: We're told as we cash out that it's cash only and the ATM is across from us. It's 2017. I don't carry cash nor do I want to pay $3 in ATM fees. The food was terrible, I left half my sandwich behind. I enjoyed my drink. There's better places to go. I'm leaving this place with two stars because the drink wasn't terrible like everything else was.

Text: Good burgers.  Like the busses to event but no more writing on the walls - new busses.

Text: We are parents of four grown children. We took them all there before the Tigers game yesterday.  My husband and I had been there a couple years ago and had a great time and thought our kids would love it.  We got there, they were not busy at all. The bartender was straight up rude and acted like us being there was a bother to him.  Pat was great, it was the older guy who had attitude. (He could have been the owner for all we know). It's not like we were a bunch of obnoxious kids. We were 6 grown adults who had planned to stay, drop more than a few bucks on beer and burgers and take the shuttle to the game.  We left and took our business to a competitor. Sorry to say, we will not be back.
