Text: Drove 30+ miles to eat here .  I was disappointed because the bbq on the hot bar was Luke warm at best and was not fresh .  Nothing on the hot bar was fresh and the rolls were hard as a brick .  The salad was good though......but that's not saying much . I guess we should have gone to Long John Silvers across the road . Service was good and beverage was cold though ! It was 3:30 pm but the hot bar should have been tended to better !
