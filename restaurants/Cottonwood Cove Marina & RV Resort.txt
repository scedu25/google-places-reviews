Text: Food is great, burgers, fish n chips, pizza, nachos, all really good. Came out fast and they were pretty busy. The kitchen has come a long way in improving since our first visit. My wife and I love it, we stop in every time we're going by, and our picky 2 year old loves their chicken strips!
Definitely worth a try!

Text: Ugh! Where do I start. I live in Blair and would truly come visit more often if the service and food was at least a 3 out of 5 stars. We come once or twice during the summer to see if the food and service got better. Once again, we were disappointed. I am a friend of the band that was playing there Friday night. We had a 6 top and another 10 top. Not once did a waitress come take care of us in the 3 1/2-4 hrs we were there. We had to go up to the bar to get our own drinks. The drink machine never gives you a clean drink. My vodka water always has a hint of whiskey in it. The food is nothing special. If we plan to go to your place, like Friday, we plan to eat at the nearby steakhouse before going on to your place.
