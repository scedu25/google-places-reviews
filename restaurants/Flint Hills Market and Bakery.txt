Flint Hills Market and Bakery
Rating: 5
Text: We got there just as they were getting ready to close, we were on our way to Wichita and I was telling Roy about the bakery and we just decided to go ahead and stop! We got the best and I mean best zucchini bread with chocolate chips that either one of us has ever had! We also got a box of donuts and you could tell a huge difference between their donuts and the donuts like you would get at the grocery store in their Deli because the ones at Flint Hills market we're definitely homemade and absolutely fabulous!

Text: We ended up here by accident, looking for another place that we had heard about in Florence, but it was no longer there. I am so glad we did. We bought some kaloshes, maybe galoshes, pastries with fruit in the middle, frosting drizzled on top. Delicious. I crave that dang peach one now. Brought some home, just 4, wish I would have purchased more. We all ate one, my son asked me why I didn't buy more? It is only about 50 miles or so from Wichita. Need to go back.

Text: Such a beautiful and nostalgic atmosphere. Tasty sandwiches with homemade bread and the cookies were delicious! Can't wait for my next visit so I can try something new. I've heard the pizza is amazing!

Text: I like to go there  to have a cup of coffee and read/study.  It is a great place to meet friends for coffee or lunch,---they have great, reasonably priced bakery goodies to eat.  There is a gift shop in the front of the store that is beautifully decorated.  A nice seating area for small group meetings.
