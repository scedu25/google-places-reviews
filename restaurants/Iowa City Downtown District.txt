Iowa City Downtown District

Text: I would give the downtown area a 5 star-it's  very cute and you can tell the city takes care is it. I gave it a 2 star because you can't actually enjoy it because you can't walk down the street/ped mall without walking through cigarette smoke. You aren't supposed to smoke downtown, but it's not enforced.

Text: The ped mall is the local Iowa City downtown walking area that contains restaurants, the public library, retail shops, hotels, bars, and outdoor seating areas. A home to many a festival as well as the IC homeless!

There is a large play area of children, more benches than you can shake a stick at and an area with water spouts that make arches for kids to run under. 

There are a plethora of bars and restaurants in the ped mall, the majority of which have outdoor seating, perfect for a drink or bite on a nice evening.  Additionally, there is often live music on the ped mall, be it from choirs, local musicians or, periodically, more well known artists.

A nice place to kick back and relax on a nice afternoon or catch a bite to eat in the evening!
