Bonzai Steak Teriyaki & Sushi

Text: Best place in Kirksville for ?.  Portions are quite large and price is very reasonable.  Its rather nice on the inside as well.  Not what you'd expect walking outside.

They have funky hours so make sure you get in at the right time.  No alcohol but otherwise would be a great place for a date.  Every time I eat here I wonder why I'm not here more often.

Text: The food here is awesome. Probably the best sushi I have ever had. Great deals but odd hours. So call before making a long trip. But well worth the drive!

Text: The food is the only thing I like about this place. Every time I've been here the food has been good but everything else was terrible. I once waited an hour and a half for my sushi and when I got the bill it was $9 more than I had expected. Get sushi from the SUB at Truman if you really want some sushi in Kirksville.

Text: Cozy dark atmosphere and tasty sushi.  Only dinged them because wasabi and ginger cost extra.  I've never been to a sushi restaurant that pulled that before!
