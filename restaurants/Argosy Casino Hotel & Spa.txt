Argosy Casino Hotel & Spa

Text: Nice place but nothing extra special for the higher price. Nice large shower and casino is quaint. Was there on a Friday night so it was pretty busy and smoky. Buffet is basic but good....nothing out of the ordinary for the expensive price.

Text: Nice place. However the first front desk employee was rude and dismissive. They lost our reservation and acted like it was my fault, he was to busy talking with a friend to be of any help, even though I had already paid for my room; but claimed that they had no room for me. The next lady was apologetic and polite. She had us checked in and headed to our room promptly.

Text: Review is for the Journeys Steakhouse at the casino. Great service and steaks served up Thursday to Sunday. Staff is helpful and not too intrusive, prices are medium for each diner. Good presentation on the platings.

Text: The service, selection of different meats and vegetables is what we enjoy.  However, it is buffet dining and it is somewhat pricey.  If you reserve a room, make sure everyone eat and is counted.  If not, you may be charged for a just taking a seat.

Text: Nice rooms with beautiful glass showers. Had a blast in the casino. Came out $250 ahead. All the restaurants were good. Hotel is very clean. Staff was very nice. There is no bell service. Look forward to visiting again.
