Two Brothers Roundhouse
Rating: 4
Text: I like going here and the ambiance is really very singular as the roundhouse building is a cool place to visit. The food is fine, but the Two Brothers brewery has gotten more ambitious and interesting with their beers in the last few years. In a good way. I'll continue to go here as it's convenient and historic. I'll just hope the food will match the level of the brewing growth.

Text: Very cool spot.  The roundhouse alone is worth a visit.  Two Brothers has a well-earned reputation for quality beer, and their vast selection of seasonals makes this a great stop anytime.  Food is higher priced and not huge portions, but you do get something good!

Text: Went to see the bands. Wasn't horribly busy but still waited an hour for our food. Manager made it right.  Had multiple servers which probably added to the confusion with the food. Nice atmosphere and good beer. I'll give them a second chance in the future.

Text: Was quite impressed by the Roundhouse burger and enjoyed one of the seasonal Oktoberfest beers. Nice ambiance and service come together for a really cool place to grab a bite and/or drink. Enjoyed a coffee after dinner in their café area as well.

Text: Beer was good. But the food was terrible. Not what we expected from a brewery. Normally we would pay a lot for a premium dinner. Here was on the cheaper side and unfortunately the food was not that great. We never have to go back again. But. The green bean app was great!
