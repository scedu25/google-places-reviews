Text: Good dinner and service at the bar. Their signature Spiced Manhattan was well worth trying.

Text: I would give this spot a 2.5 star. The place is new renovated fancy etc. 

I did not try the drinks so cannot comment on this. My poor review is due to the lack luster quality of service and quality of food at this place. 

I ordered a Mexican Chicken Salad - the chicken was dry and cold. It seemed old. Almost like rotisserie style and left over chicken used here. 

When I brought this to the attention of my server she said sorry and that's it. No follow up. No real aptitude to capture feedback or make things right. 

Highly disappointing for a Hotel brand of such stature. 

Here's the issue - this is the only semi fancy spot in a few miles radius - tired business travelers such as me, who get back to hotel late work - want to just grab something at the hotel and go to bed. 

And after a long day's work - such poor quality of food and service cannot be pardoned. 

My buddies got burgers and were not impressed either. 

Marriott - you gotta do better!
