Text: Update : This place isn't as good as it used to since key staff have moved on.  The great staff have opened their own shop " Los Jalapeños." It is the same great food. Reminds me of So Cal. they are by Hwy 283/ Prospect. The 5 stars are for the staff that moved not the current restaurant.

Text: On a family road trip and decided to forgo fast food and eat at locally owned restaurants whenever possible. So glad we stopped here. Plan was to pick up a "little food" and then take it to a nearby park for kids to run and play and we could supplement restaurant food with apples, carrot, chips, drinks etc that we have in the car. There was asolutely no need for that! Portions were huge and delicious!  Family of four ordered 2 burritos (soft and chewy tortillas) and 2 tortas for $23. We easily could have ordered one of each and been just fine.  Drive right by Taco Bell and stop here instead. So worth it.
