Pizza Kitchen

Text: Hidden gem in rural Milford, NE. Great food, great service, friendly, and very reasonable. Reminder of the good old days, when every small town had their own locally owned and operated restaurants. I wish it was still that way.

Text: Pizza Kitchen is easily the best place to eat in town. Their service is exceptional and they have food to match. Their pizza is great and their chicken is supreme!
