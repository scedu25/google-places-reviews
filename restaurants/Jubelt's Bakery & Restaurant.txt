Jubelt's Bakery & Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Great food. Great service. Glad we stopped in during a road trip. We purchased pies and bakery goods on the promise that they could give us a bag of ice for the cooler, but upon picking up the pie we were told by a different cashier that they do not do that. So off to the gas station I went for ice...thus the pie cost more than I had anticipated. An unfortunate end to otherwise wonderful service.

Text: I am revising this rating because the owner immediately reached out to remedy this.  We are quite impressed with her efforts and will be returning to try again.  Don't see that every day!!

Initial review said, "Food served on cold plates.  Got 2 bites of omelet before it was cold.  Yuck.  Waitress response was, "yea, we keep our plates near air conditioner."   No problem with that?   If you're lucky and go when busy you may get a hot plate fresh out of the dishwasher."

Text: Don't usually complain but service should have been better. I had to ask for silver Ware and we shared one napkin.  No one asked how we were doing. I also had to ask for a drink refill.

Text: Jubelt's for breakfast is always a treat. Omelets, biscuits and gravy, or baked goods like donuts make stopping at Jubelt's in Litchfield a pleasant surprise.
