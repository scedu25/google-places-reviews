Text: My wife and I only had beer here, so I can't speak on behalf of the food. Their beer selection is good, couple different types, so you should be able to find something you like. Good spot to watch a game as well.

Text: I loved my evening at Detroit Beer Co! The fish tacos that I ordered were amazing and my fiance's catfish was also excellent. The drinks were delicious and the service was on point. We will definitely be back!

Text: We had to attend a wedding in downtown Detroit. Because there was a gap between the ceremony and the reception we needed to kill time. We found this place on Google maps. The waitress recommended the stromboli so that's what we ordered. OMG, it was so good! Plus the beer was tasty too. This place was the highlight of the wedding. Highly recommend!

Text: We came here right before a Pistons game on Saturday night. Arrived around 5 PM and we were seated right away. The place quickly filled up to capacity though so I recommend not arriving too late after 5 on weekends. NOTE: I called and asked where I could park. I was told to park at the Opera House Parking Center across the street and Detroit Beer Co. would validate my parking ticket. THIS IS NOT THE CASE ON NIGHTS WHEN THE OPERA HOUSE HAS A SHOW. Keep this in mind when deciding where to park. For us this structure was a flat rate of $15 for the night no matter the length of our stay.

The beer and food was great. The "Malgoth de Oro" was one of the easiest-to-drink 10% abv beers I've ever had. It was easily my favorite beer even though the others were good too. Even my girlfriend loved the 10% beer and she doesn't often like beers that strong. Also I really liked the seasoning on the fries and the burger was cooked medium rare like I asked whereas almost every other place these days will overcook it.

SUMMARY: This was a good stop before the game and I would return. I deducted a star for the kitchen being pretty slow and the person telling me wrong information about parking over the phone.
