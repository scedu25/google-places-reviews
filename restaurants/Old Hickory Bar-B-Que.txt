Text: Exceptional wait staff! Our waitress went out of her way to make sure if the ingredients we're safe for my food allergy. The food was so good! Seriously, get the onion rings! Everyone was super friendly. We'll be back!

Text: I heard so much good stuff on this place and gave it a try. Hell, my boss once ordered $200.00 worth of it for a client and I was able to try every item they had. I see the smoker and amount of meat they have. It is legit in that regard.

However... I just don't like it. It reminds me of "old people food". I love BBQ and grill myself way too much. I have gone to many BBQ places and many I have loved. This place I just don't like.

Not sure what it is. Reminded me of Buy-Low/IGA type food. Just... No. Not hating on anyone who loves the place, but I can't give it higher than a horizontal thumb.

Text: This is our favorite BBQ place!  My favorite is their chopped mutton sandwich. The onion rings are crisp and delicious.  I love their BBQ beans....they are spicy and quite delicious.  The atmosphere is relaxing and all the people are very friendly.  Their menu is limited; but when I go for BBQ, I don't need a huge buffet when what they have is wonderful!  Love it!

Text: We waited almost 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Once we received our sandwiches they did not have the topping that were supposed to come on them. The BBQ sauce was good enough that we bought a jar. The hostess and girl checking us out were not friendly at all. The food was decent.
