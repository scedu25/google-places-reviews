Text: Had a group of 21, so service was a little slow, but Lisa took care of us and the food was good. I liked the pizza, but the little jalapeno corn fritters were awesome.

Text: Really great pizza and service at loop brewery.  I highly recommend the jalapeño corn fritter appetizer it's got to be one of the best things on the menu.

Text: Really average Asian chicken salad. Didn't bother trimming peapods. Chicken was precooked Sysco chicken breast. Overpriced for what it was. Would not go back.
