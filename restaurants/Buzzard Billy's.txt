Text: I have had awesome food and service every single time I've been here.  And it's never so busy that you can't get great service.  Highly recommend.

Text: First time in Nebraska. Came to this place before the football game. We were rooting for the visitor team, yet everyone was amazing from the moment we enter. The food was amazing and our server Nikki, was outstanding. From the fried alligators to the bread pudding the experience just kept getting better.

Text: This is one of my favorite places to eat in Lincoln. I love their swiss mushroom burger (with *yummy* secret sauce) and the decor/atmosphere is fantastic!

Text: Sat outside on a night where most people were inside. Still got checked on frequently. Food was awesome. Mentioned I couldn't have something. Waiter came back to let me know that it was also on my main dish and asked if I wanted it removed. Very courteous

Text: Awesome Cajun food and grand beer selection. Alligator strips, Jambalaya, Shrimp Fettuccini - all great! After a week of Mediterranean food it was like heaven!
