Text: Maggiano's is absolutely AWESOME!!!!!!! Thank you so much for all that you have done to help pull off my proposal. You guys went above and beyond and did wayyyy more than I expected. The food was absolutely amazing along with the atmosphere and vibe from everyone, especially our waiter!! We will most likely request him when we come back. I ordered the salmon which had a burst of flavor and every bite. My fiance :) ordered the Tuscan chicken and shrimp pasta which she also loved. So with that being said, I will be recommending this place to everyone i know.

Text: Delightful Brunch!  We had the opportunity to eat here for a Sunday lunch/brunch.  My husband had a great eggs and ham Benedict.  I had Mom's lasagna.  Both were very good. In addition, we were given a free entree with the lasagna as part of the regular menu.  Because we were celebrating our anniversary our exceptional waitress, Kelly, brought us a special created dessert.  Justin, the manager, came out to speak with us.  Overall, it was a pleasure to eat there.

Text: How should I start? If the rating could be a 0 it would be a 0 out of 5. We placed an order at 7:09. Everyone at my table was served at 7:51pm. My appetizer, flatbread pizza, hadn’t come out yet. At 8:40pm, my food had arrived, so I canceled the order as everyone else had practically finished eating.

Text: Delicious food. The Spinach and Chicken Canilonni is to die for.  Be prepared to spend $$$.  Prices a bit higher than Olive Garden, but worth it for the quality. Patio sitting if you want a view of traffic and people walking to/from bus stop near by. The atmosphere lends itself for special occasions and celebrations. Food can't be beat!
