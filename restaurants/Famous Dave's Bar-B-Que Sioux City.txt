Famous Dave's Bar-B-Que Sioux City
Rating: 5
Text: I've ate in famous Dave's from Virginia to Missouri and the last two times I've been in Sioux City visiting my brother we ate there.  Both times the food was great.  Some of the best ribs and brisket I've eaten in a BBQ joint period. I have enjoyed smoking meat for myself and family get together for the last twenty years and for the most part don't eat BBQ out much because I'm usually disappointed.  This particular Famous Dave's has got their act together.  The waiting staff was superb, the food about as good as I've ever had out!

Text: Service was excellent. I mean excellent. And the food was tasty too. We were just in town for the weekend, but we wish we had discovered this place sooner! 
Plus, because it was our first time, we got to take a bottle of sauce with us. Unfortunately, we couldn't take it on the plane - but we certainly tried.

Text: We came from New York to Sioux City to visit family and they invited us to this fabulous place to eat. The service, the food and vibe is absolutely great. Best barbeque we've ever had, awesome variety.  Our waitress was super cool and very professional. We'll definitely be back when we visit again.
