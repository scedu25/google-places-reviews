Potbelly Sandwich Shop

Text: I went during lunch rush, and the wait was horrible. They also lost my order. But all that being said, they handled it well. The manager began handing out free drinks to those customers who were waiting. He was very responsive to the needs of the customers, and overall the customer service was excellent even though the wait was long. Nice people with a good environment, and the sub was worth the wait and confusion.

Text: I went to listen to my son and 4 fellow students play jazz here. All I got to eat was the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, and it was so good! Chewy and flavorful! Staff was so accommodating, and invited them back any time they want. They also did everything they could to make sure all customers were comfortable while they dined.

Text: Get all the toppings. Great chicken salad sandwich, the Mediterranean is amazing, the wreck, pizza sandwich, and Italian are all great, and the shakes are delicious. But the best ingredients at Potbelly are the peppers.
