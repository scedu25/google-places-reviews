Text: This is a town's favorite. This place has a pretty solid beer and whiskey selection. The food is great, I personally recommend the mushroom ravioli, and if you're a meet lover they have powerful and tasty burgers. A great vibe, pool tables, awesome staff and the location in downtown Urbana makes the Alley one of Urbana's special gems.

A final word for international friends, bring your passport or US-issued ID or else they will not serve alcohol.

Text:   The food, while a decent presentation, was surpringly awful tasting.  I'll chalk it up to the burger being a daily special, but a place like that should definitely have their employees sample the food before recommending it.  And just so everyone knows, it was the burger with white anchovies.  Now while I love anchovies, in hindsight that could not have been a worse accompaniment on a burger.  It completely clashed with the beef in the worst way.  I was really disappointed when I asked the bartender if he had tried the burger yet, to which he replied, "I don't get around to trying the daily specials".  
I eventually had to get something else to wash the taste out of my mouth, so I ordered their mac & cheese bites, which were disappointingly bland. 

Overall, I would definitely return for their excellent draft beer selection, but would stay away from the daily special unless highly recommended and tasted before hand.

Text: Great place to go for American pub style food.  I recommend the War Pig burger.  Outdoor seating available.

Text: The food here is great (try the hummus plate) and they have a pretty fantastic beer selection! Think ahead of you want to play pool, as there’s often a waiting list.
