Harvey's On the Mall
Rating: 1
Text: Attended an event near Harvey’s and wanted a hot cup of coffee during intermission. First cup was barely warm to say the lease. I inform the waitress who ( after five minutes) informed me that she was brewing a fresh pot, but the second cup was barley warm as the previous one. At this point I gave up and my husband paid for the coffee and we left. That was my experience with Harvey’s on November 12, 2017 @ 6 P.M.

Text: The service was great.  The food was average.  I hadn't been there in years, and I feel like the menu used to be much better.

Text: The service here is amazing! Carrie is literally the best bartender I've ever had, especially for a dive bar! She was so friendly and helpful with all the local beers. Will definitely come back when I'm in the zoo!!!

Text: I have no idea if they still have it or not, but Harvey’s buffalo chicken pizza was and still is the best pizza I’ve ever had. I have dreams about it and its been years since I’ve been there. I miss living downtown when we came here often. Great food and drinks!!!!

Text: Great burgers and pub fare. Also very accommodating to our family for lunch (they printed FNAF pictures for the kids to color). Very much recommend.
