Text: This place is awesome. Get the bacon wrapped shrimp, it is the best.  Premeal is house made bread unbelievably soft and delicious. Very happy with my food and service and the facility

Text: What an awesome and very inviting steakhouse this is! Every time I come here, I am always mesmerized by the awesome food and the wonderful service that I receive here! The employees here are always happy and ready to help you with a smile! I like coming here to treat myself out for a steak once in a while, and usually when I come here I always leave here happy and full. The food is terrific here - one the of best steakhouses in Kansas or even the USA, you could say. The employees here truly treat you like you are "part of their family."

Text: Many people told me how good this place is but i was skeptical.  Went their with my wife for our anniversary on Oct 21, 2017 with low expectations.  Had the best food and service at Tucson's since moving to Kansas a year ago.  The food was flat out great.

Text: Went there with a very large party on a Friday night.  Wait staff was able to accommodate us.  All food came out together, and was correct.

Text: Really good place to go out and see a game...not always the best food, or a short wait, but decent.
