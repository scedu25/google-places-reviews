Text: This  is an excellent choice for any dining experience.  The food was delicious, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was excellent.  I will visit again. 
There were 4 of us in our group, we ordered lasagna,  stuffed mushroom, pizza,  lobster pasta,  dessert, veal parm, bread pudding. Everything was hot and tasted really good. 
Pizzas come out a bit flat and could use more sauce, but besides that it still was delicious and that was only do to inexperience with their product,  I didn't know it was flat bread style. 
Great place in a weird location.

Text: Great food! So many gluten free options including desserts. My husband loved his lobster penne, and my boys enjoyed their spaghetti with meatballs.  I got gluten free rigatoni and it was amazing. Food is reasonably priced and good size portions.

Text: The food and service here are phenomenal. I stopped here once with my sister and my wife randomly, not having ever even heard of the place. We were in for such a good treat.

The food is good and the price wasn't that bad. One of my wife's friends even came in from Maryland and we drove all the way down to Port Clinton to take her there to eat. I'll definitely be back the next time we are in the area!

Text: Walked in and several tables open yet 30 minute wait.  While eating appetizers the fire alarm went off. For 20 minutes.  Did not offer a drink or dessert for ears ringing. Food is good.

Text: Waiters are very slow. We sat down at 740 dis not take our order till 812. I know that they were busy but the waiters did ignore our table multiple time when trying to flag them down. When waiting for our food I was able to leave my party for a moment to leave to pick up something from the other side of marblehead and come back with out food just arriving at 9pm. Was not very happy. But luckily the food was good.
