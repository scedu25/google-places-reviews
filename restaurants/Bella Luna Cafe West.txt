Bella Luna Cafe West

Text: One of our go to spots for lunch.   Wide variety on the menu and often some good daily specials.  Like the mix of Mediterranean and standard fare.  Soups are great.   Good service.  Only complaint is that they are a bit aggressive on the air conditioning.

Text: The service is great as is the food. Bella Luna has been a Wichita must go to place for awhile if you like this kind of food. The salads are fresh. It doesn't take all day to get your food either. 
Definitely worth checking out.

Text: Great Mediterranean food. Specials are always interesting and yummy.  Always hard to pick just one item to order. Very helpful staff.

Text: First time and last time coming. First water was dripping on me from the AC vent on the ceiling. (They did move our table, but didn't throw anything in to maybe keep the customer happy) AC was so cold my daughter was shivering and they refused to give a small booth to block the air. Second my wife's shrimp carbonara literally had 3 pieces of shrimp, and they weren't very big. Third and what got me to leave was finding hair in my food. Food was tasty, except the gyro meat that taste like spam. Only reason for the 2 stars is darsha was as good as management let her, and some things were quite tasty. Money is better spent elsewhere.
