Text: This place is a hidden gem. We were driving from St. Louis to Burlington Iowa and stopped here for lunch. Everything was delicious and service was very attentive. The lunch special is a great deal. Includes soup, entree with rice and an egg roll or crab Rangoon all for roughly $8. The egg drop soup has peas and carrots in it which is a surprisingly nice addition. The outside looks rough but the inside is very nice and modern. If we are driving through again we will stop here again.
