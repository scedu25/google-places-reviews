Beethoven's #9 Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: This restaurant had been recommended to me by several people, so I finally made a trip and I was not disappointed! Had to try a bite of everyone's food and it was all very reminiscent of real German food. The gravy on the spaetzle was perfect and the cucumber salad was awesome. My only criticism would be too try a different breading for the schnitzel (I'm not even talking a star away because it was still really good but more flour based rather than the traditional corn meal/bread crumbs). All in all, great German meal and I will definitely recommend!

Text: Found this place on Trip Advisor. Took my 92 yr old mother for lunch. Very handicapped accessible. We shared a Reuben and had the German potato salad and added the onion straws. Everything was excellent and our waitress checked on us often. Great experience!

Text: Having lived in Germany for 3 years i consider myself a fairly good judge of German food authenticity and Beethoven's is a 10/10! Sauerbraten was dead on and the Jager schnitzel gravy was perfect! The spatzel and hot potato salad were fantastic as well. We were greeted and seated right away and our server was very friendly and competent. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area.
