Text: As great as I remembered! I'm now 68 & we patronized Marion's when I was in high school (the 60's). A very pleasant experience!

Text: This was the worst pizza I have ever had.  I was in town for business and everybody raves about this place so I ordered it one night.  I took one bite of it and could not eat any more.  I called the restaurant and they offered to make another pizza but would not refund my money.  Why would I want another pizza that was no good.  It literally tasted like a frozen pizza that had been microwaved.  I will never have this again even if it is the only place open.

Text: You're either into Marion's and Dayton style pizza or not.  I like it a lot.  This is the original location and the best quality.  Sometimes they get crazy busy.  Delicious pizza though kind of pricey.
