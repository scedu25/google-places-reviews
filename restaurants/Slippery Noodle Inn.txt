Text: Thought we would check it out the night before the big game in INDY.  Then the band kindly started out with GO STEELERS. I’m out. Can find a place in Indy that will support the home team. Won’t be back.  If you a Colts fan, stay away until they can support our team.

Text: Waited over 45 minutes to get a server. Flagged her down three times to try to get our order in, and she STILL did not acknowledge us. Once she did, she basically told us we couldn't order food because the kitchen was running an hour and a half to fill orders. She waited on three tables that were seated after us and they all got their food. We only got drinks, because we went to the bar ourselves. Terrible service, will never return. All people in our party have been servers and understand being in the weeds, however just come over and acknowledge our table and that you are running behind. Big disappointment as we were really looking forward to dining here. Sadly cannot recommend this place. ?

Text: Went for an evening snack. The nachos were good.  Cheese melted, crispy on top, got a little soggy towards the bottom. Might ask for no salsa next time.

Text: It was my first time and the burger was very well done for my taste but I should have asked them to cook it less but it was very tasty with the roast beef on it and I was a big fan of the tater tots

Text: Food is excellent, great service and their "Tuesday" night band was awesome.  Three talented musicians that made blues accessible  to non  blues informed or even fans. I will return! This place rivals ANY restaurant in NYC regarding it total package .
