Shorty Pants Lounge

Text: We visitied Shorty Pants while we were at the Lake for the last warm September weekend. We moored our boat at the very large pier and walked up- very clean and nice. We were seated immediately, of course, because it was off season. Service was prompt and outstanding, thank you Dawn! The food was hot and fresh: Coconut shrimp was tasty & the Oyster Po-Boy was the best according to my brother, who has eaten here before. The Asian salad was loaded with ingredients and a slightly spicy (yum) dressing. We had a great lunch on the water- we'll be back!

Text: Jessica did an outstanding job as our server. Food was excellent. Had an oyster Po Boy and a shrimp Po Boy with upgrade sides of Jambalaya. Definitely one of the better food stops on the lake.

Text: Who puts orange juice in a Margarita? Shorty pants....weird. If you asked me about Shorty Pants last year I would have said great food, generous servings, good service and they always had a great bartender......this year I'd say the only thing that's the same is the service. We won't be returning for a few years.

Text:  Nice place to eat lunch or dinner on the water. Dogs allowed on patio which was a plus for us. Our food was tasty and our server was friendly and attentive. The only thing that could've been a little better was the original mojito we ordered.
