Text: Excellent meal and service.  Celebrating my wife's birthday and our server caught on and surprised her with a complimentary dessert.

We'll be back!

Text: Andria's is tucked away in a remote corner of Edwardsville.  Everyone in Edwardsville tends to talk about how great Andria's is.  They are right.  It's an unexpected treasure.  The steak my husband and I had was cooked to perfection, a great cut, and so juicy.  The two sauces we had were so good and we did not regret adding them.  The sides were very good as well.  The restaurant is inside a house so it is an unusual setup.  It works but it wasn't my favorite aspect of the experience.  Still, Andria's is a great dining experience without having to cross the river.

Text: Excellent service, food was amazing, environment was nice and cozy (there is a bar area on the other side with less intimate seating) and the steaks are cooked to perfection. So.e of the best spinach artichoke dip you can find.

Text: This is our favorite restaurant!  We always dine in the bar side and love the staff. Larry's favorite item is the filet & after at least 200 visits he has never had a bad steak. I chose a variety of entrees & am always pleased.
