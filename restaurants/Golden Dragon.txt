Text: This Golden Dragon is awesome! I have been coming here for years and it is great each time. The food is very good and the people who work here are great also. Once we ordered some carry out, but could not come to pick it up as we thought we would be able to. We called to let them know and they delivered our food to us without hesitation and were very nice about it. Overall this is a great place if you want great food and service!

Text: Terrible place. The food had a funny taste, like the pan or something was cooking with the food like a metallic taste. Drove all the way back up there to just get my money back they said no, called the police and all. I did not want them to re make my food since i am a firm believer in if you cant make it right the first time, plus it tastes weird, no i do not want it period i returned the food in whole to. Overall horrible, money hungry people!

Text: Decent authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices. Eat in take out or delivered

Text: Standard Chinese menu, reasonably priced, but if you don't ask for condiments such as soy sauce you won't get any. Disappointing for carry-out, when you don't realize this until after you've picked up your order and are ready to eat.

Text: Golden Dragon always produces great tasting take out! They are always very friendly and very fast. Most times our orders are done by the time we come to pick it up (about 8 min). You wont be disappointed if you try them out.
