Text: Went SPECIFICALLY for the prime rib. Ordered it medium rare. Arrived well done. Sent it back. Second attempt slightly less well done. Begrudgingly are it. When they do it right, it is phenomenal. Sadly, I've only tried it twice. First time AMAZING. Second time horrible. I'll be back, but if I can't get mid-rare, just bring me a burger...

Text: Great salad bar, always with a variety of hot food as well.  Good heart healthy options, and whatever you do, DON'T miss having a cinnamon roll!  Only downsides are it can be crowded around traditional meal times and you might have to wait, but the food is worth it!
