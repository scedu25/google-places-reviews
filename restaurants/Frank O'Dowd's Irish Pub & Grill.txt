Text: My family and I were very pleased. Walked into a beautiful setting, friendly staff, and amazing food! I had a Rueben and the corn beef was thick and juicy! My family had fish and chips and chicken strips all finished their plates!

Text: Great beer/ale and drinks, including variations with Irish whiskey, great appetizers, and the menu is Irish.

Live performers on Friday and Saturday that encourage audience sing along to songs we all remember, or should get to know (for the younger crowd). Enjoy!

Text: In a word: yum! They're open late, the waitress was nice, and the food was great! I had the fish and chips, and my girlfriend had the paddy melt. For an appetizer we had the nachos, and for dessert the cookie with ice cream. All winners, though the cookie could have been a little softer so that it cut more easily. Come on Fridays and Saturdays for live music (some performers are more engaging than others).
