Country Kitchen - Marshall
Rating: 4
Text: They have a large enuf menu of round the clock meals that you can find something you like. There is a salad bar though I have not gone through it myself. Service is friendly and attentive. The food is consistently well prepared and comes out of the kitchen quickly. I just prefer this restaurant over the Denny's or the Subway also at this exit.

Text: Greeter was overwhelmed by two customers cashing out. Manager bussing tables whiles the regular wait staff for Sunday is talking about anything but work related issues. 15minutes later our family of three was seated to a wet table and booth. My wife attempted to use the napkins from the silverware settings to dry off the table and booth. Needing a dry towel we stood waiting for staff or the stuff to dry for another 2 or 3 minutes. Couple more minutes standing here waiting for the water to dry off. Finally sat down only to wait over 15 minutes to leave without getting so much as a drink order taken. All we wanted to order was the breakfast buffet. After walking out we drove down the road to Denny's
 We was greeted instantly by a great staff. Within in 10minutes we had our food and drinks.
