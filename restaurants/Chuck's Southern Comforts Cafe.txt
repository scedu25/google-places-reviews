Text: I have never had a bad night out going to Chucks. They have food for every mood I'm in. Cajun, BBQ, Sandwiches, Pasta, a great variety! The staff has always been very attentive and friendly. Food is a great value as well, big portions. Great for families and for a nice night out with a special someone!

Text: Awesome experience. Chuck's honors teachers as well as the school community. Thursday is teacher appreciation and that means discounts. Also for a limited time, 8/21-25, back to school special honors the family wallet. Kids under 10 eat FREE. Way to go Chuck's.

Adrienne was our server at the bar. He was so helpful to us two ladies. We are not spring, hot momma's. Just ordinary women wanting a beer and a meal. He gave us his sweet, attentive attention. Loved it.

Jalapeno Cornbread was awesome. We both had the fish specials. Perfect! 
No room for more and took food home.

Text: Went for the Bar Bingo with four friends, they only had one waitress  taking care of the whole bar area tables she was taking food orders and drink orders. This place usually  gets a good crowd  for the Bar Bingo they do need at least one more  waitress during  this time the wait between drinks and food was to long. We where sitting at a table and twice we went up to the bar and just ordered  our drinks right from the bar tender. The bar tenders and the one waitress that  work  on the bingo night are very nice they are just under staffed at that time it's not their fault.
