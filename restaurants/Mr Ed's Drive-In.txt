Plus one of the employees is our neighbor and her son mows our lawn. So needless to say, great employees work there to. Love the atmosphere. And love the owners!!!!

Text: This is a great place to stop while traveling or if you're in the Louisberg, MO area. It's a popular place and been around for a long while. It's family owned and one of a kind. Great burgers, fries, and shakes. Quick service and very visible/easy to get to from the road.
