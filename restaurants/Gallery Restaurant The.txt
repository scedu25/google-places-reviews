Text: Friendly service, great appetizers, a bit pricey. Got beer to start, nice presentation. Had the sharing platter as an appetizer, delicious, interesting and reasonable. Shared the 6oz steak with gravy and egg, much too salty and mediocre quality. Nice patio with fountain. Slightly surprised with $75 bill for 2.

Text: Delicious! Ask the owner if she made any of her tarts today and you won't regret it! The fish and seafood were great too! And it felt like we were on island while on the patio.

Text: Very disappointed.  The $35.00 ribeye steak requested medium was seriously overcooked and did not appear to be a ribeye at all.  The plate was returned to the kitchen by the server and immediately returned to the table by the owner.  The owner stated it was medium in the centre and we would just have to accept the outer portion being well done. We did, and will never return to this restaurant again.  P.S.  It was our Easter dinner and expected a better meal.
