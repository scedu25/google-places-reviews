Walt's Pizza

Text: Love the food here!  There is something for everyone, kids included.  I've never gotten anything bad, from the steaks to the pasta, but almost always go for the Double Decker pizza.  Lunchtime buffet is well stocked and fresh food brought out constantly.  Can be busy on weekends, and have a wait for a table and food.  Week nights and early evening weekend times you are usually seated immediately.

Text: My husband who used to work here and I had our wedding reception here 13 yrs ago today. Although we moved out of state some yrs ago we try to come by at least once a yr. This yr we were lucky enough to make it on our anniversary and had the same meal we had on our wedding day. Steak and mushroom cheesbake it's the best! Thanks for making it the best. We will be back soon!!!!

Text: Walt's is one of those hidden gems that only people of the area will know. The food is remarkable and their double decker pizza is to die for. The staff are very hospitable and the atmosphere is warm. Their new patio is a great place to relax on.

Text: In one word, I'll describe Walt's Pizza...cheesy.  Home of the Double Decker Pizza, Walt's has a great menu of pizza, steak, pasta, and more.  This establishment has deep roots in the Marion community, and provides a great atmosphere for family, friends, and hangouts.  They have an outdoor patio section with a bar for weekend nights when you're looking for a place to go with friends.  There is an arcade in the establishment, so you know they are kid friendly!  The servers are well versed on the menu and all the items within.  I've never had a bad experience at Walt's, and I don't think you will either!
