Vernie's Hamburger House

Text: We read some reviews and decided to try it out.  We all got burgers. We all thought they were very good. Mine was very flavorful.  TBH, I love salty flavored food. My burger did have a salty flavor - just the right amount. So consider that if you don't like salty food. It was definitely worth the roughly two mile drive off the interstate to get there.  If we had the opportunity we would definitely go there again.

Text: The chili is my favorite ever . . . anywhere.  The staff are very nice and helpful and the entire menu is very good.  Better than any other hamburger place in town for sure.
