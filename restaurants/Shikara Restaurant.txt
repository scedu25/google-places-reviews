Text: They used to be so good until until 2015. Now a days they just serve only chicken in other words vegetarian beside having lamb or goat gravy or the biryani. All their budget items doesn't taste that fresh but it taste more like left over from a day before.  Well now I stopped going there too many disappointment.

Text: Great food, atmosphere and staff! A bit pricy but worth trying. Nice Indian food in the area. Many Indian people are eating there so I think it should be authentic enough.

Text: Great service. Friendly and professional staff. Authentic food at reasonable prices. Try vegetable samosa for appetizer and Malai Kofta for a vegetarian entree. Their weekend buffet is delicious as well. I have and will continue to recommend this place to friends and family.
