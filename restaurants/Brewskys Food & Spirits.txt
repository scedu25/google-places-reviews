Text: Good food, they always have at least 2-5 games on one of the TVs. It seems like they have a lot of TVs, but that's good because they show many different games and sports on any given night. They always have good food and drink specials.

Text: There was a metal screw (an actual screw) in my spinach and artichoke dip, in which I chewed and could have easily chipped a tooth. The manager came out and comped a bucket a beer but I was still charged for two pitchers of beer.

Text: The food was good for bar food but the wait staff was awesome! The young lady who waited on us had the best sense of humor ever! Lord knows she needed it to deal with our group!
