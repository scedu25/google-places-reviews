Text: The food was good, and it was a quiet place to eat and talk with others. They had a fairly good food selection on their buffet.  However, many of the dishes were almost empty, and I had to go up later to get them. Also,y Mom and I felt somewhat hurried when we were seated. Overall, though, it was a fairly nice place to eat in Herrin.

Text: If you are looking for life-changing food, search elsewhere. But for the price and quality it's tough to beat their lunch buffet.

Text: Have gone there for years.  Pretty much the standard Chinese buffet for a decent price.  Food is always hot and fresh.  Clean buffet and restrooms are always a plus.

Text: Food taste wise is pretty good,  but the temperature needs alot of improvement.  It doesn't stay hot very long at all.
