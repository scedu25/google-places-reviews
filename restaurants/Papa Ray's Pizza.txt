Text: Paul the owner is super nice and my 2 boys love walking down to grab a slice... they often go for breakfast with their grandpa. A Hastings favorite for family from out of state... the old Papa Ray's traditional pizza recipe is one of a kind and there is just something about it that keeps us coming back.

Text: The food is good, but they are best known for their pizzas. The breakfast is a little greasy but is always good and one of the few places in town that actually offers a cafe style breakfast at a decent price. The cafe itself is dated, but is still a nice place to enjoy a meal.

Text: Love this place! I am celiac and LOVE the gluten free crust! My boyfriend (not celiac) even likes it better than normal pizza crust! Always fast and tasty! Our favorite place in town. 
***Side note: this is a cash only establishment although I do believe they have an ATM!

Text: Always good, very unique, been eating there since the sixties when I was very young. My oldest brother delivered pizza for the original "Papa Ray!"
