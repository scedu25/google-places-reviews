Text: Friendly fast service. Decent sushi, good menu variety. Some of the dishes are pretty greasy, but the flavor is good.

Text: Maybe good help is hard to find, so don't let one indolent person behind the counter chewing her cud (who doesn't greet you or smile at all!) lead you to walk out of this otherwise very nice restaurant.  Too bad she is the order taker!  The woman in charge (and other employees) were very helpful & friendly.  She gave us samples of Boba berries -- original + 4 flavors -- and explained that you can get them in various beverages.  I had green apple in sweet milk tea & loved it!  We had broccoli & shrimp, which was VERY good, and garlic chicken, which was very good but VERY garlicky.  I love lots of garlic, but it could be overpowering.  The rice was also good.  If we are ever back in Great Bend, we will definitely stop back.

Text: The hospitality was OK. They didn't go out of their way to make us feel welcomed. Felt kind of like a fast food Chinese. The food was mediocre. It could be a better experience if they had more variety. We stopped because it has a big Sushi sign but when asked they said no Sushi until next week. I am giving it a 3 because it is an OK experience but could easily be a great experience if they put a little more into it.

Text: Food and service has increased dramatically. I have been impressed with the food and customer service as of late. I felt welcomed and they even explained the different kinds of boba teas they have. They now have Sushi and it looked great. I'll be going back to try some of the many different kinds of sushi including eel.
