Text: Evdently this place is have it their way only. Second visit ordered bacon eggs and hash browns with bacon and hash browns crispy. Limp bacon and hash browns that taste a week old is what I got. I will never go here again. If the owner paid as much attention to food quality as she does to her cookie jars it could be a great restaurant.

Text: Lots of "canned" food or very "processed". Not much is truly "homemade" and if it is tastes like it came out of a can. You get a lot of food for the money and prices are very inexpensive. Not much more in McCook so it's about as good as it gets there.

Text: A 24/7 diner with unique character and generous portions of good food. I recommend the chicken fried steak or one of their omelets. Come hungry.

Text: Just about the blandest breakfast in memory...I left half my food on the plate. Coffee was watery. Bacon was good, decor was interesting.
