Text: This place is fantastico! Very busy, but our food was on time. We were a larger split group and they were a little confused about where what went, but not because they are a bad place- just tremendously busy at that time and people were pouring in even as we left. Be sure to order their fresh flour chips - with queso dip (we love them more than the corn) Food tasted amazing and we would happily return! Great atmosphere and lovely details in the woodwork.
