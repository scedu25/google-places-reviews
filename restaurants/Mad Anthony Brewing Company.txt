Mad Anthony Brewing Company

Text: Beer lovers dream come true in an expansive space in downtown Warsaw. Features large bar with TVs in 21 and over section plus family seating area as well. Unwraps are a must and cocktail program is underrated. Try to get a seat by the front windows for optimal viewing of downtown life in a small but growing town.

Text: The food here is amazing, the beer is great, and the service is top notch.  Not once did out waiter let us go without a drink.  He checked on us but wasn't overbearing like some waiters.  It was a great experience and I highly recommend this place.

Text: Giving 5 stars because they have great beer, good food, not the same menu as everyone else.  If I take customers to lunch in Warsaw, usually the first place I think of.  Met one of the owners who was friendly and informative.

Text: Big menu with diversity including a handful of vegetarian friendly options.  They have a number of tasty beers brewed in-house and always seem to have something new to try.
