Real Hacienda Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 2
Text: We eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants and this was the worse experience ever. Maybe they was just having a bad day but we won't be back. We ordered drinks and two cheese dips. Waiter came back 8 minutes later with drinks and no dip. I figured his hands were full and he would be back. Never came back. Our chips were gone, no cheese dip and he came to take our order. I asked him to please get the cheese dip first then we would be ready to order. He brought the cheese dip and left and took 15 minutes to come  back and take our order. Portions were small, wasn't impressed with food, and fried ice cream wasn't prepared  correctly. Salsa was good though.

Text: Fast service. Good food. Friendly staff. If you get there between 5 and 530 on the weekends there is usually not a wait. After that you may have to wait a few minutes.
