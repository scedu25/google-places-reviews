Text: Normally really great. Slipped a little today but, not enough to keep me away. Always visit when I'm in town.  Portions are large. Always have some for later. If I could only get the margarita in a to go cup?  LOL Service is always good and attentive.

Text: Food wasn't authentic. Food was tasteless other than good salsa. Decor was Nice, but Tables & Chairswere greasy. Waitress was unaware of items on combination plates. Waitress talked too much about personal life.
