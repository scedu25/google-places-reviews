Shack in the Back BBQ

Text: Really good. Best great beans I've had in ages and the Mac and cheese was some of the best I've had too. The chicken was good, not wonderful. They are very friendly though and they have in-house sauces that are very good.

Text: I absolutely loved this place! The pork ribs were the best that I have had in Louisville, to date. They are now my new regular spot to eat BBQ. I almost left pissed, until they came back and said that they did sell pork ribs.

Text: All I can say is 'Turkey Ribs.' You're not going to find those at your average BBQ joint. Not a terrible fan of the 'White Lightning' sauce that comes with them, but they have several others. Not your standard BBQ/Buffalo though. And this place literally is just a shack. It's great! I think they were recently remodeling but I've not been back out that way since. I'll have to check it out.

Text: I had a friend suggest I try the Turkey Ribs when ever I went to the "Shack".   I asked him what in the world was a Turkey Rib to which he responded "GOOD" .  And you know what , he was right, they are good!  Really good!!  And very unique, which is what I love about trying a new  BBQ joint.

When I got back home I "googled" the bone structure of a turkey.  Best guess, these "Ribs" look to be the scapula bones from a turkey.  The scapula can be compared to the  shoulder blade on a pig or cow.   But again,  that's just my guess!  Regardless, they are tasty and all white meat.

These babies were smoked so perfectly that with a bit of a tug, the bone could be pulled easily from the meat.  A white BBQ sauce, mayo and vinegar based, was served which was also unique.  The combo was a great treat!!    I ordered a platter to try as many other items as i could, chicken wings, pull pork and brisket,  all of which were enjoyable.  My server was great and attentive, even brought me some of their burgoo to try.   Yum!!

My only complaint,  the "Shack" is about a 50 mile round trip from my house.......but that ain't stopping me from going back!!

Text: Wonderful little bbq joint! I wasn't sure about it when we pulled up, but I knew the consistent line from the order counter to the door was a good sign. I had the pulled chicken sandwich, bbq beans and mac & cheese...all delicious! I would definitely recommend!
