Text: We stopped in starved on an impromptu outing to a movie with just 30 minutes til show time. We explained our quandry, were seated, our order taken, and had our food in minimal time. It was a quick bite, but I still drew a portrait on the table paper. Great service; great tip; and off to a great time at the movie.
