Text: Excellent place.  If you're looking for a great night out with friends, this is the place.  The bar, club, beer garden/patio are all great.  They have something for everyone, and the staff is very pleasant to deal with.

Text: It's a little out of the way for my taste but there is lots to do here.  Dancing, pool, and fun activities in the smoking area.  The only bad thing is cops hide around the bend so be careful when you leave!
