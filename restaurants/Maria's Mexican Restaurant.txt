Maria's Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Based on the other places I saw and visited in Atchison, I imagine this is the best restaurant in town. The salsa and questions are bothering very tasty, and the chips are crispy and not greasy. The entrees are satisfactory and they have a good variety of Mexican options.

Text: The best restaurant in this town, hands down. If you don't like Mexican food, well, you better go to St. Joe for dinner.

Text: My favorite place ever!!! By far the best Mexican food-nice and cheesy-not dry like other places. Fast service, never have to wait long, always tastes the same each time. I recommend the California Burrito-you will not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the Platte City location shreds their chicken instead of the cubes/strips like the Atchison location in their California Burrito. It tastes better with the chunky chicken than shredded.
