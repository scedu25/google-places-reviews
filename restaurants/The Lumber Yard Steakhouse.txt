The Lumber Yard Steakhouse
Rating: 4
Text: Went for the seafood buffet the day before Father's Day.  I had made a reservation, and they got us seated immediately.  The staff was very courteous and gave excellent service.  Their clam chowder was a very nice surprise, as it was made by hand instead of out of a can.  I didn't care for either the mussels or the clams, but everything else was fantastic.  I just wish they were quicker to refill the crab legs, as they were wiped out pretty fast.  The area where we were seated was back by the kitchen and it was fairy warm BUT it was a stiflingly hot day.  Not many flies in there, too , and the dessert I had was fantastic. All in all, we were very pleased and will be back.

Text: A lumberyard made into a restaurant? Sounds crazy, but that's what they've done! The prices are pretty reasonable and the food is good. It's not a quiet, romantic place, but a good place to meet friends.
