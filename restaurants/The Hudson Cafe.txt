Text: Not sure what all the hype is about, and not sure it's worth the 50 minute wait. 

Prices are high. Portions are decent size. 

Service was very good. 

$8 for a kids meal is a little high. $3 for a soft drink is double of what others in the area charge. 

Omlet was watery and runny. 

Crepes we're good. Pancakes just had toppings and not in the batter. 

Guess I need to try one of the specialty dishes like cat fish and waffles. 

Will try again to see if experience changes.

Text: Granted, it was a really busy Sunday morning, but our server couldn't get us out fast enough. There are several poached eggs options on the menu so I ordered eggs Benedict. The first order was cold. I sent it back and the second order came back with hard yolks. My husband's pancake order was great.

Text: Great fresh food. I will come here everytime I visit downtown Detroit. There's a long wait but definitely worth the wait.

Text: The omelette and home fries were about as good as it gets, and our server was a pleasant, high-energy guy. Be prepared to wait for a while on a weekend morning. Our group of 8 waited for a little under an hour on Saturday morning - though, in all fairness, the time may have been significantly less with a smaller group.

Text: Food and atmosphere was great. Service was good. We'll worth the wait which was extremely long, but there is a lot to do in the general area while you wait. We explored part of the city and got coffee at a Cafe close by. They text you when your table is ready.
