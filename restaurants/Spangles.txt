Text: Honestly I have had better but nonetheless I still drove here from Leavenworth and will shamelessly do so again. It is probably the commercials that draw me and my stomach.

Text: Came in to give this store yet another chance and was served a raw burger. Jarod the Assist. Manager corrected the problem with a new burger. Then proceeded to take it off my C.C.  So we will begin anew once again at ground zero. Rene would not be happy with this. This is the 5th attempt at Good service with this store in particular.
