Jct 4 Diner

Text: This diner is top notch! Clean, friendly, and decent music playing in the background. The food was really good! Limited menu, but the hamburger was tasty and the bun was slapped on the griddle and toasted. The boyfriend had their 2 egg breakfast with bacon. His eggs were cooked over easy and done very well. They popped an egg and offered to make another, but that was unnecessary as the boyfriend just chopped them all into his hash browns. "Those eggs were right on the money, " says the picky eater. 10 out of 10, would eat here again.
