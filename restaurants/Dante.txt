Text: One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday. A splurge for us but worth it! I couldn't decide what to order because it all sounded good so I got the 5 course tasting with wine. It was perfect. Even the wines were impressive. Our waiter was great and informative on the food and wines.

Text: Went this past Saturday night while in town visiting from Myrtle Beach, SC. Amazing spot!!  Sat at the bar because it was a packed house, yet still intimate. Service is second to none! Try the Seabass or the Salmon. Braised greens appetizer is delectable. The bartenders make a killer old fashioned, and afterwards stop into Dante Next door which is an underground spot for live music.

Text: Went here for early dinner around 6:00. Used open table to make reservations and got a table as soon as we walked in. The dress code is relaxed, nice jeans are fine and I even saw a few people in nice t-shirts when we were there. Business casual is definately fine. The wait staff and chef are very allergy aware. When ordering, just let them know your allergy or dietary restriction and they will let you know if a menu item can be catered to you. This also goes for the chef's choice 5 course meal (although we did not order that). Some of the menu items also have sample sizes, so you can try a few things and not break the bank. Very large wine selection ranging from 40$ to over a thousand. They even had a vegan dessert option!

Text: Wonderful service, mostly fantastic food. Duck was amazing, as was beet salad and tuna tartare. Lots of pasta but not much else in the Carbonara.
