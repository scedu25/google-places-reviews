Text: It is awesome. The food is great. My kids never leave still hungry. And prices are not high. You get what you pay for. The portions  are good sizes.

Text: The food isn't quite typical of Americanized Mexican restaurants. It is exceptional however! The entrees each have their own twist and excellent flavor. The decor is fun, with a mix of traditional Mexican accents, country touches, and reclaimed treasures. The service is excellent and the food worthy of a try.

Text: This place is not as good as it used to be. Very cookie cutter feel to the food now. Same thing you can get anywhere. I think they are trying but its like they forgot they can be special so easily if they try. Missed a chance to be number one. Sad. They used to be better. I get the feeling they are struggling with something.
