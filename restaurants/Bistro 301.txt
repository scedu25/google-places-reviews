Text: The menu offerings are very good.  The atmosphere is cool.  Kind of uptown bistro meets pub.  :)  The food is pretty yummy.  This is a nice spot and the staff is super friendly.

Text: I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich for lunch.  The outside was spicy and crunchy while the chicken was very tender.  It had been a long time since I was there last, I will be back soon.  The sevice was great as well and the total cost for our group was great.
