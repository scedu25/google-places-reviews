Text: I arrived with five of my friends when the alley was not crowded on a Saturday night. We wanted to play most of the night, so we all bought three games each. The total for each of us was $26. Overpriced, but I wasn't mad because that is a lot of bowling. After 20 minutes of waiting for the cashier (Derrick/Derron B.) to figure out how to work the register and a lot of rudeness from him, we went to go play. We bowled a game then my friend Josh, our ride, got a call from his father explaining that his mother was in the emergency room. Since he was our ride, we all had to go. We were offered refunds on the two games that we hadn't played. After bringing all of our receipts up then going back to my group while I waited for the barely competent manager to go through them all, I arrived back at the desk only to discover that the manager denied ever receiving the receipts. All of us lost at least $16 and one of us lost a parent.

Text: Was not impressed with this place. Pin setter kept sticking and would not reset. Finally they moved us to another lane. That lanes ball return did not work all the time in that lane and the power shut down in the middle of the frame. Don't plan on returning

Text: This is just too freakin' expensive!! I can't believe it cost $50 to take my 2 grandchildren to roll a ball down an alley. Ridiculous!!
