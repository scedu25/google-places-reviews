Café Patachou - Carmel

Text: Friendly staff, delicious food, good coffee! Right next to a big church, so it's fairly crowded on Sunday afternoons. Our group of 6-8 is usually seated within 20-45 minutes. Limited wait area with only a few chairs. Spacious outdoor seating area when the weather is nice. Definitely a great value--you get what you pay for!

Text: Nice atmosphere.  Coffee was luke warm so I requested some hot coffee. Another cup of coffee was brought and it was luke warm. So then the waitress asked if the coffee was hot and I told her it was not.  She went and microwaved my coffee!!! What?????  I go out to enjoy a good cup of hot coffee!!   The omelette was tasteless.

Text: Serving up good food here. Dine in and carry out several times. However I think they are grossly understaffed in their kitchen. Or lack of efficiency in the kitchen. Very convenient being less than 5 minutes from my house. Be sure to allot plenty of time for carry out or dine in. As it will be needed.

Text: Food is always tasty. It's odd that customers have to get their own coffee and refills. This always interrupts the flow of conversation.
