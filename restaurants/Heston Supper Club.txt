Text: Quaint restaurant with lots of ambiance. Food was delicious. For us, it's a "special occasion" place that I'm so happy to have discovered.

Text: Had ribs here for first time.  They smoke them out back.  Very tasty. I did notice I smelled like camp fire after we left. Also had the sweet potato smash which was good flavor wish but looked like baby food.
