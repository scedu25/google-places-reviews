Text: Food is always really good! Great menu. Recently calling here has almost become more trouble than it's worth! The girl answering the phone is lacking in either ambition, personality, or she is more heavily "medicated" than the person taking orders should be.

Text: Last night must of been inbred night at Ann's Pizza, went in with my girlfriend and as we were sitting waiting on our food for dine in we were verbally asulted by a preteen, who's what I can only assume was his entire family seated at another table, decided to jump right in. Instantly the owner n 3 goons from the back appeared and proceeded to tell use to get out, as we left these bouncer wanna bees stood in the door continuing to try n instigate me to come back and take a swing, sad that every were u go now a days business have cameras....Makes it easy for low life cowards to stroke each other's egos. Needless to say, if your looking for a place to dine steer clear of this place, because honestly, it turned into a dangerous environment in the blink of an eye and the owner and staff only tried to antaganis and escalate the situation like rabid hyinas...
