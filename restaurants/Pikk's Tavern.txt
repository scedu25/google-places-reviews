Text: This place is a favorite of mine! Great service and amazing food! My favorite thing to get is the pad Thai with shrimp! They also have super yummy specials for the people who aren't committed to one food at a restaurant or the foodie who wants to try something new!

Text: Good food. Moderate prices. A little small, a little cramped, and a little loud.

But I'd go back.
