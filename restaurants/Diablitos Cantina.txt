Text: This is my favorite place to eat in the city. The prices are fair, and they have a large drink/beer selection. The $3 all you can eat salsa bar brings in many college folks and is always great. I highly recommended the New York salsa. Their street tacos are delicious. I haven't had one that was bad. The pulled pork and chicken comes from Kenrick's, so you know it's good. They have outdoor seating and a fire pit for colder evenings.

Text: Just went there for the first and last time. The food was great but our waitress was horrible. She had an attitude from the start, I would NEVER have given her a job. It took us nearly two hours from start to finish to get out of there. We waited for an hour to get our food. Within that hour we were checked on maybe two times tops. She was not attentive and was rude, too. I could keep going on and on with examples, but you get the point. Oh, and I paid in cash and she shorted me on my change. So she's a theif, too.

Text: Atmosphere inside is colorful, but the lighting is inadequate. The interior is too dark, but sitting on the patio is quite nice. The food in my experiences there (twice) is delicious! But I'm not sure why they charge for the salsa bar. IMO chips & salsa should always be included in your order. Worth at least one visit.
