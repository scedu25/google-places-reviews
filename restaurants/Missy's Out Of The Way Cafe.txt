Text: We were on a road trip with friends and stopped in for dinner about 5pm. We got lucky and they were able to seat us right away. The teriyaki chicken and steak was delicious. Only thing that disappointed me was i askes for the grilled pineapple with my teriyaki chicken and it was one slice of pineapple out of a can of pineapple.

Text: I was disappointed with this place. I had been looking forward to eating here. I made a special trip, just to eat here. But the service was terrible. When we were seated we waited 15 mins for our waitress to take our order. While she waited on other tables that were seated after us. Finally we asked another employee if we could order and she said that wasn't her job and she would tell the waitress. I don't see why she couldn't write that on paper and take it to the kitchen but whatever. Then after another couple of minutes our waitress came back, and said that she forgot about us, so then we were about to order then she walked off again.  So we just left, and it's not worth trying again. Bad service

Text: Arrived around 4:30 PM on a Saturday. Good thing we did because the place was packed when we left. The steak was the best of the trip and the bill was reasonable. Next time we will bring something for them to use as decoration.
