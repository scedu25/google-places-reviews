Parker's Smokehouse
Rating: 5
Text: From the smokehouse fragrance  that greets you with a promise of great tastes to come, to the wait staff, especially Riley, who are all pleasant.  The food is served promptly and the flavor is ALWAYS delicious!!!!  
The desserts are decadent, from the warm apple cobbler, to the brownie sundae.  
 Parker's is a great place to  enjoy the atmosphere of small town America while filling your tummy with great food!

Text: The experience we had at Parker's was outstanding! Seth, our server, was great! Even though it was busy, he did a commendable job on balancing the load! The food was delectable and left us wanting more. My only complaint, and mind you this may seem silly so sorry, was there was no demo done on the sauce which left my significant other wary of the sauces. One of the parts I appreciated the most was simple chocolate dessert and warm Birthday wishes from Seth instead of the obnoxious birthday singing scene.  Until next time!

Text: 10 min wait was 30 min.  Waited 15 min for someone to come to table  another 10 min to get drinks. Another 10 min to place order and after waiting 30 min to get food, we had it boxed up.  Manager said she checked the ticket and we only waited 30 min.  Didnt account for being ignored. It was so hot in the restaurant we took food home where it was cool.  So disappointed

Text: Catered a family event for us. They took care of everything. Food was excellent. The brisket and Romano potatoes were excellent! Portions and prices were great. Debbie was very friendly, responsive, and knowledgeable. I would come back again and again.
