Text: Best sushi I have ever had anywhere. I grew up in o.c. California. This place is fantastic, if people hate in it oh well. I still talk to my old lady and reminisce on our date we had there years ago. I was referred by a old oil field buddy there a long time ago. We drove there and had a blast. Great fresh crab. Sushi etc. Good service great sake. No complaints. I have never left a food review anywhere for any reason. But after reading the negative comments I had to speak up. This place is awesome. Wish I could just say it sucks to keep people away and have all this grub to myself, but I won't do them dirty like that. Haters are haters what can u say??? Those people belong at Apple bees not here. Will return anytime I'm in Wichita

Text: You won't find better sushi in town! I love the environment of Kanai, the staff is always so kind no matter how busy they are they work together to take care of you, and I LOVE getting to know the owners each time I go in! I have never had a bad roll and I have tried over half the menu. The Ozeki Saki is excellent and at a very reasonable price. HIGHLY recommended!

Text: Best sushi in Wichita bar none. Fresh, delicious, with a fantastic smoked salmon roll and of course, a fantastic variety of other rolls. The head chef and owner has been in there every night I've been there. So good, so delicious! A+

Text: Great sushi and great service. I like the variety it gives to the city having more than one sushi place is a big deal to me, because sushi is such an expressive and creative art. So having more than one place gives variety.  Great atmosphere as well. I love Kanai
