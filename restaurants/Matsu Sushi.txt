Text: This location had a really cool walk up to the door. The prep sushi maker was really friendly. He makes excellent quality plates with high end looks for lower price. If your in Omaha in the old market by the slides check it out.

Text: This is my favorite restraunt! I eat here a couple times a week and is always delicious I've tried many things on the menu and none has ever disappointed me. The service is awesome, the atmosphere is usually always peaceful and quiet, and it is fairly priced. Their Udon Beef soup is one of the best soups I've ever had, I've also taken many people here and they have always enjoyed what I had them try. Overall this is a great restraunt and if you have found your taste for Japanese/Asian food then I definitely recommend Mastu!

Text: Authentic and quieter than the other Old Market Sushi spots. Matsu is my favorite among more popular joints like Blue, Hiro or Tokyo. The portion sizes for sushi are better, but price is about the same. 

Service is better overall, but there are a few language barrier issues from time to time. The other places are more modern, loud or have an all you can eat options, but Matsu carries an atmosphere of a sushi/Asian restaurant with all the character you'd expect.
