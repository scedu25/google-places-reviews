Stonewood Ale House

Text: Just left a deliciously tasting dinner from Stonewood Ale House. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing with a great bar to watch games. Our server was excellent with knowing the menu and making us feel welcome. She was very attentive and also gave us space. A perfect balance as a waitress! He manager, Bradley, was also wonderful to check on us and make sure all was good. Definitely will be going back again and having another appetizing burger!

Text: Food was not bad. Cheese sticks, Frickles(fried pickles), ribs and chicken we were all good. I would have bumped to 4 but i am pretty sure they forgot my son's chicken strips, though the waiter said they "didn't like the looks of the first batch, so they made a new batch".  Atmosphere had a bit of family restaurant with sports bar/pub feel. Seemed nice and clean.

Text: Very good food. Bavarian pretzels are excellent. Really enjoyed the spicy crispy Burger as well. I tried they're Stonewood Amber ale and it was excellent

Text: Service was good. Stonewood Amber Ale was very tasty,  Main courses (patty melt, meat loaf, and black & blue burger) were excellent and large portions. Sides (according to all three of us) need some work. Chocolate brownie dessert was dry. Overall an ok experience
