Text: The mall is cool. Especially since its the only one we have. Its hard to find trendy plus size clothing. You just have to have plenty of time to look and a great imagination. Plenty of food options. There is a lot of change with the stores. I did text tgem today to see if the have motorized scooters. They do not but you can use a wheelchair. I'm currently not walking :)  they responded back very quickly.

Text: Nice clean place. Excellent for an early morning walk. And the coffee shop inside opens up early so you can get your shot right after you're done with your walk

Text: I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to pick up a gift certificate for a friend's new baby. I was very disappointed that there's NO ONE in the office on Sunday to write up a gift certificate. I spoke with the security at the mall and explained to him what I was needing. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the news that there's no one available to handle my request... It's Sunday - not a holiday!!! I understand people want off weekends, but it's a Mall!!!
