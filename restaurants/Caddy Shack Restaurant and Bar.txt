Text: Came here for some entertainment while staying on Kelley's Island.  We had some of their hummus/pita break and pizza.  Both were pretty good. The pita bread was actually delicious! Prices were not too bad.  Didn't have a good experience trying to get a drink from the bartender inside.  I swear he went around the entire bar to everyone else before he even asked what I wanted and it wasn't even that busy.  It was a little annoying. They had a band that was playing 80's music out front and we loved it.  Lots of people and dancing.  Had a great time!

Text: Nice stop to grab a beer and enjoy a patio on Kelley's. We always rent a golf cart, grab lunch, and then stop here for a drink. Very friendly service!
