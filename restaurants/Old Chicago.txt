Text: The food here is amazing! Stromboli was perfect! I tried the buffet to have a taste of the many different pizzas- it was followed by chocolate chip cookies which alone are worth the visit! Our server was Angie and she was great. An individual pan pizza could easily feed two people and is around 10 bucks. The lunch buffet was 9 bucks with a soda and cookies. Freshly made pizzas and Stromboli constantly bless the counter and do not sit for long. This is a great place!

Text: A wonderful place to go for some pizza, Stromboli or other Italian food, and amazing appetizers. Full bar, lots of American beers & craft beers on tap or in bottles/cans. Great atmosphere for family or romance. A lot of fun. Staff is wonderful, friendly & helpful too. Try it out for something different other than your ordinary "fast-food" pizza.

Text: Stopped here on our way home from Chicago and were pleasantly surprised! Very good food (we got deep dish pizza, of course) and very friendly service. Would definitely visit again!

Text: Great place, with awesome deep dish pizza! The waitress was awesome too!

The kitchen made our pizzas wrong to begin with, but the waitress caught it to begin with: she told them to make new right ones, and then told us that it would take ten extra minutes, and asked us if we wanted to have a slice of the wrong ones while waiting, or if we wanted to take them with us (we did) with no extra charge, if course. Great way of handling the situation! :)

Text: I had a horrible experience here. I have eaten here multiple times and had minor issues but I recently went and purchased two appetizers that were overpriced for little food and I opened my silverware and there was a big chunk of old food. Then I went to eat my meal and the third bite I took I felt a huge hard chunk and after that I found two pieces of hair that was short, black, and curly, that was not my hair or any of my family’s hair. On top of that when we told the manager she only took my meal off the check. This place doesn’t even deserve one star.
