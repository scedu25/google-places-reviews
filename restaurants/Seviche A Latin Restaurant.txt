Seviche A Latin Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: 5/5 food, 5/5 ambiance, 3/5 service, 4/5 price

Very delicious food, and I think the best place for Latin food in Louisville.  The price is high, but almost always worth it.  The atmosphere can't be beat for a nice evening, and the staff are friendly.  The service time could use a large improvement, however, as I usually end up waiting 15-30 minutes between being seated at a table and placing an order.

Despite this, I will certainly come again because the food is absolutely worth it.

Text: The BEST the BEST the BEST!!!! I LOVE this place. They go above and beyond to make sure that your meal is awesome. The staff is very nice, the ambiance is lovely, and the food is sooo good. My date is a extremely picky eater, and they made a dinner for him that wasn't even on the menu. He loved it!! I had wine that I had never had and it was delicious!! The food, staff and ambiance get my FIVE STARS!!!!
