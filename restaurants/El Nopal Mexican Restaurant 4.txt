Text: Great friendly service, had the steak fajitas, a little skimpy on the meat, but tasty nonetheless. Very fast service as well. Convenient being next door to The truck stop.

Text: I stopped off this place on my way back to Florida from Iowa. It wasn't half bad but it wasn't fantastic. The tortillas while pretty decent had clearly been soaked in leftover Grease. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because quite frankly you won't find anything better along the highway then this restaurant. So you might as well stop there and enjoy it. And will the food might only be for stars, the customer service There is five.
