Text: I can only speak for Walker & Leamington locations.
I hate calling and ordering pizza at these 2 locations.
It always seems rushed like they are doing you a favor.
The pizza itself ? Decent. Sometimes real good ,
sometimes not so good. Most recent in Leamington
not so good. Undercooked toppings with a burnt crust.
Not sure how that happens.
For my money I would rather patronize Dougall Cheese Wheelz.
Just my 2 bits.

Text: At 30 bucks for a full rack of "tbq" ribs, I expected them to be awesome... WORST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD. Absolutely brutal.
Our waitress was great though.

Text: We arrived at 1:45 and didn't get our food until 2:25 despite there being almost no one else in the restaurant. We only ordered wraps. The table was sticky. There was no apology for the slow service. The women's bathroom was dirty and one of the taps were broken. When we eventually got our wraps they were good and the portion of fries was large.
