Text: This place isn't bad, but not all the food was great.

Our nacho appetizer was very flavorful, the kids meals were made well and the dessert was tasty as well, but my chicken burger was DRY. Really dry. Almost hard to swallow dry. I asked for a side of ranch and used that to help get it down. I didn't mention it to the waitress or send it back because I have worked in the restaurant business and I know exactly what happens to returned food and wasn't willing to risk it. Our waitress was incredible, very friendly and attentive (I think her name was Shelby) and the place was clean. 4 stars overall.

Text: I ate here every night while on a project in Saint Joe. Great service, great food, and reasonably priced. Spicy chicken sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. The tater kegs were one of the best appetizers I have ever had as well. Highly recommended.

Text: I'm in town for the eclipse and Alexis was my waitress. She's super cute and the food was perfect. The sweet potato fries were just perfect and the burger was perfect. I even ordered and ate and entire mini loaf of bread.  I bet the desserts are good. But I'm so full I can't eat anymore.

Text: Great atmosphere, and a well versed menu certain to satisfy whatever you are craving. The spicy chicken sandwich is amazing, and came well recommended, as it should be.

Text: We had a 30 min wait which wasn't bad. Service was horrible. We didn't get our food at the same time. One person in our party had to wait an extra 10 min only to have the pasta and chicken be cold. Table wasn't clean. Had to ask for the check and never got the cookie that came with the kids meal.
