Text: Coming from Texas my expectations weren't high finding a place in central Illinois that can compare. The bbq wasn't bad. I will say I was very disappointed with the portion size. I ordered the 3 choice combo platter and the brisket, turkey, and pork ribs. I thought they accidentally ordered from the kids menu. For over $21 I was expecting more. Probably won't go again.

Text: Great hospitality, our server, Serena, was more than polite; she was very informative, and humorous, with an extensive knowledge of the menu items, elaborating on the vast amount of menu choices. The atmosphere was exquisite, especially the metal platters that the food was served on tied that gave the atmosphere a more rustic look. The food was reasonably priced for it’s quality and there was a large array of interesting menu items.

Text: Great place to stop in even if you are just passing through. Friendly staff and fast service. The house made BBQ sauces are fantastic! Try the chips and salsa, better than what you might expect.

Text: Fantastic burnt ends!  Definitely recommends. The chicken and turkey tacos however were very weak, lacking flavor ni had to add BBQ sauce to eat them. Also, the salsa needs some cilantro in it. I gave five stars because other members of the groups loved the BBQ sandwiches.

Text: Came in from all the great hype ive heard of this place. Food quality was poor to mediocre at best. Beer selection was miserable. The prices did not support portion amounts. So, I've tried it, it failed, I won't return.
