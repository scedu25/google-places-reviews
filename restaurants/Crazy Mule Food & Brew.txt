Text: Great fresh food and friendly service at a good price. They even had safe and clean highchairs and coloring books and crayons for kids. The bathroom was a little bit dirty, and they only had one unisex restroom, which? always had a line. But it did have a changing table. The food wasn't fast, but it was fairly fast considering how busy it was. The place was packed. I ordered the small southwest salad. It was plenty of food and tasted super fresh. I lived the cilantro lime dressing.

Text: I ate there on my way to Oklahoma. My coworker and I ordered the same meal. My meal was half the size of my coworkers. The breading on the chicken fried steak was like plaster, hard and dry. The steak was also hard and dry. They refilled my coworkers drink and left mine there without offering to fill mine and it remained empty during the entire meal. I found the food to be poor in preparation and quality and the service non existent.  I will never stop in there again.  Kwik shop sounds more appetizing. Save time and money, go someplace else.

Text: I got mushroom Swiss burger with sweet potato fries. There mushrooms were very fresh. The cheese tasted processed. The burger was very good. The sweet potato fries were very hot and very limp. 

Service was okay, or a bit better.

Text: Fun place to eat. Friendly staff. Food was okay. Biggest problem is the time. It took us nearly an hour to get our three burgers, and then another long wait to receive our check and take care of payment. If you have all the time in the world for lunch this is a fine place to eat. If you're in a rush or on a limited amount of time I'd look elsewhere.
