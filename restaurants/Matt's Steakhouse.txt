Matt's Steakhouse
Rating: 4
Text: Ribeye was tender and good tasting, but not well trimmed. Garlic mashed potatoes were tasty, but portion size was small for their size of steak. Our bottomless salad and bread sticks were never refilled. Took a long time for our buffalo shrimp appetizer to come out. Our waitress was devoid of personality.

Text: Where to start...the salad is fantastic, the bread sticks are divine, then you have THE BEST steak and baked potato around (the coconut shrimp is amazing as well).  The wait staff and the owners top it all off with excellent service and welcoming attitudes.  We have never been disappointed.
