Text: My favorite Mexican restaurant, I am never disappointed here. Tried something new with a fajita taco salad. It was not only a generous portion, but it was presented beautifully and tasted as good as it looked.

Text: I understand it's hard to believe that someone can be allergic to jalapenos....but i am, and love Mexican food! My husband and I both stressed the importance that no jalapenos come near my plate to the waitress. Mind you I ordered a chicken casadillia, take one bite and what do ya know! All I could think is haha someone must not have believed me, and thought they'd test it out....not like an oops moment where a sliver of jalapeno krept over there, no it was a single slice of jalapeno! Needless to say I swelled up, had to use my last freaking epi...and still had to pay for my food!! The food was good though, so as long as you don't have a weird allergy like me...you'll probably very much enjoy this place!!
