Text: Kylie was my waitress and she was amazing! I ordered lobster with a house salad and creme brûlée and everything was fast and delicious. I couldn’t give this place anything less than 5 stars!

Text: Lovely restaurant and I've had luck in the past however my husband and I both ate the bacon wrapped shrimp with angel hair pasta last night and the dish was laying in a pool of orange grease. We both had horrible stomach issues later that night.
