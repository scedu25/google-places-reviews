Text: Decent place to go. Food is great for the price. They have a nice outdoor patio setting as well. The seating is not the most comfortable, but doable. You get nice fresh chips and salsa dip and there is a variety of food for anyone. I did find the red meat chewy at times, but all in all a nice authentic seeming place to try.

Text: I've been going here for several years.  Always delicious food, friendly service, great margs and fun atmosphere.  We have had many family birthday dinners here. They let you bring your own dessert for the birthday celebration.  My favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.

Text: The food is reminiscent of bowling alley food, low quality, yellow cheese Tex-Mex. Compelling in the same way Jack in the Box tacos are. A bit overpriced for what it is. 

Cadillac margaritas are the best in the area although more ice than drink. 

Service is usually good, sometimes disappointing.

Text: Great tasting food, fajita steak kind of tough, but very flavorful. VERY long wait to check out, stood at least 8-10 minutes with my elderly mother who had just left the hospital. There were 4 customers in line waiting also. The cashier was no where I'm right and no one stepped up to check customers out, although other employees were available, but not helping with checking people out.
