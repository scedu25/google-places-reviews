Text: Fourteen of us had Christmas Eve dinner here. I had Penne with Sun-dried Tomato Pesto. It was very good. I thought the service was pretty good considering they were very full, with people waiting at the entrance at 5 pm. One member of our party was in a wheelchair and found access from the parking lot to the upper level seating was very easy. Unsure about handicap access in the restroom since we did not use it. Good job, IL Forno!
