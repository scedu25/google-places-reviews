Pies & Pints Pizzeria

Text: We stopped in while driving through WV and we’re pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is very laid back and chill while the staff played right into that. Our waitress was fun, friendly and witty. She had great recommendations from beer to specific pairings. My SO bad the Black IPA which began fruity and ended with a darker bite. We’ve traveled extensively trying different beers and this one stood out. They had a great local and east coast selection of beers along with a diverse options from all categories. As for the food we settled on the “Cuba Gooding Jr” which was a half of the Cuban Pork and half of the Chicken Gouda. It was slightly over cooked (or maybe they didn’t have enough cheese?) but was delicious regardless. It is a bit pricier but they don’t skimp on anything so we had no problem paying $25 for the pie. 

Wish we lived closer so we could stop by more often!

Text: I'm not a huge fan of pizza, or at least I wasn't until I tried the pies at Pies & Pints. They have such a wide variety of choices, and you cannot go wrong with any one. Furthermore, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is upbeat and fun. I have nothing to complain about, except that they don't have a location closer to home.

Text: Quite literally the best grilled wings and gorgonzola dipping sauce you'll ever have!  My favorite pizza is the Mediterranean Shrimp, but I've tried several and have yet to find one that I just don't thoroughly enjoy. In addition to the amazing food the service is second to none; the last waitress we had was the perfect mix of professional and friendly.

Text: Passing through town and stopped here based on reviews.  This was awesome.  As close to what I would consider a perfect pizza crust as there could possibly be.  Great toppings too.  
So glad we found this place.

Text: This is the borderline definition of gourmet pizza. Servers are nice, pizza is great. There is a wait but I'd say it's worth it. Not everyday food but you'd wish it was.
