Text: I've had better frozen pizza. The service and the entertainment aspect of the place is pretty decent, but the pizza was downright awful. My kids wouldn't even eat it. We didn't finish one piece of thst cardboard pizza. If you are hungry...I would suggest thinking twice.

Text: Trivia is fun but if you want food the service is slow.

Text: I have been coming here for almost 2 years, and have never had a problem getting served alcohol. I have an out of state licence that is vertically positioned, but there is clearly an "under 21 until 2014" and my ID is valid for 4 more years. Tonight I was refused a drink because of this. Clearly, customer loyalty and a valid drivers license mean nothing to this establishment. I don't want to be "that person" because I work in customer service, but this was quite insulting and I will not be ordering food or beverages here anymore

Text: Great selection of food, including gluten free pizza crust! Full bar also, but family oriented.
