JJ Twig's Pizza & Pub
Rating: 5
Text: It’s nice to have a restaurant that cares about fresh food and premium ingredients. Hand made breaded mushrooms were excellent and the double decker pizza is original and superb. Perfect amount of sauce, toppings, and cheese with a crispy crust makes it perfect. Great to have an establishment be around for almost 10 years and still care about the quality of food. This sets them apart from the rest. I will definitely be returning.

Text: First and last timer. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive but food is lacking. The burgers were awful, even my 13 yr old son wouldn't eat it! Definitely not a 10 dollar burger(included fries). Maybe pizza or something else is better but I won't be back to see.

Text: My first time visit so I can only comment on the JJ Twig burger. It was cooked to my satisfaction (slight red inside) and well seasoned. Piled high with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and cheese of your choice. 1/2 pound of beef is more than a monthful. The flavor was great.
