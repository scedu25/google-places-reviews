Text: First place we ate while spending the weekend - everything was great. I was told to order everything "Greek Style" by a local and they were right. Greek salad, Greek fries, and Greek Rib-eye were all amazing. I'd make the trip from Milwaukee again just to go here.

The whole family was working!

Also, the Old-Fashion was delicious!

Text: Not at all what we expected. We thought (were told) this was a traditional American steak house but what we found was a Greek steak house and we loved it! The food was amazing and there were some very nice options with a Greek flair (but not over-the-top). We would definitely eat here again!

Text: Great food, affordable prices, and wonderful atmosphere are terms that I would use to describe this place. The seafood that I had was delicious and the service was fairly quick. The only issue is that we had to wait a bit for our bill, but the place was busy and we were in a hurry so we were probably just feeling a bit antsy. Overall, great place to have dinner at affordable prices.

Text: Never had a bad meal here. Steak was always perfection. Salad super fresh. It's worth the 2 hour trip to eat here. Wish they opened earlier in the day though
