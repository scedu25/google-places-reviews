The Farmers Daughter

Text: Confused.  If the food is suppose to be made  and served  as soon as possible after you order, why was my food the last one to be served. There were around 14 of us customers and my daughter ordered the same as me.  She ordered at least 10 minutes after me and got her food around 10 minutes before me.  Food was good except for the hush puppies and slaw.

Text: The food was excellent and very well priced with free coffee.   Waitress was amazing, on point and noticed that my steak was overcooked before i got it and brought me another cooked properly without even me having to ask!  Will certainly return again!

Text: Entered the restaurant and was told to seat ourselves. Waited 15 mins with no acknowledge from any of the wait staff who were standing around talking amongst themselves. What a shame, thought it would be a nice friendly place. They lost what would have been an awesome tip. Lets not talk about the dirty dish rage left at the only table free for is to sit at!
