Text: I would give them a -4 star, if I could. We were passing through at lunchtime thinking this would be a great place to stop. The restaurant was very clean, but this didn’t warrant the bad service and cold food. We waited over 15 minutes for our food. We asked a waitress when it would be coming out. She walked over to the food warmer and pulled it out, it had been sitting there the whole time we were waiting!!! It was cold, subpar, & unsatisfactory!! Our food was so grim it should’ve been remade! We also noticed that a majority of locals seemed to know that staff and we served shortly after sitting down. We felt as if we were not the important customers. We will not be returning to this establishment until a new franchise owner takes over. Frank Hardee what were you / your team of professionals thinking when this place had its last corporate review?? We were warned about how it would take an hour and the food would be cold, but I didn’t believe it to be true. Unfortunately it was in our case.

God Bless.

Text: We order one combo at the drive through and she gave us our total without asking if there was anything else. Then when we told her there was more she let out a big sigh over the intercom.  When we order our second combo she told us it was going to be awhile. It was only 8:00pm they don't close til 10:00pm and the parking lot was empty.

Text: We got very sick after eating. We ordered the same thing. Both got diareia after eating. We were fine before this. We will not be eating here again.  The sad thing is we both got diareia and sick.

Text: I went to Hardee's on a Sunday when there was one car and me. I ordered and it took 10 min for my order to be handed to me only for me to find out that I did not get a receipt, my fries where not in the bag for either meal along with the cheeseburger not being correct. They got 0% of that order right.  I called to tell them we didn't receive our fries. While the guy on the phone manages to say to me "we noticed we didn't put the fries in the bag." No apology, no trying to make it right. Horrible service. If you can't get it right on a Sunday. How do you think you can make it during rush hour on a Friday lunch hour!? Did I mention that the manager was there at that time too? ?
