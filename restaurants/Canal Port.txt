Text: After several years we recently gave this place another try, because it used to be good. While waiting for our dinner the waitress didn't check back with us, so I had to go to the bar for our drink refills. I did tell owner, who was at the bar, but even so, I still had to flag down the waitress for another drink. I assumed the owner would have said something to her, right? Guess not? The food was just average, nothing special, which is sad because we used to like this place. After so many years we really hoped they had improved their food and service, like it was before they expanded the seating capacity, but they didn't, oh well.

Text: It's a slightly expensive place, but that's to be expected in a tourist town (Matthiessen and Starved Rock State Parks are near by), and the food is pretty darn good (try the crab cakes!), plus they have a nicer than expected beer selection (Lagunita's, Bell's, Sierra Nevada). Give it a try!
