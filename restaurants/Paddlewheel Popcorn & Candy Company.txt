Text: What a surprise!  Spent a weekend in Hannibal and walked around downtown, wandered into this shop and bought the 'Tom Sawyer' on a whim--holy cow it was amazing!  Am tempted to go out of my way to drop by again to pick up some more of this fresh goodness...try it yourself--they even let us sample some of the others!
