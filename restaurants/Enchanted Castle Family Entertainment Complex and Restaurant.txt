Text: I frequent many arcades and have to say this was the best, most stress-free arcade visit I've ever had. 

Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Management is nice and active with customers. Overall an extremely enjoyable experience. When you come in be sure to check out all the deals before purchasing credits as they have some excellent food/credit combos.

Text: The staff is nice, the things to do are fun, but the price is way too high. Games cost $1+ per play, and you barely get any tickets. With about $20, I  was able to play for around 30 min trying different games, and another 45 min going to the "attractions", and got around 150 tickets. For comparisons sake, I  spend a lot less then that for Dave and Busters or nickel city, and get way more tickets. I  would not go back unless the prices came down. I  have no complaints of the quality or friendliness of the staff, I  just do not feel the prices are reasonable.

Text: Worst place to throw your child’s party. $800 for two hours . Rushed to eat and too leave-like the rent was over due. Horrible-just horrible.
