Text: We needed a place to stop on the way back home, and from years ago when we had family living in Carroll, we had Cronk's recommended as a stop, and I am so glad they did. The service was fantastic and friendly, the food was incredible, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and comfortable. I had the bacon cheeseburger, something I've had many places and this was really a standout for me, and the rest of our group had nothing but praise for the place. Just a great meal at a great place, gladly given five stars.
