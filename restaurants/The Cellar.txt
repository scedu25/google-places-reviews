Text: Great basic coffee, and amazing espresso drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. Their sandwiches and soups are delicious. I personally recommend the chicken salad sandwich. Yummy!

Text: They have good food that is reasonable in price. Its hard to see from the street and i dont recommend it to anyone that is handicaped cause you have to go down a steep flight of concrete steps to go inside.
