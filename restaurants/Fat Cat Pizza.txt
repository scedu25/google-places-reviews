Text: Good food when you can get it I live in Columbus and bring my daughter to Walmart in Lancaster to work she has to be there at 10:00 pm which is when Fat Cats is supposed to close but I try to call and order all the time at 9:30-9:40 but they never answer and I'm talking I will try 3-4 times a week but they never answer then I will go by and they are cleaning the kitchen with signs on and lights!!!! So they are just trying to get out of there so why not change your hours so you can leave early instead of disappointing loyal customers!!!! We have been eating at Fat Cats religiously for 30 years but the service just isn't what it used to be!!!! Hopefully they  can turn into room for dessert find a new pizza place I guess eat it !!!!!!!!

Text: Great pizza one of my favorites here in town. I recommend it to people any chance I get. The first time I tried it was on Washington Ave (I think) on West side. I was hooked I used to love the veggie with broccoli on it. Since then something seems different. I miss it before but it is still one of my favorite pizza places in town.
