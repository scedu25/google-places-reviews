Chicken Place

Text: Quaint, old fashioned fried chicken diner style place with gizzards, hearts, and livers in additional to the regular chicken pieces. Good variety and prices, slightly greasy even for fried chicken but I would still recommend.

Text: We have been going to The Chicken Place since 1987.  We live 63 Miles away but it is always well worth an afternoon trek!  Whenever we have friends come from out of state, we always include a trip to The Chicken Place as a special treat to awesome fried chicken and southern hospitality.  You might wamt to try one of their margaritas too!  However, need to get Amber Bock back!
