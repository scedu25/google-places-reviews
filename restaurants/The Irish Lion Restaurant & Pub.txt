Text: Great fish & chips... seasoned well and the fries were perfectly crispy.  One thing you must try is the Blarney Puffballs starter, which is deep-fried potato balls made with a cheese & garlic mixture, served with sour cream and chives.  Delicious!

Text: Long time favorite on Kirkwood in a historic building and with a solid Irish themed menu. Many great beers on tap and specialty cocktails. A good variety of foods for all tastes. Service is always friendly and usually fast.

Text: This is the best place in the state to get great Irish food and beer. Try the Shepard's pie and a glass of kilkenny. My personal favorite

Text: Probably my most favorite place to eat in Indiana.  I'll drive an hour from home just to eat here.
Never had bad service or food in the 15 plus years I've been coming here.  Highly recommend for Irish fare.
