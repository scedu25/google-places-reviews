Rigazzi's
Rating: 5
Text: My absolute go-to spot on the Hill for years.  Rigazzi's has some of the best toasted ravioli's in St. Louis, and that's saying something.  

Although it might feel a little dated when you first walk in, the charm of Rigazzi's is incredible.  Old school service and excellent food are hallmarks of the entire neighborhood but Rigazzi's hits it out of the park each visit.

I strongly recommend a fishbowl beer, an appetizer of toasted ravioli, and a pizza or sandwich.  This place is an absolute must-see for St. Louis foodies or anyone on their way to a Cards or Blues game. 

Top notch!

Text: Went here for my birthday never had been here before. Had a party of 8 the food was great service was awesome. Even a waiter who wasn't waiting on our party sang happy birthday to me. Everyone in our party had a great time. We didn't have reservations and still were treated top notch. I thank you for birthday dinner to remember

Text: Best restaurant not only in St. Louis, but ever.  I've been eating here since I was a child with my parents.  The food is incredible; the meatballs are to die for. The service is fantastic, the right amount of courtesy and gruff honesty that you look for in servers.  If you eat at one Italian restaurant in St. Louis, make sure it's this one.

Text: Family of 5 visit (1.5-adult). Amazing food, my husband and I both had the special which was all you can eat lasagna (although I will be impressed with anyone who could eat more than one plate!). The kids all shared a pizza which seemed to be made from scratch and they all enjoyed it without complaint. The atmosphere seems to range from family friendly to a great date night spot. Great service, would definitely go again!

Text: Rigazzi's is located on The Hill. I have been there quite a few times. The food is somewhat mediocre for the price, and somewhat less fancy than its similarly priced counterparts in the neighborhood.  You can't go wrong with any restaurant on The Hill, and the price and quality are still better than most other restaurants in our region.
