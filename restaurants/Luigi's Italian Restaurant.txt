Luigi's Italian Restaurant

Text: Food is always consistent and amazing!  The service was by the far the worst service we've ever received at this restaurant.  It was a slow Friday night, a total of 7 tables seated. We waited  over an hour and a half for our food. During this time our waitress brought our appetizers, drinks, salads and rolls all in one trip. Shortly after this the table behind us had been served our meals by her "trainee " without our server (her trainer)  any where in sight. She then proceeded to check on us a total of one time, while she was finally bringing our food out to us, making a total of two times in the almost two hours we sat there.  Our waitress blamed her "trainee " for mixing the food up, honest mistake. Most of this could have been remedied with a simple apology, instead we received excuse after excuse.  Our waitress attempted to  discount our meal (25%) at that point we requested to speak to the manager about our service. She came back to our table and informed us the manager/ owner didn't wish to speak to us because he was busy and comped  our meal. We hope this isn't a sign of how the business is doing, it would be such a shame to lose them.  Their food is really that good.
