Text: This place is wonderful! Low gas/diesel prices, bathrooms /restrooms upstairs AND downstairs! Convenience store, cafe/restaurant, and even showers (downstairs, as you enter cafe entrance). Big and nice and clean. Friendly workers.

Text: I am not one to ever complain and I never post reviews,  but this was bad enough for me to take time to post a review,  My family and went to this cafe around 7:30-8:00pm, the place is filthy.  The servers are not attentive, they changed there portion size,  we paid $3.99 for a spear of eggs and over cooked bacon and stale toast for my kids, the egg on my omelet was over cooked and dry.  I ordered a sweet tea,  it tasted moldy so I asked for a glass of water,  it still tasted moldy which means they don't clean the ice machine or bins,  I watched an employee drop coffee lids on the floor then restock with the lids that were on the floor,  I will never go to this place again.

Text: A convenience store built around an all year fireworks stand. Diesel fuel fairly accessible(no showers). Good gas prices if you sign up for a Trex points card. Lots of locations in north western Mo.

Text: The gas station and fireworks part is great. Clean bathrooms, decent coffee, food and soda selections.
The resteraunt is another story entirely. When they first started it was great but since then I guess they've gotten a manager that orders whatever cheapest without changing the prices. I ordered a burger with bacon and mushrooms, didn't have them when it arrives. Waitress offers to put them on and comes back less than 60 seconds later with nuked bacon and nuked canned mushrooms on it. Still my go-to stop for gas and drinks on I-35, will not eat in the resteraunt ever again.
