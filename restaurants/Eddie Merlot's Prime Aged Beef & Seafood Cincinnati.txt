Text: This really is a good restaurant for MSG sensitive people like me. The atmosphere is classy, the waiters attentive,  the cocktails incredible, and the food is wonderfully delicious, high quality and mostly free of MSG. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have a mild MSG reaction after eating the spiced bread they serve as a table snack. Every other aspect of my dining experience was fabulous!

Text: From the time of sitting down and took 13 minutes for them to get me my glass of wine. I ordered an ice water with a lime and had to flag down another waiter to get my lime.. this nice waiter continued to cover for my waiters bad service. When it came to pay my buddy had tons of points that should have covered his meal, but they had not been applied to his account. The manager was able to print off and confirm that he had spent thousands of dollars there. But did nothing to rectify the situation, saying that he would have to come back tomorrow, but go ahead and pay today. The food was amazing, but due to the number of issues and confusion I told him I was never going to come back and I don't intend to. For such an amazing restaurant I was greatly disappointed that they didn't have things under control. I don't collect points or use them but if in a restaurant is going to offer something like that, to not have it figured out makes the dining experience suck.
