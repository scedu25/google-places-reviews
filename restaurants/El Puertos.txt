Text: Beloit has two mexican restaurants and this one is the more casual of the two. It feels like a working class restaurant along highway 24 but that is not a bad thing in my opinion. The food is consistently good, the service is consistently good, and the prices are fair.

Text: Decent food, vibrant decor. Sometimes service is sketchy but friendly. Beef and ckn are better than the pork.
