Text: Excellent food, outstanding personnel, and lightening fast service!  We eat here almost weekly and always have a great experience. They have a large menu option, and the restaurant is very clean. We have brought in a large crowd close to closing time and they have never complained or treated us poorly.  If you are in the area, Mi Casita is the place to go!

Text: My sister and I enjoy meeting here. It's on the square with plenty of parking on the side street.

The food is always very good. I prefer the chips at other restaurants more, but it's not a big deal for me.  

Courteous staff, clean restrooms, and a very large selection on the menu.
