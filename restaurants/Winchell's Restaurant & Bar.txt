Text: Very busy. Quite a wait but food was hot and tasty.  Fun family crowd.  Staff was busy but plesent and accommodating.  I normally hate sports bars but seem to end up here at least once whenever I'm in town

Text: While I was eating the shrimp and grits I told my friend, "this is like having Brett Eldredge's voice in my mouth". So. Good. And the fact that they're consistently delicious is an added bonus. I passed through town years apart:) thanks guys! Derby pie is a winner as well...

Text: Had an amazing post Bourbon Chase brunch here. The steak and eggs were great along with the home fries and sourdough toast. Will make this stop again!

Text: Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. Not your traditional sports bar. Cosey feeling. A must go-to
