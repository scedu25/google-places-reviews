Text: Delicious every time. What stands out the most to me is now fresh their ingredients are. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean and well maintained. The Best Burrito is worth the drive from Kansas City.

Text: Best Mexican in town, in my opinion. At least ever since Mezcal changed. Great rice. Delicious tacos. Humble and homey atmosphere. Also, their salsa doesn't taste like soap. Hooray!

Text: We've been here several times and the experience is always great. The staff is very friendly and the one time our food wasn't right they fixed it right away without hassle.  The service has been the same when we've had 10 people as when we've had 4.
