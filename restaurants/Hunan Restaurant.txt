Text: The family and I (total of 6 people) arrived to town late, called our order in 20 minutes to close to be picked up. Despite our large, late order all of the employees were nice and the food was amazing. Extremely great fun for such a great experience after a 7 hour drive.

Text: Hunans is our go to at lunch time for a sit down meal, easy in and easy out.  So far everything we have tried has been very tasty. The prices are less at lunch time and then increase for the evening meal.
We have our favorites but we have tried different dishes and as I sated before they are all good.
We both love the Hot and sour soup. When we catch colds that is our go to hot soup. It makes up feel better quicker.
The floor plan is very comfortable with plenty of room between tables. The restaurant can hold quite a few people. The service is fast and your drink will never be empty. 
The bathrooms are nice and clean.

Text: The waitress and hostess were super sweet and the food was yummy! The only problem I had was a huge one: they had a lonely turtle trapped in a glass tank. The water the turtle was in was very dirty and very shallow. The female cashier was not busy at all and could have easily cleaned the tank and added more water.
        Regardless, the tank that the turtle was in was too small and the turtle was clawing at the glass trying to get out. Just because the animal is a reptile, not a mammal, it still needs attention and needs freedom. I hope that they take the turtle out to play and love sometimes.
