AZUR restaurant and patio
Rating: 5
Text: Azur has a great atmosphere, the patio is wonderful and they feature live music in the weekends.  Chef Jeremy Ashby creates amazing dishes that source local ingredients and are truly culinary masterpieces.   The service is great and they will accommodate special dietary requests.  Try the wood fired pizza Thursday-Sunday, it's delicious!  Sunday's feature family style meals and Monday is $5 Burger night for rewards members.

Text: Very good food. I had a turkey wrap with bacon, goat cheese and peach preserves for lunch and it was incredible. I live outside of  Chicago and find myself wanting to go back and have it again. My only complaint would be that they were kind of slow relative to how busy they were at the time. Very clean, bright and friendly place however. I'd go back.
