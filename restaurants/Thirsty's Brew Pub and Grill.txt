Text: The atmosphere is great!  The building is very open and features unique artwork. The food is mediocre, not terrible but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is the true draw. I wish that they had some healthier options (the salads are all iceberg). It would also be great if they added a vegetarian option or two so I  bring others here.

Text: Fantastic service and the food is great. There's a fairly large selection from salads, pasta, seafood, steak, burgers, sandwiches, and more. The layout is great. The tables aren't smashed together and it's not too loud to visit! 5/5 recommendation.
