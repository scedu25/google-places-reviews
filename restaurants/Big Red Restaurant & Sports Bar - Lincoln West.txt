Big Red Restaurant & Sports Bar - Lincoln West

Text: Pretty good variety on the menu. Decent specials including 1/2 apps on Fridays. Pretty friendly staff and food is generally ready in short time. The place is pretty popular so you have to get there a bit early if you want to beat the rush and get a table. I'm not sure if it is due to the amount of older people there playing Keno or not, but there always seems to be a fair amount of urine on the floor by the urinals in the men's room. That is about the only real negative other than maybe if you sit at a table near the door to the smoking area.

Text: The food would have been excellent but it was cold.  The butter didn't even start to melt on the baked potato.  The French fries were cold & soggy.  The prime rib was warm.  Our server was friendly.  I was impressed with how the waitresses work together & help each other. Experience would have been great but food needs to be served hot, HOT, HOT.

Text: Great service don't let the stars cool ya! The 4 stars is because between this location & the West O location are so completely different.  I'm a local & prefer the hustle & bustle of West O.
