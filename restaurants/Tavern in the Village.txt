Text: I didn't know good customer service still existed! My meal came out wrong but when the manager came by she apologized and quickly brought me soup while I was waiting. She then offered me another glass of wine and comped the meal on top of that. Would definitely recommend this place!

Text: Great service, terrific people, varied menu, nice atmosphere.  I was there about 2-3:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was still busy - a good sign of a good restaurant,.  I would definitely go there again!

Text: The trout is amazingly season with a phenomenal sauce and sides. My meal exceeded my expectations and appetite. Had a snack for the next day.  Sadly, my friend ordered the "Jumbo" Crab Cakes" and left hungry. I'm not sure where they got the idea they were jumbo or even an entire meal.  The Panko Shrimp dish had larger shrimp than the crab cakes.  Granted, when they say jumbo shrimp, they mean it.
