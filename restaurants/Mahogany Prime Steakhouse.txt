Mahogany Prime Steakhouse
Rating: 5
Text: This was my wife's and I first time to Mahogany and the experience was excellent. All the food from appetizers, dinner and desert was amazing. The wait staff was very courteous and numerous, I believe there was about 5 different employees waiting on us. Yes just like all the other reviews the menu is pricey but is expected for a higher end steak house. We believe that our dinner was worth it!

One of the best places for steaks here in Omaha! Took my wife there for our anniversary and the manager made sure to stop by the table and thanks us for celebrating our anniversary at their restaurant. Food was excellent and wait staff was very attentive. This is one place we will always return too.

Text: Steak was perfect. Wait staff extremely friendly. Yes, pricey. But worth it if you are looking for a perfectly cooked,steak. Also the asparagus was crispy and delicious.  Dropped in for no reason and really happy we did.

Text: Very disappointing.  The prices and decor all say fine dining but the actual experience is a different story entirely.   Walking in there was no one there to greet us, when a passing server finally did take notice of us we were practically chided for not having a reservation,  which was pretty odd considering it was five pm on a Wednesday and the place was practically empty.  The service was mediocre at best, and frankly so was the food.  We got fresh baked bread but had no way to cut it properly, we had only butter knives that we're completely inadequate for the task.  When my steak arrived, very undercooked, the server actually tried to convince me that a steak that they cooked to medium rare was the desired temp of medium well.  When I sent it back they didn't even refire it properly, instead they put the steak I had cut in half back on the grill turning it into shoe leather.  Sorry folks but when your charging fifty dollars on a steak with no sides included that is completely ridiculous.  I won't be back and can't recommend.

Text: This is our 4th time eating at Mahogany.  Every time the service is excellent, and the food is without a doubt the best we've ever had.  The manager always comes to our table to check on our satisfaction.  We will definitely be coming back!

Text: Holy smokes! The service here is outstanding- we had 2 waitresses assigned to us and any waiter that came by would step in to help in any way. Wow! The food was incredible- the rack of lamb and dynamite shrimp are definitely what I will come back for. This is a real Omaha gem!
