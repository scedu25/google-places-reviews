Text: AAAAAAH... The burger bar. Absolutley love this place! Been going there for over 40 years. Lived in Kansas city, but we have farms down here. So every time we came to town we would stop there for beef burgers and strawberry malts. EVERY TIME! Been there since 1950something I believe. I used to drive two hours from KC just to get four beef burgers, two plain, two with everything, and a strawberry malt. And I have started that tradition with my kids now. I hope this place is around for their kids to enjoy. Once you eat here, you will always come back. Trust me.
