Text: This was an okay buffet. Gen chicken was actually pretty good. Price is okay. Noodles are okay. Decent options and ice cream available. I wouldn't go again. Staff is average Chinese buffet. Nothing like ocean buffet in st rolla. Does not compare

Text: This was my first visit food was good but different than I am used to at a buffet. It's not bad food was hot waitress was attentive clearing dishes quickly and refills on drinks were frequent.

Text: First time I'd ever been in, everything about it was wrong. I love going to Chinese buffets, but this place's food and service were both horrible.

Food: 
The crab rangoons were just cream cheese, not even any imitation crab. The egg rolls and spring rolls contained *only* cabbage. The deserts they offered were cookies and such bought from the dollar store, laid out still in their packaging. The chicken dishes they offered were fine but I found the pile of imitation crab they had sitting out entirely unappetizing (and why was none of it in the crab rangoons?). The rice was underdone (raw vegetables in it, unseasoned) and the noodles were overdone (complete mush).

Service:
We had dirty plates on our table for what felt like an eternity and they took forever to refill our waters. They weren't very polite and they all just stood around talking amongst themselves. The price would've been fine if the food was good, but it cost me more than the Chinese buffet I usually eat at and that was with just waters and two people.

Not worth the money.
