Text: Charming restaurant - The sandwich I ordered seemed similar to what one could make at home, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It was definitely a quality sandwich - toasted bread, bacon, turkey, cheese and lettuce. Turkey was high quality deli sliced.  Potato salad was excellent as well. Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of their pies.
