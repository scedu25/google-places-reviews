Text: I'm not sure why the rating is so poor here. I've eaten here several times and always had great food and great service.  I've tried their sandwiches,  flatbread pizzas and turkey dinner special and have enjoyed all of them!

Text: Friendly staff and good quality food, with a great view of the buffalo. Plenty of seating within the area, and you can even take it back to your office

Text: For the last two time eating at the grill within the café the food was very undercooked.  I am officially done with eating here.  I work in the building and its the only place to eat within walking distance.  I got runny egg for breakfast and some hot dogs that were on the grill for 2 second for lunch.    Not to mention that it pricey for slop.  I would rather starve.....
