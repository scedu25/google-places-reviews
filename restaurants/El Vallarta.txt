Text: A hidden gem. I'm from So Cal where Mexican food is an art. This little spot is as close as you can get to excellent. They know what to cook and how to cook it. Their carnitas is outstanding as is their guacamole, salads fresh & crunchy, and the staff very friendly. Well worth the drive from Omaha or Fremont!
