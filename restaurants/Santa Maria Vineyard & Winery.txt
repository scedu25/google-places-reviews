Text: The food is terrible and their son is a felon who beats up unconscious kids. I don’t know about you but if they can’t raise a decent, well adjusted human, how can they run a decent restaurant. To the owners: tell your son to turn himself in and quit hiding out. If you have any hesitation or think I am insane, go to Iowa courts online and search Viktor Guinan.

Text: A group of us ate here, and each ordered a different thing. None were good. The lettuce salads were wilted lettuce with dehydrated cucumbers. One had to return a bad tasting steak. Would not recommend , and will definitely not go back.. Very disappointed.

Text: We try to come here for a date night every time we're visiting family in nearby Glidden, beautiful and unique inside! We've tried various dishes, haven't been disappointed yet. Great place if you're looking for something a bit nicer.
