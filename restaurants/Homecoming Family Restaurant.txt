Homecoming Family Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Stopped here to eat on the way home from my daughter's marching band competition. The food was good and plentiful. I ordered the liver and onions, (don't Ewww, I like liver,) and it was a little tough and the onions over powered it a bit, but still pretty decent. The server was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere relaxed. I would eat here again.

Text: Prices have gone up twice since I started coming here. Was $12.96 with tax to eat the breakfast bar when I first started coming here and I thought that was steep for breakfast. Now it's way over $14. By the time you tip, you have $17 for breakfast for one person. How is that a reasonable family dining experience? That's way more than Orchard Tree in Celina, Ohio and they have a bigger selection of items. The waitress asked me where I've been and I said that I'd been eating elsewhere because of their prices. Little did I know they had went up again. I won't be going back.

Text: Service is painfully slow every time we visit. On more than one occasion, we've waited 10+ minutes without being noticed and left. The food is pretty good and the staff nice, there just isn't enough wait staff hired!

Text: We love coming here. The food, the people and the feel of the place is like coming home. The buffets in the morning and afternoon is very good.
