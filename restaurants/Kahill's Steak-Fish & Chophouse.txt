Text: This is our special occasions restaurant.  I have always had an amazing ribeye cooked perfectly.  A must have is the hashbrowns. The river view is great, especially if it's snowing.

Text: I've been in a lot of steakhouses, and I can say that Kahill's has an amazing filet. The environment and service are excellent;  the view of the river is a perfect match. The selection of vines are highly recommend. If you are not in the mood for meat, the Sea bass, it is just a great option. Ahh!! I cannot forget the Mc and Cheese. Not really a big fan, until I tried here.

Text: Friday night October 13th, 2017 for our 27th wedding anniversary had reservation for 8 at 7p. We were also guests at the hotel for the weekend. Four ordered the prime rib special at 7:10pm. I ordered New York cut medium rare. At 8:12 the manager informed us they were sold out of the prime Rib. All four chose the Ribeye medium rare. Our meal finally arrived at 9:15pm. All of our steaks were cooked to medium well or more. We continued to be very polite but did express our dissatisfaction. Our total meal came to $423.00. They only compted $24.00. The response for the inconvenience was new management and high turnover. We will not dine there again.

Text: Sunday Brunch here is fantastic with a lot of selection fr8m salad to fruit to carbs.  They serve starbucks coffee which is also another nice addition.   The atmosphere is delightful as seating overlooks the river.
