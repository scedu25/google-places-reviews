Text: This place rocks , I come her once a week and it is very encouraging hanging out at the store and seeing people coming in to weigh in and loosing lbs week after week. I think the product taste really good and honestly when I use it I loose weight and when I don't and eat crap food I gain.

Text: Healthy Happenings is a Herbalife club.  Pay the membership fee when you enter the club and you can have your choice of a smoothie, a tea and a shot of aloe.  On your first visit your fees are generally waived (I can't say how long this will continue, but it has been in place for as long as I've been going).  Book your first visit in advance and you can have your metabolism tested as well and learn more about how many calories you should be eating.  Even if you don't sign up for the herbalife plan, you will benefit from the metabolism tests!   These are protein smoothies, but I have never found another protein smoothie that tastes as great as these, there are over 100 flavors to choose from.  If you're struggling to pick one, my favorite is the Wedding Cake Frosting (tastes just like frosting)!
