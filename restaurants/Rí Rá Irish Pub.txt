Text: Fantastic experience.  Somewhat small beer selection, but decent variety.  The food was very good.  I had the pretzels with beer cheese and they were fresh, flaky, and perfect.  After that I asked for recommendations and was told the fish and chips were the best.  My meal arrived with salt, lemon, malt vinegar, and ketchup, so all tastes should be covered.  The fish was huge and cooked perfectly! I went with a bit of lemon, salt, and vinegar and it was excellent.  Very friendly staff as well.

Text: Had the fish and chips. Outstanding! The service was a tad on the slow side, but they were slammed this evening, so it was totally understandable. Especially with the crowd we brought with us. Could have used more traditional Irish music over the pa. The food was delicious, the Guinness was perfect, and the servers were kind and friendly. 10/10 would go here again. Fantastic for large groups.
