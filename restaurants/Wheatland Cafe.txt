Wheatland Cafe

Text: Great small buffet, with lots of choices in smaller containers. Food is changed out frequently so its always fresh. Everything is home made style and we had no complaints about anything. There were 12 of us so we made a reservation, and we had 3 tables pushed together. Place was packed the whole time we were there.
