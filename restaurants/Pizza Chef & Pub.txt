Text: We came in as a team after a tournament that was out of town!  Our server was amazing but the comments that came from the manager and other staff was absolutely rude.  We are a very easy going fun group that tipped our server very well and we were not demanding at all.  If you want to keep business local you probably should not do people like that.   Our other restaurant choices were chain resturants!!  Next time that's where we will go!!  They liked our business and money
