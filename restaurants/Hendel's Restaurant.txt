Text: I had the grouper and it was excellent. Service was fast and friendly and attentive.   It's always crowded,  make a reservation. Wednesday is half price bottles of wine. Parking is tough.  The lot is small and most have to park on the residential streets.

Text: Great restaurant. Waitress suggested the salmon blt with the cheeseburger soup. They were both delicious. 
Was worried that historic site would mean old and rundown it is old but newly  refurbished and very clean. Very nice. Loved the atmosphere. 
Seems to be a local hangout with ladies playing cards in the bar after lunch. A young couple was meeting for a special lunch. 
I will come back.

Text: No complaints  for Hendel's. We decided to sit at the bar and get a drink while waiting for a table. The bartender was quite busy but still cortious. The food was excellent. Scallops were quite tasty as well as the peas and bacon pasta. Dessert time. Peach Praline Pie
 A LA Mode was excellent. The crust was crisp and flaky. Every bite was like heaven. Can't wait to go back.
