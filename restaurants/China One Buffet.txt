China One Buffet
Rating: 4
Text: Nice owners. Food is good, best to go during lunch and dinner hours. The food is rotated so it is hot and fresh. Prices are good for all you can eat buffet. Best chinese restaurant in town.

Text: If you're not in the mood for the buffet they have a huge menu. Seniors get a discount at the register when asking for it on top of the already low price.  Staff is excellent and food is great. We have been there over the last seven years and it is  never disappointing.
