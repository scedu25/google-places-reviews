Text: Stopped for lunch, after  11:00am and they would still serve breakfast. I'm on a low carb diet and they had a Cajun chicken breast skillet, they left out the hash browns and it was perfect. My wife and 2 grandsons ordered lunch and were very happy. Thanks for a nice pit stop, better than fast food.

Text: My husband and I had entirely different experiences, although our waitress was friendly throughout. Mine: Tough steak, canned fruit, unseasoned scrambled eggs, dry toast (even with the butter-like substance spread on it). His: Bacon, egg, and cheese club was excellent; tater tots were crisp; coffee was good.
