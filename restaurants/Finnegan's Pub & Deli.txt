Text: I generally go to Finnigin's early in the afternoon before the party crowd shows up. It's quiet with a great atmosphere and very friendly service. Wish the well drinks were less expensive, but couldn't complain about anything else.

Text: It has beer and drinks. It can be fun if you have your own group. Otherwise don't bother.
