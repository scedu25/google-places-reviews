Text: The woman that served us at the window was very polite and pleasant. Order was correct and she even remembered napkins. 2 thumbs up. Only reason not 5 stars is because the location makes it a little challenging to get back onto North bound 41.

Text: I was ignored for 8 minutes on the pickup side after waiting 14 for my food they had 9 cars in line four people inside for pickup.. don't like giving bad reviews but it could have been a lot better service..  the food was very good though maybe they could use a couple more people helping

Text: If i could give negative stars i would. I try this out a few times a year and every time it's pretty nasty. Nothing is ever hot or barely warm. Rude service, but it's kinda quick. Fries are always cool and burger is usualy under done, kinda warm but never worth what they charge.

Text: Half the time they get the order right, but the good is always good.
