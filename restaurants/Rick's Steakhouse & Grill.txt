Rick's Steakhouse & Grill

Text: Stopped in passing on business. Ordered the 8oz bacon-wrapped sirloin (medium), salad, and buffalo chips and draft Boulevard.

Beer price is high IMO.
Steak was cooked correctly, but grade of meat was tough with no char-flavor, so used steak sauce to help (taboo). Bacon was floppy and fatty.

Buffalo chips - nice.

Price was only $12 for the the meal.

Staff was kinda and efficient.

Would I retun, likely - given limited option in the area, and the price is reasonable for the meal.

Text: Good but not great. Food was good and got to the table quickly. Service was good, except that I had to ask for silverware and napkins. Fried pickles on point, medium rare ribeye was seasoned well and cooked perfectly although a bit thin, and queso mac n cheese was decent but really heavy. Overall was worth the 20 dollars. 

Be sure to tip your server.

Text: We are visiting Moberly from out of state & went here with a large group (13 total). We were well taken care of. They did an excellent job of accommodating our seating needs (2 kids and 2 newborns) and still sat us all together in our own little nook of the restaurant. Our server, Shad, did an excellent job. The restaurant was clean, food was hot and fresh, and our drinks and rolls were kept topped off. We have family that lives local and will definitely be coming back again!

Text: Nice place and good service, but food not very good and way over priced.  Breaded chicken looked and tasted like frozen store bought, not hand made. Also topped with cheap singles swiss cheese. Ribeye steak was a very cheap cut, but unfortunately not cheap priced. Wife and I will not be back.
