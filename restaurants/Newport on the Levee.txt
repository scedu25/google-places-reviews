Newport on the Levee
Rating: 3
Text: This would be a great place to go for a date or girls/guys night out. I took my 3 year old and we were disappointed. The train ride was our purpose for going but it was not in operation at 5pm on a Friday evening. We then went to Gameworks and quickly (under 5 minutes) spent $7 on games. I had to save the evening from being a disaster so promised a toy from the store. The closest to a toy store I could find was Barnes and Nobles where we did find an affordable toy and enjoyed sitting in the play area.

Text: The Levee is such a cool place to go, whether with friends, family, or just by yourself. With so many stores, including a Game works and a Barns and Nobal, it's almost hard to do it all in one day. Not to mention the aquarium, witch is also very nice. Grab your wallet and have fun!

Text: Went to the aquarium..a 2 hour drive my home..brought 6 of my grandkids. No handicap entrance and a huge steep staircase to climb to reach the ticket sales..which were ridiculously high...then more stairs to get into the building. Good photo opportunities throughout the building. Loved touching real sharks..prices in gift shop were kinda high too. Kids did enjoy what they saw. But truly expected more than what was there. Food court is not too pricey.

Text: Whether you're a visitor to the area or a local, Newport on the Levee is great place to visit. Fantastic view of the Cincinnati skyline and the Ohio River. A nice variety of restaurants and snack venues, the Aquarium, a movie theater, summer outdoor concerts and festivals. There's always something going on at the Levee.
