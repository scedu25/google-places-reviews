Boudreaux's Louisiana Seafood & Steaks
Rating: 4
Text: Great menu. Our server was a little "green" but appears to learn quickly. We did wait an inordinate length of time after being seated before being greeted by our server. The crab dip is good, but the chips do not do it justice. We asked for bread instead and got something  that looked like a grilled hot dog bun. My wife ordered the super jambalaya, and I had the seafood saute. The jambalaya was the better of the two. Great atmosphere set amid historic downtown St. Joe Missouri!

Text: We love making a trip up to St. Joe just to visit Boudreaux's! They have some of the BEST Louisiana-style food in the Kansas City area. It may be a little bit of a drive from the city but its definitely worth the small day trip. They have a great selection of beer and the staff here are always very friendly and helpful. The fried gator is a MUST! The atmosphere here is very historical and easy-going. If I'm not mistaken, there is a party room you can throw parties in too! The bar area is large and with some beautiful architecture. If you're in the area, this is a MUST stop place.

Text: Always have had great food and very good service.  My husband and I have enjoyed this restaurant many times. We have been with our child, small groups and even larger groups and each time we have received the same great treatment and yummy food.

Text: Fantastic service. Jill was our waitress and she was great. Food and drinks were served quickly. Everything was hot, fresh and tasty. Fish tacos were yummy. I recommend grilled veggies as a side.

Text: Our waitress was wonderful.
The crab bisque... delicious and house dressing is a must for a salad.
Nice dining experience.
