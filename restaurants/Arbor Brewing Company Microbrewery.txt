Text: Absolutely love the hell out of this place and wish I lived within walking distance. Corner can differ from day to day or even hour to hour in how its atmosphere seems to feel. During the earlier day, this is a great place to work on a report while relaxing with a pint and bite but later it definitely can come to life and is a great place to meet up and hangout with friends for food and drink

Text: Great facility. Came here for lunch and quick meeting. Food Is great, had the special jalapeño cheese bread, and the goat cheese pizza. Beer is also fab (bought the 24 case deal). 
4 stars because there were a few other people in the bar and service was slow. 
I'll still come back!

Text: Great food, great beer, fair prices. Excellent staff, always quick and nice! 

I'd like to consider myself a BBQ sauce connisseur, and this place has some of the best. Regardless of what you order, get some of their homemade bbq on the side.
