Text: We waited for quite some time to get the appetizers(not hot), and then the entrees were brought out shortly after. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the appetizers. My entree(the prime rib) was delicious.  My dining companion had some issues. His order was brought out wrong, not once but twice, and the temp on the prime rib was wrong. Our server needs a bit more training.

Text: Very disappointed in the dining experience Friday night. The food was terrible. I had a steak the seasoning on it was disgusting. Another member of our party bad chicken tenders. They weren't completely cooked. Cheeseburger was burnt. About half size of the bun. Very overpriced for a terrible meal. Certain will Never return. Sad best part of dinner was baked beans and the cocktails..

Text: I struggled to find something other than the decor that I was impressed with. The meat was burnt as were the buns for our sandwiches. The services was so poor, we almost left prior to our food being served. Disappointed to say the least.

Text: They sort of panicked when my sons and I entered and said we had a party of 18 coming, but did a great job of figuring out how they would accommodate us. They did a great job of serving us and checking on us while eating.  Overall, it was a great experience.  We were thankful because we had just wrapped up the first day of a two day softball tournament, and were somewhat exhausted. Oh yeah, the food and drinks were good too!
