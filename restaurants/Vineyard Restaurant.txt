Vineyard Restaurant

Text: We decided to go to the Vineyard for our anniversary dinner, and were not disappointed in the least! The atmosphere is just perfect, the service is some of the best we've had in a very long time and the food is absolutely delicious! A great local wine and beer selection tops it all off. All in all it was a great meal, and a place we would happily go back to!
