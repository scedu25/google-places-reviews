Text: Food is really good. Beer is nice and cold but could be a little colder. My only criticism is that the food portions could be bigger for the price. Great local bar with good food a definite go to.

My wife had the chicken fried steak and I had the Hog Holler, pulled pork on a half pound burger both were awesome.

Text: Stop in for a quick lunch and get some basic bar food. We were told if you come in later the pace can get a bit wild
