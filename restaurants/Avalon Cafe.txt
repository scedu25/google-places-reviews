Text: I went here for a lunch date with my mom and sister and was very impressed! The building used to be a house so it has an interesting historical feel to it. Had a yummy club sandwich and splurged on a delicious dessert called the "chocolate pillars"...so good!

Text: I am lucky enough to live and work in Weston so I usually visit the Avalon cafe two or three times per week. My favorites include their brie appetizer, their pesto soup and seafood bisque, and for dinner, their wild boar loin, seafood linguini and beef tenderloin. Favorite lunch items include the Avalon Salad & the bleu cheese burger (add bacon)! Don't forget Sunday brunch! On a recent visit, the special was potato crusted walleye and I must say, it was to die for. If I wasn't a sort of poor working girl I'd eat at the Avalon everyday!

Text: Beautiful view from the outside eating deck. Very unique menu, not oversized portions, but beatifully presented. Wait staff a little casual for the price of the food.
