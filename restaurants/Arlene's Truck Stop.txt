Text: Wasn't expecting much but wow!  Ordered the 12 oz TBone Steak with sauteed onions and mushrooms. Came with a great salad. Steak was done perfectly as ordered. Absolutely delicious for $12.98. Also has Fresh broccoli for the side. Excellent also. As a trucker, this will be my stop for fuel and dinner from now on.

Text: Great food great service all around great atmosphere but on the trucking end of it the u are not up to par you can't do a lot for your TRUCKING company as far a getting cash advances because they don't except a lot of the big name credit card and things like that. The showers were ok but they did not give you a wash cloth and there was mot any soap in there either.

Text: It's usually very good but, for some reason things were terrible on Sunday, March 12th, 2017. We waited an hour for our food! And, when it finally came, mine was the wrong order! I had ordered an Ultimate Breakfast. So, I got my toast and biscuit but, had to wait for the main part of my meal. When it finally came, it had bacon instead of sausage patties but, I just ate the bacon. Mine took so long because apparently the ticket didn't get entered into the computer. Then, when our bills came, those were all mixed up too! One in our group had a breakfast burrito but, was charged for the sandwich they accidentally brought to me. It was cheaper than the breakfast burrito so my friend didn't say anything. I think this will be the last time we go there on a Sunday near the lunch hour. Hopefully today was just a fluke. Their food is good and comes in large portions at a good price.
