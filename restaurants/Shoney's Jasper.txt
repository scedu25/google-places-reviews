Text: Ordered $12 worth if salmon. Miserable portion size. Tasted awful. Baked potatoe was overcooked. Rice was overcooked. Dinner bar was covered in flies. Staff was messing with food without gloves. Had to keep waving flies away from my food at my table. They were nice enough to cut a few dollars off the bill, but that didn't help the food quality. This was my first visit and I'll never be again.

Text: The phone does NOT work!! Not everyone has a cell phone!! Had to ask how to use remote control on TV and was told to "hit input, put it on HDMI1.' THAT should have been disclosed on the website OR upon checking into hotel and getting to room!!!! We've driven from Lake Placid, Florida to Mitchell Indiana and back tracked to your hotel!! We are exhausted AND tired and should NOT have to walk back to the desk for information that SHOULD have been given upon checking in!! We will NEVER recommend any of our family, friends s s business associates here in Indiana, to this hotel! Very dissatisfied! Both times going to the front desk, checking in and about issues, the front desk girl  was out back smoking, so had to push the button and waste more of our time!

Text: There food doesn't really agree with me. My husband likes it. It's fast and easy ,if you get the food bar,or order off menu. Some of the wait staff,keeps checking on you ,and gives you a bill before you sit down with your first plate,I don't like that personally. It's like there trying  to rush you.

Text: It's a shame that you can't get a cup of coffee & a piece of pie anywhere on Jasper. However Shoney's apple crisp is the next best thing!
