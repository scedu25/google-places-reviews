Arandas Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: This place is on the list of 10 best places to eat in small Missouri towns, and for good reason!  Friendly staff, lots of good things on the menu, great chips and salsa, and reasonable prices.  I have gone here every few weeks since I moved here 2 years ago, and always had a pleasant experience.  If you have an issue and you tell the server, they correct it right away, no questions asked.  The staff and owner is very nice.  I take anyone visiting me here, and even had a guy from LA say it is on par with the Mexican in his area.  Well done!

Text: Had to wait to be seated, host on phone giving the "just a minute" finger.  Very dirty floor and booths.  Had to remake my order as they did not listen to my order.  Slow service.  Strange young waiter not doing anything other than staring at me during dinner.  The worst? Possibly.
