Wild Mango Restaurant and Bar
Rating: 5
Text: Interesting fusion of different cuisine created the Wild Mango, but it works well.  My steak was super tender and perfectly cooked.  The mashed potatoes piped onto the plate created lots of interest from my co-workers who all suddenly wanted to try them.  The mushrooms sauteed and tossed with parmesan were amazing and could have been a main course in their own right.

I despite it's location, this is high-end cuisine that's priced lower than it's worth.  

The only negative was the font on the menu made it really hard to read without a cellphone-flashlight

Text: This place has phenomenal food and service for far lower prices than you would expect. For lunch, I had Romano fried shrimp with spinach and sweet potato fries ($8).  My wife had glazed salmon with salad and sweet potato fries ($10).  They were beautifully plated and impeccably prepared.  Our son  got calamari ($7), his favorite in the area.  Meals also come with a free amuse bouche (even at lunch) which in this case was a scallop and split pea soup, which was excellent.

Text: One of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. We come to a conference in the area once a year and make a special trip to dine here for 5 years running now. You feel like royalty when you eat here, the service is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the food is utterly impeccable. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough! Make sure you save room for dessert! This is a feast for all the senses, definitely worth every penny.

Text: My cousins and I had a wonderful lunch. I posted pictures of the Romano Shrimp the Crab Cake and the Chicken Cheescake. We also had a complimentary soup  which was excellent. We're looking to go back to celebrate birthdays and hopefully a Mother's Day.

Text: A truly wonderful, underrated restaurant. Some of the best service I've ever had. New, inventive flavor combinations, and of course, the quality and quantity of food was above and beyond expectations. Oh, and did I mention that it's all between $5-30? I'm definitely coming back and I'm bringing more friends and family.
