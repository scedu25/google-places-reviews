Text: Food is good depending on cook, Carmen's is best! Wait staff varies every time I go in and service is fair to good. Always neat and clean. Prices are good for fare served.

Text: Food overall was good but service was not good. Didn't get order correct. Never refilled drinks. Acted like they didn't know what was going on. Table was not clean nor were the rest rooms. Rest rooms were out of supplies.
