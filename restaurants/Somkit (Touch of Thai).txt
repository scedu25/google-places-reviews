Text: I love this place!  I am especially excited that you can now order On-Line and that they have a Pick-up window!!!  This is very accommodating for those just grabbing lunch since anyone in Dixon knows downtown parking during the day can be a nightmare.  I am NOT a fish person but their Chicken Fried Rice is delicious and I could drink their Sweet & Sour sauce.  I HIGHLY recommend  this place.  You cannot go wrong with friendly service and great environment.

Text: The name is only partially correct because there are several other cultures represented in the surprisingly large menu.  The atmosphere is cozy and the tables are nicely spaced.

Text: Great lunch buffet and best hand rolled sushi I have ever had! Worth the drive to Dixon and Sterling!

Text: We started with crab ragoons. They were very good. For lunch I had a bento box and my daughter had pad thai. The food was well presented and prepared. I recommend the bento box as it has seaweed salad, sushi, rice, california roll and a choice of salmon, chicken or beef.

Text: I love Thai food but this place was  watered down and bland. Dissapointing.
