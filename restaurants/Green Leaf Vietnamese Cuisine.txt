Text: Most the negative reviews seem to be from people who aren't used to the random way an international restaurant tends to be run. Yes they can be slow - relax and enjoy not rushing for once. There's a chance any local restaurant will be slow. Prices seem high for noodles and rice. But considering it is easy to drop $10 for a burger and $25 for a large pizza within half a mile it is sure easy to recommend Green Leaf. Food is very fresh and so tasty. Great flavors and variety of dishes, good selection of bubble teas, and quality ingredients that feel minimally processed and make for a filling and wholesome feeling.

Text: First off, the food is good. Read the other reviews for more detail. That said, I had a random chance to hear the owner give a talk to students. She is truly an inspiration. If for nothing else, support a local business, an entrepreneur, and someone who is truly an inspiration and worth supporting.
