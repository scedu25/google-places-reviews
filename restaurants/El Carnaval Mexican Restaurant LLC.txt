Text: The staff is always friendly and the food is great! The salsa can be a bit spicy, even for me (I love spicy food) but you never really know, but that's a good thing because you know it's made fresh! My family loves the nacho fajitas!

Text: Ripped off twice at this restaurant. First time they tried to over charge me approximately 5 dollars, but I caught it. I didn't go back for about six months. I decided to try it again today, and they successfully scammed me again, which i didn't realize until i got home. My total bill before tax was 6.98. I gave them a 20, they gave me ~4.80 in change, from which I left a generous $2.50 tip. They stole ~$8 from me while 4 employee's stood there and watched! I am never going back! On another note, they use the lowest quality beef with all the veins and arteries.

Text: Good food but seriously have to get my bill adjusted ALMOST EVERY TIME we eat there. Once they charged me $10 extra and just last week they added an extra $8 to a $24 bill. They always fix it but it's a hassle and I shouldn't have to scour my bill each time.
