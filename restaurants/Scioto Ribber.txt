Scioto Ribber

Text: Wow! This place should be inducted into the Carnivore Hall of Fame! "Country-style" ribs & steaks to die for, done to perfection on open wood-fired grills. I had a 3 Rib Dinner that contained easily 2 lbs of the best tasting, moist and tender pork I have ever had the pleasure to consume. My buddy had a "Small" 16oz New York strip that was equally fabulous. Not much on the outside, but inside, great service and spectacular food!!!

Text: The good. Price is very good for the amount of food you get. The waitress was friendly and attentive. I just don't see the appeal to this place. Wait can be extremely long. Place is in serious need of updating. Overflowing urinal in men's bathroom.
We decide as a couple for one of us to get ribs and the other to get the steak, which we've heard good things about. The ribs are not ribs like your thinking, they are huge pork chops that are dry and lacking flavor unless you dip in barbecue sauce which is what we did.
Steak was ordered medium well came out overcooked and charred. Frankly I've had a better steak at a longhorns and it was cheaper.
If you live outside of Portsmouth and don't like a long wait for average food, I don't recommend.

Text: Excellent barbecue! Whenever I am down here I get lunch here. They have a great pulled pork sandwich, and onion rings for lunch. It's priced like fast food, but destroys fast food in flavor and goodness! I always sit at the bar, and the service is great. People love to have conversations, and don't mind you dive in on theirs (provided it's not personal. Lol). I highly recommend this place if your in the area. Service is quick unless you order a larger meal. Good things will come for your little wait.

Text: Great service and nice atmosphere, but the name Ribber is a misnomer. When you pull into the parking lot, the smoke pouring off the grills gets you primed for BBQ, but the  country style ribs appear to be parcooked and briefly on the grills for a show of grill marks, not cooked in a way that produces tender meat or succeeds in melting the fat or connective tissue. Also, no sign of a rub or even really salt. More like an overcooked pork chop. Portions were very generous and the staff couldn't have been nicer.
