Text: My wife and I went to this restaurant Saturday 7/15 for the first time and was pleasant impressed by the decor and the cleanliness of the establishment. The food was hot, and exactly what we ordered. Good portion. Food was fresh and tasted great! Portions were larger than expected.Their Margaritas are outstanding. However the best part of or stay was the service. Our server was a very professional lady by the name of Lori. A true class act in customer service and attentive to her customers.If you want to experience an enjoyable dinner the next time you come to this restaurant, ask for Lori.

Text: The food was great! Even the next day my leftovers were wonderful. It took quite a long time to get a seat, but what do you expect on a Saturday night. Make sure to utilize the call ahead seating. But my server was great, the food came out quickly and was very tasty. I recommend this place to friends.

Text: Not a good experience here. Our group ordered different meals and none of us were happy. You pay top prices for oversized portions of bland food. It's pretty hard to mess up fajitas! I feel sorry for the servers having to hand out that slop. Thanks but no thanks!
