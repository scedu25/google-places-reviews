Honey Bee La Colmena

Text: My go to for authentic Mexican ingredients. Avocados are always reasonably priced unlike at most other chain grocery stores. Produce is always fresh every time I've been. Also would highly recommend buying a bag of the chile lime flavor tortilla chips they have on display by the free samples when you walk in the door (you won't regret it!!!).

Text: Everything is awesome in the store! From the free guacamole and salsa when you walk in to the amazing produce section to the meat section to the dairy section and everything in between! Super clean and extra friendly staff. They also offer honey bee t-shirts for $10 as well as insulated honey bee bags for $5. As detroiter I think the combination is a must have!

Text: This is my favorite grocery store in the Detroit area! Their produce is always fresh, their deli is off the charts! They have every cut of meat under the sky and a lot of great already prepared options. I go here for lunch most days because I can buy fresh fruit and a lunch special at the deli which changes every day so I'm not eating the same boring thing every day. Everything is fresh and the employees are so helpful. Please try this grocery store and don't be afraid to explore some of the great food that is normally not offered in your average grocery store. Oh and their $5 rotiserie chicken is so good and so cheap it's hard for me not to buy one every time I visit.

Text: This is our favorite grocery store in Detroit. You will NOT find fresher, more variation of ethnic and home town foods then Honey Bee. The meat selection is fabulous, vegtables look like fresh from their garden and taste like it too. Check it out.

Text: The Honey Bee Market has a good selection of Latin American products. They also have very good hot foods to buy by the pound, and even great lunch combos for $3.99.
