Text: This place definitely needs better customer service training...arrogant, rude & obnoxious. If a restaurant turns patrons away because they cannot accommodate more than 30 diners at a time, then the establishment should not even be in business. My party of 2 seemed more like an inconvenience from the moment we walked into the restaurant. The family behind us walked out as well. This place is definitely NOT a 5 star ?? restaurant. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Text: Wonderful surprise in Richmond. Visiting the city on business. Saw listing online and thought we would give this place a try. Wonderful dinner. Some of the best shrimp & grits I've had. And a delectable  banana pudding cheesecake. Professional courteous wait staff. Rustic elegance and delightful  experience. Will go back again next time in the area.
