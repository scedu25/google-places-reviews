Pizza Mia

Text: I bought a groupon for Pizza Mia in Frankfort, I didn't realize it was take out and delivery only, not dine in. Even so, I ordered/picked up a small The Chub, and a sausage thin crust pizza. I have to say, OMG THE CHUB IS FABULOUS! What an awesome pizza. The sausage pizza was great too. I am going to bring the menu into my work tomorrow, and tell them to order from here next pizza day!??

Text: Awful service. Great food... But AWFUL service. We called in an hour before we went to pick up the food and we placed our order and stuff. Then we get there and we werent even in the system. So we decided to pay for it and have it delivered, and she took the cost for delivery off because they messed up. But then she tried to charge us for it. So we went home and then we got a call later saying that she couldnt have the pizza delivered because U MUST PAY for delivery. We got irritated and got a refund. And wont be coming back unless its a pizza emergency Jsyk.

Text: This place has good pizza at a reasonable price. They also have good sandwiches and sides. I enjoy the fact that my order is always accurate. I have had problems at other local pizza places forgetting items, but pizza Mia always gets it right.
