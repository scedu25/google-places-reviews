Text: Only been here once, but this place was pretty dingy and it was like 90 degrees in there. We had to wait about 25 mins for our food. The person at the counter was not exactly pleasant, but I'm sure working in that heat all day doesn't help. The food tasted fine, for the price. My calzone must have dripped out about half a cup of water, not sure why it was so wet, would've been better without the soggy crust.

Text: Got the tandoori chicken deep dish pizza, with added gyro meat, and it was amazing. Perfectly prepared and plenty of cheese, sauce, and toppings. Hands down one of the most satisfying pizzas ive had in my life. 

Delivery is fair priced and fairly fast, although my pizza was banged around a Little bit, but nothing major.

 5 stars! Their reputation as a must try for pizza in ann arbor is well earned. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone as long as they aren't dead set on pork, which they do not serve.
