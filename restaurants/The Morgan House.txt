Text: Delicious food and lovely boutique shop. Lots to see and purchase.  A great place to get unique gifts.  I'll be back to do some Christmas shopping.  A special thanks to our wonderful server, Melissa, and the woman who helped put tables together for our large group.  Our afternoon outing was perfect!

Text: Love the Morgan House. Good food, great gift shop. Lost our ticket for lunch so the wait for lunch was extra long. Probably not our best visit at Morgan House.

Text: Food is great. Little room very cosy but there is always a wait so get there early! Also they have great things to decorate your home and outside. Cloths and all things wonderful!  Spend the day shopping.

Text: Great atmosphere, the staff was very warm and friendly, and the food was delicious.  Our waitress even gave our two young boys free beanie babies from the gift shop.  My family and I will certainly be back.
