Text: Best tenderloin and onion rings I've had in years. Atmosphere is typical dinner but food is delicious.

Text: Got the hamburger steak, they were out of brown gravy subbed white.  None of it was very good.

Text: Went to this restaurant on a work trip, looked around for places to eat and researched online. Every review for this place was negative, but somehow we all decided to go there anyway, thinking maybe the previous reviews were too bad to be true. Turns out they were all very accurate... We got our orders taken and after half an hour, we got our food, and that was the last time we saw our server for the rest of the evening. They don't have free refills on their drinks, and they also sometimes don't even give you your drink either! (One of my coworkers ordered a chocolate shake and it never came, and we had no server to ask about it. When we went to the counter to pay, it was sitting behind the counter looking like chocolate milk from sitting there for so long.) Three of us ordered double cheese burgers, and they were huge and actually pretty good. Our other coworker ordered the Big John burger. If you like paper thin patties, the Big John Buger is still not for you...because you need a magnifying glass to see the parties. If you find yourself in Ainsworth, and all the other restaurants burn down and the only place left to eat is Big Johns, you'd be better off eating the grass on the sidewalk...
