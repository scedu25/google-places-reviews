Text: I'll give them two stars because the food was not horrible. However, I love Mexican and know the difference between a good or bad margarita. The ones her a very limey. When I tried to explain she came over with her hand on her hip and ask d what was wrong with it. Wow as a business owner that's not great customer service. It's fine I didn't drink it and I will never be back if that's the way she wants to treat her customers. I'll stay at El Charro where they have two things that are important to me. Great margaritas and customer service.

Text: Friday, May 26th there was a boil order, we only knew about it because someone in our party had walked past Papa Don's and they had a sign up. 

We ordered our drinks, mostly water then looked up the boil order to make sure it was still in effect and it was. We told the owner, who's son works for the water district, and she said she knew about it because someone else told her. She offered to sell them bottled water but they didn't want to buy water. And she served us the water without even telling us about the boil order. 

This is not an establishment that genuinely cares about the health of it's customers. If they are willingly serving water knowing it's contaminated then what other contaminated things are they serving up?

Don't go there!

And if you got sick from this place I'm sorry, I tried to communicate that to the staff but they didn't care.

Text: Food is wonderful! Horchata is the best I've had! Service was a little slow especially since they weren't very busy but overall the best Mexican restaurant in town!
