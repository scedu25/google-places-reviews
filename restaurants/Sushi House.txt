Text: This restaurant has been our favorite for years, but our highschooler had a shockingly bad experience there yesterday.  She often goes there for lunch, ordering the same thing....a $5 eel roll and soup.  The new waiter brought back a different tempura dish that was $16.  She did not touch it and instead told the waiter that she had ordered an eel roll.  He went to his manager who then told our daughter that it was her fault because the waiter said he had repeated back what she had ordered and she failed to correct his misunderstanding.  The manager repeatedly insisted she pay but our daughter had only a little cash.  They begrudgingly took the wrong dish back and took so long to make the simple eel roll (even with only 3 other customers at that time), that the girls were getting up to leave when it finally arrived.  My husband and I are very concerned that this would NEVER happen with an adult customer, and this restaurant would treat a young girl so poorly.   It's quite possible there was shared error behind this mis-order if he did repeat back the wrong item and she failed to correct him, but I've never heard of trying to pin that on the customer.    We are so disappointed!

Text: Its my go-to place when i want a good and quick lunch or dinner. This is a nice place to go if you want sushi or Chinese. Both are good here. The Chinese food is quite above average for this area. The place is clean, and it's family friendly. Nice selection of wine and beer. Often crowded, but never too crowded. I highly recommend it.
