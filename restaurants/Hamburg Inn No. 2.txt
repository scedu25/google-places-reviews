Hamburg Inn No. 2

Text: This is my favorite breakfast place in town. I'm a vegetarian and i love that they have veggie sausage and bacon. The eggs benedict are awesome, and i love the baby cakes as a side. The pie shakes are insane but a meal in itself, so be warned. There is always a wait on the weekends in the morning, so plan ahead. Don't even try to go here for a quick bit during big weekends (graduation, etc). They have their own parking, which is nice, but usually full. They also have a point program so for every $100/points you get $5 off, which for us happens every few visits, but they also email you coupons for double or triple points, and free pie shakes. I love hamburg, it's history, and it's damn good food. Can't wait for the new one to open!

Text: Friendly and fast service, great food. I particularly like the "pie shakes", which are pieces of pie mixed into milkshakes. Great idea!

Text: Great place to go for affordable, classic American cuisine. Their macaroni and cheese is quite good, but be prepared for a wait at 'usual' dinner times.

Text: Love this place. Quality breakfast, fast service. I went to college in IC and have not eaten here for 10 years. I came back and it was the same cozy, delicious experience.

Great food. A lot of choices. 
Staff is very nice. Music from kitchen makes it even better.
