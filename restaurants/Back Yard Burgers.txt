Text: Friendly service, delicious food, and reasonable prices. Try the sweet potato fries and the fried pickles: both are among the best I have ever had!

Text: Decent fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches at average prices. It's usually packed when I go there for lunch, but the wait time is consistently short, and your food is brought to the table.

Text: My "Hawaiian Chicken" sandwich was very disappointing.  The chicken was flavorless, tough, and stringy.  The flavoring sauce, while fully encompassing the chicken, was clearly added after cooking and added no flavor to the chicken itself.  The pineapple was cold and clearly hadn't been cooked to caramelize any of its sugars.
My wife's burger, in her words, tasted like a Runza burger but with a 15 minute wait.

Text: I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of meat and the waffle cut fries were the perfect amount of crispy.

Text: Everytime we come here, the food is delicious. One of our favorite places to eat since moving to Lincoln.
