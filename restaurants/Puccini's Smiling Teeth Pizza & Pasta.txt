Puccini's Smiling Teeth Pizza & Pasta
Rating: 5
Text: Great place. Personally, I have had no problems here. Their pizza is amazing, and the breadsticks are usually very good (although slightly on the crunchy side, but still great). The atmosphere is usually laid back, clean, and the service is pretty good. One of my favorite places to get pizza!

Text: A family favorite for pasta or pizza.  The "Bill" pizza is a favorite and also the calzones.  Good linguini with Vodka sauce- add a meet if you like.

Text: Puccini's food is first rate, delicious, made fresh, and priced extremely reasonably. Although their service staff can sometimes be filled with novices, all problems seemed to be resolved quickly and without issue. For a small family owned restaurant, they do an excellent job. Easily my favorite place in the West Lafayette Area.

Text: Good pizza, but the calzones are the best. The service is good but could be a little better.
