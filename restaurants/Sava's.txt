Sava's

Text: I’ve been to Sava’s several times and I’m a huge fan. It’s an excellent option for happy hour and dinner. The drinks on the cocktail menu are also really good. I very much enjoyed the tuna steak on the appetizers/small plates menu. Literally everything on the menu is unique and good. Can’t go wrong with Sava’s for anything from a snack, drinks, dinner, couples night, family, or friends.

Text: First time there 10-2-17  late lunch place was easy on the eyes but way over priced!  I’ve had better salads was cheaper.  Hubby’s sandwich where’s the meat!  I ordered a artichoke dip nice size portion with  not enough pita chips to go with dip portion!  Won’t return like I said way over priced......

Text: Sava's is a trendy, upscale eatery with a fantastic quality of food production. The price is always a bit higher than it needs to be, but it is downtown Ann Arbor. The breakfast brunch is the most impressive I've ever seen for a long time (although it's very inconveniently placed at the back of the restaurant, forcing people walk past a lot of crowded tables to get there and back each time). The dinner menu is also impressive, and each dish I've had there failed to disappoint.

Text: Service was great. Was seated upstairs all by myself, which I found strange.  I finally asked to move to the first floor.  Greek salad was good but the chicken breast was kind of dry.  But I would try Sava's again if I am Ann Arbor.

Text: Wonderful food. Not huge proportions, which I loved. Great cocktails for the evening, but I'd love to come back for brunch one of these days because that menu looked really fabulous, too.
