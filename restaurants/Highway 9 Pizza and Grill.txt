Text: I ordered a cheeseburger it came to me raw had to send it back twice to get it well done..then the cook slash owner copped an attitude and the last time she sent it out there was no chesese in it..the chef salad that I ordered had like 2 pieces of Oscar Myer sliced ham chopped up and thrown on top of this massive mound of lettuce more lettuce than anything else..just not worth the visit money or time
