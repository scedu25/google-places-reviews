Gabby Goat American Pub & Grill

Text: This was an okay place to eat. We were passing through town and decided to give it a try. It was average on all accounts...service, food, and atmosphere. Our food order ended up being four sandwiches, one beer, and an order of sweet potato fries. Our check with tip ended up being around $60. Definitely not worth that amount of money.

Text: We had to wait for a table on a Monday night due to all of the people stopping on their way home from the eclipse but it was a quick wait. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was OK. We had the fried smoked gouda for an appetizer which was  very tasty. Great beer selection. I recommend giving Gabby Goat a try.

Text: I was glad we stopped. What a great place it was. The pork appetizer was slightly over cooked however. Other than that everything was delicious. Friendly quick service as well. Would recommend if your in the area or driving by.

Text: Such a great local place to grab a bite with friends. The food is always great & the staff is always friendly. I frequently point out of towners in  The Goats direction when I'm at work.

Text: Had breakfast here on a Sunday morning after we were told how great it was. It was mediocre at the most.
Everything was hot but flavor wasn't exceptional. I ordered the eggs, potatoes, and sausage patties. My husband ordered the B & G with chicken and he said it was awful.
The chicken was way over-done and the biscuits were hard. I will say their rumchatta French toast was amazing. Kids had pancakes and they barely touched them. Overall, I would say try it out. I won't be returning myself.
