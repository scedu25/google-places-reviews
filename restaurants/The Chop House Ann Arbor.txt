Text: My husband took me here for my birthday--we went on the actual day so we got the 50% off birthday deal. The restaurant is a great place to celebrate a special occasion. The service is great; our waitress was friendly, attentive, and helpful in accommodating our 11 month old. We enjoyed their seared tuna and lobster bites appetizers, the lobster tail and cowboy steak entrees, and the mac 'n' cheese and mashed potato sides. I enjoyed all of it, but my husband could not stop raving about the steak. We're making this place a birthday tradition!

Text: This was one of the best meals I have had in Ann Arbor, and I've had many meals around town. We went because of the birthday discount, but I would absolutely pay full price for the meal we had there. The food was outstanding, and the service was equally excellent.

The one annoyance during our dinner was the noise inside the dining room. With a full dining room, it got a little too loud for a conversation at normal volumes. However, I plan on coming back at some point in the future.

Text: Prices are high and tonight no one was on their game. We waited for our wine and were told because we only ordered an appetizer and two salads we didn't get any bread. Mind you, please, one salad was $28!! Our sweet potato casserole was cold.... when it finally got there. The manager picked up our tab but I didn't ask to speak with him so he'd buy our dinner. Poor showing for Main Street Ventures tonight.
