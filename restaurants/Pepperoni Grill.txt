Text: Pepperoni Grill is my favorite restaurant in the Bloomington area!  No Bloomington parking hassles.  The Southern Indiana drive is always gorgeous and relaxing.  Love to eat under the porch awning in nice weather and have a favorite secluded table inside.  Spinach Ravioli is to die for...

PS  Pepperoni Grill once again accepts credit cards.  Ignore reviews below that say, "cash only".
