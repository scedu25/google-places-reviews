Text: It's so great to have a local coffee place that does in house roasting! The baristas are great and the quiche is a must try!

Text: Nice place, but the setting and atmosphere is in line with the more metropolitan third wave cafés moreso than the espresso. However, that being said, they do roast beans to order, which is impressive. It's a bold move to abstain from offering whole beans off the shelf, and I'm seriously intrigued. Next time I'm in town for a few days, I am anxious to place an order.
