Arni's Lafayette Market Square
Rating: 5
Text: Having a great time at Arni's in Lafayette!  The picture is what is left of a very generous pour of a "double" Maker's Mark on the rocks.  Good service, but haven't yet tried the food.  From the number of patrons present I bet it will be good.

Text: Arnis pizza is the best pizza around. Thin crust with toppings to the edge, any way you like it.  Ready in 10 minutes. Ask.for extra crispy if you like the salty burnt edges.  The staff is always pleasant and will go out of their way for you. A Lafayette landmark.

Text: There's no place like Arni's for great pizza, salads, and sandwiches. There's plenty of room for large gatherings (we had 20) with 3 distinct dining rooms. For good food with family or friends or for take-out, remember, "Meet you at Arni's"!

Text: Ordered takeout for a veggie pizza and they were super prompt about the service. The pizza was well seasoned and warm as I drove back - the car smelled like heaven. And then it tasted kinda good too. Good value from money from a local pizza chain.

Text: This is a local favorite, familiar to residents of Lafayette. Very tasty food. You should try Arnys salad.
