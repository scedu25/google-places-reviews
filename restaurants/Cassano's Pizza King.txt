Text: We always get a good pizza here, but today was not one of those days. We think the crust was old and doughy and hard to chew. We asked if they changed the crust and she said she didn't know but didn't think so.

Text: Good all around. Not my personal favorite, but actually very good pizza. Their sausage just not my cup of tea, but would recommend.

Text: Their pizza sauce is a locally unique, acquired taste.  I enjoy it occasionally, but not too often.  Our grandchildren love it.
