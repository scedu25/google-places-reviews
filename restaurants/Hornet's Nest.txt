Text: My favorite burger in the Evansville area! The atmosphere has a local neighborhood bar/pub vibe. The staff does a great job caring for patrons. Nice place to eat and visit with friends.

Text: I left hungry, service was average. Price was what i would expect at a high end place, not a hidden gem. Still would prolly come back if I'm ever near.
