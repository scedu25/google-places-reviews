Cabin Club

Text: We had a wonderful meal at the Cabin Club to celebrate my father's birthday. The drinks were amazing, the food was delicious and our server, Leilani was wonderful. We really enjoyed our meal and I hope to go back soon.

My only complaint is that this restaurant is not handicap accessible. There is no ramp into the restaurant and the restrooms are not equipped to serve someone in a wheel chair.

Text: Cabin Club is pricey for what you get. I went here with my co-workers and we found the food good, but not worth the price that we paid. The ambiance is good for a lot of different situations, and the wine is great. The chef did a great job cooking the meat to my preference. The place is usually busy, so I recommend reserving a table.

Text: First off, the service is excellent, 2nd to non. The steakhouse is warm, inviting, clean, and up to date with technology for anyone who wants to catch a game. (Me) 
Drink or dealt generously. The steak tasted wonderful. Whatever the chef is doing for taste keep on doing it. I ordered the Bone in ribeye, Medium rare. Came well done. ?
If you are from cow land order rare:) even over cooked it had great taste. In fact I will be back to try it again. I have a feeling I will revise this to a five star on the next visit.
