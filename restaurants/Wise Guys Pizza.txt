Wise Guys Pizza

Text: Ordered a pizza. They took the money. They refused to deliver. After a couple hours had to give up. Columbia is a fairly small town. Would have been faster to have the pizza delivered from St. Louis.

Manager was rude when called about the pizza lack of delivery.

Never got the pizza.

Text: Best Pizza in town!
A friend told me about them and i am blown away! their pizza is amazing! Hot, saucy, meaty, thick crust, and wonderful flavor. took a while to arrive, but it was definitely worth the wait.

Text: Cool that they deliver until 3AM, but I would rather go hungry.  The food we ordered was all pretty bad.  The wings were awful and rubbery.  The pizza was very bad, and I'm not picky about pizza either.  The cheese sticks were the best thing, but certainly nothing special.  I cannot recommend this place, unless you are literally starving past 2AM, even then it might be better to starve.

Text: We have lived in Columbia for 5 years and eat a LOT of pizza. Just discovered this place a few months ago. Hands down best in town! High quality and affordable. Crust is awesome!

Text: Best tasting pizza in town, hands down. Sometimes the delivery can take a while, but the fair prices make it worth the wait, arguably.
