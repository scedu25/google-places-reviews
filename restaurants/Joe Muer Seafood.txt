Text: My husband and I went for a date and everything was excellent! We don't go out much but new we were going to spend some money and we did! A few drinks, excellent sushi, appetizer and dinner. We didn't have room for dessert, but it looked amazing! The white bean dip with the fresh bread was great too! 
Our view was beautiful and the service was even better. It was worth every penny.

Text: The food was absolutely amazing with an awesome ambience. My lady and I went here and had a great experience. The servers were very thorough in their presentation of menu options. The drinks were awesome and the entrees are top of the line. We would definitely be back there again soon. It is pricey so fellas make sure to be prepared to spend some guap on you and your lady.

Text: The food, ambience and service were 8/9 out of 10. However, the valet experience at the end of the meal left a bad taste in our mouths. Don’t forget to get your ticket validated. Then, on a fairly busy night, at the end of a good meal, be prepared to stand in line to get your car ticket registered, only after you’ve had it validated. Then, stand in another line to wait for your car. Overall, a not good ending to an otherwise good evening.

Text: Exceptional.  Steaks were top notch- for a steakhouse, seafood place, whatever.  Lots of attentive staff on hand to provide excellent service.  I’m sure their payroll is huge but believe me - it pays off.  Nice job!

Text: The staff here is impeccable! Extremely friendly and helpful. We sat at the chef's table for a Bachelorette party dinner and really enjoyed our time. I had the Joe Muer sushi roll and iceberg wedge salad - all delicious! It is pricey, so make sure you get your money's worth by sitting at a table with a river view!
