Text: This place is okay...at best.  The seats ARE super comfy, but their sounds system inside the movie theatres are really horrible!  We watched "War for The Planet of the Apes" and at times you couldn't even hear the music playing and the sound effects for explosions and gun fire were so low, it made watching the movie tiring and boring. Fix your sound system and make watching the movies more exciting with better sound.  Also, you can hear the movies playing in other theatres as well.  

On a positive note, this place is clean and the staff is friendly.

Text: Limited food options, unless you are a diehard carnivore. Lol. Nice lanes, nice balls. Did not do much in the gaming section. Staff were friendly.
