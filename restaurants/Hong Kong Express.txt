Text: We don't go to Macomb that often, but whenever we go there, we always try to stop by Hongkong Express. Our favorites are Crispy Shrimp and Mongolian Beef. Their Crispy Shrimp are the best! Also very nice owners!

Text: Their salt-spicy spare rib is awesome. A total calorie bomb and a smidge pricy, but totally worth it.

Text: The best Chinese food in Macomb and they deliver! The light on their sign is always off or burnt out, but they're still open. The service is good and the staff is so nice.

Text: This was the nastiest Chinese food ive eaten in my life. I tried to get a refund and the woman told me "no". I told her she was" being misleading"  and she told me that she" wouldn't refund anyone's money, not just me". EGGS,EGGS and more EGGS in the fried rice. I literally got a side of EGGS with my orange chicken and beef fried rice. My fried rice was covered scrambled eggs and it had no seasoning.  The beef in the fried rice  looked boiled or microwaved. I am a black man with no prior culinary Chinese food training, but I could make better Chinese food. DO NOT GO HERE!!! RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION!!! GO ON A CHINESE FOOD FAST OR GET PIZZA!!! GO TO PIZZA HUT!!!
