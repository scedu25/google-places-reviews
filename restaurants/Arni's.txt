Text: Overpriced, not rave-worthy, rude waitresses
Two mini pizzas, two drinks, an appetizer?  $25.  Not worth it.
The taste of everything was not as good as Pizza King.

One rude waitress ignored us when we asked for a to-go box, and resumed cleaning a table.
We asked again for a to-go box, and she took awhile before she replied that she would - and when she did, she seemed hasty and did not ask if we needed help with anything else, but walked away from our table.
Another waitress said that we did not listen to her when she informed us how to make a payment, as she did not understand that myself and the person I was with are both hard-of-hearing and new to the restaurant; so I felt I was given the "Well, I told you" lecture.

It was a quick decision for the both of us that dined there:  Never going back.
We informed our friends and family of our experience, and they also agreed that they were disappointed, and would not want to pay a visit.

Not to be a jerk about it, but in my line of work, satisfying the customer and acknowledging the customer's mistake with a smile and a "no, it's okay," helps bring the customers in.

Text: Amazing cheese fries and pretty good pizza. The burger I had one visit was pretty sub-par though so I'd stay away from those.

Text: Midwestern version of deli. Everything is tasty, if not truly authentic. Friendly, low key service.

Text: First time it was good, second time they messed up our pizza and served us raw chicken! Plus the waitresses were rude. Disgusting.
