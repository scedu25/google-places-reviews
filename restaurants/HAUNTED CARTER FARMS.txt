HAUNTED CARTER FARMS

Text: We have been going here for some of my b-day party's the last two years and have loved it. My twin is a boy and I'm a girl so it makes it extra fun when u have a mix of both friends. Though it seems that I'm the one they always cling to and the one they always make go first when we turn the corners. Weird, right?? Its definitely the place to go when you have a birthday around Halloween or just to go in general with some friends. I highly recommend it. There's always something lurking in that corn maze...??

Text: This is our annual Halloween tradition now with our kids at the right ages (10-15).  They offer a haunted corn maze that is fun and lengthy, but not really too scary.  They have a little area to get your picture taken, a bonfire to hang out at, and a concession stand for snacks.  You get a discount on admission if you bring 2 can good donations.  The atmosphere is great, especially since it's out in the middle of nowhere and very dark.
