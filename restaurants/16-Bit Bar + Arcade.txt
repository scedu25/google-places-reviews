16-Bit Bar + Arcade

Text: One of my favorite places to hang out in Columbus. Fantastic drink selection and wonderful staff. The games are fun but I go for the Street Fighter tournament on Monday nights. Outside food is allowed and there is an outdoor patio. It's a relatively small place but plenty of fun to be had!

Text: Great place to get drinks and hang out. Can get pretty crowded on the weekends. The vibe is awesome though. People are playing and watching each other play games having a good time. Everyone seems to be giving each other turns which is dope. Need to go back soon!!!

Text: I absolutely love this place. The games are free, the drink selection is broad, and it's friendly with its neighbors, meaning you can get food from a neighboring restaurant and bring it in. It does get very crowded on weekends, and very hot. For me, it's always a fun time. I just can't be miserable here.

Text: Stopped in shortly after opening while we were in town for a wedding. Great game selection, and drink prices were very reasonable. A good place to spend a few weekend afternoon hours and kill some time.

Text: Although this was NOT a singles bar as I had expected (or perhaps it was just a slow night for them), the arcade and bar were top notch. The servers were dressed attractively in attire appropriate for the setting. They were friendly, hard-working and knew their stuff.
My server was Andrea I believe. Her service was warm and inviting. My mixed drink slushie was worth more than just $6. She treated me as a patron so well that I gave her a $5 tip.
The games had me excited at each round! I do not believe I have been to a real arcade, or at least for a very long time. There is quite a variety here and great two-player games.
My visit here was the perfect way to end my Tuesday. No regrets for the night.
