Text: Kyle the bartender...we sat at the bar...he's AWESOME. Found a new wine - Molly Dooker. Enjoyed a FABULOUS dinner. Which left room for an EXCELLENT dessert. Relaxing vibe. Outstanding service. Delicious food. You don't need Iowa City....just come to a Riverside Iowa!

Text: Wonderful experience. The staff at Ruthie's is extremely knowledgeable in terms of wine, food and cocktail recommendations. The cocktails are incredible! If you get the chance to try the Ruby Red Fresca or their margarita I would definitely recommend it. Food was amazing and so was the atmosphere! I will definitely be back.

Text: My parents ate at Ruthies Steakhouse for the first time on Mother's day weekend. They were 5 minutes late but we're about to get seated thanks to Kyle Toth for saving there reservation . They said the waitress was kind and patient  I'm pretty sure her name is Summer ( sorry if i got wrong). My parents English is a little broken up so the fact that she took her time and help them out when they didn't understand something on the meau. The food was amazing. Thank you for giving my parents a great experience.

Text: For Ruthie's Steakhouse:

To start, we waited 20 minutes for a drink to be delivered to our table. Our food took a very long time to prepare and they were not extremely busy, there were a few tables open. Manager stood around while our drinks were waiting on the bar top. Finally got our food brought to us by the manager- it was incorrect- she just looked at us after I said "I ordered lamb not steak" and then walked away without saying a word. We waited another 15-20 minutes. My boyfriend's steak came back completely rare- my lamb was cooked perfectly however. While he sent his food away, I took a bite of my broccolini and found a massive hair in it. Disgusting. Will not be returning.
