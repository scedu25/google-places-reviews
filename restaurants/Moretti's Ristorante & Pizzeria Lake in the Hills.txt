Text: Excellent food. Large portions. Fair prices. Great service. We moved to Phoenix which has none of these things. We miss Moretti's. Yes we always make time to stop for dinner, lunch whenever we're back in town! Need a great restaurant in Phoenix area. Need a Moretti's! Send Keith.

Text: The food was great our waitress was excellent we went to the bar to order a cocktail before we sat down.. 
 Bartender said we could not transfer the cocktail to our table is this a real thing???
I'm in the food industry and have never been told that.....
Definitely something to take a look at otherwise it would have been all fives...
