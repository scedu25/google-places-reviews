Text: Upscale restaurant with separate bar lounge on lower level. Large extensive menu suggests they are trying to cater to a large variety of tastes, but not doing any of it well. The food we ordered was in $20-$40 entree range each.  It was average and not worth the price point.  The service was average and  did not meet our expectations of an upscale restaurant.

Text: Nice place. Good Service. Everyone was friendly & knowledgeable of the menu. Food was very good & prices were fair. Prime rib was perfect. Moussaka was my wife choice. She enjoyed.
