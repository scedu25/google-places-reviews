Text: The location is nice with a large patio but they don't take cards & we bought a strawberry beer, a signature drink there for 11$ each.. of all the places I've vacationed I've never spent so much on a drink.. hell even a beer I've never paid more than 5 bucks on draft. After the ATM fee & tip it was 15$ for a freaking beer lol.. my last time ever going here.
