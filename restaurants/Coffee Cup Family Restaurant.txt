Text: The food is amazing here! The staff however, not quite. I've only gotten ONE waitress that has been kind to us. Otherwise I don't feel very welcome. But who cares, the food is AMAZING!

Text: Food is always so greasy. You have to flag down the waitress to get something. Fast food is better (gag), and it's just as homemade.
