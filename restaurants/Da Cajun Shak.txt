Text: I’ve never in my life wrote a review but today was that bad of an  experience.  My food came out and then they still forgot to put my kids in. They never got there food mind you I sat there over 20 mins after mine was gone. I repeatedly asked for diet Pepsi for my diabetic son. Then I said never mind on their food because I was already done so they brought me to go drinks and hour later and he brought me a Pepsi after I pacifically over and over and over and said Diet Pepsi.  So I asked him what was in that cup my son was drinking out of and he told me Pepsi he thinks .  What is 3:13 AM and my son sugar is still high I didn’t get one apology nothing I will never again eat there that was the worst experience of my life .
