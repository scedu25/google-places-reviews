Text: Great food.different price levels $15-50. Real live piano man on staff...very cool. Chefs in the kitchen are in an open cooking area for guests to watch.Full bar.  Restored old building. Can be a lil noisy if its busy with the extra high ceilings.

Text: Food is good for the most part but a little overpriced. Drinks are way overpriced. Recommend going during happy hour if you want to order drinks here so you aren't getting ripped off. Service is hit and miss. I think they know their service blows so they automatically add inflated gratuity to parties of 5 or more. Pay attention to your bill as they will add 20% gratuity based off your total including tax, which is wrong. Dispute the amount and they will change it for you.

Text: The food was good (not worth the $23/plate), but the atmosphere was lacking. The kitchen staff could be heard talking loudly as we tried to enjoy our anniversary meal (open kitchen concept). I think management needs to make employees aware that guests are present, and can hear EVERYTHING being said. I don;t think we will ever return to the Phoenix.
