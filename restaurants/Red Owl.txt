Text: The Red Owl has a variety of tasty sandwiches, salads and dinners. Saturday breakfast buffet includes home made cinnamon and pecan rolls, meats, eggs, potatoes, homemade biscuits and gravy. Don't forget the french toast and pancakes. Sundays lunch buffet includes fried chicken, another meat, real mashed potatoes and other hot items. Also included is a full salad bar and homemade desserts. They also have an all you can eat salad bar  Tues-Friday lunch along with other daily specials. I would suggest if you are too full for dessert you take a piece home. All desserts are made from scratch including pies, cakes and lush. If your too tired to make it in they also have free delivery in Beardstown!

Text: Really good food. Old building so either you like the vibe or not. They play great music and for me that was a plus....if you like Tom petty, pink Floyd and the likes.
