Oishi Hibachi Steakhouse

Text: Went for a Bday party so it was a good setting around the grill.   Staff was friendly and the grill show was fun.   Wife & I both had shrimp and were disappointed.  They put it on the grill when they started all the meats & came off the grill after the steak & before chicken.   Needless to say, a minute on the grill would have been plenty so it was tough.  A little pricey for what you get but I guess your paying for the entertainment as well.

Text: Birthday days and school field trips. This place is great for a group meal. Good service and food is always fresh and tasty! Love the house salad dressing! Tom Yum soup is a spicy and amazing soup too!

Text: We tried the hibachi steak tonite, food is ok. Two eggs to make fried rice for 8? That's on slim side!  Not cheap for its meal.

Text: I eat here about once a week. Some servers are better than others, but the ones that know me pretty much rock. Been loving their sushi since they first opened.

Text: Good sushi, great ambience.  Pleased with the service.  Nice enough to be semi-formal but comfortable enough to be casual.
