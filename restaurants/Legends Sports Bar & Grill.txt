Text: The atmosphere was okay and there weren't many people here. BUT the hamburger I had was by far THE VERY BEST HAMBURGER I've had in many years. All Angus beef and cooked to perfection on a toasted bun. The only thing I can complain about is that it was too big and I couldn't eat the whole thing!

Text: The hotel is dated but don't let that fool you. I am a burger FANATIC! So since I have been staying here doing contract work I finally decided to try out the restaurant after reading the burger reviews. Did I say I was a burger FANATIC?...well this was a royal treat and right in the shadow of an Applebee's no less.  Onion rings were very good also.
