Text: I love the pork fried rice and the beef chop suey.  I have it specially ordered, but they still never get it right on the first try.  If I don't check the order before leaving on carry out, I'll be sorry.  I'm not sure if it's because of a language barrier or what, but whenever I ask them to NOT put white onions in my fried rice, but ADD EXTRA green onion, they never get it right.  I always have to send it back for them to do it over.  It's really irritating, but they do make the best fried rice and chop suey in Springfield.  That's why I still go there.

Text: Hands down the BEST Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The General Tso's chicken is the best  version I've ever had. It is simply unparalleled. I've tried to find a place that makes it similarly, but, alas, no luck! I seriously drive out of my way when I'm in Illinois to eat here. I also love their sissling rice soup...Yum!!
