Beef-A-Roo
Rating: 5
Text: Amazing food. The beef is the best and is unmatched for the speed of service. Cheese fries are also very good. Little on the expensive.
Rating: 3
Text: Read some of the hype via Reddit, but not sure it's warranted. Place is pretty standard, nothing unique to make it memorable. Not bad, just not special enough to be a 4/5 star rating.

Text: Disappointed that they no longer offer "combo" prices. Everything is now al a carte.  Spent $40 On dinner for 4. A bit pricy for drive thru but the food is always delicious!

Text: Great pork tenderloin sandwich! The French fries are the best, especially with their seasoned salt. And, they have Caffeine Free diet Pepsi!
