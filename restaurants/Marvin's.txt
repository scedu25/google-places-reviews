Text: I time-honored tradition in the heart of Greencastle/DePauw.  The burgers are solid, the speed is reasonable, and the flavor is awesome.  Their Beta Suite grilled chicken sandwich is my go-to, and the wet burritos are terrific.  The pizza crust has good flavor (tastes like brick oven pizza IMO), and then different variants of french fries/toppings are sure to please.  Not to be missed, the chicken tenders are fantastic as well!  Light breading, great flavor, and tender!

Text: Garlic cheese burgers are great. Taco salad sat in the window for 20 mins. Meat was cold. They got a new one for us. Cool atmosphere!

Text: Salty, salty, salty. The iconic Garlic Cheeseburger was nothing special, and really only had any flavor because it was so heavily salted that it felt like I could feel myself dehydrating through each bite. Same goes for the cheese fries. Food is pretty reasonably priced, but i couldn't help feeling nickel and dimed as it was an additional 80 cents for dipping sauces which were definitely needed for the sake of making everything a little more palatable and dealing with the dry burgers that were too salty. Definitely outdated, and not exactly sparkling clean, has the reputation as the campus greasy spoon, maybe that makes putting up with everything if you're drunk? All that being said, I'll still be back to see if the Philly Cheesesteak is any better.
