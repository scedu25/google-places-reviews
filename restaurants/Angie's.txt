Angie's

Text: DoubleTree Hotels

On our recent stay in your DoubleTree Lexington KY hotel on Richmond Rd. Our hotel stay was fine but your restaurant inside called Angie's was horrible. My meal on the evening of May 3rd, 2017 was inedible. The waitstaff was very unresponsive or cared that I could not eat my meal, just removed my plate and never asked nor said anything. I sent a letter to the hotel desk and they did nothing. We were waiting to see if they would remove the charge of the meal, yet did nothing. Very disappointed in the quality of food and service at Angie's.
