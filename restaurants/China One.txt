Text: Food was okay, preparation was FAST out the door in just a few minutes.  Maybe it's too authentic for me or maybe they were having a bad day.  Happy family was good portion, in fact larger than expected.  Vegetable Lo-mien tasted off, kinda like the pan had some burnt leftovers from some previously cooked Lo-mien, it infused my portion with a smoky burnt food flavor.

Bottom line, staff was friendly, not to difficult to understand.  Meal cost a little more than I expected ($14 for family buffet and lo mien to go) but was a larger portion than I expected.  Lo mien tasted off.  I probably won't go back.

****Update 4-6-17 went back, food was much better! Will be here more often!

Text: Food tasted good. But portions were a bit smaller than expected. Egg roll is actually spring roll and dinner combo is actual size of other restaurants Lunch combos. Pictured is egg roll and dinner combo.
