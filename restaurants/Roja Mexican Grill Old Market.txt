Text: Great food. Great service and nice environment. I love that they text when your table is ready. It was a little hard to talk among our group due to it being a little loud. But we still had a great time. We'd definitely come back.

Text: Very good service. Prices not bad ($22 for 2 adults, not including tip or drinks). Portion sizes more than enough to fill us up. Food was not particularly outstanding, though. I'd eat there again, but would really like my Tex-Mex to have more spice. More cilantro in the salsa & generally more heat in everything. (Nothing we had was spicy hot in the least).

Text: Have eaten here a few times. Nothing really spectacular about the food or the service, it has always been pretty average. The atmosphere however is pretty nice, and it makes for a great place to hang out and down some margaritas downtown. 
But, if you are just looking for authentic Mexican food without any of the flare, I'd recommend heading down 24th street and stopping just about anywhere out there..

Text: Had a great waitress (Heather), who was attentive and accommodating both with our large group and my personal, oddly specific, food order. Everything came out quickly and correct! Really enjoyed it - would definitely go back.

Text: Roja Mexican Grill in the Old Market has a great open atmosphere. At night they light the fire pits for a cozy feel. The chicken frijata I had was delicious, so much I had to take most of it home!
