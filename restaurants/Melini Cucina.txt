Text: The food used to be great however the last two times we went it was absolutely horrible! My fiance's salad came out with noodles on top of it and my chicken carbonara was chicken noodle soup and it was disgusting. We will never eat here again. Also their grilled chicken is actually thrown in a deep fryer to warm it up!

Text: Always good food, but hard to give them a glowing review when you show up at 8:20 on a Sunday night and they already have the doors locked and look out at you through the blinds and just walk away.
