Text: What a GREAT little jewel.  We stopped as we were traveling through the area.  We had Margery as our waitress/bartender, she was so friendly and extremely efficient. The food was excellent, service great. The other customers were very friendly.  Try the fried shrimp and  spicy fried green beans!  Love this place!

Text: It's ok. It's not authentic Irish food. Service was good. Food's slow coming out of the kitchen, and I think it's frozen food...but not a horrible experience. Glad we didn't drive out of our way to go.

Text: I've not been here for over a year. It was closed for a while. It's just a standard bar and grill with a bunch of regulars. But the burgers are very good, locally grown. Plus it's good place to stop for a drink and chat with the locals. I like it and hope it's open again.

Text: Grouper was delicious but side salad had more cheese than greens. MANY mistakes with our order but may have been a new server or because we had a pretty large group.

Text: Great little place with good food and service. Drinks are definitely on the heavy side for a very reasonable price.
