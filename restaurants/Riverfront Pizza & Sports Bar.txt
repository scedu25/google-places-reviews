Text: Beer is Cold. Food is mediocre. Def dine in. Delivery may or may not make it. She is on the way with Your food. Is the standard answer when Ya call to find out where it is. If it does show up it will be cold and at that point if Ya paid with a card.  Your kinda stuck with it. If Your here on a trip. Give Goodfellas a ring. You will be happy all the way around. Life is too short to eat bad pizza. Had My fingers crossed this joint would be a place I could recommend. In 10 yrs time it has gone down hill. Like I said. The Beer is Cold enjoy the bar. And eat elsewhere. There is plenty to choose from in the area....

Text: I love Riverfront Pizza. I don't recommend sitting outside though. I'm just minding my own business, eating some pizza. Every time someone is asking to use my phone (that I'm pretending to be talking on so they won't hit me up for money). Now they want the money and the phone. Can't act like I don't speak English because they just busted me "talking" on my fake phone call. Argh...well great place just don't sit outside is my advice.

Text: Half pizza parlor, half pizza bar. You can dine inside or outside. Good value, very good pizza. Definitely worth a try.

Text: Riverfront Pizza was good it was the first time I've been there in years I got the steak Hoagie While most people got the pizza it was as good as I remembered from when my kids were little the only thing is is there's lots of TV going on and music from the Jukebox at the same time so it's kind of hard to hear each other talk
