Text: Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Dewitt. Awesome food, the staff is top notch and the owners are great. Family owned, feels like walking into Cheers. Also a “green” restaurant.. is it weird the boxes are my favorite? They’re the best! And made of all recycled materials. Check this place out.. I’m in Love

Text: Very good hamburger and fries. Decent beer selection (not that I often drink here) with a video board so you don't have to decipher tap handles. Waitress was great. Food always comes fairly quickly. I usually only go here for lunch.

Text: Draft house is a great place to eat.  They have a fantastic sirloin always cooked to perfection, french dip is great, rotisserie chicken dinner is a winner among many other good dishes. Great beer selection for beer drinkers, could improve on their wine selection.  Atmosphere is nice and service is good.  Give it a try.
