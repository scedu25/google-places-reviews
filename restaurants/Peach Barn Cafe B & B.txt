Text: VERY intimate. About 6 tables total, and you will be socializing with your neighboring table and the staff. If you are a fan of a place where they take your order and leave you to yourself, this might not be for you. Having said that, I like talking to strangers and I enjoyed this place very much. The service was fine, and the food was very good. If you are in the mood for a departure from Applebee's, I recommend it.
