Wildberry Pancakes & Cafe

Text: Very good food, large portions. More expensive than other local breakfast spots, but worth it. That's why there's always a line. Moves pretty fast, though.

Text: My mother and I tried this place out on a Saturday morning. We arrived at 9:30 am and were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. The lobby was overcrowded so we waited in the car. They send you a link that allows you to see your place in line. You can also put your name on the list before you leave the house via yelp, good to know for the future. We were seated at about 10 am and once seated we both knew what we wanted since we looked at the menu while waiting on a table. Our server came over as soon as we were seated with water and took our drink order. Upon his return we ordered our food. My mother ordered the Mexican Skillet and I had the two eggs breakfast with hash browns, bacon, and instead of regular pancakes I paid the upcharge fee to try the strawberry poppyseed pancakes. Everything was delicious and although they were super crowded the food came out in probably 20 minutes if that. I have been to restaurants were we were the only ones there and it took longer so Wildberry is Extremely, emphasis on the extremely, well managed and we will be back without a doubt. Also my mother gets the Mexican Skillet at every breakfast place we go to and she said the one she had at Wildberry was by far the best.

Text: It was very busy, even on a Friday late morning. The food and service was pretty good. It was nice to have a sit down meal on vacation. I see why all those people were there.

Text: Delicious food! The portions are good considering the price. Many different breakfast options to choose from. Their coffee is also excellent, I like a good strong cup and I was not disappointed. They also have various coffee options and provide dairy alternatives. Although, be ready to wait if you go there after 9:30am on the weekends.

Text: The best pancakes I I ever ate (And I don't care for pancakes). I'm only giving 4 stars because of the 45 min wait. I'm talking massive crowd waiting outside. I go rarely for that reason. Sometimes for takeout or weekdays (still packed).
 It's not their fault  they are popular but I wonder why they haven't expanded with all the $$ they make inside a few hours. They could make more $$$ and become more accommodating by popular demand. I'm sure many would agree with me on this
