Text: Arrived late at night, greeted with friendly services. The suite was only a few more dollars and booked it. Room was very clean, and spacious. Pillows are wonderful and plenty of them. Motel is not attached to casino but it's a very short walk. Not crowded at all but we arrived on a Tuesday night around 10pm. Lots of machines, friendly people, machines for me were tight and I lost $60, but my boyfriend spent $20 and walked away $30 ahead. Good spacious casino, very clean and I would visit it again if In the area.

Text: Back in the Fireside Restaurant, you can get a pretty remarkable prime rib dinner with excellent sides at a very reasonable price. When we come this way for work, we always find time for one or two visits to get a massive steak dinner. In writing this, I am completely overlooking the cigarette smoke stench of a state-run casino that I can't really comment on since I don't gamble, hate foul odors, flashing lights, and annoying sounds. If you like casino life, you're going to love it!

Text: Have been to the casino several times and always greeted and treated with courtesy.  The only downside is one card player is a very loud cowboy type that bothers everyone with his screaming YAHOO! all the time.  The cowboy café food is good and moderately priced.  The firesides puts out excellent steaks and prime rib, good prices.

Text: The casino is pretty nice. Havent won big but usually break even or -$20 but its fun to feed the slot machines. Plus they have tables as well so a little bit of Vegas in my backyard. Really dying to try the resturant but always end up heading out too late.

Text: Classic example of discrimination. My buddy is a tourist from Mexico and they wouldn't let him in with a several valid IDs that he had because they claim only a US issues id was acceptable. Asked for the manager and he said foreign IDs were not valid.
