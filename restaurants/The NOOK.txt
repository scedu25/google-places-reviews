Text: I have been coming here since I was a kid, and now I have the pleasure to introduce this awesome restaurant to my kids! Best coney dogs around, hands down! The mural on the wall, painted by my uncle Kenny, is still as amazing to my kids as it was to me as a boy. So stop in and order a coney basket and enjoy this hidden gem in downtown Columbia City!
