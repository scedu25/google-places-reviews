Text: Food, atmosphere, service, price, excellent.  The best chef's salad and with their homemade hot bacon dressing it's to die for!    Margarita was good but would have preferred it in a margarita glass not a small cocktail glass.

Text: 8 11 2107 Service was good but we were waited on by 4 servers all together. Our main server must have been busy. Food was decent except the salmon was burnt, black charcoal mostly, tasted that way as well. We did get it redone but with no real apology, the fish comes that way they said with the sauce it has on it... rest of meal was ok.. requesting things took some effort as well, ex butter steak sauce ect. Will give this place a rest for a bit.
