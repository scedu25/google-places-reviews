Text: I had my dream wedding at Walkers Bluff! The florist Jonathan is amazing and Kelcey Keith the coordinator is great to work with! My guests were awestruck by the beautiful wine cave and the food was very good! Truly a fun and memorable experience provided by the staff! I highly recommend it!!

Text: Went on Sunday afternoon when it wasn't busy. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but the tables were dirty and several servers that were standing around were inattentive. You'd think that our food would be fresh and hot since we were one of only a few parties in the place, but no, our pizza was cold. The wine is mediocre at best.

Text: On August 21st, 2017 at 1:20 pm Ozzy rocked Walker's Bluff,  opening up the onset of a total solar eclipse with "Bark at the Moon". As part of his reunion tour with Zakk Wylde, this band of hard rock n' metal gods put on an incredible show including hits like "No More Tears", "Paranoid", "Crazy Train", "Mama, I'm Coming Home", "War Pigs", "Shot in the Dark" and more. Walker's Bluff General Store did an unsurpassed job of displaying Ozzys new wine, "Solar Red". The nostalgic store offers everything from really cool jewelry to wine hosting supplies to picnic delicacies. The tables are right outside and there is a beautiful pond and a splendid weeping willow tree right at the waters' edge. They also have a large selection of mason jar canned goods, signature wines and hard liquor, gorgeous home decor items, and more. A filling station is conveniently on the premises as well should your tank be low on fuel. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The ambiance is casually primitive yet exquisite. . . and remember, with Halloween sneaking up around the corner, maybe it's time to check out the new Ozzy Solar Red and "Hail to the Ozzfather"... Walker's Bluff Style!
