Text: We waited 45 mins for our food and the waitress was very nice and felt bad. We ended up leaving. As we were leaving the cook yelled “bye!” I called later to speak to the owner which happened to be the cook and she told me that she was giving it to us on the house but no one communicated that to us so we just left. If the cook would have come out and apologize and told us it was on the house we would have stayed and enjoyed our meal. There was maybe 10 people that were in the restaurant and even tables of 4 people that came later got their food before us. So basically we were the only ones without food
