Text: After waiting over 1 1/2 hours left without dinner. Understand it was a very busy night but when you order 3 sandwiches and a kids pizza you should get your food before parties larger and the same size as our 4. When we went to leave all we got from management was excuses.  Not sure if I'll try this restaurant under new management again..
