Text: 5 stars for a good family restaurant. Not a 'Chez Paul' French restaurant 5 star, but damn good comfort food. Great portions and friendly service. Eat here every two months. We love the chicken fingers, lobster Mac and cheese. Haven't tried the steak yet.

Text: fun atmosphere, cardinals game on, some of older foods (pies, all u can eat buffet, fried chicken) but SO many more options on the menu including different pastas and pulled pork and surf and turf.   Excellent bread and maple butter (but still has apple butter too).  also has my favorite Blue Moon beer!

Text: 1st time with family, figured i would get the buffet. It was not very good. Only ate the fried chicken. Most was not seasoned. The mac and cheese was mushy and greasy. The gravy for the mashed potatoes tasted like pizza sauce. The green beans were too sweet, and were mushy as well. I was dissatisfied and spoke with manager who did give me a discount. There were several other guests who were tearing up the food, so apparently they were able to enjoy. Just wasn't for me.
