Text: Dinner at a gas station? Really? YES! REALLY!! I was reluctant to eat here even though this place gets such great reviews because it shares space with a gas station. I'm so glad we stopped! The staff is so friendly, the seating area is clean, prices are a little on the high side but the food was absolutely delicious! If nothing else you should stop to taste their homemade chips!!

Text: They do not even come close to touching the deliciousness that is Kansas sixty BBQ. It’s OK if you in the need between trips of real BBQ places.

Text: Friendliest staff around! Chips are phenomenal, try the zesty house spice on them. BBQ is great too! Very fresh and leave the sauce portion up to you, as it should be. Will make this a new regular stop during travels.

Text: Best local bbq in town!  Those homemade chips are delicious and addictive.  Pulled pork sandwich slathered with any one of their four sauces takes you to the next level.  Hometown BBQ at it's best. ???
