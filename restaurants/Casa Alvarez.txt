Text: Terrible. Ordered 5 burritos de carne asada and I get 5 bean burritos with a little bit of meat on it for 9.50 each. The burritos are only average sized. Also the guac was bland and they didn't even bother to spread the guac on the burrito. They don't have horchata or anything like that, only soda. Our order took quite a while and no one else was there. The building itself looks like a 10 year painted and made it. The furniture is nice but that's about it. Overpriced and bad food.
