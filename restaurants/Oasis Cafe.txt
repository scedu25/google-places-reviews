Text: . Everything here is good from the soup to the chicken to the hummus. A bit pricey but very health. I would eat here everyday if my wallet allowed it. The owner is very friendly as well.

Text: Extremely small serving size for the price. Dirty sitting environment. No feta or tzatziki sauce in their gyros. They tape their napkins shut with scotch tape. Never go here, International Cafe is the place you want if you like gyros.
