Good Fella'z Pizzeria

Text: Girl answers phone doesn't even say Good Fellaz pizza, she answers saying we aren't taking anymore orders today.  Her tone of voice was in a negative demeanor as well.  On top of it all, I had to call twice to get such a rude greeting.  I called and heard click, I was hung up on, then I called back and got such a rude greeting from a young woman at 8:40 p.m.  I only wanted a small strimboli, not as time consuming as pizza.  Look sweetheart, there's too much competition to put up with your rudeness.  Next time say hello first.

Text: For some reason i always skipped over this place. I shouldnt have because its amazing! We went in about 15 minutes before they closed and eveyone treated us like family. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. We had a pepperoni pizza, italian subs and wings. Everything was awesome! Great food and friendly people.

Text: The pizza was great! But when i walked in i was not greeted. One of the emplotees was on the phone and as i smiled at her she looked at me and ignored my gesture, and i tried again, and was ignored again.
