Text: We stayed for one night here. They had a friendly and quick check-in as well as check-out. The rooms seemed well kept and the breakfast was pretty darn tasty. Hampton is pretty good about delivering on that.

The parking lot is shared with the hotel next door and did not allow for full-circle navigation of the lot.
