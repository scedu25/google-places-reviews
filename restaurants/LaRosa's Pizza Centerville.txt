Text: Today I placed an order for pickup online. The order was to be ready at specific time. Came a about 5 minutes after the expected time for pickup but my food had not even be put in the oven. The manager provided great customer service by apologizing for any inconvenience and gave me coupons for my next order as well as 50% off the current order. I usually don't review places unless I receive excellent service and product and the food was good too but the service was outstanding.

Text: Once again totally underwhelmed by the poor service. The food is La Rosa's that we all know and love, but do your self a favor and find another way to get it. An hour and half for a child's pizza and a calzone. 
Last visit for another year I guess. 5th lousy experience in three years.
