Text: Best most modern gas station in the area; nicely placed between the one way roads.  They have 93 octane for those who need it.  They also have a lot of food, but I've never ate any of it.  They have a car wash, but I wouldn't recommend using it unless you like scratch marks.  Well lit at night; always friendly staff.  Diesel fuel with large ports for trucks.
