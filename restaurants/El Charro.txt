Text: LOVE El Charro's! Best fajitas in town! Great nachos, too. Combo plate specials. You never go away feeling hungry! They'll sing and let them wear the sombrero if you have a birthday in your group, young or old! And give them (only) free fried ice cream!

Text: The food was Great! I recommend the Popeye Chicken. My husband likes the Cheese Chicken. Big portions if you leave hungry it's your own fault. Woderful Authentic Mexican food. The atmosphere was good as well. Keep up the good work! :-)

Text: I love this restaurant. Yesterday I ordered the beef fajitas and they really outdid themselves. The atmosphere is great.

Text: Love the food and 2$ margaritas! Prices are great and the wait staff are on point. Cheese dip is worth a try too. Lots of local competition but we usually land lunch here.
