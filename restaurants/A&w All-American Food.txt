A&w All-American Food
Rating: 1
Text: Today was our first experience at A&W and the service was just awful.  Never have I been so let down by a restaurant before.  We used the drive thru and ordered an a5 and when the worker repeated our order everything was correct, then we proceeded to the window to pay and get our food.  The man who attended us was first off not in uniform and was wearing his what seemed to be pajamas.  After what seemed like forever we finally received our change and proceeded to wait for our food and in doing so we noticed that the same guy who was attending us scooped up ice with his bare hand. When he opened the window to give us our supposed order we told him that we ordered the a5 not a root bear float and he rudely told us that we did.  I'm sorry but I know that if you get a customer's order wrong you're obligated to apologize and solve the customers problem.  We continued to tell him it was the wrong order expecting  him to change it and give us our food and during that time the root beer that he gave us was overflowing all in our truck and he did not even offer napkins.  You could tell he did not care for the customer and could care less about the service he was providing.  Awful experience and we will definitely never be going there again.

Text: Bad mistake they should of never place a&w with long johns together at the same place. Now you get a mixed up order and their taste different now.

Text: After my swim meet in dodge, all I wanted to do was indulge in some delicious ice cream. I looked over the menu and everything looked great but I only wanted one thing: the cookies and cream blenderrrr. I ordered and got my drink quickly then left. When I started eating I noticed that there was a lot of plain ice cream and I'm thinking, did they just give me vanilla? But as I ate more I noticed that it was cookie dough. Don't get me wrong I love cookie dough but that's not what I ordered. Cookie dough doesn't work as a blenderrrr because all it does is sink to the bottom of the cup. I wanted cookies and cream. The ice cream is still extremely good and I'm still going to eat it but next time get my order right.

Text: Walked over to place a to go order went in the door of the seating area and some little teeny bopper came running oh this section closed. So said what telling me .? Not did you want to place an order or even may I get something to go . Real class act. I will never come back and I will be sure to let all of my friends and associates know about it. I will do all I can to insure that I never go there again.

Text: Very overpriced for mediocre food. Only went because the grandkids wanted a root beer float.
