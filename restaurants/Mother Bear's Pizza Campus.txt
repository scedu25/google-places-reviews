Mother Bear's Pizza Campus
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best Pizza/Food place tucked into 3rd street in Bloomington Indiana.   I ordered Pizza and it  was the best I have ever had including offerings from NYC and Chicago. It was perfect and my college son and I dreaded going to the last piece for we knew it was too good to leave any behind. Atmosphere adds to the experience. Booths and tables that show the rich tradition of the establishment. The crown was a mix of college students to adults hanging out and enjoying a small slice of pizza heaven. It was ranked in the top ten Pizza places in the Midwest and still hold that distinction

Text: I go here often for lunch.  I don't know how this place can be voted 4th best pizza in the nation.  It's pretty good but great?  That's not happening for me.  Pizza's could use a bit more sauce for my palate.  The lunch specials are really nice for the price and include a salad.
