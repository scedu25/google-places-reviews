Bob Chinn's Crab House

Text: $$$ The seafood is prepared perfectly and given it's fresh, adds even more to the flavor. Very large seasonal menu that provides a wide range of choices, but this may tend to overwhelm some diners. The restaurant is casual and set up to handle a large number of diners and is definitely not very intimate and tends to be on the noisy side, but in a good way. However, unless you're a fresh seafood connoisseur, the prices are EXTREMELY HIGH and seem only justified by the hype of having fresh seafood and the experience of dining at a long established restaurant. We were there celebrating daughter's birthday and afterwards she said although the food was good, she said next time she'd prefer Red Lobster. So bottom line is food is second to none but it comes down to the willingness to spend a mortgage payment for it.

Text: It's been over a week since I was here and I'm STILL craving their garlic rolls and the surf and turf (king crab leg and prime rib) that I had their with my co-workers. What made this experience so enjoyable was the waitress. She came over, spent about 5 minutes explaining the different types of meat and showing us what each one was on the menu. Once I ordered my meal, she put the bib on me (The Best Legs In Town) and showed me how to get the crab meat out of the legs. Loved this establishment and would recommend this place to ANYONE!

Text: Absolutely love the seafood here and their Taro cake. Their garlic rolls are bomb and saucy. Their special dipping sauce for the crabs are way better than regular old butter. You will never feel the same after their sauce. The restaurant is usually packed, but the wait isn't that long. They won't seat you unless your whole party is there, otherwise they'll make you wait until everyone has arrived.

Text: Bob Chinn's is the place to go for fresh seafood. I highly recommend the seafood gumbo, which is hearty with a generous portion of seafood and a nice spicy kick. In the fall and winter, when they offer their lobster pot pie, it is definitely worth the price. The pastry is light and flaky and the filling is full of large tender chunks of lobster in a creamy sauce with vegetables.

Text: Came in from Detroit for a Reliv conference and I always wanted to come and partake in the bob chin experience. No words can express the feeling of gratitude. My family and I were so pleased with the service, the seafood and the experience. 
Crab Legs and rib eye for 2. All I can say it's the best steak we've ever had. So tender, juicy seasoned well. The crab was so sweet and juicy and fresh. My mother had grouper and she's in love. We don't come that way often but when we do we'll make it a point to visit. THANK YOU
