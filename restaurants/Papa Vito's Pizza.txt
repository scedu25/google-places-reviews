Papa Vito's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Papa Vito's is one of the best pizza joints in the St. Louis area.  We usually start off with a salad to share, and it was plenty for 3 and a half of us (the youngest usually has a little too).  The garden salad is full of cheese, crisp bacon, onions, and the best croutons I have have ever eaten. The house dressing is so good that we bought a bottle to take home.  Last time, we ordered the Deluxe pizza.  It came to our table in what seemed like just a few minutes.  It was outstanding.  It's thin crust, of course, but piled with fresh toppings from end to end.  The crust has such a good, smoky flavor.  We love everything about Papa Vito's.  The atmosphere is nice.  The service staff was pleasant and attentive.  The real star of show of course is the food and it does not disappoint.    We don't get to Belleville all that often, but when we do, Papa Vito's it at the top of my list.

Text: I love Papa Vitos.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is comfortable and home-y.  The staff is always friendly and fun.  The pizza is excellent, they always have a monthly special theme pizza (my fave is most definitely the thanksgiving pizza with Turkey, dressing and cranberries) but my most favorite item here is Ricks Preferred Wings.  They are excellent.  Servings are HUGE (one salad will feed 4 easily) and food always comes out piping hot the way pizza/wings should be.  Go now!

Text: The preferred wings are the best wings ever.  So tasty and it is baked and then fried.  The skin is just right.  No soggy fatty pieces.  The pizza is great as is everything on the menu.  Huge portions for great prices.  Thin crust pizza.  Good beer selection as well.

Text: Excellent service. Food was excellent from stuffed bread sticks for an appetizer to a personal size pizza and calzone. The thin crusted pizza was exceptional - probably the best in the area.

Text: The hostess was great, and made our visit extra awesome once we inquired about the ghost plaque on the wall!  Also, our waitress was awesome...very friendly.  The house/restaurant has rich, interesting history.   The pizza is AMAZING.  First of many trips to Papa Vito's!!
