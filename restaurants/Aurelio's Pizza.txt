Aurelio's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: This review is for the Chicago location. The Ambiance is nice but modern. The pizza is excellent, with a sweet sauce and a salty cheese. It is the best thin crust pizza that you can get. I have been eating it for 35 years. I was a busboy and their Homewood location in the early 1990s.

Text: Had the super six the works. Definitely among the top 5 pizzas I have ever tasted. Can't remember any that were better. Ask for the old oven. It is a brick oven about 75 years old so the pizza taste is baked into every brick. DELICIOUS!!!!!

Text: We were a group of 16+ and 4 high chairs on a Sunday at 1230pm( we reconfirmed the advance notice 2 times earlier in the week) and although the restaurant was mostly empty, we were put at 2 cramped tables in a corner with 4 completely empty tables next to us. After waiting to be acknowledged by a server then waiting again for pitchers of water, we had to flag down the waitress for beverage service. While waiting on our beverages, the hostess approaches our group to request that we remove our items from the empty table next to us as they need the tables -reiterating that we were assigned 2 tables,  not 3- this is long before we were even given the opportunity to place a food order. 90 minutes later the empty tables next to us that were so urgently needed were still not occupied. Aurelios pizza is the best in the area, but the customer service definitely needs improvement. I plan several events in the area but unfortunately would not recommend this Aurelio's for group events.

Text: Most people think of big deep dish pizza when they think of Chicago Style.  Not me, this is home, this is Chicago style pizza for me.  The best crust, sauce toppings in the area.  The Homewood location has the best atmosphere and is truly the home of sit down family pizza.  It is pricey but worth it.

Text: Server Was the rudest woman that I have ever come across and she snatches things from your hands and don't allow you to ask a question without saying that lunch specials were over. Wasn't offered anything regarding lunch and when the order was ready to be placed could not find her. Poor time management skills and customer service consideration too. First time visiting and will be the last. No One had any manners or consideration for other people then themselves. Too much time spent on personal conversation.
