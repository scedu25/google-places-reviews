Text: Totally flavorless food, will never go back here. Garlic bread didn't have any garlic, it was just a loaf of regular bread. Bruschetta had NO flavor whatsoever. We tried the roasted peppers wood fired pizza it was literally just dry crust with no sauce, barely any cheese and 3 pieces of green pepper and red pepper each. Moreover, we could just taste individual things instead of a bit of pizza, and those individual things didn't taste good either. At the end of the meal, we felt like we just stuffed ourselves with flavorless bread. Service was great though. Our server was really sweet and when we asked about the garlic-less garlic bread, she immediately took it back and brought another one, but that was only slightly better. Well, we just wasted $35 on bread we had at home already..

Text: I was not impressed.  I paid $25 (tip included?) for a 9" pizza.  The crust tasted dry and basic.  Maybe it was frozen factory made.  The toppings were sparse.  Double cheese was barely any.  Pomodori's is a craft pizza place but most of their menu pizzas are vegetarian and I really like meat.  I did order meat but there were not enough toppings for me.  I just did not like it.  The service was fast but at 11am I was the only one there.  Alexis B. was an excellent server.
