Pesto's Italian Restaurant & Catering

Text: Ordered basic spaghetti with marinara sauce. A side salad was included, which was a nice mixture of tender greens with homemade dresding,. A complimentary half loaf of bread with balsamic dipping sauce was included. Even though it was close to kitchen closing time, the spaghetti was cooked just right. The marinara sauce was fresh and well seasoned. Service was prompt and non-obtrusive.
