Text: This place totally sucks. First off it doesn't match and the walls are falling off but that didn't even matter to me until after the waitress said it was a 15 min wait which was cool. What wasn't cool is that we sat and watched 2 people leave as 2 other people without reservations came in and were seated within seconds. I walked out because that was rude as can be. No thanks, rusty dog is waaaayyyy better.

Text: Came for a couple beers and food. Went with the scotch eggs which I'm glad I did.  They're one of my favorite dishes and am very glad we have them available in Huntington! Had an ipa and a blonde ale. I'll be back weekly for the eggs and order a steak next time.

Text: Terrible service.  Our  waitress was rude and talked over us. She also lied when asked drink sizes. The food was ok. I had a chicken sandwich that was watery and not that flavorful. My husband said his food was good though. Not a good experience. The waitress ruined date night!  Oh and we got served our appetizer with no silverware! We asked for some and got it 10 min later, so now our appetizer was cold..
