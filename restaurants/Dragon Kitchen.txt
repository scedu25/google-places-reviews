Text: Should have taken the advice of the reviews. A friend, my husband, and I visited this past Sunday around 7pm. What food was left was luke-warm, or even cold. Some of the deserts needed to be refreshed as they had been out, uncovered, for some time. I felt bad taking a full serving of anything as I was afraid I would take the last of it. Of the three of us, we all had very different items and each of s were disappointed.

We were starving, so we stayed, but I regret it, as my stomach was upset later that night. We will not visit again.
