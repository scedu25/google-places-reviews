Big Larry's Burgers

Text: Their burgers are incredible, and the shakes are amazing, but the fries are very dry. You will also often find yourself face-to-face with about 4 flies if you eat in. I would much prefer ordering for to-go. This place also has a drive-thru, making it a good grab n' go place. Overall, it's 89% good. Another point I would like to make is that it is currently a little bit small, but with the right funds they could expand to another location. There is usually no one in the building on weekdays, except for Friday and rush hour. This place is closed on Sundays, however. So come during Saturday or before. There is only one in the world and this is the one, so if you want to eat here you are going to have to come to this very specific location. Great job, guys!

Text: This was my second visit here. I decided to try to pork fritter meal which included fresh cut fries and a drink. The pork was fresh and hot and had a good flavor to it. The fries tasted good, but only warm, and not hot. Still good, I just have a pet peeve on not getting hot fries.  On the positive side, you certainly won't leave feeling short changed on the portion of fires. They give you way more than you should eat...but I ate them all anyway. The ketchup is kept in a refrigerator in the dining area, so it is kept cold. Unfortunately, it is either and off brand or is watered down, so it distracts from the quality of their fries.

It looks like a small restaurant from the outside, but it does have a fair amount of seating inside and plenty of parking is available. I will certainly return again and look forward to trying their burger next time.

Text: I give the service five stars. They were very friendly. Food is ok. Nothing that I would ever crave enough to drive all the way to Valley Center for.

Text: Good food and service. The portions are more than equal to the cost.

Text: Really good cheeseburgers amd fries. Little bit on the pricu size but I'd but it again and again. They make up for the price on their quality of cheeseburgers and atmosphere. Local and family friendly type dining. Worth it any time.
