Text: We had their specials. I had Ocean Trout and She had sirloin steak. Both meals were outstanding. Desserts were excellent. Had maple walnut pie with ice cream and coconut cream pie. Service was excellent and very friendly.

Text: We love Sandstone Grill! We had to come up from Oklahoma to finalize on our house. Lunch before heading home HAD to be here! The 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich, cup of soup for $12 is perfect before hitting the road. The wait  staff is still top of the line.
