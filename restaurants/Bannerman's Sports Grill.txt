Bannerman's Sports Grill
Rating: 4
Text: Great place to watch sports and entertainment. Friendly service and good price on beer. Cover charge for big fight nights and live music, But not outrageous. Games help past the time waiting for food or events to start. I approve of this venue, and will be back soon.

Text: Large bar, decent pizza, ample seating and tables. Plenty of other distractions if you're not into whatever game is on. Prices are decent and the staff is helpful. I would return to bannerman's sometime in the future.
