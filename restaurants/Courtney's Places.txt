Text: What a diamond in the rough!  In the middle of nowhere Kansas comes this restaurant with delicious food, delightful ambiance, and professional waitstaff.  And on weekends she has locals provide dining music.  It may seem a bit pricey, but it's not a fast food restaurant.  This is a special occasion place.  And make sure to save room for dessert!!
