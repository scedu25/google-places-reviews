Text: We went Sunday when they have all you can eat catfish. The catfish is wonderful, I would definitely go back for it! Very friendly waiter. Side salad was also really good. First time here. Tuesday is all you can eat ribs!

Text: Took forever to be seated when they were not at all busy. When we finally did get a seat our drink order came 15 minutes after we ordered them. We were about to get up and walk out but the waiter offered free draft refills the rest of the time we were there so we stayed. The food was ok but nothing like it used to be. Was really disappointed, especially because I was raving to my friend how great it was and then when I took him the experience was awful. Needless to say I won't be back for a while and I don't think he enjoyed it at all to come back.

Text: At 6PM they were already out of the entree I ordered...but 2 minutes after I reordered,the other meals were served. I got my hamburger 5 minutes later and instead of a nice pub burger, I got a nicely grilled frozen burger patty.  What a disappointment.   By time our drinks wee hone and so was the waitres.  We ad to track her down to get the bill...this took about 15 minutes and then had to explainto her that since they wee out of the pullledpork sandwich, we shouldn't be charged for it.She didn't remember that.  15 minutes later we left...never to return.
