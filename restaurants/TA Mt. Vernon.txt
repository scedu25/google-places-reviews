Text: The level and lack thereof of knowledge boils over here. We stopped last night due to severe weather and when my husband went in this morning... Lets just say.. The progress made in the rest of the country will be arriving in hopefully the next 5 years.. Moronic behavior is nauseating and my stomach is currently sour.. TA before you grant a yokel town the blessing of the jobs and potential income for all... IQ test ought to be mandatory and a civil rights class should be apart of the hiring process... To further express the ignorance... A local asked my hub if he was the man on his shirt... He is wearing a Kobe Bryant Black Mamba shirt

Text: Don't buy the wraps. They are super soggy. I took the meat out and threw the rest away. I would have got chicken tenders if the 3 piece meal wasn't $9.
