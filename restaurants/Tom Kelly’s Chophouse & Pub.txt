Text: Was just there last night for dinner. Service and atmosphere was great. I really like the openness of the place. Cubs game was on! Food is ok. Second time in a row my baked potato was over cooked and my ribs were dryer than the Sahara Dessert. I'll keep going back but hopefully the quality of the meals gets better.

Text: The food is pretty good and i never get bad service. Tim is an excellent waiter and the owners there are there regularly and interact woth customers. If they bring back the Guiness burger i can give it 5 stars

Text: Waitressing was very pleasant. I come often with my relative as a nice lunch break. It may be tucked back, but I love it. Ive seen business meetings and family functions happen here. Very versatile and happy to serve people of all ages. Clean, irish-bar/restaurant setting with a fabulous menu of very well prepared cuisine. Sports or fanatsy football fans or those of the like would love it as well.

Text: I go to Tom Kelly's occasionally, often when going to the movie theater nearby.  The place is large with high ceilings which makes it less cozy for my tastes, but the food is good.  There are some unique appetizers and the entrees have always satisfied.  The service, in my experience, has ranged from average to good.  I will return.
