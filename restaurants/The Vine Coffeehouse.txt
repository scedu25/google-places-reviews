Text: This is a treasure in Ottumwa. The coffee and tea selection exceeded my expectations, but the quaint atmosphere and friendly service are what made me decide to curl up in a corner with my book for a bit while nibbling on a fresh sweetroll.
I do advise against bringing really small kiddos along. This is a popular place for the college crowd and there are often lots of students working quietly on laptops. Not a bad place for chit chat with a friend, though.
