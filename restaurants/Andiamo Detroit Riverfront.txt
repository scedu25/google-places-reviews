Text: Initially we had a delay in service... then Mgr Rick T came to the rescue! Rick provided us with amazing service... getting the kiddos in our group their meals in plenty of time for us to let the kids burn-off some after dinner energy before the evening session at our conference at the Renaissance Center. Rick went up & beyond to make our time really wonderful... & treated us to dessert. Our meal was truly delicious, portions were great & the outdoor seating along the river made the start of our evening refreshing! Thank you, Mgr Rick, for taking such great care of us! :)

Text: I’ve been here twice in last year for birthday parties. My first experience wasn’t great and the manager was accommodating. Our waiter or lack there of was over worked that night. Last night was my second visit and my last. The food had no seasoning or taste same as the previous time. The atmosphere is very nice however the food is subpar especially for the price.

Text: I recently hosted a Rehearsal Dinner at Andiamo Detroit Riverfront for 60 guests. I worked with their Event Planner, Andrea Mueller. Andrea was amazing to work with and totally engaged herself to ensure this event exceeded my expectations. We were seated in the far side of the restaurant which offered a spectacular view of the Detroit Riverfront and Canada. We added some of our own personal touches... it was beautiful! The variety of menu selections and Open House Bar was a perfect dinner option for our guests. The food was amazing and no one's glass went empty... For many of my guests, this was their first visit to Detroit. Everyone is still talking about how wonderful it was! Being the mother of groom, this was a very special night...my son said, "thanks mom...it was amazing!!!" Thank you again, Andrea Mueller, Alison Nowinski and the Andiamo staff for a job well done and for making this a most memorable evening for the Bride and Groom, our family and friends!!! I highly recommend Andiamo Detroit Riverfront!!!
