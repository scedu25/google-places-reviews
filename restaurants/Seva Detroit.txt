Text: Vegetarian options for all tastes and palates. Reasonably priced with a broad menu to choose from. Nice outdoor seating for the warmer months, and a great spacious atmosphere in either of the indoor seating areas. Happy hour drink and food specials. Nice proximity to all of Midtown and Downtown's attractions. Plus the Q-Line stops a block away!

Text: Love love love it here. Not always the fastest service, but always worth it. Happy hour is awesome and so is the general TSO style cauliflower. Love the fresh, quality ingredients and always changing specials menu! My go to veggie restaurant, I love Seva

Text: Fabulous food! Our service was a little slow, but I didn't mind as I was catching up with a friend. But a great place to check out if you're in the area.

Text: Great food, especially for a vegan place. The service does seem a bit better than thou, but it's probably due to me ordering an egg with my Pad Thai...

Great Pad Thai though... It didn't even need the egg. If I'd of known before I ordered, I could have flown under the radar. Maybe even get those vegan superpowers I keep hearing about.

Text: Really great food! All vegetarian with plenty of vegan options. Patio seating is great, though you may be bothered by bees, squirrels, or flies. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The staff seemed a bit stressed and overworked, though it didn't help that several groups of customers were abruptly moving tables and making persnickety requests. Wait time was a bit long, but the food was delicious once it arrived. The Seva Club is a mouthwatering sandwich, and the vegan Blue Moon ice cream from Ice Cream Plant is a fantastic way to end your meal!
