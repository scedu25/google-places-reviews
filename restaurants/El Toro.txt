Text: Service is great. Food is okay. Definitely mediocre as far as Mexican food goes. Prices are also fair. Seems to be the best bet in town for Mexican food.

Text: I eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants all around the state of Missouri. Most of them are pretty darn good and this one is also. What it has that some others do not have is a more varied menu. Also the staff didn't laugh at me too badly as I practiced my Spanish!

Text: One of the best places to get Mexican in the area!  I came in hearing good things about it, and decided to get a sampler and a  small margarita, pretty good way to gauge a Mexican restaurant. 

I didn't taste the alcohol at first, but it sure hit me later! They also have given us hot fresh tortilla chips,and the beef used wasn't greasy at all like some other places I've been. 

Great place to get some quality Mexican food and alcohol!
