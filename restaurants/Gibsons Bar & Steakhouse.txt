Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse
Rating: 2
Text: Honestly the $400 bill for my family of five (3 kids) and only two Captain and Cokes just didn’t seem worth it. Yes everything tasted good but not sure I see the $400 value. I would rate five stars but I didn’t experience anything special to make up for the price tag.

Text: A great place for a drink and some dinner. Beautiful steaks and seafood. There was a live pianist when we walked into the bar. However there were TV's in the bar that stole from the antiquity of the ambiance.

Text: Gibson's Oak Brook is one of the best, most reliable places for excellent steak, seafood and drinks outside Chicago.  The location in Chicago is even better! The staff does great and I've never been disappointed

Text: Went here for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Ambiance was great, food was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised at the options and price ranges available. You could come here for a special occasion or a burger for lunch. Will definitely be coming back. I got the filet with cajan blackened crust and mashed potatoes and it was fantasticly mouth watering.

Text: We have dined here a number of times for a weekend lunch, which has always been fantastic.  Weekend lunches are not too crowded.  The food has always been fantastic and the servers we have had have always been amazing.
