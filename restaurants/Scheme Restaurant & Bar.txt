Text: Let's face it, there are few places where you can find Great Pizza.  Well look no further, The SCHEME's "Dream Pizza" is the best Pizza out there!!! Well worth the wait, but I like to call in in advance and get the order going. See you all again soon!

Text: Best pizza in town hands down. I just wish they took debit/credit cards like every other business in the 21st century does. The atmosphere is nice, but the music is always way too loud. Staff is always friendly, and the overall experience is nice.

edit: I appreciate that you are music lovers, and I'm a music lover myself, but its a real problem when the music is so loud I can't hear the person next to me speak or what the waitress is saying.

Text: Out of this world yummy Dream Pizza! The service is excellent as well. Ambience of the establishment is top rate. If you get a chance and are lucky, have owner Duane tell you about his wall collections. Very interesting! We always come back when we are in the area. Thank you!

Text: Leftovers so good, you'll kick a roommates ass over them. Spend that money. It's worth it. Make sure you come early, and on a rare open day.
