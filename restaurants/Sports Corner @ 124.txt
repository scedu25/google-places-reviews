Text: Its food is pretty good and they have a decent selection of beer. They also have trivia on Tuesday nights, but it's a bunch of questions on paper, like when I was in school in the 80s. Quirky, but definitely small town.

Text: Well we got sat down in a reasonable amount of time. They were busy so I expected a little wait. Wait we did!! Our order was not taken for at least half an hour after we sat and they we did not even get our food for an hour and a half after we got there.  People next to us were there longer than us. When they started asking for there check for their drinks and I was ready to finally leave all of the sudden our food showed up!! The food seemed like it was going to be good but mine was under cooked. I would like to  give them another chance but very leary about it. It was awful loud also. We were not even offered a discount at all. Very disappointed

Text: Early afternoon on a Saturday is a great time to be here. The chef cooks some excellent grilled chicken and the wait staff is superb. The California club salad is great if you feel like eating light. If youwould like for yourself a quick afternoon buzz there are also plenty of drink specials.
