Text: My Fiancé and I passed by the establishment several times , so for My belated Birthday present we finally went.
We found the decorations and decor very clean and interesting.
Our serve was a lady that was very cordial ,well dressed and clean.
The Serve was great at taking our Order and got it right even though my date asked so many questions .
 The one thing we were the only People when came in and sat down we got our drinks with the cans in our glasses. 
   I know our serve was young but she didn’t come back to check on our drinks.
  I’d recommend the place to anyone. May have a lot of out of town people visit in Sept or March 2018.Thats the tentative months .
  Who knows we hold all the meals for the wedding.

Text: Great Breakfast !  Friendly staff.  Nice retired farmers drinking coffee and telling stories.  Open your ears and listen!  AND BARB the cook & baker.  We tried to coax her into the car to drive home with us.  But alas she prefers family & Verdigre.  Try her cinnamon rolls if they don't sell out.  And the bismarks are light and tender.  The pancakes were excellent as well as the typical 2 egg hashbrown sausage breakfast.  Go eat, go fishing or kayaking and then come back again. Worth the effort.  Inside is a Quonset Hut with a floor on the ceiling.  Look it up or ask your grandpa.
