Text: Fine place long hours for food in a very small town.  Longish walk from the marina but often about your only choice for food outside 9 to 5.  Always been easy to get in, over the decade I've come here on boat trips.  Pop is always weak.  Big variety menu.  Enough room to maneuver in wheelchair and tables to pull up to was s plus this time.

Text: the best bar in belle river, but the options are limited in that town. went there recently for dinner with my husband, the food seems to have been imporoved. my husband was happy with his burger, our poutines had actual cheese curds in them instead of shredded mozzarella which they used to use. the server was a bit off, had to remind her a few times for things that we had asked for, like a booster seat or our waters.
