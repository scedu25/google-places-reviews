Text: The food is good, great salad bar, great price! The rolls (which is what i go for), were hard and cold,  no one was eating them and when I asked for fresh ones I was told they would bring out more when those were gone!  She did go heat one up in the microwave. ....which made it hot and rubbery...oh well,  guess I didn't need them anyway. ..

Text: Nice quaint lil place to eat. Small buffet but really good food and well maintained. Large dinning area so i am guessing they get a lot of traffic. Very nice place!!
