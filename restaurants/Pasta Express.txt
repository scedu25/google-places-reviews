Text: Love their tortellini!!! I No longer miss The Pasta House Co. from St. Louis. They have the same tasting signature salad that made them famous down to the dinner rolls. PASTA EXPRESS has many more choices I can't wait to try. Next, I'm gonna order a few pizzas. They even have a drive thru!!!

Text: I have to tell you how much you they rock! Their service and product never let me down and I am so grateful for having them a part of some special events in our lives!
I know this seems crazy and a bit sappy, but it is true! They always deliver. I am happy to continue referring and using them for our catering needs!

Text: I had the mama's favorite and loved it. The waiter came back to check on us multiple times making me extremely happy. I will definitely eat here again.

Text: Food is always great, consistent quality. Service is usually good but sometimes they seem short staffed. Prices are good for the portions.
