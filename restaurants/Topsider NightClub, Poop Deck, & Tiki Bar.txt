Topsider NightClub, Poop Deck, & Tiki Bar
Rating: 1
Text: We were in the mood for some drinks and appetizers but due to the fact DogDays was so packed, we would have had to wait an hour - we thought we would give topsiders a chance. Big mistake. The drinks we ordered came out wrong regardless of the waiter's confirmation that they were right and the bartender "had been doing this for a few years". The 'supreme' nachos we ordered literally were Tostitos with Hormell chili, served on sterifoam plates, something you would expect to receive at an elementary school cafeteria. The waitress was stoned, so the service was slow as well...but I don't blame her; if I had to work there I would be high as a kite all day too. R.I.P. Topsiders

Text: Huge bar with live music and lots of space, but the bar service is not so great and there is no beer on tap.

Text: With a 10 dollar cover charge they still try to charge you to get a glass of water.
