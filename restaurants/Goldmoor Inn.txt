Goldmoor Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We have been to the Goldmoor Inn for dinner in the past and always have had a wonderful meal. We recently held my wife’s surprise birthday party there. We had a group of twelve. It was a huge success. We had a private room off the bar. The owners and staff were a big help in planning the event. The food and service was great. Everyone had a wonderful time.

Text: The Goldmoor Inn is an amazing place to relax and unwind, exactly what we were looking for in our 26th Anniversary get-a-way. We stayed in the English Country Cottage which had amazing views of the river and spectacular sunrises and sunsets. The screened in porch was the perfect place to sip coffee in the morning, listen to the wonderful sounds of nature and enjoy reconnecting with each other. Our delicious gourmet breakfast was delivered to our room each morning and every afternoon we came back to a clean room and fresh baked cookies. We chose their signature dish, the Beef Wellington, for dinner and it was one of the best meals we've ever had! The owners, Birgit and Slobo were very hospitable and made a point to meet us during our stay. Their entire staff made us feel welcomed every day! We would highly recommend staying here and we will definitely be back!

Text: We stayed in one of the cabins. My wife needed a break from her stressful work. She had a couple of days to get away. Very nice cabin perfect for a couple. The breakfast included is wonderful, muffins among the best anywhere. My wife ran each morning along the quiet country blacktop down to Chestnut resort. We loved Galena toured the U.S. Grant home, Elihu Washburne home, and Galena Historical Museum. Spent our time walking the downtown and choosing where we would have lunch. There are so many cafes, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc.the choice is a difficult one. Galena is about a 15 minute drive through the rolling country of scenic farm fields and woods from the Goldmoor Resort. Horseshoe Mound a county park, just east of Blackjack RD between Galena and the Goldmoor, is well worth the drive up its gravel drive, a great view. We had dinner at the Goldmoor Lodge one night. The food was excellent and the view overlooks river marshes of the Mississippi back waters. The windows face mostly to the west for sunsets. A great place for what we wanted in a two day vacation.
