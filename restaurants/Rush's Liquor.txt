Rush's Liquor

Text: The woman with the glasses who works there, usually around 5:00pm, I don't know her name, but she is incredibly nice and always has a smile. On the other hand, the man who I believe is the owner, Gary, I think his name is, can be quite rude. It doesn't give me the feeling of good customer service when he always tosses things back at me; the pen to sign the receipts, my own debit card, even the receipt he manages to toss. I don't think I'll go back in when he is working because that is unacceptable behavior from the OWNER of the establishment. Fix yourself.
