Text: This place has good food, but not sure if they are even opened anymore. Need to update their website to display ACCURATE hours. Disappointed to drive all the way out here to find it was closed.

Text: The absolute best catfish around!  They farm raise their own.  Try the "footballs", my favorite!

Text: Was surprised to discover it was open air with the temps being in the 90s at 7pm. Was more surprised that two full grown dogs were allowed to come and go as they pleased even flopping their noses onto the table to beg for food. The waitress never bothered to kick them out but actually stepped over them. They want $33 for a steak. After the slow service for our drinks (which were not correct) and the continued dog nose up my arm pit we decided to just leave. Never ate the food but after 5 minutes in the door I wasn't enticed to stick around and try it... or fight the dog for it.

Text: This place has the best smoked catfish I've ever eaten, and we specifically come back every year to have it again and get random cravings for it. Seriously, it's like all the best smells and tastes of camping rolled into one food. The servers are friendly too. My partner and I were signing in ASL and they struck up a conversation with us about sign language and we taught them a few things.
