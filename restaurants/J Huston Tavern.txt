Text: Fried chicken is fantastic! Mashed potatoes are delicious. The whole meal is a soul food fix and we enjoyed it. Great value compared to the other places in town. Don't trust the negative reviews. It's simple fare that tastes good at a decent price!

Text: The beauty of being in such an old building and in this historic town is truly wonderful!  That made our trip somewhat worth it since we came Wednesday July 13 2016 when the storm hit, and it hit hard!  All electricity went out of ALL the restaurants and shops!   What a scare.

We finished our meal but were very very disappointed; the waitress was very pleasant and that's a plus, but my cheeseburger was cold and the sweet potato fries were mushy.  Will not eat there again but, again, loved the ambience!

I've heard they have good fried chicken?  I don't know how good but, apparently, and if I do decide to eat there again, the other food choices are not.  The coffee was too weak and watered down, not fresh and robust.

Thank you for listening!

Text: Poor service, waitress was horrible and the manager had a bad attitude. Food was just ok, too many store  prepared items on the brunch.

Text: The food was mostly as described in in review B during our experience on June 10, 2016 except the corn was crisp and tasty. We enjoyed the meal, but it wasn't authentic southern style comfort food. Everything was from a can or box. There was no salad as mentioned in review B but there was a dry style cabbage slaw that was OK. They should just drop the ham from the fare if they can't do any better than that. The floors were newly polished and the whole restaurant was very clean. The wait staff was very nice. We may go back again, but with only one choice on the dinner menu, it isn't the type of restaurant where one eats every Saturday.
