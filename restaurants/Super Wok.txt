Text: The food was decent, nothing special. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the broccoli nearly chipped my tooth. The fried rice was just okay. Now, don't get me wrong, I get along with kids, but I was sitting there trying to have a nice meal with my mom, and they had the kids running all around the resturant. They where screaming, yelling, and had a really annoying and loud piano toy. The employees weren't doing a thing about it either. It is a resturant, not a babysitting facility. A complete joke in my opinion. Won't be back, and would not reccomend to anyone.
