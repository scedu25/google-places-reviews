Text: This has an amazing atmosphere you can not find anywhere else. It is the number one hangout place for me and my friends. They have great ice cream for a reasonable price and the turtle moca is my personal favorite.

Text: Perfect coffee place (plus ice cream).  Stopped in each morning on my way to training class.  A splendid dark roast and a nice morning walk.  Ideal!
