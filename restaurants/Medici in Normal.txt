Medici in Normal
Rating: 5
Text: Location / Atmosphere - Nice modern atmosphere in a 'hip' area of Normal. Check out the 'outdoor / rooftop' seating.  Very pleasant area which was perfect for an afternoon lunch.  Very clean and well managed.

Food / Beverage - Nice creative menu where everything sounds good.  Hats off to the chef.  I had the soup and sandwich combo with both the soup and sandwich of the day.  Loved the 'shoestring' fries.  Others in our group had the burger of the day which was a very creative with beef burger and pulled pork on a pretzel bun, the Margarita pizza which also looked good and the perfect size for a young growing boy and the Crab cake sandwich which was very good but could have used a little more sauce (comment from my picky wife).

Service - Very pleasant and attentive service.  It's always nice to be served by people who don't mind being at work and have a positive attitude.  A bit of a wait for a table (20 minutes) but nothing out of the ordinary for a Saturday at lunch time.

In summary - A very nice place.  I recommend visiting Medici's when in town.  Thanks for a great lunch...

Text: Our group of six was sat quickly at one of the taller bar tables. Our server Dan as well as others kept the food coming as well as drinks. The food was delicious. The sweet potato tater tots were fun and a different twist on the sweet tater. I would definitely do a return trip next time I am in the area.

Text: Delicious food and a great drink menu. Good prices and lots of options for everyone. Great gluten free menu as well. Cool atmosphere. I would suggest making a reservation on their website/Open Table on weekends because they do get busy.

Text: I ended up eating almost every dinner for the month I was assigned in Normal. Pretty interior design. Attentive staff. Good food. Reasonable prices. Upstairs outside patio. Full bar. Decent wines and lots of ever changing craft beer. Deserts are good but you have to ask for that menu.
