Text: The food was excellent.  Service was excellent, even though we had a large group.  My only complaint is the prices are high.... expect at least $50 per person.

Text: The food was REALLY good and the service was excellent. A great staff can make or break a restaurant and our waiter (Marcus) was top notch!
