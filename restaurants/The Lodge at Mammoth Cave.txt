The Lodge at Mammoth Cave
Rating: 3
Text: Stayed in one of the Historic cottages. They have an awesome vibe on the inside. However, the interior is old and dirty. These could be vintage and a must stay if they replaced the some of the wall decorations, repainted and kept the floors clean. So much potential. On a positive all the towels and bed were crisp and clean.

Text: We ate lunch at the lodge on Saturday, while the food was not bad it wasn't anything to get excited about. A lot of the tables seemed to be bussed by the waitresses and that made for lots of tables sitting with leftover food on them for a while. Having someone able to bus tables would have made the place seem a little nicer.

Text: Our lunch was tasty and the menu had quite a few wonderful options. The service was good as well. It was nice having a great restaurant right in the park.

Text: The restaurants and accessibility to Mammoth Cave were wonderful, no complaints there.  Where I don't give a full 5 stars is because of the room itself.  I chose to stay in the hotel itself because there was a room available and it was in my price range.  When I walked into the room, it was not according to what was advertised in the picture (which was dark wood headboard, desk, and drawers), I excused it as I figured they may have been in the middle of renovating, and this room was not complete yet.  Also, they room was very muggy and hot.  It sounded like the Ari conditioner was on, but the sound was the only thing you had to go on, unless you stood right over it.  Even when I adjusted it to make it as cold as it would allow me to go, it still did not elevate the humidity unless you were sleeping in the bed right next to the AC unit.

Then there was the doors.  It sounded like someone was consistently messing with either the door, the handle, or the lock.  I looked out the peep hole many times throughout both nights I stayed, and saw no one in the hall.  Either the rooms are haunted (which I am ok with), or there is an issue with the doors themselves.

There are only 4 rooms in the hotel itself, and they are all in the same small corridor.  With there being not that many, checkout being at 11, and check in at 3, I would like to think that all cleaning for 4 rooms could be complete by 3PM.  When I checked in, there were still trash bags in the hall, the next night, the cleaning crew was still working at 6 PM, and when I checked out, there were trash bags in the hall.

If I were to stay here again, I may try the Sunset Terrace with hopes for a better overnight experience.

Text: The Lodge at Mammoth Cave is great place to stay when visiting the national park. Our group of four was given a cabin with 6 beds, so we had more than enough room. Because the lodge is located in the middle of a national park, cell service was poor to nonexistent, but the visitor center provided free wifi. There was a small mouse in our cabin, but it didn't bother us and would be unlikely to be a problem so long as no one left food out for it. Overall the stay was very comfortable and the park very enjoyable.
