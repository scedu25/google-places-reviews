Text: This was my first time here. My neighbor brought me here as a Thank You for watching her cat. The service and food were excellent. I had the bacon, lettuce, and tomato pasta salad with a turkey, bacon, and melted Gouda sandwich on Brioche bread. I was too full for dessert. I now plan to bring my daughter next time. We need a day out.

Text: A wonderful birthday lunch with my mother.  Food & service was excellent.  My suprise was the value... pricing, selection, taste.  If I lived in the Clinton area, LaTeaDa would be a frequent treat!
