Garage Bar

Text: Ham and cheese (locally sourced) sampler platter with crusty Italian bread made for excellent appetizer. Nicely put together pepperoni pizza featuring house made pepperoni and other delicately balanced flavors on a super thin crust hot from the wood fired oven. Craft sodas. Great poppy seed cheese cake. Great service. No misses. Definite 5 for this kind of place.

Text: I've been to Garage Bar many times & I love the atmosphere. From ping-pong tables that light up at night (that's right, I said they light up at night!), To great brunch selections. Garage Bar is a great place to go at any point in the day!

Text: This is the first place I found in this town with local beer on tap. Great outdoor area with lit up ping pong tables, tons of casual seating, and an overall fun ambiance. I didn't order food, but the menu looked good too. I would definitely come here again!

Text: Cool vibe, great outdoor space, good beer and Bourbon.  Games are fun and make it a nice place to hang out for a while. We also ordered two salads and a pizza. Salads were great, and the pizza (potato & pancetta) was good but much too oily. I literally had oil running down my arms. Nice dough though, so the other pizzas are probably better.

Text: Super cool place with a solid beer list. The mixed drinks I've had there have been tasty,  too. The crowd here tends to be pretty low key and fun. I've always had a blast when going there
