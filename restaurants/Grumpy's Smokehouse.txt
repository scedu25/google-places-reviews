Text: Thought the prices were fair until I got my food...everything is tiny. You'll need two bbq sandwiches to equal one elsewhere.

Text: Great food every time!  Barbecue nachos were great with lots of toppings  Fridays all u can eat fish is good too. They have very reasonably priced drinks and pour generously!  One of our go to spots in Marion.  If you want an out of the ordinary great steak , stop by on Saturday night. That's the only night of the week they serve steak but we'll worth the money

Text: We have been to Grumpys multiple times. We enjoy the atmosphere and food.  We were there on Friday, June 9, 2017 and ready to eat. We showed up at 8:25 pm and the doors were locked. The establishment 
was to be opened until 9:00pm(according to the door hours). There were waitresses in there cleaning and never came to the door. We were very upset. I'm sorry but you have lost future customers.

Text: The food was good,  even though they brought me the wrong steak.  Salad was fair, but lacked the extra dressing I asked for.  I did not appreciate the automatic. 18% tip added to our bill, since service was lacking.  As I said, the food was good.
