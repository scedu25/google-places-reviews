Text: Very nice restaurant with patio to overview the River. Great beers selection  and food. The food is very tasty and their portions are huge even for appetizers. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended place.

Text: Not truly bad, but definitely tailored to a specific palette as the name implies. For those of you looking for beers, sausages, and authentic German inspired food, this is your place. For those who need diverse options for a group or for picky/specific eating needs, this is not the best choice for you. Service here is good and beers are served properly. Bier Stube also offers great river views seasonally - both indoors or out.

Text: Atmosphere,  price, food, cleanliness and service were all good. Not really set up for accommodating toddler seating as the tables are all raised and they literally stack three high chairs to get toddlers to table height seating.  They also have very limited outside seating with views of the Mississippi River.  We were not lucky enough tho be able to sit outside.  ? Definitely worth a visit.

Text: Great place, great food and an even greater selection of beer. I can highly recommend the Schnitzelsandwich with a Koenig Ludwig Weissbier.
