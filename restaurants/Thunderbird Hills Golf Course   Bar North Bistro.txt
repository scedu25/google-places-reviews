Text: This place has really gone downhill. This used to be my favorite restaurant in the area, but the food quality has really suffered, as well as the staff.

Text: Terrible experience here at the "legendary" Thunderbird.  The man working the front area where you pay was very rude, and did not try to help our situation.  Also very poor food quality, would NOT recommend!
