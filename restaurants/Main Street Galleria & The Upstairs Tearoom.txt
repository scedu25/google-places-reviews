Text: I went in to the store for the first time and  ordered a lavender infused lemonade.  Gal at the counter was very nice and helpful.   Then I bought a piece of fudge from another gal and she was helpful too.

Not sure why the one reviewer gave such bad feedback.

Text: Server stood there bitching about the customers where everyone could hear. Server was slow to come and take order, bbq brisket came on a walmart bun not a kaiser roll like menu advertised, they forgot to make my wife's meal. Lavender lemonade was good that's about it

Text: Weston is a good tourist town that has everything you'd expect. But here at this drug store soda fountain and fudge shop, you'll be able to get something that you can't find anywhere near here and is worth stopping in for. That's their homemade pies that have all the country taste you look for in Missouri baked goods. The last piece we got was the delicious chocolate cream with lots of chocolate and not so much sugar making it like a thick custard. Of course there's ice cream, phophates, and even lavender infused lemonade. It's a must try.
