Text: For what you get, the food is terribly overpriced. I ordered boneless wings ($5) and received 6 tiny pieces of chicken that were mostly crunchy breading. Won't be ordering from here again..

Text: We decided to try Chix as it was nearby, had a decent reputation and delivers. I ordered three meals, two combos and a rack of ribs and was told delivery would take roughly 30 minutes. An hour and 20 minutes later we still hadn't gotten food or even a phone call. I called back and was given the excuse that they were "busy" and the food would be delivered "soon". 

Ten minutes after my call and an hour and a half after we ordered, food finally showed up. Delivered in cheap plastic bags, nothing labeled, no napkins, salt & pepper packets, paper plates or plastic flatware. The food (unsurprisingly) was cold, the fries soggy, and the boneless wings sitting in a disgusting pool of oil. 

There was no flavor on the wings to speak of, and a tiny amount of coleslaw. If I could give zero stars I would. In the time it took to get this cold, unappetizing flavorless food I could have driven across town, ordered and eaten dinner at another restaurant and driven back. Complete waste of time and money.

Text: I had the Loaded Wedges Combo. The wedges were delicious and my Hot boneless wings were very good though not hot,  which was ok by me.  The server was very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed and keeping our glasses full. Can't wait to visit again.
