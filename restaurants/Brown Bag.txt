Text: while the food was okay... I have to say the interior is horrible.  I don't think the booths have seen a good cleaning in years. I think the seats have seen all kinds of pop and kids feet on them for years.  There was all kind of food and wrappers under the booth at the front where I sat, and it was only 11:30 and they open at 11:00.  Some of the booths were not cleaned of crumbs especially between the seat and the backs.  It really needs to be shut down for a few days and the dirty brown carpet replaced, a good cleaning and painting would greatly help this place.  The outside is not inviting at all, dark and the windows could stand a good cleaning.  Just not what I would think a eatery should be like.  So judge for yourself, but I am not impressed.  Hope the back where they fix the food is better than the front end. I went there only because everyone really thinks this is a good place to eat.
