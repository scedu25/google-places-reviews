Text: Greeted and seated right away. Had a limited menu for Memorial Day, but the food was good! Draft beer seemed a little on the warm side, but was tasty anyway. Cute atmosphere. Would definitely come back!

Text: Beers are great and service is friendly and fast. I tried the Bollywood Blonde and it was darker and spicier than I expected, but was very tasty. Nice trendy atmosphere!

Text: Had a flight if local beers with some new friends.  Some good beers, also a nice little patio to enjoy the weather.  There is also a little gift stop if one is interested to get some souvenirs.
