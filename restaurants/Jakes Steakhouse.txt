Text: The worst restaurant experience I've ever had. The waitress was rude and forgetful. Asked to have my steak cooked medium and when it was brought out it was raw in the middle and still bloody.  Sent it back and still came back raw in middle. Manager argued that is considered medium. Boyfriend asked to have his steak cooked medium rare and his was Cooked to medium. Manager did deduct money from bill. Will never return there.

Text: Waitress was very rude while restaurant was not busy. Employees eating fries and (double) dipping them in ranch in the kitchen while on duty. My friend ordered all you can eat wings and I had 2 to taste and waitress tried charging us for 2 all you can eat wings or said my friend could not have more of the all you can eat wings.

Text: The staff was very rude when we called to reserve for a larger group. We were treated like they didn't want us there and kept getting glares to leave once we were done eating!  This has been the same feel for several months as we have met there once a month! We we are going to switch to a different restaurant for our future get-togethers! I've worked in a restaurant in previous years and we would have gotten fired for acting this way! Our group gives good tips and pleasant to wait on! It is Ridiculous!

Text: Our group of 16 people hit Jakes at 11 am 10/15/17. All of us were very impressed with the food and service at the Sunday Brunch. This place is a "keeper".
