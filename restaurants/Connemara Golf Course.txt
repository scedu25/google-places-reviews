Connemara Golf Course
Rating: 3
Text: Beautifully laid out and challenging. Very fast greens! For first-timers, it can be a bit confusing. They could use more signage on the course and also yard markers. The clover was rather high for a Saturday afternoon and didn't see any grounds keepers anywhere. It was $38/person with a cart. Thought that was high for the offering. Still the nicest course around but I may not return again soon.

Text: Very nice course. A little expensive but it's high quality and well taken care of. Great course, range, putting area, and saloon. Staff is very friendly, good location as well. Nicest place I've been to in town.

Text: The course was in excellent condition.  I used to play this course a lot, but now I can't believe how much they've improved it.

Text: Great layout for everyday player.  Cart paths are in need of repair and somebtee boxes are rough, but this course is on its way up!
