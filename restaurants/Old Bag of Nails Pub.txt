Text: My burger was way under done with all the toppings I didn’t want. The bun was completely soaked and gross. My fries were completely covered in salt to the point of wear I couldn’t eat them. While my friends wrap was completely cold and covered in barbecue sauce to wear they didn’t want it ether. Will not be coming back.

Text: There food was great fast and hot when everything  hit the table. My daughter  was hungry  and I was  extremely happy when they got her good out as fast as they did. Yes we had to wait a little bit longer for our food but it was worth it when it got there and it was not much longer after she got her food over all it's a good place to eat. As for our server she was fabulous.

Text: Food is hit or miss. Sometimes it is really great, sometimes...not so much. Unfortunately, it is the same with the wait staff. Some are excellent, some not so much. Ordered unlimited soup and salad and it took fifteen minutes to get anything and was finished with first salad and soup for about fifteen minutes before the waitress ever came back again. Definitely not ok. I like the food when it is good, otherwise, I would have given a lower rating. A little pricey, considering the service and hit-or-miss quality of food.

Text: Had the fish sandwich with a side of steamed broccoli! It was absolutely delicious.  Service was polite and fast, and the whole place had a very cool atmosphere. There is an indoor and outdoor bar, which I thought was quite unique.

Text: Lots of good choices, my burger was really good. Seemed like it took a little longer to get our food than it should have. But overall, it was very good and I would go there again.
