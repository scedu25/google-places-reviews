Text: Taste of Thai is a diamond on the rough.  The food is fantastic, as is the service.  The owner of this restaurant has a hands on approach.  He can be seen cooking, serving, running the cash register, cleaning tables, and just about everything he expects from his employees.  He leads by example, and is always smiling and friendly.  If you like Thai and Chinese food, don't miss a Taste of Thai!

Text: I went to taste of thai for food and found a fly and maggots in it. And one worker got mad and was very rude they are wrong and they know it. And I'm sick and one of the workers who was very rude name is phong. The girl was not trying to give me her name what's so ever. But health department will be there. They would not give me a refund but tried to give me something else out there kitchen.
