Text: I had a brisket sandwich, my sister had catfish, & our friend had a burger. All were great! Friendly service, well worth stopping on our way through town.

Text: Easily the best tenderloin in the state. It was meaty juicy fried heaven. Prices are fair. But portions are great. You get what you pay for. Service was fast and friendly. Also you might get to listen to a lady talk about nothing the entire time. You don't have to listen no one at her table was either.

Text: Dont know how the food is, we sat for 10 minutes while the waitress was cashing people out. When she was finished she walked straight to a couple, that hadn't even got in their seats, with menus. She was asking them what they would like to drink as we walked out. I guess the good reviews you read here are from locals.

Text: Friendly fast service! My wife had the cheese burger and I had the tenderloin sandwich. Both were excellent, possibly the best we've had. Definately adding this to the list of places to stop and visit again on my next trip through the area.

Text: Very small and cozy... Not much food to pick from though. Food was good but could have been better.
