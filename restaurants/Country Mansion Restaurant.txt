Text: The food was okay.  Had prime rib med rare, 3 fried shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes, and green beans.  The prime rib was dry, a little tough and flavorless.  The mashed potatoes had no garlic flavor, and tasted like they'd been refrigerated and took on other flavors of the fridge.  The saddest part was how run down the place has become.  Weeds, rogue trees, and overgrown plants.  It looks like a grounds keeper got lost somewhere in the mess, and they haven't found the body.  They are letting the old garage fall apart.  You can't even get to it anymore.  A historical landmark going down the tubes.

Text: Nice place for a wedding reception, short staff of servers for 200+ guest, didn't like that my plate was tossed on to the table towards me.

Text: As always, the Sunday Lunch Buffet was delicious!!!  We have eaten at Country Mansion for several decades and will continue to do so because of the friendly management, staff and food.  =)
