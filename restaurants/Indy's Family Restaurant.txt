Text: I come here pretty much every other day if not every day because it is so good. The food is amazing, the staff is amazing, and its not even expensive. They have great quality food that is hard to find these days. I recommend this restaurant for anybody, any age.

Text: The food was fantastic, and the price seemed almost low for the great quality of food I got. The food comes with two sides AND a soup or salad. The cream of broccoli soup was addictive, and so were their green beans! The waitresses were extremely friendly, and made me feel at home.

I chose to eat from the breakfast menu, wich has something for everyone, none the less my eggs were cooked perfect (medium well). I left feeling very satisfied knowing I had just gained some good friends and a exceptional place to eat...

Text: Food was excellent.  Happy to see they have an actual seniors menu. Their fried zucchini is the better than Red Robin.
