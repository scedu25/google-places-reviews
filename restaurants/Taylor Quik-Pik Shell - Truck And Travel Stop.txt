Text: Never stopping here again! If the ladies aren't rude then they are talking your ear off and won't just let you get what you need and go. Or they will ignore you. I've sat at the registers with the item I want to purchase and they don't even acknowledge me or ring me up this is the last time I'm dealing with that.

Text: Small gravel truck parking lot, but I can usually find a spot. Pretty good store. Restaurant is open until 8pm and there's an Arby's and a McDonald's next door, and a Penny's Dinner within walking distance.
