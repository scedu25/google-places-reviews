Kreso's Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I had dinner here last night and it was outstanding!!!  After a long day of traveling we just happened to find this restaurant and decided to try it.  The food was very tasty - salad cold and crisp and the Wiener Schnitchel was wonderful.  My husband enjoyed his goulash.  Great European food and atmosphere.  Service was good and our waitress was very friendly - also enjoyed the story of how this family restaurant was started.  We enjoyed our dinner tremendously and will definitely return when we travel this way again. Highly recommend.

Text: Having never been to Bardstown, KY, I looked on Google & saw that Kreso's was rated highly for it's food. I decided to try it this Monday evening about 7:30. It was a bad decision on my part. I was told by a white haired woman, the owner, I presume, they were very busy & only had 2 people waiting tables, if I wanted to wait, she would seat me, but they were full. Rather off putting for someone whose never been here. Maybe Kreso's doesn't cater to out of town visitors, at least on Monday nights. If I ever find myself in Bardstown overnight again, Kreso's won't be on my list to dine in.

Text: Not sure these people know how to run a kitchen. It's Saturday night and they are understaffed, running around, and everything is taking forever. Can't tell you how the food tastes, yet. 

Update: Food arrived 70 mins after ordering. Waitress claimed they are slammed and had to fit us in. I'd say it's about 50% full, so if they had to fit us in, that wasn't clear. I think I'd rather not be sat than wait 70 minutes after my order. Food wasn't really good and is overpriced. Sad face :(

Text: The food in this restaurant was absolutely spectacular. I have never had such great European /Bosnian / German food. The owner was just wonderful and treated us like family. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.

Text: Top 3 worst restaurant experiences of all time. Rude, condescending, slow service, wouldn't provide itemized bill (felt we were overcharged for two items), and the charcuterie plate we ordered? Luncheon meat from the deli. Our son who's grown up on charcuterie plates... 'This tastes like bologna.' Definitely don't recommend.
