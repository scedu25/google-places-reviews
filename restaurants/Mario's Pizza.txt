Text: This place is horrible! Went in with my family and waited for 20 mins for someone to take our order. They were not busy at all, and the lady with brown hair and glasses at the counter was very rude when I went to ask her if someone could take our order.

Text: I love this place. I love the blooming onion and the loaded cheese fries, they are my favorite. They have great food. I never really eat the buffet. The menu food is awesome though. Worth stopping to eat.

Text: "The lunch buffet was kind of pitiful. All that was on it was undercooked pizza and over cooked pasta. Al dente was hours ago. Pizza was average if you're taking about frozen pizza left out all night. I've seen better salad bars at elementary. For sixteen bucks for two, you should get better." - My Uncle David

Text: Only reason I'm giving it a star is because you have to. The owner is very rude, he will literally argue with you if your order is not right. The cheesy fry's are not even cooked they heat them up in the MICROWAVE! I used to love this place but it's went down hill. It's extremely high now and you don't hardly get any food anymore. And the food has been GROSS the last 2 times I ate there. They have lost my business after Ive puked my guts up over eating there nasty uncooked Fry's!

Text: Great pizza and pasta Buffet with salad and they'll make any pizza you want on the buffet. The menu food is very good as well although it's a little slow coming out. Definitely worth a visit.
