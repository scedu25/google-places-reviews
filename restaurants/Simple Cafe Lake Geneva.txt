Simple Cafe Lake Geneva

Text: We hosted a private event (rehearsal dinner for our wedding) at Simple and could not be happier.  The food is just so thoughtfully and deliciously made with farm-to-table ingredients; people are still buzzing about the food....and those desserts!!  Shannon was so easy and comforting to work with, and her staff were so kind, quick, and attentive to everything.  Thank you Shannon and Simple!  Highly recommended!!

Text: WOW! Unusual menu, good food but meat, meat, meat. Only 1 fish option (salmon),  but great variety from blueberry pancakes to omelettes to wraps with fresh ingredients. No problem with custom orders - leave the kale out, sauce on the side, extra cheese, etc. Bakery on the other side of cafe is small but with excellent treats & breads to tempt the strictest dieter.  Again, all fresh wholesome but yummy ingredients. A must for visitors to Lake Geneva.

Text: The best breakfast around the area. Great service. Food is amazing and seasonal to make sure your getting as much local grown as possible. Bakery next store is also very good.

Text: awful food. and overall very bad staff, Being from Chicago I thought this place would be good... But its not and its suppose to be the " best" breakfast in town as i heard when i moved in town not that long ago. I seen workers smoking in the back of the store. very unsanitary..! I have eaten here multiple times and gotten sick as well. And apparently I am not the only one! haha Gross!   DO Not Recommend! (1/5) Would give  0 if possible.
