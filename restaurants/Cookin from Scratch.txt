Text: Signs all over the restaurant says best fried chicken. So I ordered the pan fried chicken. Wasn't even close, the skin was soggy, I was expecting crunchy. Tasted nasty. The waitress was outstanding, real good service. Too good to be serving that mess they called fried chicken. Go another 20 miles and get the Chester's Chicken at the truck stop.

Text: Oh my Goodness that was some of the best food ever. I was beyond impressed. It was right off the highway the Food was excellent the service was great. And it was nice to be traveling and get a taste of some homemade meal like from home. That needs to come to Kalamazoo Michigan. It would be the best seller. And i truly Loved the store.

Text: The server was so funny. She had us laughing before we got our food, and after that she let us eat but checked on us for refills. The food was great, and came out faster than we expected. Overall a wonderful experience.

Text: Food was great! Kicking myself for not getting the bottomless fried fish, but the ribeye steak sandwich was delicious! Server was very attentive and did a great job. Glad we stopped here!

Text: There's nothing like real home cooking... makes me remember when I was a kid. My mom made chicken just like this. Fresh tasty food with a home like atmosphere. The staff is friendly... can't say enough about this place. Stop and enjoy. It'll bring back memories for sure.
