Text: Had the prime rib which was a bit overly peppered.
The fries were undercooked.
One bite into the prime rib had me sold on a 4 star rating. It was delicious. 
The meat was tender and juicy, and the bread was grilled but not burnt or charred.
These people know how to cook.

I also got my food rather quickly.
