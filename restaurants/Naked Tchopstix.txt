Text: Husband and I went here for a date night and it was just absolutely amazing. It was my first time trying sea urchin, something I've been wanting to try forever but is usually sold out, and the sushi chef not only delivered but personally made sure it was fresh and delicious and boy did he deliver. Absolutely amazing young gentleman who stopped by our table on his way out to see how our food was and thank us for coming. 

The rest of the staff was just as polite and accommodating, answering questions and always there when needed. The rest of the food was just as amazing as my sea urchin was. 

Seriously, best dining experience I've had in a very long time. Don't pass them up if you interested, and seriously give them a taste if you're out that way and hungry. 

Amazing. 5/5. Will return very soon.

Text: I am a Black Card member at my local sushi place in Fair Oaks, Ca; meaning I have spent more than $10k, so I know my sushi.  Naked T-chopsticks is AWESOME! Who would have thought I would find fresh sushi in Fort Wayne, IN...  the service is incredible and the chef customized my entire dinner for me. This is incredible!
