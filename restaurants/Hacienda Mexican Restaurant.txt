Hacienda Mexican Restaurant

Text: Always good food, good service, and reasonable prices.  They also offer carry out. Have always gotten our orders correct.  Love the cheese soup! If you like salsa with a bit of heat, onions, and a touch of garlic, ask your server to bring the green salsa as well as the milder red they bring automatically.  I like both.  But have to switch back and forth so the heat doesn't get too much for me.  They do not charge extra to provide the green with the red.  Makes a nice change.  They are also kid friendly.

Text: Hacienda is always great!  I've grown up eating at this local Indiana chain and still continue to love the food, experience, and the great frozen margaritas!  If you've never been to a Hacienda, do yourself a favor and get a strawberry margarita!  Love it!

Text: It was a new place for us visiting in Kokomo, Indiana....service quick and friendly! The food presentation great and the food good. The price factor...say about $$...not like some but it's not a taco bell....worth a visit and taste for yourself. My rating A++

Text: My experience on Thursday evening wasn't so good. Our waitress was great but two of the managers were not. One manager brought out food gave the couple next to us their food but just left ours on the tray. Other manager ask everyone around us if their food was ok and skipped right over us. We were seated at the bar. Won't be going back there anymore!!!

Text: The last 3 times have been awful!  Steak was too salty the first time, food cold and poor service the second time, and this this time the food took forever . The only saving grace this time Shey. She is always awesome and takes great care of her tables!
