Text: Love this place. The food is fresh and made to order.  They have daily lunch specials and a self-serve condiment/Kim chi bar for when you order Korean food. It's really hard to find Jahm Pong in the United States and they have it!

Text: I came here as a suggestion by a co-worker. Now it is kind of like "my place," where I go for a quiet tasty dinner. Love the Korean menu.

Text: Terrible service. I ordered a simple steamed rice and soup. After 15 minutes they had served to other people and I walked out

Text: Bulgogi tastes exactly like the bulgogi I had in Korea, delicious. Definitely worth a shot.

Text: Great little hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurant. They also have plenty of Americanized Chinese food dishes for your friends who are afraid to try real Korean food.
