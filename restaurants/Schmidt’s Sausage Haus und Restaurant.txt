Schmidt’s Sausage Haus und Restaurant

Text: GET IN MY BELLY!!!  Pretty much sums it up for me.  I have been eating at Schmidt's since the 70's and 80's when my parents would go there to eat.  Anytime I'm in Columbus I always try to make time for a meal at Schmidt's.  Authentic German food- the real deal.  Great Schmidt's dark beer on tap too.  Oh, and don't forget to get a jumbo cream puff for desert! Go with vanilla when you order a cream puff.

Text: My waitress Lauren was so nice. She triple checked a food allergy for me as it's been a few years since I've eaten here. I got the pretzels they were really good. And then I got the sausage sampled which was good.. the chunky applesauce is really good not to sweet.

Text: Delicious sausages! Wonderfully fun atmosphere! Delicious beer! The whole package! They even have German lessons in the bathroom (the men's at least)!! I learned how to say, "Momma always said life was like a box of chocolates; you never know what ya gonna get." And, "Here's looking at you, kid." And, "I'll be back," in German while peeing! :D

Text: Food and waitress was great, however we waited a pretty long time before being seated.  It did not appear to be entirely busy, and they wouldn't seat 7 people because the other 5 were going to be 20 minutes late.  That would have been fine, but after the 5 arrived it took another 30 minutes to be seated.  The waiting area was unusually hot compared to the rest of the restaurant, and 3 people ended up leaving before getting seated.  We will eat there again, just hope this isn't the norm.

Text: We really enjoyed this fun authentic restaurant. The food was good. The pastries they are known for speak for themselves. They were not over powering in flavor and done well. Would enjoy visiting this establishment again if I'm in the area. Also, I loved that it was family owned and operated. It's nice to visit a place that stays true to it's heritage.
