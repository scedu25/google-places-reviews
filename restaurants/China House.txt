Text: They have really good Chinese food...but recently prices have gone up and portion sizes have decreased a lot! You use to be able to get an egg roll & crab Rangoon but now you only have a option to pick one.

This is a terrible restaurant. I ordered teriyaki chicken with fried rice. It cost $1 more for fried rice. No problem. 
The rice was literally white rice with soy sauce on it. We asked if that was fried rice? Yep. The teriyaki chicken was vinegar flavored boiled chicken in a nasty sauce. $10 wasted on lunch and a drink. I left my plate in the table. Didn't bother asking for money back. 
I will never eat there again!!!
