Text: Service was good. Pizza taco was weird. Was basically a taco with chunks of sausage. Didn't taste like a pizza. And 7 dollars for a small taco is a bit much.

Text: The food is overpriced For What Little you get. Silverware had spots, and was needing replaced. Place needed a thorough dusting.(Couldn't tell if I was in Rick's Cafe)Chairs were sticky. Wait staff looked as they would of rather had you walk back out the door. All in all stay home.

Text: Pizza Tacos are the best! Great service and burgers as well...not too broad of a menu and you only can get chips with your burgers but all in all, good choice!
