Text: Some of the best Mexican food around. Usually very busy and understaffed, if you need something tell them right away because you may not see the waiter again. I don't have problems with it because I love the food too much and am a regular customer. New people may have issues in the begining.

Text: Very expensive and not a lot of food. I got Carnitas, they tasted extremely dry. Water couldn't even resurrect this meal. I am very unsatisfied with this establishment. My advice for customers is to stay away!
