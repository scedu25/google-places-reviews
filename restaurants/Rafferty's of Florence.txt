Text: Great food. Wonderful atmosphere. Service was acceptable and the wait for dinner was not overly long. I had the dinner duo with Cajun butter pork chop and buffalo chicken tenders with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Each of these items was fantastic. Anyone would be mistaken to miss out on the honey nutty butter croissants! Seriously decadent and totally delicious.

Text: Fantastic meal for the price! One of the best medium rare sirloin steaks I’ve ever had!  Perfectly cooked, hot coming out, expertly served!  Speedy too. I’ll be back

Text: We sat outside by the fire pit.  The weather was perfect and the fire was a nice touch for a quiet peaceful meal with friends.  We all enjoyed our meals and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  We will be back again.

Text: I wanted to like this place. The staff was amazing! It is probably the most welcoming place we have ever ate at in Florence. But the food was not good. I could eat it but I did not like it at all. For what we were paying I was hoping it would be much more flavorful. There was also not a good amount to eat. Some people may like that but I did not want to pay for extra sides. A good entree for me is at least two good sides. Not a family accommodating place.We had to eat there in order to figure that out for ourselves. Tables are tight so we were pretty uncomfortable trying to get around especially the high chair. Kids did not like the food either but they loved the staff! Thought they were hilarious and nice.. Although this is a great place for friends, co workers, and date nights I still think it is over priced even with different company.

Text: Great food, great service by Dan! My Prime Rib was delicious, as we're my Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Salad. Was seated right away, and was treated with respect since I was dining alone, bc my wife is in the hospital and having surgery on Monday, so I  decided to stop in and try to releave the stress of worrying about my wife's health! When she's released from the hospital, I  plan on bringing her in for dinner and drinks. Please thank Dan for being so kind and thoughtful! Sincerely, Thomas Schwartz.
