Text: Best wings in Louisville.  Service is friendly.  Lots of new TVs and two big projectors.  Obviously a big Bills place.  Highly recommended.

Text: Stopped in for lunch. I ordered a chicken cordon blue, got it in a timely manner. The chicken was either raw or absolutely putrid. Still feeling nauseous 7 hours later.

Text: Great place...great food....reminds me of Cheers! Certified angus beef. Original new york buffalo wings. Blue cheese sauce is the best. And they just upgraded all of their tvs!

Text: My family and I tried Rootie's for the first time this evening, and for the most part we enjoyed our experience. The food was pretty decent and the atmosphere was very laid back. We had a few issues: first, my fiance was brought the wrong sandwich. The waitress was quick to take care of it and it was not a problem. Second,  we waited for our food a little longer than we expected for only seeing a few other patrons. Third, I was charged for a soft drink when all I had was a water, but again no big deal. 

What really caught us off guard was the final bill. For three sandwiches, two soft drinks (3 counting the one we didn't ask for)  and an appetizer, it was almost $70 (including the tip). Looking over the bill, we noticed that they had added  $2.29 per sandwich because we substituted curly fries for regular fries. On the menu curly fries are listed as only being $.50 more than regular fries, so when we got the bill we were definitely taken by surprise. We wish it had been a little more clear on the substitution fee. 

Overall, the food was good, but not $70 good. We won't be back which is too bad because we've been looking for a neighborhood grill.
