Pazzo's Pizza Pub
Rating: 5
Text: Last time I was here was 2 years ago. I came back today and it lived up to its expectations. The food was amazing (Pazzos Pretzels, Pepperoni Pizza, and BBQ Spicy Buffalo wings) The tomato sauce can be a little overwhelming but it really doesn’t ruin anything. Our server was amazing as well (I don’t know her name, she was a pretty young lady with black hair). 10/10 would recommend (get the pink lemonade it’s just better here I don’t know why)

Text: I showed up with a large group close to closing and was given top notch service with incredible pizza. This is not typical in this type of restaurant. The pizza dough really sets Pazzo’s apart and now their service continues to distinguish them. I’ll be back. Also, get the breakfast pizza. It’ll blow your mind.

Text: Ordered pizza online for pickup.  Showed up about 10 minutes after it was suppose to be ready.  I was notified by host it was not ready cause it burned.  Another 15 minutes and I got pizza.  No apology from mgt or accommodation offered.  To top it off, order was wrong.  Disappointed to say the least!!

Text: Fun pub in a great location right next to campus.  It's an easy walk from campus but they do have free parking for their patrons around back.  Pizzas come on a hand-tossed/thin style crust and they have several other foods available.  They usually have lunch specials where you can get a large slice with or without a drink for $5 or $6.

Text: Got the traditional chicken wings with 5 star chinese sauce, not the greatest taste I tell ya. It was all soaked up in honey paste. I was still hungry afterwards!
