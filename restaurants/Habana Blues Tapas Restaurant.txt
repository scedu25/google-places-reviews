Habana Blues Tapas Restaurant

Text: Absolutely well worth the drive from Louisville. We have eaten here many times and everything we have ordered has been absolutely delicious. We eat out very seldom and we are very picky about the quality of food we consume. The quality, taste and value for the money is tops! The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating!

Text: Horrible service... understaffed.. not efficient... I walked in and had to use the men's facilities and was told immediately I couldnt... but they never asked if i was a patron... I wanted something to eat but since I was told no I couldn't use the men's facilities I left .. all he had to do was ask if I was dining but no one was at the front to greet me and I had to search for someone to talk to.. and they were rude.. I'll never eat at this place...

Text: OMG! THE LAMB CHOPS! So literally everything I put in my mouth made my soul shine. Not to mention the ambience is calming intimate and beautiful. I went during the day and we were the only people there. I feel like people in Louisville have no idea that this gem exists. While it is extremely similar to Havana Rumba, the food has a few other options.
