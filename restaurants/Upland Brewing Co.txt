Text: Upland caters to all walk of life.  If you are a local or just passing through Upland will gladly serve you.  They also have the best food out of any brewery.  Their burger is to die for!

Text: Honestly can't match this place. In terms of the balance in great beer and amazing food and atmosphere, its unbeatable in Bloomington. I've had everything from business dinners to Sunday football beers with the boys here, perfect for any occasion. Get the Mac n Cheese too, it's unreal.

Text: Such an amazing food selection, the spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had and I am an aficionado. Also please please try the horseradish poppyseed sauce. I asked my server if he recommended the pizza, and he said no, and I ordered the pizza anyway. It sucked. Honest staff with good intention.
