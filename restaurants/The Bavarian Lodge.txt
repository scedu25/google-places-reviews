The Bavarian Lodge

Text: About 250 beers on the menu. Has wonderful German and European food. I had the pork shank, which is like 3.5 pounds of bone in pork goodness. Crispy.  Wonderful. The menu description warns diners that the size and appearance of the bone-in pork shank could be alarming. I say, delicious. Get it.

Text: I could go on and on...but it would be quicker just to recommend you go here.  From food to service to decor, it's a wonderful dining experience.

  I can really appreciate this place nowadays.  In an era when restaurant speak the right words.  Saying things like farm to fork, organic,etc,etc.  So many of these places don't have proper technique.  It's nice to see the Bavarian Lodge is doing things right.

Text: Great food, good beer. Awesome kids and veggie options. 
Downsides - the food is all pretty heavy, the lights are always dim, and it's really loud.
Overall, it's a nice destination, just not a good option for intimate meals.
