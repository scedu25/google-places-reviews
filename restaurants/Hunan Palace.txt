Text: High Quality Chinese Cuisine with quality ingredients. A rare find in the Asian food category. The Moo Shoo Pork (with Plum Sauce) is out of this world delicious. Kids can interact and cook their own appetizer by ordering the "poo poo tray". Clean and well cared for dinning room. One of, if not the best Asian Dinning Sioux City currently has to offer. Well done!

Text: Really good sauce on fresh tasting vegetables and shrimp. It was so good I ordered some to go for the inevitable 15 minute hunger resurgence after Chinese food. The staff is also very friendly and fast. This is my new favorite Chinese food place in Sioux City.

Text: I like it, very fast getting the food done. My second to go to place for Chinese. I just don't like how they have the sauces in open jars on the table for anyone to stick there fingers in. A friend said they found a band aide in one onetime. yuck. I usually get chicken and more often than not it tastes a bit off to verring degrees, sometimes dry, and occasionally the wanton soup tastes watered down. My mom loves the tofu. That's a safe bet. The staff are nice and never had an issue that wasn't fixed. So other than those few bad points, its pretty good and a lot better than the other cheep Chinese places around town and for a nice sit down place, there very affordable.

Text: Probably the best place in Sioux City to get Chinese food.  Delicious and the prices are fair.  It is a sit-down restaurant but service is still pretty quick (if you're having a quick lunch date with your best friend, for instance!) ?
