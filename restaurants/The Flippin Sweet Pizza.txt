The Flippin Sweet Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Actually some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. They do only get local stuff so they may not have all the options available. Interesting beer selection. Staff was nice, cooks are right there which is interesting to watch. Cool setup since it's in a garage. I highly recommend this pizza. Will not forget how good it was.

Text: Fries were so stale. When I let staff know they replied "yeah they're under heating lamps that don't keep food warm. Your total is $51+"
I paid $51+ For stale food and mediocre staff. I would leave this review on flippin sweet burger joint.. unfortunately it isn't on google. Staff also let me know that it's run by the same people and the two locations will be joint in the near future. I will try this place again when I can afford to waste my money

Text: Best crust with taste of the wood fired oven.  So many specialty pies!  Quirky atmosphere.  Unique and tasty!

Text: The service was impeccable, Barbie was very kind, quick with our drinks and knowledgeable about the menu. Also the food was fresh, delicious and flavorful. The salad was the "Best" salad I've had at a pizza place. I would suggest trying it!
