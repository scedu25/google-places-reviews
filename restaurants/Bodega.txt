Text: More of a bar than a restaurant per se, but they have solidly good food and the beer is decently priced. Great atmosphere that is not remotely intimidating and seems to be welcome to all kinds of people. Definitely a place where I feel comfortable and have fun while drinking and stuffing my face. Extra points for the elephant disco ball.
