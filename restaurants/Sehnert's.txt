Sehnert's

Text: Everything you're looking for in a coffee shop/gourmet sandwich place. Sehnerts is thee local hangout, meeting place and community center during daylight hours. Their donut selection is vast and each is better than the last. The Apple Planter is a must but you can't make a bad decision for lunch.

Text: Matt Sehnert and the Sehnert family have been a part of the reason the town of McCook is so vibrant for over 60 years. This family is part of the history of McCook and they will also be part of McCook's future. Go to Sehnert's and have a sandwich on fresh baked bread or try a donut with friends, the food and atmosphere will bring you back again and again.
