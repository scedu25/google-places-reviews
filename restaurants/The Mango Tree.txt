The Mango Tree

Text: Nice quiet restaurant with amazing food! The fried cheese is light like a pastry jist the way the cheese on a stick used to be at Cedar Point in the 90s. I prefer the flat iron steak here. Everything is excellent here! Finish with the mango creme brule. A great place to take a date for sure, but they also have an excellent kids menu. Highly recommended. Our favorite part is that even on a Saturday night they can accommodate our party no matter the size with little to no wait instead of waiting 2 hours at Texas Roadhouse for a meal not quite as good.
