The Over/Under Bar & Grill
Rating: 4
Text: Not your typical greasy, bar food there's plenty of selection for just snacks or sandwiches and salads. But you are coming here for the beer! Plenty of craft selections. There's a variety of seating from bar, high tops, table as well as great outside patio in nice weather and a tucked away chair and couch lounge area. You will be surrounded by TVs so if you're looking for an atmosphere and someone in your party needs to watch a game try this place.

Text: I haven’t had anything here I didn’t like. The Gorgonzola fries are especially good. Service is quick and servers are fast and friendly. They have some pretty interesting mixed drinks too.

Text: Good food, good service, live music was good but loud. Everyone was friendly. Bartender acknowledged us as soon as we came in. Seated in a few minutes. Drinks were quick. Menu isn't massive but plenty of good options. For keto eaters, good Cobb salad.

Text: This is a great place to stop by for drinks and to watch the game. Lots of TVs for you to catch the action. Great craft beer selection. Service was fantastic. Would have been a five star rating but food was average at best.

Text: Probably my favorite sports bar downtown St. Louis. The bartenders are nice, great food and consistent service.
