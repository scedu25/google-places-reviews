Text: This was my first time there. I ordered "The Reuben". IT WAS AWESOME.  I was a little hesitant at first because it was on pita bread (which was cooked on the flat top at the same time). But damn it is awesome. The only thing I could say is that I could've used just a bit more 1000 island or Russian dressing, other than that 100% awesome.

Text: Portions were big, so it helped with value for the cost. Open kitchen, which is a plus. Food was pretty good. Customer service needs work. Worker who took the money seemed bored. At least she smiled when we walked up and delivered our food to us.

Text: Just went in here and the manager was making a scene in front of everyone while raising his voice to his younger employee. The girl was in tears. Shame on you!! Young lady if you want a great job, friendly environment, and good money please come to Maxs Thunder Road. When I went back in to say something the manager started making excuses as to why that behavior was ok....not under any circumstances was that ok!!! Take a shower and learn not to be a douche bag to your employees!!!

Text: I have yet to eat here as I believe the employees preparing you food should have hairnets or hats, pants not tiny little shorts that could pass as underware and closed toe shoes not flip flops.
