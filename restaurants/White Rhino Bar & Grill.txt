Text: The Chipotle Chicken Penne was incredibly spicy hot. The Mango BBQ Pork Chops were also very spicy hot. The bar drinks were perfect. The bread was wonderful. Cream of broccoli soup was delicious.

Text: I went here a few times. Great place to just get away for a little while and have a drink or two.  I was even comed a drink because they were so busy they had run out of the dish I had ordered. It also helps that I was by myself and the bar tenders made sure I was kept safe. It made this single gal remember them when it came to tips. Looking forward to going back soon. :)
