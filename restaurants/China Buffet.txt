Text: We will NEVER eat here again. The food is ok-ish but fairly bland and gooey AND the service SUCKS! In a 1/2 full restaurant, my husband was literally berated by one of the employees about how much food he took and how much he didn't eat. A lot of what he put on his plate didn't taste good and was mushy. She was just plain rude in every possible way. 
I don't know who she was but we have eaten here occasionally over the 10 years we have lived in the area and have never been treated with such disrespect before and we refuse to be treated in the same manner again. 
IF I COULD GIVE A ZERO RATING, I WOULD.

Text: Highly recommend this place. Both time I went, I got great service and the food was delicious (I ordered from the takeout menu twice). Would have eaten here more, but I was only in town for a brief time. The second time, I forgot to get my change from the manager after paying, and he quite literally ran out the door after me to deliver a nickel to me. To me, that shows a special level of customer service.

Text: The dishes just kept coming out.  Nice and hot and the three of us in our party tried a wide range of food.  Everything was delicious.

I drive through Kansas about twice a month I'm gonna put this down as one of my favorites.
