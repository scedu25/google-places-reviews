Hedman Vineyards

Text: We visited Hedman's during a weekend on the Wine Trail. The staff member providing the tasting was very friendly and provided a lot of information on the property and the journey of the owners. We paired our tasting with the appetizer cheese tray (which included salami, fruit and olives as well) and had a great experience. The peach wine is unique to this property- they were sold out of one variety, but the peach dessert wine was very good.

Text: What can I say about Hedmans the best winery and restaurant in southern Illinois. I am from the Chicago area and review many fine dining restaurants and nothing can compare with the quality and consistency of  Hedman's beautifully prepared food. I have had many great meals on the menu, but by far my favorite is the beef tenderloin. It is lovingly and exquisitely prepared with a béarnaise sauce that you will not find anywhere. The food is so good that it brings tears to my eyes. Gerd and Anders Hedman are fabulous chefs. There attention to detail and service is exceptional! Rhonda their hostess is so attentive and welcoming--she makes you feel like family. I have always had a great meal at Hedmans and I look forward each time I am in southern Illinois to visit this lovely vineyard and café. This is a 5 star establishment!! Thank you for all that you do and providing such a wonderful experience. Southern Illinois is so lucky to have you!  Debbie D

Text: Great scenic place. Food is awesome and owners are very friendly. Mr. Hedman saw my fiance and me playing chess and he came over to talk to us and even told us the history of the game. Bartender was great also. I would recomend this place to anyone

Text: This is an absolute hidden treasure.  I cannot believe we found this little winery.  From the greeting at the wine tasting with Olivia, to the incredible menu in the cafe, we were just blown away.  We almost passed up the winery as it was near the end of our day, but we're so glad we decided to visit.  We stayed for dinner which each of us ordered something different and our whole party wanted to try each other's meals.  There are no words to describe the simple elegance of the winery, the incredible variety and diverse flavors in our meals, and the humble hospitality of the owners and staff.  We are telling everyone about this place and hope that if you're reading this, you make this a definite stop on your wine tour.  We will be back!!!

Text: Hedman Vineyards is a professional and enjoyable stop on the Southern Illinois wine trail. I helped a group of SIUC students with a website for the vineyard in 2014.
