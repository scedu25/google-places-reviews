Mr Bills Bar & Grill
Rating: 5
Text: Satisfied 99% of the time. Can't get any better than that for food anywhere. Friday evening fish is very good. Fried chicken is awesome. Won't get any better livers and gizzards anywhere. Beer is always ice cold. Waitresses are all friendly and very good. Always smiling. Gotta try Mr. Bills.

Text: So went in for a drink and got chewed for not leaving a tip earlier that day. Then demanding your tip that is rude and uncalled for.
