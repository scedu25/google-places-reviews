Text: Good food, got moved from one table to another to accommodate a large group. Should have offered free appetizer or dessert. But still good

Text: Everything we tried was fantastic. So flavorful and fresh!  Alligator,  shrimp, catfish,  blackened ribeye,  gumbo, 2-fay - sho'am good tastin'!  Even the coffee was great. Waitresses friendly. Service good. It is out where Jesus left his sandals, but worth the drive. Lines form outside before it opens...20+ people last Sunday before noon opening.
