Text: This was our 3rd time eating here.. Usually I would have given this a 5 star.. But tonight I was a bit disappointed. The gentleman that was running  the register was confused about something with something the couple before us need and asked a young lady for help.. To which she rolled her eyes and then said she would. She then took over the register and when taking our order began rushing through taking our order. I ordered my main dish and when I started to ask for a side dish she did not give me the chance before asking my husband what he wanted. She at least had noticed I was wanting to order something more and asked me if there was something more I needed after his order was done. After ordering and we were seated my husband instantly had his side dish but I had to wait for mine. He then was served his main dish and my side arrived at the same time but then my main dish arrived right after. Poor timing? Yes. I know will be back since normally food is wonderful and served appropriately.

Text: My favorite place to grab quick Asian cuisine.  I've ordered the Pei Wei spicy every time I've come and have never regretted it!  The restaurant is clean, staff is very friendly, and the orders get sent quickly.  Definitely a place I recommend!

Text: Good food but more expensive than expected for the "food court" type atmosphere.
