Blumenhof Winery
Rating: 5
Text: We stumbled onto this winery driving up 94 Highway through 'wine country' on our way to St. Louis. It's a quaint and inviting winery, and the staff (Linda, in particular) were very helpful and friendly. We visited several along the way, and this was by far our favorite. And, yes, the wines were very good. We particularly like the Vignoles.

Text: Lived this beautiful and super friendly winery!   Beautiful patio area.  Our server was super nice and engaging.  We bought bottles at this stop! 2 wines we called sin in a glass.  Can you guess which ones?  Stop, you will be glad you did.

Text: Great experience. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, great wine selection. Had a great time with the music and friends. Good parking for the size of the winery. Bring cash too. Small eatery. Call ahead.

Text: Great wines; the music the times we've been hasn't been overbearing or excessive.
