Text: Came down from Kansas City, MO for business and had dinner for the first time. BEST. MEXICAN. EVER. Tasted just like homemade - this will forever be a favorite. The staff was so friendly, and we even got to meet the new manager during our visit. 

Our wonderful server was very considerate of our meal alterations (due to allergies) and was very attentive. She also gave fantastic recommendations of what was offered.

There's a huge selection on the menu, so there will always be something new to try; however, margaritas were  necessary at Las Margaritas. They use fresh limes for the flavor and that just made a world of difference. 

During our next trip out to Garden City, we will be coming back!
