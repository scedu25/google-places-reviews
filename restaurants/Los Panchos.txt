Text: We stopped by for dinner on the way back from Holiday World.  We had an awesome waiter, Mario, who was very attentive and got our order out quickly.  The food was great, I got a BBQ pork burrito which was absolutely amazing.  The decor inside the building is a little dated but don't let that fool you, the food is great.

Text: Several members of our group ordered the specials that were ground beef based. When the food arrived, the beef looked, smelled and had the consistency of wet dog food. It looked and smelled unappetizing. It was a waste of money because most people in my group couldn't finish it. My meal was okay.

Text: The service was quick and great. Very attentive without hovering. Food was awesome, out of all the mexican resturants we have visited this one is by far the best.
