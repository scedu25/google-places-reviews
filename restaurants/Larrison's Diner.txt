Text: This place is very good and of course no Place doesn’t have faults. This place had a couple of issues.

1. The omelet we ordered wasn’t cooked throughly, the eggs were runny.
2. The waitress didn’t communicate or visit the table often
3. I didn’t get my toast, and the toast we did get was OLD bread, hard and stale.
4. Hash browns aren’t fresh, they’re frozen patties

Outside of those four issues this place was excellent for breakfast. The prices were reasonable and the food (which was cooked) was great. 

We will be back!

Text: When I was on 3rd I would come here for breakfast at least once a week! I love the employees and I LOVE the food! I highly suggest paying a visit! 
P.S. Try the fired potatoes with melted mozzarella cheese and hot sauce...yumm!

Text: We've been here twice and both times the food was great but the time to get the food after it was ordered was extremely long. Great place to eat if you have time.

Text: The worst you could ever say is that they get crowded often, but that's just a sign of how good they are.  Great food and service.
