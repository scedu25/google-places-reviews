Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I stay here at least once per year for a night away and have done so for years. We had intended to do the same last night but our young daughter became suddenly ill. My husband called the Marriott well past our check-in time to see if there was any way they would allow us to change the reservation to another night. They were very kind and allowed us to cancel at no charge given the circumstances. We are very grateful for their customer service and are planning to reschedule for the next few weeks. Marriott definitely has a loyal customer in us for the service we were given.

Text: The Rooms are nice. The bed was very comfortable. The Lobby is dated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The bar/restaurant was under construction and its stand in left a lot to be desired. The hotel is in Downtown Detroit and is walking distance to Greek town, Ford Field, Comerica Park.

Text: I do applaud the front desk crew for handling 753 Marines in for Marine week at the beginning of my stay as well as the conference check ins I was there for. I am a Rewards member and choose to be green on the housekeeping. I reuse towels and make my bed. With a longer stay like this was, they are still supposed to come in and clean every 3rd day. They never did this. There were no can liners for me to put my trash in and put outside the door. I did see the housekeeping cart on the floor and heard them cleaning other non-green rooms every day. I would have been happy with simple trash pulls and a replenishment of toiletries. Certain areas had great service and others not so much.

Text: The room was nice with a decent view. Pretty well maintained and overall OK. The valet is a complete s*** show, I mean these people are rude and incompetent. I've always wanted to stay at this hotel because of the views it offers (and I was not disappointed with that) but if you're going to stay here, park elsewhere! You have no choice but to valet here and its a mess. 

One of the big benefits though is the ability to walk down to the first floor and eat at the food court or walk right down to the river walk. That's a huge plus!
