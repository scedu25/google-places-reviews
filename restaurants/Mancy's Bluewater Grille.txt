Text: We enjoyed an excellent meal and pleasant atmosphere.  Waitress was very attentive.  Chef is inflexible regarding a requested alteration that seemed a simple exchange.

Text: Came here with family from out of town. They travel the country and said the seafood is as good as it is on the coast. I had the steak and it was as tender and juicy as could be and the cocktails were very well priced and tasted great. I will be coming back soon

Text: Glad we ate there and proud of a successful locally owned business.  Wish lighting was no so dark and froze during dinner, felt like a meat locker.   Food was good, steak was average.  Could not understand why water was so chlorinated.  Such a restaurant should have an RO filter.

Text: Food was excellent. Ambient us very nice. Would give 5*, but 2 things need to solve: the much too loud fan in the kitchen and the water tastes strong for chlorine. If they have problems with the water they need filters or canned water.

Text: Like the atmosphere here! Nice staff too and food is pretty good. A little pricey but that is to be expected.
