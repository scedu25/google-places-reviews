Text: I usually get fried shrimp and they give you plenty. The chicken is all pretty good though especially the tenders. They could give you more fries but it is what it is.

Text: My favorite place for some fried chicken! I think it's the "secret" seasoning that makes it so delicious! Just wish they had the seasoning to sell to customers .. I hear it's available in Grand Rapids!? Price is right for the serving size :)
