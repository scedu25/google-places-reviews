Text: I had the tortellini and it was wow! Only drawback was it had been bought, not scratch but the sauce was scratch and fantastic. my salad was fresh and packed w cheese. Clean and comfortable. Will definately go back.

Text: Not a big fan of pizza in general but their lasagna, calzones, and salad dressing are amazing and my husband loves their hot wings! I would recommend taking home as their seating is limited and the service can be hit or miss. They are usually pretty busy though so I would call ahead and as with any restaurant make sure you double check your order before you leave. *They do orders for parties too!

Text: The food is good but not good enough to make up for how little they give you and how much they charge.
