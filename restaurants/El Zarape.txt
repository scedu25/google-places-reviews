Text: One of the best Mexican food choices, defiantly a local favorite!  Staff is always kind and attentive.

Text: I personally don't like the food. Cheese dip is fine but it needs to be an Abby dip to be good (beans added to cheese). Family loves the place, when grandparents visit guess where we go? Which of course leads to me awkwardly sitting there watching everyone eat since they don't know how to put any sauce on enchiladas, or make rice that's seasoned properly. But family enjoys it so. . .

Text: Me and my two coworkers, were so disappointed with the food it was terrible. Are tostadas were soggy, the enchiladas and burritos were so hard. The horrachata didn’t even taste homemade. So disappointed.

Text: Personally I don't usually like restaurant Mexican food. I prefer homemade foods. I do like El Zerape! They give you a mountain of guacamole also.
