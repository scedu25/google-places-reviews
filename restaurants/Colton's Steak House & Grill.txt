Text: Amazing dinner. Good food portions. I am very happy with the food and service. We had a guy server and he was so nice. His name starts with a C or K, he was like in the range of 25 with a beard. If you find him tell him he's great. Thanks for the good dinner guys!

Text: I love to come here! The atmosphere is quite nice too and I'm a sucker for the country music! The food is always delicious and I absolutely love their Pasta Alfredo. Their spinach artichoke dip is also amazing. The servers are super friendly and attentive. There's also usually no wait which is awesome! Great place to go with friends or family.

The Waitstaff was very good.
Food came out on time.
The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and catfish/grilled shrimp were done perfectly.
