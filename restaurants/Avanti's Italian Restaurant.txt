Avanti's Italian Restaurant

Text: Waiter was great!  We came on Homecoming night so the place was slammed. Our waiter was attentive and we never felt like we were waiting needlessly.  Food was good.  Had the standard fare of spaghetti and lasagna which were both tasty.  Best part is the garlic mozz bread.  YUM!

Text: Had our meal after funeral serves for the family. Room was VERY hot. Air had not been turned on. Told them we would have 50 to 70 people. Room and food set up for 50.  We had closer to 60 people for  eating. They told us we could sit in main dining room since room wasn't set up for 70.  Not only could we not all sit together, one waitress complained to 3 different co-workers about us sitting there. And pointing at us. Said someone was going to be "pissed" because we were there. We could hear AND see everything. The young person in charge came over to the table and we asked about the air and set up. She said they didn't think we would need more than 50 seats. And prepared food for 50. Was not concerned that the room was broiling hot! The waitress complaining about us came over and I told her they said we could sit here. Then I informed her "give the bill to me since I am the one paying". Tried to be sweet then. I guess the people taking care of the main room did great! The people where we were sitting were very RUDE and snotty will not recommend.

Text: My husband and I were very disappointed in our meal.  It was cold even after having it reserved. The people were nice and the service was good. We have the feeling that Avantis is serving frozen microwaved meals. Avantis in the seventies was very Good! What Happened?

Text: I love coming here. Lunch service is great, quick, and fair priced. You can't go wrong with the Gondola! A must stop place when in  Bloomington-Normal.
