Jefferson St. BBQ
Rating: 5
Text: Very good food. Great Saturday special, The Jefferson for $11, $2 off regular price. 2 meats and 2 sides. Large portions. The best jalapeno corn bread. $5 for 6 muffins, most definitely worth it. We had a very good, attentive waitress. First time eating there and she was helpful with our questions. Worth the 25 minute drive from Walton to Converse. I'm sure we will go back. 

They do take reservations, an I would recommend making one on the weekends. We went at 4:30 on a Saturday. They were just getting busy when we got there and there was people waiting for a table when we left an hour later. If you live in north central Indiana and looking for something new I would definitely recommend this place. It's family friendly and worth the drive.

Text: We have traveled around and tried BBQ restaurants in many different towns and states.  We live about an hour away from this restaurant and have now gotten hooked.  It is by far the number one BBQ we have been to.  Excellent brisket, pulled pork, ribs, baked beans and mac&cheese.  The Brisket is the best I've ever had.  We now try to get here at least one /month.
