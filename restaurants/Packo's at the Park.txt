Packo's at the Park
Rating: 5
Text: Better than front location. Food was great. However, I did not want to stand in line for 30  minutes and find a table. Prefer wait staff service. Packo's at the park had better service. Managed to show up for national hot dog day. Who knew. With purchase they had 5 cent hot dogs. Tasty, but could use more onion.

Text: Went for the family style and it was awesome. They had it last year at the holiday's as well and was looking forward to going back. Hot dogs, stuffed cabbage, chicken paprikash, potatoes and potato salad, plus all the fixings! Awesome, and our waitress Jen did fantastic! Kept our drinks full and plenty of food.

Text: If you come here and don't get at least 1 order of the fried pickles .... you are crazy! Best fried pickles I have ever had in my life. No joke. As well as some of the best Ranch dressing I have ever had and yes... I am a ranch addict. Get you a bowl of chili and some dogs to go with them! mmmmm best dog in the town.

Text: The food is pretty tasty and the portions are large. You could easily share one of their specials and even have left overs. The service was excellent and the historic feel of the place is there with all the images and signed buns.

Text: What can you say about an institution like Packos? Eating one of their dogs with a bowl of chili is a religious experience! Best local place in Toledo, hands down! 
It's a dog eat dog world my friend.
