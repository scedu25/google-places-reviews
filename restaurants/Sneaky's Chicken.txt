Sneaky's Chicken
Rating: 5
Text: Everything on the menu is delicious, staff is very helpful and treats you like family. We come here weekly and have yet to leave disappointed. Hard to find a restaurant that consistently pleases the whole family, but sneakys always does it

Text: Best chicken place in town!  A must if you live here or are just stopping by.  Not a fan of chicken? No problem, because their tenderloin sandwich ("Sneaky's  Pride") is one of the best.  Great local place with good prices and awesome service.

Text: Worth a visit. I thought the prices were good. I liked the cole slaw as it wasn't too sweet, but that was the reason another in our group did not like it. You can't get broasted potatoes, everywhere, so give them a try too. They're kind of like Americen fries.

Text: Service is great. Completely suggest the buffet because it's the best chicken in town!

Text: Great chicken! Sneaky's is a nice environment with wait staff who are always courteous & friendly. They treat customers like family, and that alone would keep me coming back for more, but the food also speaks for itself. I love their buffet M-F that runs from 11am-2pm. There's no reason to go home hungry!
