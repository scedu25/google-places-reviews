Text: First time we stopped.  Everything we ordered was very good except the calamari it was OK.  May seem a little pricey to some but the quality of the food was worth it.  The tastes reminded me of being in Europe.  Look forward to returning soon to try some different items on the mean.  Our server Samantha was wonderful in helping us decide what to try.

Text: Always a wonderful experience when I visit here.   The food is top notch.  Cozy and romantic, especially when they have live music.  A "must try" place, if you haven't visited here yet.

Text: Great service, selection of local craft beers. There are daily specials. Seafood and pasta are the main selections. Great for family or dining by yourself.

Text: Terrible service. We walked in and were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress took our order and disappeared.  Several other dinners arrived and she was off to other customers.  Everything we ordered was cold with the exception of the grilled chicken on my salad. 30 minutes later the bread basket we asked for still didn't arrive but my hisbands meal did, 5 minutes later still no sign of the bread or my salad. We walked out.....
