Fortune Palace Chinese Restaurant

Text: Really good food in every respect, but be sure to add 10-15 minutes to when they tell you your food will be ready--there is always a backup of red-in-the-face people who showed up on time and are awkwardly standing around still waiting. As the other reviews state, the atmosphere is quite subdued, almost feels like a doctor's waiting room. Good food though, the hassle is worth it!

Text: My favorite Chinese food in Lincoln!  Might be slightly higher priced than some Chinese places, but I think it's pretty reasonable overall.  Nice fast service except sometimes if you do a to-go order and they say 10 or 15 minutes, you still have to wait a few minutes when you arrive - but that's not the end of the world, just don't order if you're in a huge hurry.  The staff is friendly and the food is yummy!
