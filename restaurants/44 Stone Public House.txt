44 Stone Public House
Rating: 5
Text: Stopped into Columbia on a month long road trip and dinners out.  After we checked into our hotel we looked at reviews to local pubs/restaurants.  44 Stone looked good. We went there at 8:45 on a weekday.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent!  Started with a beer, had salad, cheese fritters, bread pudding and tea. WOW!  I wish this pub was in our home city.

Text: One of our favorite places for date night and family night. Unique food. Attentive staff. And amazing amount of craft beer. Pretty pricy but usually worth it.

Text: I love their food specially the grilled apple salad and the tikka masala soup. I visit this one lace very often but unfortunately I always encounter issues with the serving staff. My last visit the server i had was one of the worst. Apart from that only for the food I would give a five star.

Text: 44 Stone feels like a local secret. There is a related restaurant downtown that's likely now known by other people, but longtime Columbians remember that Stone is the Mothership. I have always had prompt and courteous service, and the food is consistently just mouth wateringly, eat-until-you-have-to-loosen-your-belt good. 44 Stone is an Irish gastropub, and first timers usually spend a little while looking dubious, with items like "mushy peas" and "rarebit" (for the record, these two dishes are my favorite), but ask questions and trust what the wait staff tell you, and you're in for a treat no matter what you order. This is a great placr for business or casual dining, and they also have a bar seating area with local brews on tap, plus an extensive wine list (and of course cocktails).
