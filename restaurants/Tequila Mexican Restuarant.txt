Text: Tequilas has the BEST margaritas, and the food tastes great!  HOWEVER, there is one thing that grosses me out .... ?They don't use deveined shrimp!!  It's messy trying to devein them at the table (and looks a little strange), so I usually get something different. I don't think it costs that much more to buy deveined shrimp!  ?
