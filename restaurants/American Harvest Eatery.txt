Text: The breakfast salad is incredible.
I sat down for a late lunch at a very wide open bar space unsure what to expect. When I started eating the breakfast salad with potatoes, bacon, egg and vinaigrette I became a very happy person.
The salad is slightly unique in appearance with crispy potato pieces and hidden bacon but it's the sauce that really stole the show.
The sauce was applied in perfect consistency and a great combination with the other ingredients.
Great food, great service.

Text: Had lunch here on the way to Chicago.  I ate the Breakfast Salad.  I am thinking about duplicating it at home.  Service was good, thank you Nate!  Lots of good selections.

Text: What a find....underrated by most. Food is creative, well executed, and is always served with absolute attention to detail. If people like me (from Chicago were great eateries are easy to find) are weary of travel to certain areas because of the lack of perfect spots to eat...this is It for central Illinois! Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and despite its strip mall location  (although I've found many a hot spot in a strip) it's has an inviting atmosphere. GO!
