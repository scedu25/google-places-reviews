Text: The atmosphere was GREAT! Service decent!  The band, amazing! The food could have been more flavorful but it still pleased the palate!  I LOVE key lime pie and I wasn't impressed enough to order dessert!

Text: Very nice restaurant with good menu. Wish they enforced more of a dress code. Hate to be wearing a suit jacket seated near people in sweatpants

Text: Food, atmosphere, service - all excellent. The booths are very comfortable. Gave 4 stars because I think the food is a little over priced.

Text: Excellent service!!!!! My wife and I were here with our 2 1/2 yr old.  We asked for the a flatbread with cheese only.   The Mgr came over, my every accommodation and brought out the flatbread within a few minutes.  This place always has great food and drinks.  However to go above and beyond this way was such a surprise.

Text: What is it with young hosts/ hostesses? First time dining at Redstone, go on Saturday about 5 pm. The place is at 25% occupancy and they take us to a small table right by the kitchen entrance and chicken rotisserie. Now there were an over abundance of nice booths in the main dining areas so why would you tuck us away in the back in the corner. Told the server who was gracious enough but we were never asked if we would like a different table. Food was very good but it should be for 2 people spending $60 each. Sorry but if an establishment fails to recognize it's own faults by treating customers to a table in no mans land when they are clearly not busy then they don't deserve our business. Train your people to be more customer oriented.
