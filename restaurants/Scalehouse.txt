Text: Small handy convienece store that meets the needs of any trucker.  Located directly across three street from Cargill. Make sure to call the pickup first to verify the load is ready!

Text: Large flat dirt for parking but its still bumpy in places.
Snacks and drinks are incredibly limited and They don't even have a real deli counter with roller food.
They have a shop but I didnt need to use it do I cant review it properly, but one of the shop workers stood outside until I laid back down in my bunk and couldn't see him, watching me through the window.
They say that the pizza hut delivers here but only after 4pm, but that's odd in and of itself and the two gentleman that were inside told me they didnt know why.
Overall its very quiet, clean and flat (like everywhere else in Nebraska), but I wouldn't spend any amount of extended time here.
