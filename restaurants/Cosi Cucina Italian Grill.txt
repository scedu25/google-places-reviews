Text: Excellent food, wide variety of menu options from wood fired pizza to steaks to salmon to pasta. Excellent service-so attentive to our family during the entire meal. Delicious food served hot . Cozy ambience makes it a great date or family night.

Text: Great as usual.  Been eating here since '95.  Highly recommend for a nice dinner out or for fine celebration.  The Ziti is a great choice and get the Cheesecake, you will not be disappointed.

Text: I was really looking forward to one of the pasta dishes but was informed that it was sold out. This was a Sunday night around 7:30 and the palace was about half full. The meal that I ended up getting was pretty decent. The bread was pretty good. For some reason the furnishings reminded me of an Asian restaurant. Overall it was a decent experience.

Text: This was our first visit here and it was for an early supper. We were very impressed with both the food and the service. More of a casual atmosphere which we enjoy.  We will definitely be going back!

Text: Excellent food and great service.  Our group of three all really enjoyed our dinner.  The fried ravioli for appetizers were some of the best I have ever had.  Really good.  Reasonable prices for some great food.
