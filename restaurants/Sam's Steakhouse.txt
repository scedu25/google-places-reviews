Sam's Steakhouse

Text: Worse steakhouse ever eaten.  Place was cold, food was cold, and not cooked to our order.  Waitresses were slow. Got our salad before drinks were even served.  And took there sweet time feeding all of us together.  Then automatically take tip out on our check.  Won't ever be there again.

Text: This is our favorite place for steak. Great service & we love cooking our own. Salad bar is always fresh. Great place.

Text: Wow where do I start.  The waitress was nowhere to be found. My steak was inedible. They don't have butter for the baked potato, just something that is titled 48% vegetable oil spread. It doesn't melt, just lays on top. The owner totally blamed me because I did not complain (to whom) and refused to take ANY money off.  The salad bar was OK. Just keep driving.

Text: Not appropriately staffed for the size of restaurant. Ordered a Rare NY strip and was served a well done steak. The waitress was curteous and apologetic and I hate making a fuss at a restaurant. The owner was cooking because I was informed the regular cook was out for medical reasons. Was never approached by management/ownership to apologize which is a first I've experienced at a dining facility. The only reasons for two instead of one stars is for the waitresses running around non-stop.  Vastly overpriced.

Text: A fine hometown roadside steakhouse. Had an 8 oz. New York strip, it was cooked to my order, service was fast and friendly. A good stop if you're on the road.
