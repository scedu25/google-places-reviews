Coffee Cup

Text: I really enjoy the food here. It's always been fresh and delicious every time that we have went. Weather it was for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It was always good. The place could be a little bigger, and use a remodel. But the food is always great and the waitresses were always attentive and friendly. I haven't had an issue yet in all the years that we have been coming here.

Text: Today was my first visit, and it was a pleasant surprise! My family and I went for dinner. The staff were inviting and nice. Our server, Jenny, was very attentive and kind. She checked on us often and left us feeling well looked after. The food was great, prices were very reasonable, and the menu offered a variety of foods. We will definitely be back!

Text: Very busy when we came in but we only waited a few minutes for a seat. Our waitress was nice and we received our food very quickly for a group of 5 during Sunday rush. Our meal was tasty and without errors, would definitely recommend.

Text: I've only had breakfast here and I like "mom and pop" diner food for breakfast. Skillet breakfasts are good. Wife gets omelettes and is disappointed with the generic cheese... if they used quality cheese it would make a big difference. I usually bring my own coffee... Service has been good most times we've been there.
