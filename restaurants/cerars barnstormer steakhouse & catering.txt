Text: A disappointment to say the least.  I lived in Monmouth for over 20 years and always had the highest regards for the Barnstormer restaurant.  Bernie had the concept down.  Ten of us went for a friends birthday this evening and it was such a let down.  It took us 2 1/2 hours for dinner.  The service was poor, the food was average and to top it off, not one of the 5 checks was correct when it was time to pay.  We won't be back.  Apparently we aren't the only ones who have seen the decline in quality.  It was graduation weekend at Monmouth College.  In the past, the Barnstormer would have been jam packed...there were plenty of empty tables.  Sad.

Text: Went with a small party of 15 people. Prices were fair, waiting staff was polite, but food quality was lacking.  Mainly just doneness of meat.  I'm giving it 1 star since they weren't even close to as requested. Well done burgers were very rare and rare steaks were well done.  Im not from the area but locals seemed to be very fond of the place, I just don't see it...

Text: Great food, service and atmosphere. I had the porterhouse pork chop and it was KILLER! Crabcake appetizers were also excellent. We loved it!
