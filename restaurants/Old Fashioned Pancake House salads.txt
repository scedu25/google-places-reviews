Old Fashioned Pancake House salads

Text: I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. The food is always good, service depends on the time of day you go. If you're coming for Sunday brunch, expect a bit of a wait to be seated and served. The menu is extensive for breakfast and supper.

Text: This place used to be great, but it's gone down in quality over the years. My family has food allergies and this is one of the few places where we can eat. First of all, the service is always great. The staff has never been rude or unprofessional; always friendly. My problem has been with the quality of the food. We used to order our food for pick up, get it home, and it was still hot. Then we started to get cold pancakes, as if they'd been sitting out a while; we live less than 10 minutes away. A couple times when we dined in, the same thing happened- cold pancakes. We decided today that it just wasn't worth going there anymore. We had a hair in the potatoes on one plate, pancakes changing a really nasty looking color on another plate (we were told it was a new pancake mix), and a chunk of egg in one of the waters. It's good food when it's warm, doesn't change colors, and doesn't have hair in it. I didn't make a scene about it, management was informed, and a bunch of apologies were given along with a small discount. Thanks for everything over the years, but we'll find another breakfast spot.
