Text: This was the nastiest chicken fried rice I have seen or eaten ..chicken was rubbery and literally no egg or Veggies... I strongly recommend the owners and staff to Try Ming's Chinese food  in Papillion.. so they can see how far off the mark they really are.....  My chicken fried rice would put this place out of business! Sorry I didn't drive to Ming's now....
