Text: Great little "Mom&Pop" type restaurant.  Across street parking and in back - front and back entrance.  Lots of seating, friendly servers, breakfast, lunch and dinner options.  Fast service.  Nice, clean place.  Reasonable prices.

Text: Food is usually good.  Usually very busy and very noisy.  They have the best butterscotch pie, but you have to make sure the waitress brings it as soon as you order it.  Otherwise you may not get it as was the case tonight, even though I did order with my meal!!!

Text: I had the chicken salad plate. It was the best I've had in quite a long time!!! 

The waitress waitress however... she was extremely pleasant to me. But when my friend Jody asked her to wipe off the dirty table, NOT so nice. 

I'll be going back.

Text: After escaping Hurricane Irma this was a great treat! Nothing fancy but great food! Gigantic...delicious tenderloins and homemade pies to die for! We drove 1000 miles, so where ever you are...it's worth the drive!

Text: As old school as it gets - and I liked it a bunch! Like going over to Grandma's for dinner including a big ole slice of homemade pie. An Americana gem!
