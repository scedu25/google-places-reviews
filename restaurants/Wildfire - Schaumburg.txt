Wildfire - Schaumburg

Text: I booked a dinner reservation for 2 here for dinner last night and it was even better than I'd hoped. I don't eat meat, so I ordered the french onion soup as an appetizer and the double baked potato, roasted vegetables and kale side salad with lemon vinaigrette as my entree. The flavors were amazing and the portion sizes were huge. His lamb was cooked perfectly and his sides were also delicious. Our server was very attentive without being intrusive. Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated in a pretty quiet section. Great atmosphere and fair prices, will be returning.

Text: Absolutely beautiful experience, from our arrival, through the very end of our dining experience tonight, August 29, 2017.  The table reservation was spectacular.  Our server (Art) was a God sent, he was outstanding!  The food, venue, and ambiance was wonderful.  Thank you, Wildfire - Schaumburg, we definitely will highly recommend your place to others.

Text: I loved my meal. I got 3 filet medallions, so tasty. Prepared perfectly. My husband's steak was overcooked, quite disappointing. The side dishes were great as well. The meatball appetizer is excellent. So is the  mixed berry cheesecake which is enough for 2 to share ;-)

Text: Great ambience, great service, and great food. Many places can do 1 or 2 things solidly but rarely do you find a spit that can hit all targets on a given night and thankfully Wildfire delivered for our visit. The filet mignon melts in your mouth like butter, and the drinks were poured flawlessly. Have to also give a shout out to our waitress Emily who was fantastic.

Text: One of our favorite places to eat. I'm very picky about my steaks, and these guys know what "medium" is. The steaks are so good they don't really need anything on them, but once you try the horseradish bacon wrapped filet you'll be hooked for life!
