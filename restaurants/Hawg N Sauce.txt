Text: Great food with options for almost any palate. Service is excellent. Prices are good. Live entertainment outside from time to time. I stop every time I go to Mt. Vernon.

Text: Food here is usually decent at best. Sat for 45 minutes before being told our order didn't go through. Got out food very quickly after that and it tasted reheated. Not terrible, but not an experience I would want to repeat.

Text: Omgosh  great BBQ.  I rate them with Mission  BBQ. THE BEST IN SOUTHERN  INDIANA.  Clean, friendly and fast service.  Great place to eat. It takes us an hr to get there but SO WORTH IT.
