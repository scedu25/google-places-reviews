Text: Waited for quite awhile to be even given a menu, while we watched a waitress writing on something at the counter.  Then two other couples came in, sat down and she promptly got up and proceeded to take them their menus.  I said "that's it"  and we started to leave.  She looked at us and said "you've not been waited on?"  I said no, and we left.  It's not like they didn't see us, I was in a wheelchair and we were told to take a seat anywhere.  We will not be back!

Text: The server had to come back to our table several different times to inform us of menu changes after we ordered. Food was servered luke warm at best. Had to ask for BBQ sauce for pulled pork and then got barely enough for a half sandwich. Drinks were never refilled or even offered to be refilled. We will not be returning.

Text: Steak didn't have much flavor, portions are a good size, waitress could have been more pleasant. Prices seemed to be a little high
