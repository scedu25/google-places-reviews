Fujiyama Japanese Steakhouse

Text: My family and I frequent the Carbondale restaurant monthly. Tonight we tried Marion because we were short on time. Service was good, but our steak was not good at all. It had funky taste. Fingers crossed that it was just a difference in seasonings.

Text: Always get great food and great service here. The chefs are entertaining and talented and servers are pleasant. Food is yummy and there's a lot of it. Go for lunch Monday thru Friday for a lot of food for not a lot of money.

Text: Nothing went right.  VERY slow service.  Had surf and turf.  Steak was low quality, over cooked, lobster was overcooked and over sauced.  "Chef" had little personality.  Such a low grade version of a great Hibachi restaurant.

Text: The hibachi show is always fun to watch, and the cook was very attentive to not putting any sauce on the food I ate, which I cannot have. Very nice, he served mine first and then added the sauces for the rest of my family. Thank you!!
