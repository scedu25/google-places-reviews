Text: Not sure why people are giving this restaurant 4 stars; if I could give it less than 1 star, I would. We went there for dinner. This is a cafeteria. The food all looked and tasted like frozen, warmed over food. The worst meal we have ever had. My husband had Salisbury steak, at least that's what they called it and I had chicken tenders. We each had two sides and drinks. Our bill was over $22. Don't waste your time or money going here. They advertise they are an Amish LIKE restaurant. They are not even close to being Amish-like.

Text: Wonderful friendly family owned. Joe the owner was out baling hay right before coming in and (after making his rounds warmly greeting and hugging all the regular local patrons and even spending time with me a salesman) joining in on his fiddle with a group of over a dozen other musician friends picking and singing folk songs in the back dining area. You've never seen any place like this!

Text: Stopped for breakfast  never even got acknowledged  when I told the manager she said they were doing the best they could do. If that is the best you can do you shouldn't be in business
