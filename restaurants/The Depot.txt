Text: Really unique place to eat in an historic old train depot. The place is so interesting to look at and read its history. Good service, coffee and unique menu items. You might even be surprised with complimentary muffins.

Very cozy, clean and beautiful. The building itself is so historical and oozing with rich architecture. Ill be stopping in every time I pass through town!
