Text: Great bar food and cold beer. I give it an honest four stars. It's nice if you are looking for a place to sit down to eat with a cold beer or cocktail. I've been to some wedding receptions here. I feel as if it is a well suited establishment for that.

Text: Meatloaf special okay.  Mashed potatoes and gravy bland.  Expect that from potatoes not gravy.  Service outstanding.  Moscow Mule delicious.  In the section we sat...they may want to work on something for men's restroom.  Every time someone went in you saw gentlemen using the facilities.  Very awkward for them, but entertainment for crowd who giggled everytime the door got opened.

Text: The food is hit or miss. Sometimes great, sometimes bad. But itâ€™s a nice place to go.
