Text: We are here now and it's our first time...yes, we are Rusty virgins. (Pausing to laugh.) Ok, I'm back...the food is perfection. The chef (are cooks called chefs at a bar/club), even made a special cilanteo sauce for my nachos that I hope to see on the menu next time we visit. Now, for the most important part, the wait staff still holds true to great customer service (come on...you know that's hard to find these days). We truly are enjoying our time here and appreciate such a good spirited group.
