Text: During peek hours, there can be a wait for food and service, but the quality is there.  Drinks are cheep and made the way the customer likes them, the servers get know you and your preference pretty quickly.  Local crowd are a friendly bunch, but leave you alone too.  Its a nice bar for a quick bite, or to sit for awhile.

Text: We stopped in on our way back to St. Louis. We weren't sure to expect. Once inside,  the service fast, the food was yummy.  My hubby recommends the burger! I had the fish sandwich and onion ring. Both were awesome .  The pitchers are cheap and best of all, there was pinball.
