Cal's Fine Foods & Spirits
Rating: 3
Text: Easy to get to. Ample parking. Service was fast, meal came out quickly. I felt it had more of a bar feel then a "fine dining" atmosphere. Dimly lit, everything felt tacky to the touch. The menu left allot to be desired, catering to heavier foods, fried and meaty. Decent food quality but nothing over the top.

Text: Terrible experience, not fine dining in any sense of the word. The steaks were overpriced and cooked incorrectly. My wife ordered a mediem steak and came out raw, not rare but raw and cold. Not just the center the whole thing, worst steak she's had anywhere.. she sent it back but it returned to the table cut in half and still raw. To top it off the service was terrible, we asked her for some extra time to order and never came back. After 10 minutes I finally got her to come by staring at her until she looked up from texting on her phone and noticed me. It seems so nice from the outside you have no idea it's a dive. I've had way better experiences and better food at fast food restaurants and that isn't an exaggeration.

Text: The last 3 times there, were bad experiences. First time, they were out of steaks on a Tuesday night, second time ordered steaks again and were over cooked, tonight they were out of A-1 sauce completely except we were told they found some in the cellar and it contained 2 tablespoons of sauce. At least it was still in date . We were also served 2 out of 3salads that had frozen lettuce in our salads.
