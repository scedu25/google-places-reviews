Text: Excellent flat iron steak. Good hand cut fries and fresh green beans.  Friendly and helpful service. Very reasonable prices in a grand old hotel that people appreciated enough to renovate and reuse original decor.

Text: Great food, but we went during a shift change on the day of the evidence and got a little lost in the shuffle. They were great, though

Text: Stopped by for a drink and my lady needed to go to the room and wanted a drink when she came back to join me. I waited for the bartender and then the bartender refused to make both drinks for me so I could have my lady a drink when she joined me. Not a good experience.
