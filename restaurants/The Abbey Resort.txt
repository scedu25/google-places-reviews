The Abbey Resort

Text: The Abbey Resort is really nice. I really like how it has an old-time feel, yet everything is modernized. The landscaping is wonderful and there are beautiful views near the lake. The indoor pool was very nice. We took our one year old son swimming and he had a blast, especially in the kiddie pool. Would definitely go back for another visit!

Text: We frequent this location for 240 West which is located inside the resort. Can be somewhat difficult to locate but highly recommend the prime rib buffet on Saturday nights. The food is phenomenal, staff is very helpful and friendly. My only complaint is parking which can be very difficult on a Saturday night. Valet parking is offered at the door, but it shouldn't be quite so difficult to park my own vehicle.

Text: A group of us ladies (cousins and aunts) made reservations to celebrate a 40th birthday for this weekend.  A family member became very ill and we had to change our reservations.  Emerson and his staff was so gracious in helping us adjust our reservations so we could be with our family member and celebrate our cousin.  The customer service was thoughtful and comforting in our situation.  On behalf of our family we thank the Abbey Resort and look forward towards our stay.

Text: I attended a wedding at the resort and stayed at the hotel for two nights. The room was a bit dated and had a slight odor, but the bed was very comfortable and all of the rooms have a walk out patio. It's difficult to find your way around the hotel. The wedding went very smooth. The food was excellent, and the tent was well air conditioned.
