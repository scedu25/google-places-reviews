Text: This place to too busy and too cramped. If you want to go during a busy time, good luck finding a seat.. Seasons or Convos is significantly better and doesn't feel as cramped.

Text: "We have to feed like a million college students, if we create enough food to literally bury them regardless of quality, they'll be happy, right?" - UDCC management (for real though, busiest place to eat on campus but still pretty good. Except the pizza, it's 1/3 crust and only okay because even they can't screw up pizza)

Text: Food is over seasoned, over priced, and customers are under valued. This sad excuse for a "restaurant" proves that service can be horrible, yet you can still make money off of students who are REQUIRED to eat here. The facade of variety gives way to show poorly cooked food, an ice cream machine that never works, dirty tables and floors, and food that has been sitting out for hours. 10/10 would NOT RECOMMEND.

Text: This is probably one of the worst places to work. The cooks and managers really get on your back. There is no sense of leadership and everyone goes on unmotivated

Text: It was good, hard to find seating though. Good variety of food. Not enough healthy options.
