Kline's Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: We heard very positive feedback from friends about Kline’s Restaurant and going there was worth the trip!!  
The food, staff, decor, and value for money was far beyond our expectations.  
We will most definitely be going back every chance we get!  
The ribs were superb, and shrimp salad was the freshest best salad I’ve ever had.  We fell in love with this place!
I’d rate it more than 5 stars if I could.

Text: Huge, delicious country comfort foods. Wow!  Is the best way to sum it up.  The cinnamon roll is as large as a pizza, only 5 times as thick and it is filled with a dazzling cinnamon center.  Delicious.  I had the 2 piece Catfish Dinner, could not finish it, took half of it with me.  Very affordable, very enjoyable, highly recommend.

Text: This place is AMAZING!! The atmosphere is perfect.  They have antiques decorating the walls and hanging from the ceiling. They have a large variety of the most decadent desserts you ever have seen in your life! This place is a must if you are anywhere near the area.

Text: Food is well prepared, flavorful and generous, desserts are to die for. Staff are friendly and well trained. This would be a five star review except the non-smoking section exists only on the floor - the last 15 minutes of our visit were punctuated by strong influx of cigarette smoke.
