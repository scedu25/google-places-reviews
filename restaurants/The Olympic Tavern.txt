Text: We love coming to the Olympic, and have never had a bad meal until tonight. Got our usual roast beef sandwich... The beef was just so salty I couldn't finish it. And anyone who knows me, knows nothing is ever too salty!

Text: It was very good food, the staff was very friendly (including our waitress that had long conversations with everyone else in the tavern), but other than that great service.

Text: Absolutely stunning bar and seating area. The patio area is the best in Rockford. Cheese curds are also the best in Rockford. A lot of choices in beer and food. Welcoming and friendly staff. If visiting Rockford you must stop in and have a drink!
