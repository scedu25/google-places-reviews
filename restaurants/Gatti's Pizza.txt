Text: Love this pizza place. The pizza is good but the salad bar is delicious. It's small but always fresh and they keep it clean which is a big plus for us.

Text: The food was good. The girl running the register was not. She had a sorry attitude and was not nice to me or my grandchildren. We were there at noon on August 6th. I spoke to the manager about her attitude. Hopefully this will be straightened out as it has happened several times over the past couple of years.
