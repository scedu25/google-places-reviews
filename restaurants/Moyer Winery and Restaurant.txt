Rating: 5
Text: We just finished celebrating our 22nd anniversary.  Been quite a day, nothing really went as planned and arrived very late, close to closing time. We were treated warmly and encouraged several times to "take our time and enjoy". The wine was FANTASTIC(took 2 bottles home with me :) ! My steak was Perfectly cooked (which is very hard to.do, I rarely get what I order). Our waitress was great. Many thanks for taking such good care of us on our anniversary,  we will most definitely be back!!!
