King David Dogs

Text: Don’t eat here. We ordered our food and the lady told us it would be 12 minutes to be ready. We agreed and went to the candy store next door. My wife returned in 5 minutes and the lady said it would be 10 more minutes. We both returned 5 minutes later and the they had given our food to somebody else. Poor service. No apology. No offer to make it right.

Text: Making a hot dog is one of the easiest processes to streamline, but King David's has failed to do so. All orders take too long even with the hot dogs pre cooked. Additionally the cashier was unprofessional.

The hot dogs themselves are rubbery and undercooked. The buns are cheap and low quality. There was no care given to how the toppings were presented. When asking for water they direct you to the water fountain across the walkway.

I can't find a single good thing to say about eating here.

Text: Just an embarrassingly poorly run establishment. The 2 employees at the front counter were eating, didnt wear gloves and didnt wash their hands after they stopped talking and eating to serve me. Zero people in line but it would still be over 15 minute wait because they didn't have any hot dogs cooked.

Text: Decided to grab food here because we didn't have enough time to sit down and order food elsewhere.  Still took over 30 minutes to get our food.  Service was awful and the employees didn't appear to care when they got backed up with orders.  Don't bother with this place.  The food certainly isn't worth the price or the wait.

Text: Absolutely atrocious service, blatant disregard for basic food safety, and every order I watched taken was messed up. I haven't even started eating and I'm 100% confident I will never purchase from this location again.
