Palm Palace

Text: Very pretty environment though little noisy. Pretty good service. Very tasty food in the whole range of types of foods. Price is a little high but the volume is large. They were understaffed the night we were there but other times I have had relatively fast service. I'd highly recommend it to anybody who likes Middle Eastern food and the food was not real spicy.

Text: The staff was very friendly and greeted us before and during the meal. The bread is delicious and filling. The shawarma was very delicious with a citrus twist. One can spend 10-20 dollars here and completely fill-up 2 people. I'm thoroughly satisfied with the service, food and restaurant atmosphere. While it is not the most romantic place, it is excellent for larger groups and meet ups.

Text: Last week we had the chance to eat at the Palm palace in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
It was an awesome experience, the food was great. Very tasty , the best middle eastern food I have ever tried. the service was super. Our server Moe was extraordinary. The chief/ manager was very hospitable .He made us feel so welcomed. Lord's willing, every time we are in Michigan, we have to go to the Palm palace as a family.
 We all as a family loved it.
I  highly recommend this place for everyone who has a chance to visit Ann arbor, Michigan.

Text: I was very impressed by this restaurant! The dining area alone is something to behold, but the food really got my attention. Everything I tried was outstanding compared to other Mediterranean restaurants I've been to, and the staff was quite friendly and helpful on top of it. This has become my favorite restaurant in the Ann Arbor area!

Text: Some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had away from home! The people couldn't have been more accommodating and polite either I mean, if I lived closer to Ann Arbor I'd be here 4 days a week!! Love it
