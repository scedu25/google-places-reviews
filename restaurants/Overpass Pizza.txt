Text: Cozy. Great food. Not good hours. Open odd times. Would het better buisness if open all day instead of a couple hours here and there. They are closed from 1-3. What restaurant does that.

Text: Perfect roadside spot - local, small, and delicious thin crust pizza!!! Called ahead from the highway so we wouldn't have to wait long with our kids. 
 The server was super friendly, they didn't rush us even though they were near closing time.
If we find ourselves coming by here next road trip, we'll definitely stop.
