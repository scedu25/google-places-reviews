The Royal Buffet
Rating: 4
Text: This place is small, almost hidden if you dont know where it is, and needs more business.  Never crowded, and could use more people going through to freshen it up.  Food is good, the service is as expected of a small buffet, and they are certainly courteous and kind.  Imagine a buffet at your grandmothers house, and this will describe it well.

Text: It's a decent place. Food is mild Americanized Chinese fair. Not much of a selection, and it's buffet only (they offer buffet take out by the pound as well) but the food is decent. There's the stereotypical lanterns and kitchen but it's a plain place with no real atmosphere. The staff is attentive and polite, it's not a bad place we visit whenever we feel the need for take-out style Chinese food

Text: The most wonderful food and staff you could ever hope for! I love the buffet and salad/fruit bar! They open earlier for lunch which is great for me, as I take my lunch break about 10 AM. Super family friendly with many big tables.

Text: All you can eat buffet. If you come during busy hours it's really good! If there's not a lot of people when you go food tends to get stale and isn't the warmest.
