Underground Barrel Room & Grill

Text: Good food.  Good drinks.  Good service. However, this is a bar that serves food not a restaurant. We took our kid on a Sunday evening at 5 o' clock and the music was so loud it was hard to talk. And every other song was about keeping your 'ho' in check.  We went there because the website said they had  a kids menu, so we thought it was OK to take the kid.  Our mistake.

Text: I had a couple of good experiences at the Underground, so I was terribly disappointed by my last visit there. My friends waited at least two hours for their food, and I waited over an hour. It took forever for anyone to come check on our table and refill drinks (we had empty glasses multiple times). It was busy and we tried to be understanding, but our server mostly ignore us until we complained. When the food finally arrived, it wasn't hot, and it ended up making me very sick. My friends and I will not be returning.

Text: Service is going down hill. I loved this place a year ago and now (taking into account the eclipse) the quality of the food has gotten worse. Even had a meal comped by a server due to an insect running out from my plate on one occasion. Step it back up and it'll be great place to go again.

Text: Food wasn't bad, but apparently washing dishes and counting money was way more important that taking our order. Took over an hour to get a to-go order. Do not recommend, won't ever be back. 3 bartenders, eight customers and it still took way too long.
