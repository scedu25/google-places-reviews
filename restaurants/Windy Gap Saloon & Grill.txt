Text: We stopped in after hearing it was the best bar in Paxton, NE. We are from South Carolina, headed to Bend. We spent a dollar on the "chance" slot game and won twenty five! We played some pool and talked to a few natives there whom were so friendly. A regular who usually comes there told us his story and a little about his town. When our food came out, it was BEYOND delicious. I ordered a loaded baked potato and my husband got the chicken strips with fries. It was the best food we had had in a long time, especially after the road. The bartenders were so nice and very helpful. We went around three pm mountain time and they only had a handful of people so that's great for anyone who doesn't like crowded places. However, when dinnertime rolls around that place can get pretty packed! Some of the nicest people I have met have been in Nebraska. I would definitely visit this town again!

Text: If you haven't had a Juicy Lucy you've never eaten a burger. Why wouldnt everyone stuff a burger with cheese and onions? Friendly service and patrons. Worth a stop.

Text: Went here since my husband and I are from out of town and everyone we work with said we had to try their prime rib. We ended up getting there to early for that so opted for steaks instead. Hands down the best steak we've had from a restaurant in a LONG time! The cut of meat was good and it came out cooked perfectly (something that never seems to happen at a steak house anymore).  We were pleasantly surprised with this little gem and will definitely be going back before we head home to Kentucky.
