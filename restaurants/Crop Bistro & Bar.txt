Text: Second time at brunch, and again, it was excellent. This morning my two young kids were in tow, and they each loved their food. Better yet, the staff was very kind and patient with them. My only complaint is that our cut of lamb was a bit dry, but it was an end piece. Everything else was delicious. This brunch is a great value when you consider portions (endless) and food quality and variety.

Text: Their tasting menu with wine pairings is my favorite meal in the Cleveland area, but will take a chunk out of your wallet and leave you unable to drive home! If you love upscale dining and find yourself in Cleveland for one night, this is the place you should go! Oh, and the chef's table is fun - they will explain whatever you want to know about what they are making or leave you to dine depending on whether you engage them. I cannot say enough about this place - from the food to the drinks to the service, I've never been left wanting!

Text: Wonderful weekend brunch! We made a reservation, but didn't need it as there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated. Service was prompt and very professional. Great selection of dishes for breakfast or lunch, with a nice carving station and a variety of desserts. Kenny was kind enough to offer us a tour of the vault area. Beautiful space.

Text: Loved the food, loved the service. The restaurant, an old bank still has all it's vintage look with high ceiling and an old vault is so beautiful.

Text: We went for the tasting menu as a birthday gift from my husband to me and it was amazing, each bite was better than the last. The server was amazing. He was so attentive, but not hovery and the whole experience was amazing. We loved every minute of the experience. We were there fairly late and could see the staff beginning to clean yet, we never felt rushed to hurry up and go. The server even gave us extra bread to take home since we both loved the bread so much that he kept bringing refills. I cannot wait to go back again.
