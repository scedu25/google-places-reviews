Text: Very very good pizza! We always get the thin crust veggie and thin crust cheese from here when we travel on US 41. The folks here are always welcoming and courteous. Highly recommend.

Text: Love the Monical's chain. Same great taste here! I'm withholding a star bc of an odd incident during our visit. We placed order (at counter, fyi). After we were seated, server came to our table stating they didn't have enough breadsticks to fill our order (the largest amt, 25, I think), they were short 2 or 3, was this okay? Well no, it's not, but whaddya gonna do? I was expecting an adjustment in some way, either offering an additional item or a reduced price. As it turns out, the question really was, can we charge you full price for shorting you breadsticks? Rather then complain after a long day in the sun, nothing was said. I think a different approach by the restaurant would have been more customer-friendly

Text: First time I've been to a pizza place where you walk in, place your order at the counter, pay & go find a place to sit. Go back to the counter to get what you want to drink. Same for refills unless you can catch somebody bringing out a pizza. (They bring your pizza out to you). I have to say, I loved the pizza! Will be back again for sure. :-)
