Smokehouse Grill and Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: This place is amazing. I'm not sure if they have a tagline in commercials or whatnot... but it should be: "Smokehouse grill and buffet... a good place to die." 
Cause I was THAT satisfied when I got done eating. I would have been okay were those my last moments.

Text: Ate here because it was convenient to the hotel I was staying in and I am glad I did.  Good home cooked food, some of the best I have had in awhile.  I will be sure to stop in the next time I am in the area.

Text: The ribeye sandwich is amazing. I stopped in to place a takeout order bc it's right by my hotel. The staff was super friendly and chatted with me while I waited on my order. Fast, friendly, and great food!

Text: Great value with the buffet that's full of American favorites. Most is home made with a very good Thousand Island dressing. Everything was fresh. We'll be back.
