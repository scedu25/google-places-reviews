Court Street Grill
Rating: 5
Text: Court Street Grill is the home of the bungtown burger. The char-grilled burgers are amazing and have tons of flavor. I'd recommend any of the burgers but adding condiments because they don't come with much. Their menu is decent and you can tell they put time into it. The people are all very friendly; it's a nice local place if you are in the area. Drink prices fluctuate greatly depending on the time of  years and if there are events in town.
