Text: My husband and I tried it after I got off work one morning and cant wait to go back. I would describe it as a mom and pop restaurant with real food. It was good food, reasonably prices, and friendly staff.

Text: Mostly deep fried foods, my stomach hurt most of the evening after eating there. They have smoking inside so it smells bad and the service was terrible. I wanted to like this place but the saturated restroom was my final straw. It was disgusting. I hope to try this place again and have a better experience. Oh and they only accept cash or check and do not serve any form of turkey meat.
