Text: Tables were wobbly but it added to the charm. Didn't realize food was going to be take out style even if you eat inside. I loved the quaint styling and decor. It added to the ambiance. Food was great and I would recommend the shrimp fried rice. No trash cans which I love because they are a no waste business! I can't get enough of this place.
