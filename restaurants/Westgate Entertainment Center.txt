Text: I had my baby shower there and the place was great! I reserved the billiards room ahead of time. It's family friendly. It's cost efficient as you can have their catering services or pizza and soda or water (Water is free), but you have to purchase their food and drinks. Also they have a bar for those who want to have a beer or such. The linen, set-up and clean up was included and the staff was very nice and had everything ready before we got there. I would definitely recommend!

Text: Super busy. Decent prices. Lanes need polished - parents next to us were using the tool to line up the ball for their kids and still getting constant gutter balls. Also, both of our lanes broke down during the game.
