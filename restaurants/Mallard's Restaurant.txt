Text: Always slow service, they never get in a hurry. A shining bright spot are their boneless hot wings. I have never had a boneless wing that I've liked until I've eaten them here. Just enough heat, plenty of sauce on the wings, and have always been cooked to perfection.  Their mixed drinks are properly made as well, try the Blue Herwaiian very tasty.

Text: Loved this place. Chose because the hotel receptionist recommended it, but the food was delicious and the service was AMAZING! From the owner to the waitresses to the hostesses they were just super on top of everything and completely accommodating of my hyper-active kids. We will come here for supper every time we're in town from now on. 

Also, if you're happily kid-free, they had an enticing-looking bar, too.

Text: The food was good and there was lots of it. It was hot and delicious. Our waitress was training another person and both of them were personable and helpful. We have eaten here when we have been in Danville and will probably go back if we get the chance.

Text: I LOVE THE BONELESS WINGS. Service is ALWAYS SLOW no matter what time you come. I've eaten here twice in the last week and both days... slow. I've gotten to the point I always just order wings and alcohol because it will take over an hour for any other food to come out. Now let me SHOUTOUT the boneless wings here beats any restaurant in Danville hands down. Always tender, completely covered in the delicious sauce with just enough kick. Most of the staff are not very friendly, except for Holly she is the thin blonde headed bartender and Jessie one of he servers who were both very attentive to the outside patrons. Holly gives exceptional service, great opinion and is honest, Jessie smiles and greets you, always on top of the game asking if refills or anything else is needed. The mixed drinks are properly proportional. The Blue Herwaiian
