Text: This is about the best our area has to offer.  Nice views of the river.  The food is pretty good.  I really can't comment on the bar.  Staff could stand to be friendlier;  all of them act as if they've never had a day of fun in their whole lives.

Text: The food was good, but the prices are to high, for the amount. I would go Texas Road for a great steak at a better price.

Text: Great food and a very friendly waitress. The view of the river in the deck was very pleasant. I ordered the prime rib and it was cooked a perfect medium rare.
