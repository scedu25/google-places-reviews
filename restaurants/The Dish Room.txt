Text: Wow! What a great meal! Delicious butternut squash enchiladas! My husband and I shared the "dish salad" minus olives and feta cheese. It was also very tasty. We were too full for desert, but the desert choices sounded good. Service was excellent. Nice rustic modern decor. Noise level was good considering there is a central bar. Not too loud for conversations. We highly recommend the restaurant. Plenty of seating with a variety of seating options. Visiting from Madison, Wisconsin

Text: The lobster Mac was delicious and definitely didn't skimp on the lobster! The sauce was so cheesy and creamy!! We also had the bread pudding which was amazing! The service was great and we were really impressed!

Text: What a wonderful first stop on our journey back from Denver to Asheville, NC. We were getting hungry and read the reviews for The Dish Room and we're compelled to stop. I'm so glad we did. The butternut squash enchiladas were some of the best food we've had during our weeks of travel across the country. Our server and the kitchen staff helped my gluten free husband navigate the menu. Our kids were tired and the outdoor seating allowed us to park right next to our table and put a movie on for them while we ate. It was a rare date while traveling with our kids. The story behind the place is pretty inspiring, too, so be sure to ask. If you have the opportunity to eat at The Dish Room be sure to do so. You'll be glad you did.
