Text: I've eaten here with friends and clients for years. The food is excellent and the service is better than the food!

Breakfast is so good that I want to go back to sleep and return in an hour or two for "second breakfast" (I may be part Hobbit).

Lunch is always quick and tasty.

Dinner is amazing, but sometimes it can take a while if they are really busy.

A first rate place to eat in a nice small town.

Text: Everything i have eaten here has been fantastic and the service great.  The reason of 4 stars instead of 5 is the price of some stuff that i like is a little high. But not outrageous.
