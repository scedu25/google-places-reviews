Sindbad's Restaurant and Marina

Text: It's an old time favorite. Very reasonably priced with good food. The Steamed Seasonal Vegetables are done just right, not mushy or too hard. Love the vintage photos on the walls. I've had the perch, pork chops, and frog legs, all delicious. Have taken several friends there and all very happy with the service and their menu choices.

Text: Our meal is always wonderful, but the last couple of times at dinner, wait staff seemed to disappear.  Could not ask for him by name since he didn't mention it.  We had to find him though anot her server.  On our way out, we looked for the hostess, did not find her.  Lunch is perfect,  meal and service.  2 large parties should not be an issue for other patrons, many repeating for years.

Text: Food is great. The owners care! Yes there is problems sometimes but look at the neighborhood.  You get locals that can't figure out how to tip! 20% is the normal,  since wait staff must pay a tax on your Bill, so the government can give our tax dollars to some illegals. But otherwise the food is great , service is good.

Text: One of the best restaurants in the Detroit area for simple seafood dishes. If you're looking for fried Pickerel, shrimp, or clam chowder you can't go wrong. Good drinks a casual, lively atmosphere and a good view of the marina, Roostertail and the Detroit River. Just be aware that it can get very busy during events and on the weekends, and that you will need to use valet parking.

Text: Sit at the bar so you can see what goes on. Bartender sneezed wipe nose threw tissue in can in the middle of the kitchen. Then went to the oven to get our bread out. No thank you!!!
