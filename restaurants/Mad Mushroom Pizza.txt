Text: Unfortunately, I won't be ordering from the Underwood Street location again. First, I will say the woman who delivered the pizza was great! She was fun, energetic, and very nice (she would get 5 stars). However, the pizza itself was terrible! I ordered a small cheesestix with pizza. The cheesestix were dry and barely had cheese. The pizza was supposed to have extra cheese and extra sauce, neither of which it had. It was very dry. It also took over an hour to receive the order (ordered at 7:21, email that it was out for delivery at 8:19, and then didn't arrive until after 8:30). I have ordered from the West Lafayette location and never had a problem. Maybe it was just a busy/rough night??

Text: Up Intel tonight I've live the pizza and service. I only reviewed because of this fact. Ok so here it is! I Order from them twice a week because my kids love it and it's easy but at 35 or more plus tip you would think you would get what you order. Tonight I placed a order at 6pm and 745 my pizza and cheese bread came. The pizza was as if it never was cooked. And it was all cold. I can't and talk to the g.m. This guy is lucky I value my freedom now day or I would have took my ass down there for him. I'm a business owner myself and know you don't fight with a custom. Or place it off that your in the right when clearly you not. 40 dollars is nothing but the fact is I'm a return customer and think it not out of line to get cooked hot food! If you can handle this job get in line down at the unemployment office
