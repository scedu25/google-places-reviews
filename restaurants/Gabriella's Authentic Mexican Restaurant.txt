Text: I really dont want to give this place a star. The food was bland absolutely no flavor. My whole family thought the same thing. We didnt eat more than a few bits of our meals. We were charged full price for the meal. One waiter came back and look at our plates and told us no charge while his buddy up front charged us full price. We were also questioned where else have we been to compare their food with. They were rude and thought our frustration was funny. We will never step foot in that place again. Oh there was a couple in there that i talked to and they told us their meal was bland too.  Also to add icing to the cake they called us assholes in Spanish as we were walking out the door. Thats great customer service said no one ever.

Text: Passing through town, we stopped here for lunch. The service at Gabriella's was great and cheap, and that was it. I ordered garlic shrimp which was garlic from a jar spread on shrimp. The beans had zero flavor or texture (perhaps too much water mixed with canned refried beans). I don't usually write bad reviews, but with such great decor and service I was shocked at how terrible the food was.
