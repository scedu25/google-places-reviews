Text: Great experience at Roc's over the weekend. My wife and I are EIU alums and came back in town for dinner and drinks. I'll only focus on the positive...Roc's! Great atmosphere for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. We sat at the bar. The servers were friendly and made us feel welcome. Drinks were great. We had the fried clams twice! You don't see those on the menu many other places, so we had a craving for them. We'll definitely go back next time we're in town.

Text: The people, scotch, craft beer and food. Do I really need go on, or are you just going to go? Sit at the bar if possible. This place is a hidden gem. The building has a really amazing prohibition era story. Mike the owner and his daughter Kylie are good people. Their scotch and beer selection are first and foremost unparalleled. You would have to go to a bar that specialises in scotch or craft beer to find something similar. One can tell they are not selected buy a beer/liquor reps but by people who like drinking craft beer and scotch. Come here a couple times and you will see how much they care about customers. The food is always good. Made by people who care. They aim to please and in my experience they have always hit the mark. Lastly, come when Mikey's working not the owner. Seriously, he's worth the trip. Damn good people.
