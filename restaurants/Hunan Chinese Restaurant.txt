Text: Zero stars!!! Wait staff was actually making fun of my child. It was very hard to show restraint. Pathetic, I will never give them business again.

Text: It's a real bummer when you can't give zero stars.
First, no plates, no napkins, and no plasticware. Food was boring. Crab rangoons were dryer than the desert I am from. The fried rice had no veggies. Just rice but not white. Not to mention, the first day I called they didn't even have fried rice. You are welcome for the fourteen dollar donation. And thanks for the worst Chinese food experience. 

I do hope you see this review and make things right for the next person.
Good luck.
