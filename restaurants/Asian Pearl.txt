Asian Pearl

Text: I'm not sure about the complaints of prices and food here. $6.50 is cheap for an Asian lunch buffet. It is twice this where I live and 4 times this if you go to a big city for such a spread.

The food was well prepared. There are a lot of deep fried foods, but they have a habachi grill where you can stay away from that. The selection is incredible.

Text: I was really satisfied with the food besides the desert bar. I don't know what was in that pudding. The ladies' room could have use some direct attention. But they definitely could use a few more hands even though it's a buffet. Again the food was great my kids had no complaints. They actually ate more than one plate full. I will be back when I'm back in town. Great place to stop off of the highway for a quick eat.

Text: Just moved here from Georgia and wanted to try the local cuisine. This place was very good! The food was delicious and hot. The price for the buffet was super affordable. I would definitely recommend and will be coming back soon ?

Text: Only Chinese restaurant I'll eat at! Love their sugar donuts, sweet & sour sauce, crab rangoon (more crabby taste than cream cheese - which I love), and beef & broccoli (though I just eat the broccoli). Servers aren't the friendliest, but they are attentive.
