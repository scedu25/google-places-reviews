Text: Nice place..great people..just need more assistance at the bar. I only wish our food orders looked as big as the pics posted by the cook. Misleading.

Text: Food was great. There was some service issues, didn't get our food for 70 mins. Only the third table in the place, I think our ticket was missed placed. Was hoping for a discount for the inconvenience but was not offered one. Defiantly good BBQ.
