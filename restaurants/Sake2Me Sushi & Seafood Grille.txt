Text: We stopped here on our drive through Kansas and it was the best find! We were surprised at how amazing the sushi was! The menu is very original and creative. Very nice atmosphere and staff as well. The Friday the 13th roll was especially incredible!

Text: Always great food. Staff was prompt and courteous.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the sushi menu being downsized.  We were really looking forward to the oysters but they sold out the night before so I will not fault them for that.

Text: The best! Caesar (sushi chef) is the man - always making great tasting food with elegant presentation. The staff have always treated me well and do a wonderful job. I have had sushi in KC, Lawrence, Great Bend, and even other states (AZ, FL, and TN) - Sake2Me's sushi, by far, is the best there is.

I will be back on a weekly basis.

Text: Having lived in Hawaii and eaten at some high end places in Vegas my expectations for sushi in Hays were fairly low, but, the Friday the 13th roll was awesome! Calamari was good as well. I really liked the vib and decor was cool too. Will definitely make this my go to stop between Topeka and Denver.

Text: Good food! Sadly hit a "out of oysters " night, but the sushi; on point.  Mussels were fantastic. Staff awesome. Would definitely dine here again.
