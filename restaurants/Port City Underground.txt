Text: I was on a business trip in Eastern IA and heard about this place from a gentleman in Le Claire. Stopped in and had a great experience. Atmosphere was great and food was even better. Mitch the manager was awesome and super personal! Even the locals eating here were nice as they chatted with me while I was there. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great experience. I will be back for sure.

Text: I've been going here for years. The pizza is always delicious and fresh, the waitstaff friendly, and the choices unique. I love the Uptown Utopia for the hot goat cheese taste, and most of them with the Fill the Basement option are fantastic. It's like cheese-stuffed crust but the entire pizza. The calzones are to die for, and the Muskie Sticks are a great deal. 

I enjoy the decor of the place, the exposed brick and low lighting. Makes for a great romantic setting.
