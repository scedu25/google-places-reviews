Text: Our server was great! The food was pretty good i would skip the cheesy garlic bread and go for the pizza rolls tho. Those are amazingly good. Any pizza you order is going to be good.

Text: Very long wait time for a chain restaurant. Depending on what dish you get it can be very good. Although one time we had a waiter that was MIA and just disappeared during his shift and we hadn't been helped for a long time. I'm assuming he no longer works there. Haven't had any other issues like that.

Text: Really good food and a nice selection of beers. Service was a little slow but they were pretty busty and had a few larger parties.
