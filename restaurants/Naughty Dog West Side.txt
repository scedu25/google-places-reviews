Naughty Dog West Side
Rating: 5
Text: Naughty Dog has excellent vegetarian options. I had a veggie dog with veggie chili and cheese and jalapenos on it. I also had local Uel Zing cold brew coffee. On top of these two things, they have fantastic fries, and the staff are super friendly. The decor is also appropriate and fun. It's overall a wonderful, comfortable place to be.

Text: Great hotdogs. Lots of choices. Some of my french fries tasted like potato chips it was great.  Good amount of food for the price which is fairly cheap.
