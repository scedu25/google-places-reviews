Text: Excellent salad bar, lovely setting, friendly service.  My friends were dissatisfied with their filets ..medium was definitely medium rare to the rare side ...and our orders were all less than piping hot.  We were told two large tables were interfering with normal service.  Nice house wine and both shrimp dishes were delicious if cool.

Text: Absolutely amazing every time we go.  The shrimp scampi is a must.  Made like no other we've had anywhere else and the blackened shrimp Alfredo has so much yummy melted  cheese, you can't go wrong!!

Text: The food and atmosphere are always very good here. I do believe its a little pricey for a town the size of Madison. We can only afford to go there for special occasions.

Text: We had to wait awhile but was worth it.  We both had the coconut shrimp for $20.  Best we have ever had.  Friendly staff and good atmosphere.  We will go back whenever we are in town.
