Text: Went in after the Husker football game yesterday, the place wasn't busy at all. The gentleman that initially took our order was very friendly and had our drinks out reasonably quick. When it came time to order our food a waitress had taken over for our table. Not only did she get our order wrong, our glasses sat empty for at least 20 minutes. It seemed as if she was more interested in conversing with a sibling that was eating there at the same time. I really enjoy the food here when I get what I order but the lack of service is going to make it hard to go back.

Text: Very good food, especially the steaks and onion rings. The patty melt isn't bad. Friendly service and not many customers were there so we got our orders taken quickly. Highly recommend.

Text: Service was terrible and they served me the other tables food on two plates. Over cooked hamburger. Slow and the place was quite empty.

Text: Service was prompt and happy. Tables are spaced out. Food for my group was good but the fries for the fish and chips were a little soggy.
