Text: Passing thru on way home to TX.  Burgers and fries were great.  Service was friendly and attentive.  If we are ever back this way will definitely visit again.  Stayed across the highway at Shepherds Inn... also a fine establishment.

Text: We're not from here, but decided to eat here on vacation and it did not disappoint! We had wings, pizza, burger and fries. Everything was delicious! They also have a great choice in both domestic and craft beers. Great liquor selection as well and great service! I would definitely suggest this as a place to go!

Text: We were seated quickly and drink orders taken promptly. We decided to order the pretzel for an appetizer. It came out at the same time as our pizza and wings; which is to say quite a while after ordering. The pizza was ok; nothing spectacular. Kinda reminded us of a frozen pizza. The wings were tasty enough but not really up to a good serving temperature (they were cooked thoroughly). My guess is that there was some timing issues in the kitchen and our wings sat "in the window".
