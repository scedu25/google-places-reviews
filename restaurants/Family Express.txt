Family Express

Text: Hands down the most friendly convenience store I have ever been in my entire 40+ year life. The same associates have worked there since we moved to Lebanon two years ago. They greet every person with a smile and know most return customers by name. The gas is quality and on point with all the other major stations in town in price.
