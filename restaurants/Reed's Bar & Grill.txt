Text: Great spot for a lunch on our road trip home. Tucked back off the interstate but worth the 5 minutes it takes to get there. Great little spot and awesome menu options! Check it out if traveling Avenue of the Saints!

Text: Nice, laid back place to get some really good eats. Friendly staff and patrons for a welcoming feel. Alcohol is served here and smoking is allowed so be warned! If it bothers you, please don't go, that's your right, as is it's also the smokers right, simple.
