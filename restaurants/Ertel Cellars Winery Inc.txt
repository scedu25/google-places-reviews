Text: It's a nice option for dinner around Batesville.  We enjoyed their traminette.  Nice setting.  Take a friend or meet up with family.

Text: I highly recommend their roasted peppers and portabello mushroom appetizer dish, and their salads are amazing. It's a great place to stop for lunch as it's usually not terribly busy, and the building looks gorgeous illuminated by sunlight. Don't forget to stop at the bar for free tasting; you might find something you want to take home! Their wine is not cheap, but if you have a sweet tooth for wine like I do, it's worth every penny.

Text: Everything was strikingly bland, with the surprise of their ability to leave even the horseradish without flavor due to improper preservation. Pork was overcooked, and mashed potatoes unseasoned. Her pasta was good though.
