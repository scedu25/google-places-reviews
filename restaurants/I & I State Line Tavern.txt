Text: I have ate about everything on the menu. I have no complaints. Fresh quality food for the price. Although they changed their fries and I liked the old ones better. The new type are delicious also. Just a preference. But what really makes the place are the owners and staff. Dave, Theresa ,Loran , Tracy, and can't leave out Gary. Love all those peeps. My favorite is the Chicken BLT ! Awesome sauce. !

Text: Late night hours and pool table make this a great place to hang after the local bars close.  Always run into fun people and pick up a game of pool with strangers who always turn out to be a lot of fun.
