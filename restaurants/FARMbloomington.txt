Text: A very eclectic spot with a minimal menu! They had some good options for the everyday eater and some more unique offerings as well. The fish tacos were really good, nicely portioned and had great flavor. The tomato soup was excellent and had a unique pureed texture and was full of flavor. Highly recommend trying it out. The fresh raspberry lemonade was a little tart for my taste though.

Text: Fabulous, super fresh food and good service in fun environment. We had the sautéed kale which had lots of flavor, a big red pizza which was mozzarella and pesto and fresh tomatoes, and the autumn risotto which featured beets. For dessert we split a piece of carrot cake which was a bit unusual in that it was spicier and a little drier than what you typically think of. It was also very good.

Text: Delicious food prepared from locally sourced ingredients, good beer selection (regional and local craft beer, some import), great cocktails. Atmosphere varies, but is generally positive vibe. It can get busy on weekends, so I would make reservations -- especially if there is a major event happening in town. Parking is available in the lot behind the building, accessible via 4th street.

Text: Really great food for bloomington in an interesting environment.  Be prepared to pay just over $100 for two with basic meal, drinks and dessert.  Service was personal and well done.

Text: It was perfect Sunday dinner. I was not hungry at all because I ate a lot before the dinner. However, the gorgeous foods enabled me to keep eating. 

We ordered garlic french fries, Steamed?! Salmon, Tuna cold noodle with wasabi sauce, and quesadilla, (beer but I cannot remember what was the name.)

What I love most was proper seasoned and fresh ingredients. Seasoning was not too much and it got along with ingredients’ their own taste. I will never forget their wonderful harmonies in my tongue. 

I just visited bloomington to see my sister, but I really want to go this restaurant without any reason.
