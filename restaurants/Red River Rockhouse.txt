Text: Good food for the price. Quality ingredients just burgers cooked too long.  All came well done with the cheese super melted to where it wasn't on the burger much.  Cook them less and u may have some thing.  Good beer selection and the fries are great.  Especially the sweet potato fries.

Text: Very popular eatery in the Red River Gorge. The outside was not very attractive but did have a place to dine outside and enjoy the beautiful weather. Inside, there was a nice clean atmosphere. They are considered a farm to table fresh restaurant within 50 miles. (That is a plus) Beer on tap and in bottle. Wine. Soda.. etc. No ice for drinks though.??  We ordered two cheeseburgers with French fries.. took all of an hour+ to get them to the table. Very, very busy place. People parked beside the road to eat here! ? French fries were awesome. Burger was good. Biggest downfall was how long it took to get our food and it was rather pricey. Would I go back? Yes. I would go back if I were not in a hurry to get somewhere.?

Text: 5 stars for the food, but -1 for the strange hours. Twice I went there hungry and ready to chow only to find it all locked up and no one there. The one time I went when they were open I had the tacos and they were to die for! Definitely want to have them again.
