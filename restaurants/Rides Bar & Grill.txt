Text: A nice stop for some domestic beers and mixed drinks. The food was good. I had a burger and fries but I would have another.  Quick turn off old 20 to have a refreshing drink and a bite to eat with friends and family.

Text: Burn out burger was more like gross out burger. Falsely listed as being covered in cheese. It's covered in disgusting artificial Nacho cheese goop. Everything on it seemed like it was over a day old. I actually had to go into the men's room to spit out the last bite of the mystery meat. I had about 10 flies hovering all over my head while I sat there. Then I go to pay only to find this "restaurant" doesn't accept anything but cash in 2017. I rarely give bad reviews but this place is horrible. Might be a better place to stop for a beer but they should stop serving food. Nasty.
