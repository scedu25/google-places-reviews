Text: The food is always great here and affordable. If you like tenderloins like I do be prepared to ask for a to go box!!! The pies are also yummy delicious. Most of the wait staff know us by name and also knows what kind of drinks to bring us depending on the time of day and what time of year it is!!!!! They also work around my food allergies which makes it even more enjoyable for me unlike some other places that just scrape it off and send it back out to me.

Text: Just like the other midtown, the food has zero flavor. Bring your own spices if you want flavor in the food. Its homestyle comfort food.  For the prices you could probably make a lot tastier food at home. Location is clean, but staff are not the friendliest.

Text: Disappointing.   I've eaten at the east side location and it was great. However, the west side location has the same food (no problem there); but that's about it on the good stuff.  Went there for the first time and waited 45 minutes from sitting down to getting our food.  There were about 10 people in the place (four in our group) , so I have no clue to the problem.  I can see the help isn't as good as the east side either.  So, in my book....drive to the east side location!

Text: We like to go to places that serve great food and everyone there takes care of you.  We enjoy both Jan and Bruce and the entire staff.  Well done.  I recommend  them to all friends and family and others dining out.

Text: Great staff, great prices- hands down the best onion rings and bacon cheeseburger I have had in a looooong time! ALSO THEY RECENTLY REMODELED! Place is super clean and looks great! They are also great about accomodating larger groups (with a bit of notice ;))
