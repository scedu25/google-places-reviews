Text: This is a great place to enjoy Balkan cuisine. The food is fantastic, as it tastes excellent. The prices are very reasonable, especially given the quality of food, service, and atmosphere that one receives.  My only concern would be that if you go early you can wait a while to be served as the prepare for the evening rush. Still, I would suggest it to anyone who wants to try something new.

Text: Great atmosphere!  It is much bigger than it looks.  The food was outstanding. 15 people were in our party and everyone enjoyed their meals. It was a great place. We'll be back!

Text: If you like Eastern European food or vibes, this place is great. The meat is always perfectly grilled, the salads are fresh, and the service is very welcoming. The quince brandy is a pleasure tour a for the palate.

Text: The food is amazing quality and very delicious, and the portions are just right to fill you up without over-stuffing you. If you're a fan of brandies or liquors, ask about some of the dessert wines and cordials--our table got a few to sample, and they were amazing! Service was on point. Their prices are higher than I normally go for, but it is absolutely worth it! Definitely a special occasion place, or even a not-so-special occasion place if you can!
