Homemade Heaven

Text: Not great, but not bad either. Almost $30 for some chicken strips and a sandwich and for that price I was expecting something a little better. Very dark in the place too. The lady that took our order was nice and the bread that I got with my chicken strips and fries was pretty good, but if I'm ever in Nebraska again I think I'll pass on this place.

Text: I order the veggie every time. Best quality sandwich I've ever had. I always feel like a million bucks after eating it. The $10 price is most definitely worth it. Not that much more than subway or Jimmy Johns but way better quality.  Pretzels are amazing too. Some nice hard working ladies run the place. Great selection as well. It really is homemade heaven.

Text: Poor service. Coffee had no flavor, tasted like grounds reused. Not impressed at all.

Text: Home made, yes, but quality was lacking. Basic ingredients and basic technique made for a couple of disappointing meals.
