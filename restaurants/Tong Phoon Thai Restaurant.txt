Text: It was great! They were able to get me in very quickly (same day in 20 min) and I really needed it due to some bad headaches. Angela gave me a 90 min deep massage and she did a great job. You could here some customers coming in and speaking with the worker up front but that doesn't bother me at all. They were very nice and professional. I will be going back.

Text: Wonderful and kind service. The best Thai restaurant this side of the Mississippi River. Flavorful. Warm when it needs to be warm and cold when needed.

Text: Really a nice place for some Thai food with reasonable prices.. been there for a lunch on a really sunny day.. the ambience isn't that great, but really good for the price and location for that restaurant.. they have a really large selection of the items in the menu, the waiters are really helpful to help us choose the food.. they do come in very good quality.. my personal complaint is that, their desserts aren't that great.. they have around 4 varieties for desserts, we tried 3 of them.. they aren't that great, just a sticky rice and different topping on it.. I would suggest not to take the black rice pudding, it's just a waste of money.. rest are at least ok to eat them..

Text: One of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. Has a "National Pride of Thailand" award. Has been family owned since it opened around 8 or so years ago. And the food has only gotten better. Delicious. Probably my favorite restaurant in Fairview Heights.

Text: Nice people, small restaurant. Not real fast but the food is the best Thai food I've every had. They also do take-out.
