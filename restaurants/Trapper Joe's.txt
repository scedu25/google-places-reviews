Text: Sit down restaurant where you can get a proper Bacon Cheese Burger and Fries for under $7. Best Chicken fried steak for at least 50 miles. This is a real family run restaurant and I especially like to go there for Sunday lunch. Very friendly and personable. My only complaint is that it is a little cold in the winter, but I still go.
