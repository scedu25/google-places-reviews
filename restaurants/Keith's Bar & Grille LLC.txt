Text: 4.7 stars.  Somebody has not been truthful on the reviews.  The location, if your riding the trails is the only thing good about this place.  The food did not even rise to the level of fast food quality.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it barely had any chicken on it.  It was a very small chicken patty, far less quality then any fast food but with sit down restaurant prices.  The menu actually listed the chicken wings at "market value."  What the heck does that mean, we're not talking about lobster tails at a fine restaurant.  Wings have been steadily price for decades.  There were several other food products that either read "market value" or had no price listed at all.  It is clear that "Market value" means they price their customers and not their food.  We had a table of 4 and all the meals were barely eatable and was of poor quality and very little taste.

Text: This is a great trail or local stop! The waiter, Tori, was such a sweetheart! She took care of us and even hooked us up with some extra ranch for the road. The fried pretzels were great! Fresh pork rinds were so good and crunchy! Hillbilly fries were amazing with their ranch dressing! I will visit every time I hit the trails!

Text: Have been here several times and the staff are the nicest people you would ever want to meet. And the food, as far as I am concerned is the best around.
