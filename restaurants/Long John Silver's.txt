Text: Not sure if it was just the time I went, but it was pretty messy inside, and the bathrooms were in poor shape. Food was good and hot, but they had ran out of hush puppies!  Bummer

Text: Floors in this piece are slippery from grease.  Food prep area is disgusting. Won't be back.  It's a shame because LJS is one of my favorite places to eat.
