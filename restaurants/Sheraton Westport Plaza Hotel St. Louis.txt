Sheraton Westport Plaza Hotel St. Louis
Rating: 4
Text: Good location - near many restaurants and trendy bars. Very far from downtown. Rooms are clean and spacious. Elevators are old and rickety. Some of the afternoon front desk staff were rude and cold; however, not all employees are unwelcoming. AJ, an employee, was very friendly, patient, and helpful.

Text: Great hotel for the event overall. Rooms were nice and staff was helpful. Only issue was that the perfume/air freshener they used throughout the hotel was overpowering from the moment you walk in the door.

Text: My car was towed while staying at this hotel. The parking lot was being resurfaced, and I didn't notice the signs. It was moved to an adjacent parking lot, and the hotel staff helped me find it.

The lobby entrance within the Westport complex is on the second floor in a corner - it is hard to find. I've posted a photo of the nearest exterior entrance (it is somewhat derelict). It is at the top of the outside staircase opposite the Starbucks.

Exterior windows have streaks, discoloration, and stains - picture uploaded.

It's the eclipse weekend, and I called the concierge earlier this week looking for the viewing glasses. The concierge said that she had never heard of such a thing and said "sir no sir, we cannot help you sir!" Other than this exchange, the hotel was reasonably friendly and helpful.

Text: Service is good. Exterior and room was dated, but room was clean. My room was unusually loud,it sounded like water hammering, but may have been the elevator, even though I was far from the elevator. Staff was great, and is somewhat good location near the airport.
