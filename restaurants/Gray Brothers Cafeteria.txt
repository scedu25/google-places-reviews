Text: Great home style lunch! More than than enough options to satisfy any appetite and taste. Plenty of room in the dining room but I can definitely see it getting packed after church let's out. Overall great experience, if I'm ever in the area I'd try it out again!

Text: Don't know what has happened but on my last visit, and it may be my last, I got carry-out, trusting that the same delicious food would be served only to find that Friday's Mac and Cheese was more like left from Wednesday before, crunchy hard. The Harvard beets ( three of them) we old, oversized and the was no sauce. Not fit to eat. Then the chicken wasn't Gray's Famous #2 in the state fried chicken.  What is Going On?!  They got one star because there is no lower option.

Text: Excellent meal and very good service. Waitresses were very good at taking care of drinks and the workers on the line made things move along smoothly. Also saw a great (and rare) act, a gentleman working the food line thanked the military veterans for their service. Great place and worth the stop!

Text: Amazing food all the time! Friendly staff and plenty of room to set. Even worth waiting in line for almost 45 minutes!

Text: Good food. We do carry out.  Only thing is when the gift shop is closed (where you pick up your food sometimes) and you have to go to the cashier you have to cut in front of people to get your food.  It's  awkward or you get the cashiers attn if you don't want to be rude and be on the other side of the pie case.   Put a bell or something up on the pie case so they know.
