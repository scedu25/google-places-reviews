#1 China Buffet
Rating: 5
Text: I’ve eaten at this establishment many times and it is by far one of my favorite places to dine. The food is always hot and fresh, there is a smaller selection, but what they do have is really good. The only small complaint that I have is that in the summer months it’s really hot inside, due to the size of the building.
