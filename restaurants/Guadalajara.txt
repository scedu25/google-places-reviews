Text: Quick and yummy!! Called for a pick up order with 7 different orders all together. When i got there, the Manager personally carried my big order to my vehicle for me, was very nice and professional. Got back to work with my huge order and EVERYTHING was correct, hot, and delish! .. Good work Guadalajara!
