Text: Would be five stars, but the buffet was kind of empty. Being on limited time for lunch I was not able to wait for refills, but the food I did eat was very good.
As an aside, I'd love to have seen cheesecake.

Text: The meats on the buffet are quite good. The fried fish is special if it is freshly cooked. The veggies need help though.

Text: There are no words to explain how amazing the food is! We have traveled 5 hours to visit Holiday World 3 years in a row and this is top on our list every year. If I had to have a last meal... This would be it
