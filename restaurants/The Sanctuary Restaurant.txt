Text: This is easily the best restaurant in Shenandoah! The food is wonderful.  I have never had anything I didn't absolutely love. The atmosphere is awesome,  being an old converted church with gorgeous windows.  The service is friendly and warm. Well worth the time to visit this gem in Shenandoah!
