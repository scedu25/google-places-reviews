Paisano's

Text: Excellent service and atmosphere; nice outdoor area. Toasted ravioli was St. Louis perfect. Iceberg in an Italian salad seemed generic; should be romaine. Wait and have coffee someplace else. Entries were good not amazing. Attentive, knowledgeable and even charming waitstaff.

Text: My husband ordered 15 layer Lasagna....not, and bland. My brother in law ordered spaghetti tastes like it came out of the can. I ordered Filet Pepper Gorgonzola with garlic red skin potatoes, that was ok but the potatoes needed butter and salt. All and all not a restaurant I would recommend for a good Italian meal. I gave it two stars because I ordered my steak medium well and they got it right also the service wasn't bad.

Text: Don't listen to these negative comments. I've been here probably 5 times and every single experience has been absolutely fantastic! Everything is good and tons of portions. The bread sticks are to die for! They are the best thing I've ever tasted! If you can get the white sauce on your pasta. A+

Text: Paisanos is every bit as good (if not better) than Olive Garden but doesnt make me go deal with Wanamaker traffic. The wait is usually short and the staff friendly. My picky 10 uear old loves it here!
