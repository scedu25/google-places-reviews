Text: Food is always good. Never had an order I did not like. Sometimes a bit noisy. Easy to find. Clean and good service.

Text: Food was amazing. The place was clean. The server we had got very distracted by our kids and I had to keep repeating my order. However, our orders were right! He also was very knowledgeable of the different styles of ribs. For example the difference between baby back and St. Louis style ribs. He was very detailed. You also get a decent amount of food.

Text: Food was ok at best. Service was very slow. Last 3 visits have taken 40+ minutes to get our food. (dining-in and carry-out)

Text: Great dessert options. I particularly love the blackberry cobbler. Very lean chopped brisket, great smoked chicken & turkey. Great daily specials -- all-you-can-eat ribs on Tues. & Ladies' Night on Wed. with half-priced entries. The stuffed baked potato is particularly good. I like mine with chopped brisket.
