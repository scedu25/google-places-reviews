Text: The food is always good and the drinks strong. The bartenders and waitresses are always friendly and there's always live music at some point during the week. It's my new favorite place to watch live, local music.

Text: We had a small group for a birthday lunch. We were surprised to see few people there. The wait staff was very good as well as the food. They serve your typical bar food such as wraps, sandwiches fries or chips but they are good. I have eaten good salads there too but settled for a wrap this time.

The dining room was clean. There is ample parking to the north and a larger parking area on the west side. I believe their larger crowds come at night.
