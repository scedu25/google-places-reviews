Text: Unfortunately the first time I have ever been here! Worst pizza ever and quite possibly rudest worker I have ever came across! Literally very little to no sauce at all! Wish I could add a picture to show everyone! If you order extra cheese you may want to order triple cheese when we asked why there wasn't cheese on the one corner and was told that's were the crust bubbled up so there would be any cheese there. LMAO!!! I have order enough pizza in my life to know better!

Text: Pizza and subs were awesome. Having recently reopened in a new building (actually an old gas station), I think they were still in the process of 'making it their own'.
