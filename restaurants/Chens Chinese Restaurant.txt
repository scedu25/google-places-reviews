Text: Decent, relatively cheap food. Not the best in town but definitely not the worst. Worth a visit if you haven't already.

Text: Will not be back. The waitress was very nice. However, they brought me an entirely different entree than what I ordered. When I asked about it, the manager did not want to take responsibility for the mistake. The food my family had was average at best and overpriced

Text: Chen's Hot and Sour Soup is excellent! :-D One of the best I've ever had and only $3.25 for a large!!!!!  Their Cheese Rangoon are good size and the Szechuan Chicken is delicious!!  
If you want authentic homemade Sweet and Sour Sauce, this isn't the place to come. It tastes factory-made ):  Their Lemon Sauce tastes funny too. 
Overall I give them 4 stars ????? for their soup, friendliness, and great customer service.  I'd come back but not to eat anything sweet and sour.
