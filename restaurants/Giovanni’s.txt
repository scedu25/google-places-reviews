Text: Terrible service! Food that was there was cold. Buffet was empty even though there weren't many customers.They were out of certain drinks and the waitress seemed annoyed that she had to tell us which were available. When we complained the mgr was rude. Member of kitchen staff walked by and said, "who cares." Terrible, terrible, terrible!
