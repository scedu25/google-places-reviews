Text: What a great atmosphere to sit for dinner.  Owners on site and very friendly to talk to.  Food was very fresh and tasty.  Had buffet and they didn't put pizza out until you got there to make sure it was fresh.  Had six different types of wings and also small salad bar.  Great family setting with friendly wait staff. Will definitely visit again when in the area.

Text: So delicious!! In town for work, decided to try Chet & Matt's Pizza. The crust isn't too thin or too thick, and still manages to be crispy on the bottom. Delicious sauce, toppings, and cheeses. Our waitress was so sweet and friendly. Couldn't be happier about eating here today!!

Text: Staying at the Comfort Inn & Suites. We were so delighted that we ordered from here.  They delivered it quickly and with spectacular portion sizes. The service was friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. We got some sandwiches and a pizza and the fried chicken salad. Astronomical.  I would recommend you guys every time, and hands down any time we show up in town we will be eating here. Thanks for making our first night in Ohio awesome.

Text: This place is fantastic. Recommend going during the buffet first so you can find the pizza you like best when the buffet is not going on. We love the buffalo chicken pizza and the cheesy potato pizza. Must do after cedar point. AWESOME!

Text: Ordered leaving our hotel 7 miles away.  All 3 pizzas were ready, correct as ordered and HOT when we arrived 15 minutes later.  Staff was helpful and very friendly.  I'm picky when it comes to pizza and these were excellent!!   All four kids loved them too.  Loved it was also cut in strips making it easier for the youngest to eat.
