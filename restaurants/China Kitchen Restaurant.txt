Text: My husband & I personally LOVE this place! The owners are always very attentive, their food is always amazing & they have even opened early for me so I could get my "fix" of chicken on a stick!

Text: The food is fine. Some of the entrees are quite good. The hot and sour is a little different. But the times I have eaten there the place has been completely empty. Can be a little awkward.

Text: Food is Soggy and Expensive you do get a good serving of it though and it does have some taste but not near what it should.
