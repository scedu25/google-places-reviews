Text: Good food! Pancakes were fluffy without being too dense, my idea of perfect. Went on a Very busy Sunday so service was good for it being so packed. Can't wait to come back and bring more of the family!

Text: Great selection, great food, excellent service, and nice atmosphere highly recommended. I would give them a 5 but I reserve that for my mother's cooking!

We have eaten here twice before and have gone a long way out of our way in order to patronize this restaurant.

Text: Service was terrible, very unfriendly. Food was not very good. I came from out of town, went to Yelp and this was a horrible experience. Will not make this mistake again.

Text: Love our visit to Le Peep!! They have the best Oatmeal with brown sugar and sassy apples on the side. We had coffee, orange juice and bagel too. Perfect healthy breakfast to start our day. Our waitress was the best, very attentive ( sorry I forgot her name). Usually we get a big breakfast, eggs, toast , sausage, the whole works.  We have always been very pleased with our experience at Le Peep.

Text: Good food. Horrible service. Rude server. Extremely long wait. Food was good but not worth the wait. I'll just keep going to Childers.
