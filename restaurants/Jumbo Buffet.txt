Jumbo Buffet
Rating: 1
Text: First and last time there. Arrived close to dinner time. The Mac n cheese looked like noodles drowned in milk. The corn appeared to have milk in it as well. So steered clear of the dried out and nasty food. Water tasted awful. Outdated prices on their website. To top it off I went to pay and crawling on the counter was a baby roach. As I signed my receipt I watched the lady squish the roach with her finger and slid it down the counter toward her. I immediately washed my hands told my family we are never coming back. In the area where they pour drinks I watched the lady who waited on us stepping on roaches. This place is beyond disgusting. I would not ever eat there again not even if someone paid me to. There were children running around (not customers) which did not bother me. But when their being yelled at from across the room. Might as well eat in my own home. Slightly cheaper then QQ Buffet but now I know why.

Text: This place is horrible! The food is never fresh, the buffet is always empty. If you ask for fresh food they get mad and act like your an inconvenience to them. Do not take a chance at this place you will be disappointed. There are little kids working here we where checked out but a 8 year old, the other kids are running around and screaming. It seams that they are running a daycare inside of the restaurant.

Text: Absolutely the worst service I have ever received, from the owner herself!  The food is awful, undercooked, all the fried food was cold and hard, and I had the most awful experience here.
If you want to go here, I wouldn't suggest it.  It's ten dollars per person for low quality, imitation food that can actually pose a health risk to your family.  The owner is also very immature, and she screamed at me when I had politely complained about the quality of her food, and service.  She legitimately argued with me for ten minutes, and it was really one way.  I could not have been politer, and she was screaming at me.  Then, she stormed off into the kitchen and screamed at her staff about me.  I will never go her again, and I don't think you should either!

Text: Food was cold and did not appear fresh at my 11am visit. Disappointed with the selection and price for poor quality food. Staff was unfriendly. Will not return.
