Golden Harbor Authentic Chinese Cuisine
Rating: 5
Text: Golden Harbor can easily boast the best Chinese food in Illinois, outside of Chicago's Chinatown. I don't know why it's so hard to find really good authentic Chinese food, but it is. Patrons who can read Chinese order their food with paddles they grab from a menu board, but they have a westernized menu for those who don't read Chinese; Western patrons fill out their own tickets at Golden Harbor, and servers bring the food to the patrons' tables. It's a rare experience in the Midwest, and to be honest, the ambience leaves a little too be desired (it's a minimalist aesthetic)—but the food is some of the best I have had. We tend to get the General Tso's Tofu and Taro Buns for dessert (sometimes, we get the Sesame Balls, instead of our favorite Taro Buns). I also recommend the Veggie Pot Stickers and the Garlic Eggplant, but we have enjoyed everything we have tried there.

Text: Best Taiwanese restaurant in Chambana. Authentic and good. You can't go wrong. They have an Americanized menu as well.

Text: Found this through Trip Advisor. Walked in and you fill out your own order, stand in line and give to cashier. Then you have a number and find a table. The service was quick, the food was hot, water and tea are no charge...and no tipping. Best Chinese food we've had in years.

Text: Most extensive menu I've ever seen.  Simple order process with self serve leftover containers and beverages.  I only tried one dish so far, but it was good.  It was sweet & sour shrimp.  They used that red sweet sauce, but I prefer the golden apricot kind myself.  I was not able to find an online menu, so I took pictures of all the menu pages and added them to the photos.

Text: As you enter, you'll find a huge menu on the wall.  In Chinese.  That's because they offer truly authentic Chinese cuisine, in addition to the familiar American versions of some (okay many) dishes.    They have many things that I'd never before seen on a Chinese Restaurant's menu, and every thing I've tried has been delicious.
They serve things family style, and are as happy to serve two as twenty -- and do it well for both.
