Text: One of the best places in town to get Thai and Vietnamese food. I love their Pho. The service as great and the ambience is really cozy and comfortable. Give them a try

Text: I've tried many Thai places and this one is still my favorite.  It is family owned and they usually make at least one yearly trip to Thailand and bring back ingredients.  I don't think you can get more legit than that in Illinois.  
The spice index does run hot, though, so "mild" may be too spicy for you.

Text: Best Thai food i have ever had. The curry is out of this world! I have tried over 10 different dishes and have loved them all! A must visit. It's a hole in the wall but the best food in CU IMO

Text: Crab Rangoon is legit.  And the crepe dish thing was amazing.  Very unique tastes and food.  You must try it.
