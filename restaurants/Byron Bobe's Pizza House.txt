Byron Bobe's Pizza House

Text: Great pizza through the years! 

We have been getting pizza from here since I was 10 (i'm 36 now) and it still ranks among my top 3 places to get pizza in the US.  I've had pizza from all over and tried as many variations as I could, Chicago (lived there for 8 years), New York, LA, etc.

Not only is this pizza style different from most but it is always delicious.  If i'm ever in Vincennes visiting family, or passing through I try to make every effort to pick up a pizza from here.

A lot of Vincennes locals will try to convince you that Bill Bobe's on 6th is better but they are wrong.

This is the best pizza in Vincennes.

Text: Unfortunately you have to give places at least a one star rating. Their pizza is so disgusting that they don't even deserve that. This place is so bad that it deserves negative 5 starts.  Go somewhere else so you don't waste your time and money.
