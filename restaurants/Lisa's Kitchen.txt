Lisa's Kitchen

Text: We were so glad to find this place! The food was fantastic and fresh, and the owner was so nice. She uses a lot of her own garden vegetables, and even the iced tea and French fries were homemade. The pad Thai was great and the spice level was exactly what I asked for. It's not the place to try if you are in a hurry- she was the only one in the kitchen and everything was made fresh- but it was worth the wait!

Text: We loved this place! The food was delicious, the vegetables were cooked to perfection, and just like they said, they're fresh out of her very own garden! Lisa herself cooked everything quickly and lovingly. The best crab Rangoon I've ever had!

Text: Popped in shortly before closing for a quick bite for my toddler. A cute, cozy little Place and she seems to do everything there. She quickly whipped up some grilled cheese, fries and a bowl of fried rice. Did the trick.
