Text: This is a great place. The food is as good as any high dollar restaurant I've been to in the KC Metro area. The service is great too. If you're hungry and in the area, I highly recommend this place.

Text: We were in town for cider fest and decided to stop here for lunch. The owner was very friendly suggested some other places to stop while in town. The food was good my husband and I had BBQ. Would definitely go back! Loved the friendly service!

Text: Great food. Everything is fresh.  They make all of their own dressings and sauc s and they are all good.  The fried foods have a light, crispy batter.  Great deck outdoors overlooking a wooded creek. Service is good.  Fabulous Sunday brunch buffet!

Text: My sister and I were passing through to Kansas city and decided we would try this place. The food was amazing! It was also really cute inside. You can book the place for big events which I think is a great idea if I lived nearby

Text: Usually have great experience anf food at Timbercreek. Was disappointed to find that mac and cheese has been removed from the kids menu. Might seem like a small change but had a huge impact on our evening. I dont understand that decision
