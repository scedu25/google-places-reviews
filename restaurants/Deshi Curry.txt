Deshi Curry

Text: Awesome food, great service, cozy place... 

But I probably will not be coming back personally. You get medium-small portion sizes, almost every dish is about $11. Simpler dishes are a couple bucks cheaper.

However, it's an excellent choice if you're okay with the price and portion sizes. So I rate well.

Text: It is the only Bangladeshi restaurant in town. Food is okay, biriani dishes are no where near like what it is in Bangladesh! Would only recommend to go when there are no other options!

Text: I love deshi curry so much!!! I get the shahi chicken and it's always always perfect. Veggie samosas are on point and the aloo chop will make you cry tears of happiness. Seriously, just eat here now.
