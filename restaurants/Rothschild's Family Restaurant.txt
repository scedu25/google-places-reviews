Text: Never had a bad meal. Fried chicken fantastic. Meat loaf best I ever had  in a restaurant. Home made carrot cake. Comes in on Tuesday.  Have to hurry. Usually  gone by Thursday.  One of
 our favorite places. And the waitresses  are great and friendly.

Text: Always amazing food and service, makes Cowan's look like food from a school cafeteria. Katie has been our server many times and is absolutely amazing! Recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal!

Text: Food is ok, service is ok, the restaurant is out of date and very cramped. I was in there once about 10 years ago and it hasn't changed. I probably won't go back.

Text: Awesome little family restaurant that has been around for a long time.  The biscuits are huge so if you order biscuits and gravy I suggest a half order. I could not finish a full order and it was all I ordered.  It was good with plenty of sausage and was served with good coffee. Good staff and a friendly environment. I will return here if I am in the area.
