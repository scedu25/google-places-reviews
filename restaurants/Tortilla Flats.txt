Text: Don't overlook this gem when at the lake. Food and service are excellent. Don't leave without saying hi to Alma and Rick, owners that care about their customers. Fried ice cream is delicious - worth the stop! Ask Alma for the white cheese dip with crawfish.

Text: The Branding Iron is right next door and always has a full parking lot, while Tortilla Flats looks like a ghost town; and I don't understand why. They have great food and a really friendly staff, along with the best margaritas on the lake. Come between 4 and 6 pm for happy hour and they're practically free. A hidden gem for sure.

Text: Been here forever and always the best food around. Always a recommendation from me.
Tried many places in Kansas City and they would be a winner there.
