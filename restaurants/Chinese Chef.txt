Text: Service was great! Food was hot and fresh! Definitely worth the (rounded up) price of $8 for one person buffet!

Text: I notice there is less and less variety of Asian cuisine choices on the buffet. There are more American choices of food on the menu. And the fried rice doesn't even look like fried rice. Looks like rice cooked with a little bit of egg and yellow food dye. Even the flavor is a bit off from fried rice. Despite all the short cuts taken to make customers happy, the servers are excellent. Prompt attentive service is definitely a plus, so they balance out. However just my opinion more options rather than generic choices for Chinese food would be nice.

Text: Great Chino-American cuisine, great service and good prices make The Chinese Chef the right place for lunch or dinner for the whole family!  Try their buffet or order off the menu, and find your favorite dishes!

Text: We all enjoyed a excellent meal. Price was very reasonable too. The noon "all you care to eat" buffet is only $6.99 per person. Will definitely be going back soon.
