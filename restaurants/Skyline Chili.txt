Skyline Chili

Text: I didn't eat here. I don't like skyline chili. I was, however, standing next to the restaurant, checking a message while a group of hookers was paraded down the sidewalk by their pimps. Did you know that pimps work together? I always thought they were solitary predators. Anyways, 3 stars, just because I'm reviewing Skyline, even though I know I don't like their chili. (Too much cinnamon for my taste)

Text: We ate in and placed an order to go.  Hot food!  Service was great.  They even offered a drink to go.  We ordered one of the AMAZING Greek salad ever to go.  They waited until we were closer to leaving to make it fresh.  Great job, Christian!  You rendered great customer service.

Text: Empolyees are awesome super friendly bunch I met today, but I'm not a fan of the chili to much nutmeg and yes nutmeg in chili and let's not forget the cinnamon... Noodles in chili is weird enough but to ad those spices makes it even weirder. The salad I ended up ordering was Hugh and very good but I got my order to go and for the amount of salad I didn't get enough dressing, but stuff happens. Lol 
Over all great experience if you haven't tried them give them a shot you may like what I didn't.

Text: Great service, great food.  Very affordable. Being originally from Cincinnati,  this location is as close to authentic Cincinnati style chili you can get outside of the greater Cincinnati area.
