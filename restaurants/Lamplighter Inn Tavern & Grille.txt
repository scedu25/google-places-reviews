Text: This place has some great food, with good specials especially pizza on the weekends. The staff is super friendly and the bartenders serve great drinks. The entertainment on weekend nights are always great as well! Definitely would recommend this bar!

Text: One can't help but like this place. When I go, I spend most of my time in the upstairs when they have the open jams. The food's good and the beer is cold!

Text: Great if you're not up for spending a ton of money at the other bars next door. It's by far the best place to get a cheap beer or two. The staff is always super friendly.
