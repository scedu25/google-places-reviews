Text: The thing I liked was it wasn't trashed out like alot places with things torn up. Few years back went to the one downtown that use to be classy wasn't that way anymore. Been awhile since I been out and pleased with how the place was.

Text: Sunset staff were down to earth people who treat their guests like family. Last night was my birthday and Sunset made it easy to have the most fun I've had in a while. Thanks!!!

P.S. Thanks for the clean facilities, you don't see that much in a bar. Lol

Text: Absolutely hostile service to newcomers. I was attracted by the change to smoke free but the attendant didn't greet us just asked for ID and was rude/ condescending several times to the point where my friends suggested leaving mid conversation. He was scowling throughout the experience. This place invites regulars to mind their own business and warns new comers their business is not wanted. Stay clear away.
