Text: A small-town restaurant with a good local vibe. The interior is spacious, split between a dining room and dining/bar area. Classic mid-west building architecture adds to the atmosphere. Choose a seat by the front windows for a view of the lazy Saturday traffic. 

Food and drink choices are clasic Americana. Pork dishes are delicious which should be expected in Iowa. The fried fish is very good as are meals for the kids. Beef choices are multiple and very nicely done. 

There is a full-selection bar and room for special events. A great place to enjoy a meal anytime.
