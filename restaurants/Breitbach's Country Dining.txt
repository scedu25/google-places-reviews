Breitbach's Country Dining
Rating: 5
Text: This was the first time for us at Breitbach's Country Dining at Balltown.  We had heard about it for some time and I must say it lived up to its great reputation!  We stopped at noon on a Wednesday and had the soup and salad bar.  The quality of the food at the salad bar was superb with it also being some of the tastiest food I ever have experienced.  To top off this great lunch, we were served by Lynn, our waitress who was the most pleasant, efficient, and courteous waitress my wife and I have ever had the pleasure to meet.  Even though we live almost a hundred miles away, we certainly plan to be back again!

Text: At first I was a bit disappointed that I did not see a breakfast buffet set up on Saturday morning (I'm guessing that is only a Sunday thing), so I put in an order for some eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast.
After a short wait, the breakfast was brought out on a huge plate. Everything was absolutely delicious, and I could not have eaten any more had it been a buffet. I was absolutely stuffed and it was one of the best tasting breakfasts I have had in a very long time.  All for about 8 bucks, if I remember correctly! I will certainly go back again!

Text: The drive from Cedar Rapids to Breitbach's is lovely. When we went it was incredibly busy but we were seated in an appropriate amount of time. The buffet was wonderful. Broasted  chicken, mashed potatoes,  every other good thing you can come up with. Reasonably priced. But let's talk tenderloins! DELICIOUS. Not those breaded tenderloins that are all breading but real honest to goodness tenderloins. What a great place to eat! And, when you leave be sure and stop at the overlook to see the Mississippi and the farm lands below.
