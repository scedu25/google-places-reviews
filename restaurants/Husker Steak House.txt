Text: Our experience here did not begin well as we entered via the door to the bar.  We stood there wondering what to do while several employees walked by.  After a painfully long time we managed to get the attention of an employee and explained we were there to eat.  After hastily telling us we needed to go outside and use the "other" door she quickly told us we could also walk through the bar to get to the dining room.  From that point everything was lovely!

The steaks we had were wonderful although we ordered medium rare and they arrived well done.  The cuts were excellent and flavorful.  The sides of a loaded baked potato and corn were both fresh and delightful.  Our servers were also great.  The price was more than fair so at the end of the night I have to recommend this place!  Just make sure you use the correct door;)

Text: As new arrivals in this state, the first two times my wife and I ate here the experience was great.  After that even with a reservation and arriving early and waiting by the counter for 45 minutes they still told us they had no table for us that we could sit back by the bar now or wait another 30-45 minutes.  We noticed upon entering and while we were waiting, there was a table in the front with a reserved sign on it that we asked about several times.  Eventually we said we would look at the table back by the bar.  After seating and ordering we learned it happened to be right next to the smokers exit which was opened very often and was very cold and the smoke was unbearable.  We asked several times to be moved and were told there were no tables available.  There were 4-5 tables that needed clearing and cleaning off.  They weren’t in a hurry to do it, so we stayed in the same spot.  The next time we came (also with a reservation) while waiting we eventually told the “hostess” about the previous experience and she said “well next time don’t sit there”.  This was after waiting 45 minutes (30 mins after our reservation time).  We waited @ 15-20 minutes longer asking when our table would be ready and they couldn’t tell us so we left.  Is this how they treat their customers?  I’d like to hear what the owner says about this!  We haven’t been back since.

Text: Didn't like the food at all. As our side we had spaghetti .. tasted musty to us like the sauce sat there for awhile.  My husband is a big eater... He didn't even finish half the plate. Could be better!

Text: Great food and service.  I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly and a generous portion.  Wife had Salmon and daughter crab legs.  Son had hickory ribeye.  All of it was good.  Recommend this Columbus gem.
