Text: Girlfriend and I stopped for a quick shower and were ultimately surprised with their showers! 2 sinks 2 shower heads in long shower with glass door and a HEATED FLOOR! The BEST shower on the road! Spent an hour and a half because it was so awesome! And I found a great necklace for the girl too. She's super happy now which makes for a happy time lol.

Text: I've been through Beto Junction on and off my entire life from the 60s-current days! Dad was a trucker - Beto had good chicken fried steaks, hot coffee - and for as long as I can remember - excellent, pleasant wait staff. Its grown over the years and yet, to me, it maintains on the road comforts - it is one of the best truck stops ever..and besides, Beto was an indicator we would be pulling into home terminal soon and then home!

Text: We love stopping in on our trips from Nebraska to Oklahoma. Clean bathrooms, interesting things to look at, great choice of beverages and snack items. I like that they put items on clearance sale also. The restaurant has been hit and miss, one time it may be a great experience and the next not. But we will continue to stop in.

Text: Love this truck stop. People are super nice. And they have a huge parking lot, just real bumpy.

Text: Nice clean truck stop, new roomy clean showers, and a huge rock lot below for oversize/ long loads. Good food in the restaurant,  and they actually have a smoker, and soft serve ice cream.
