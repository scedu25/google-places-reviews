Text: The food is generally good and fresh. However they have consistently gotten my order wrong during every visit. Most recently charging me for a beverage that I did not order. As usual they hem and haw about a refund or a replacement until it is easier to take the loss and leave. The food is usually good if you get what you order.

Text: We went once or twice. Thought we'd give them a chance. Bad idea. The 2nd visit was worse than the 1st. Our shrimp was undercooked and there was so much grease you could squeeze it out of the fish. My wife got sick that night. So if you want D's, go to E-town. I heard they're good.
