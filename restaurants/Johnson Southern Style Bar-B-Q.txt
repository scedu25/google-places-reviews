Text: This is the greatest, Bbq, local business.  It's my favorite BBQ sauce on the world! I've lived in Florida and Missouri,  and Tennessee , yet I always missed Johnson's BBQ sauce, and I'm actually a vegetarian.  So I buy the sauce and sides, and add it to my veggu burgers.  It's all natural ingredients. I buy the BBQ for the rest of my family, and they all race about it.  This is more of a take out kind of place; there is no in door seatinf, but if the weather is good,  you can dine outside, he has a few tables.  Drive up and order, or call in to go.  If looking for some local flavor,  this place is a must! Buy a bottle of his Southern BBQ sauce, and also the sweet and spicy, both are fantastic!  You will want to take the sauce home! You probably want extra 's gifts. Great stuff, great local food, great family owned business.

Text: Good food. I've had trouble in the past getting their attention to order, but haven't experienced that in awhile.  Sauce is pretty good.
