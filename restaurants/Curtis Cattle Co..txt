Text: Prime rib dinner, best in town! Nothing fancy, just loads of beef and 2 sides. Absolutely delicious, includes horseradish if you ask. Not sauce, good ol' horseradish

Text: Cheeseburger and fries tasty.  Prime rib sandwich also good.  Service was slow with but one waitress and the  place began filling up.  Plan accordingly.  I'll likely stop in again intermittently when in town.
