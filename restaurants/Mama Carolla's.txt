Text: Great atmosphere. Great food. A little too hectic on a busy Saturday night to recommend for a romantic dinner. Will be back.

Text: We were seated outside without being asked (I don't like eating with insects) and service was slow. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable, food was EXCELLENT! I had the chicken rigatoni which was wonderful and a little spicy. My wife enjoyed a Caesar salad with salmon and was delighted. I'll return and request a table inside.

Text: NEVER AGAIN. This was my first time there and I was with a friend. They highly recommended it. Upon arrival the hostess was extremely rude and acted like we were interrupting her conversation and that we were bothering her. After that we were seated and the bread and salad came. Honestly I've had much better salads at much less expensive places. The bread was just ok to. Nothing to go home and call mom about. The entrée was the best though. My friends encouraged me to reach out to the manager on the phone to no avail of course. It was the assistant manager on the phone and they DIDN'T SEEM CONCERNED AT ALL. That's all I needed to know. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN EVER.
