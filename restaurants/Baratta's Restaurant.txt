Baratta's Restaurant

Text: Reasonably priced. Best antipasti ever! Two feet of olives, cheese, peppers, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and much more. Not sure why they are so generous. Would easily feed three.  Fried cheese and marinara was delicious. Pepper steak was lacking. It had great flavor, but the steak cubes were chewy. The Caesar salad was soggy, but had fluffy homemade croutons. Order undressed. The fried chicken was perfect. The house Chianti was very nice. 
Great, attentive, staff took good care of us.

Text: It was delicious! The spinache artichoke dip was ambrosia, truly fit for the gods. I ordered the handmade tortellini in pesto cream sauce and it was sensational. I have found my new favorite Italian restaurant.

Text: Real Italian home cooking. Great flavors. Great service. A treasure on the south side. I've been here 4-5 times in the last 5 months, every time is a pleasure.

Text: Lora was way more helpful than our venue in planning for the wedding. She went above and beyond what I expected from our caterer. The food was great, we received many compliments from our guests. Even though I technically didn't have a choice for our caterer because the Blank Park Zoo requires you to have Baratta's, I am very pleased with all of my interactions with them and with the food!

Text: I went there for homecoming and we had to wait 30 minutes to even take our order. Also our waitress was super rude to us, and we didn't get our food for an hour and a half. I will never go back because the food was decent but the service was completely terrible!
