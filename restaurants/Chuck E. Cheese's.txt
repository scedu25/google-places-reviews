Text: Fun for the kids. Service is almost always an issue and some of the staff have a hard time even pretending to have people skills. I take my daughter once a week and, sadly, this has been consistent.  Wait times at the counter are horrendous, and there is often no reason for it. Otherwise, the games are good, the environment clean, and it feels like a safe environment for the kids.

Text: A place where kids can be kids and adults can be kids. I brought my boyfriend, who is covering from surgery.  We both had a great time playing all the games. We went late evening, so it was not very crowded. We laughed & expressed  our joy, as we won tickets after winning the games. We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was late evening.  An experience that helped bring out, our inner child within.

Text: Had a fun time there with my son and my husband. The pizza was a little bit too garlicy but it was good. Only a couple games didn't work but other then that had a great time. Expect to spend $50 for 3 people. But its worth the money. And I wish the games had higher ticket pay out. Kinda hard to win more then 300 tickets from $20 worth of credits :/
