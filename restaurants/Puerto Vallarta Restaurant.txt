Puerto Vallarta Restaurant

Text: The food wasn't bad, definitely not one of the better Mexican restaurants I've been to. The waiter was rude, never offered refills, forgot part of my order, and sat a very hot plate with steaming hot sauce down in front of my 3 year old. 
The floors were wet and very slippery when we first walked in and there were no wet floor signs. 
My daughter slipped on the wet floor in the restroom. The toilet wobbled and the seat was loose.  
We had a party of 7 and spent over $100, really expected better service especially since there was no one else there while we were there.
I very seriously doubt we'll ever go back.

Text: We went in for lunch and it was not busy at all. I ordered the specialty item it was chicken, beef, shrimp, Bell peppers, onions served in their special red sauce in a molcajete. It was amazing. Everyone at the table was dipping there fork in this giant helping of the absolute best food. It was still bubbling in the molcajete when it came to the table and never stopped. We will definitely be back to try all the different ones they have. Great food,  excellent fast service, all the food was correct and fast.
