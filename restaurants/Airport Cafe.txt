Airport Cafe

Text: Entire place needs a deep scrubbing, especially the bathroom. Food was decent, but nothing I'll be rushing back for. Staff was very nice and attentive. We visited at 7pm on a weekday and there were 3 or 4 other tables seated. Very small place with a good view of the airport if there are any planes taking off or landing.

Text: Waited 30 minutes to be greeted by a server, which we had to remind that we were there. He then greeted us with "sorry I forgot about you. What do you want to drink?" After we got our drinks and ordered, we waited over an hour for our food while other customers who arrived after us got their food before us. All we ordered was a cheeseburger and chicken salad. After waiting over an hour and being ignored, we decided to leave. Very disappointed
