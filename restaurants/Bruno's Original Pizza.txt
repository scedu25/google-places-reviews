Text: My husband and I got pizza from Bruno's on Friday night. I have pondered whether to say anything or not. I would like to say we have in the past 19 years we have many many pizza's from here. When we first started getting them they were the BEST pizza's in the area. In my opinion in the last 5 years they have went downhill.  I asked for the pizza to be well done and it wasn't even all the way done. The sausage was very sparse and there was not a lot of cheese. And in the slice I had there was a long hair. That was it for me I am done with Bruno's pizza's!!!!

Text: Used to love their pizza,  this one was too thick of crust, burnt edges, and very little toppings, and cheese was almost non-existent!! Very different than  Brunos in past !!
