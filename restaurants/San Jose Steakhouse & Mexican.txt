San Jose Steakhouse & Mexican

Text: Service was good. Food was not. Fajitas were very greasy, the steak was a cheap cut, the rice and beans had no flavor. The sirloin was thin, pretty sure it was not a sirloin, another cheap cut of meat.. Baked potato was dirty, like they didn't wash it before cooking, rolls were hard. For the price you pay, you should be served better food. Unfortunately we won't be back.

Text: Came through town...hoping for authentic mexican. This is not the place. My entrée looked liked it had just come out of the microwave oven. MSG should not be a substitute for seasoning. Sorry st joe..not good.
