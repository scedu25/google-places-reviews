Hampton Inn Topeka
Rating: 4
Text: The breakfast in the morning was fantastic. The service was great. Our issue was that we were there during a cross-country tournament and there was talking and stomping until late. It felt like the walls and floors were paper thin. Also, the beds were hard and the pillows were too soft.

Text: We had a great experience with our recent stay. Rooms were very clean and the staff were very helpful. The breakfast was better than most hotels. I will stay there on my next trip to Topeka.

Text: Great place, but not as good as some of the other Hampton inns I've stayed in. Still very good. I think it might be older. Has microwave and fridge in the room. Hair dryer. Pool. Hot tub. Comfy beds. Was quiet even though it's next to a busy road. Nice people working there. Yummy breakfast.

Text: Not sure how to rate this one.  The staff is fabulous but the GM is a joke and has no courtesy for loyal Hilton customers.  Lets just say he should stay behind the scenes and let his wonderful staff take care of everything!
