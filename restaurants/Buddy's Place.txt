Text: I have been there twice . The first time the special was ok , the service was about a 6 rating . They kept my tea glass full . I returned again the other day . I drove 40 miles out my way to eat there . The chicken livers was over cooked so bad I had to eat them with ketchup on them . Nasty . The apple sauce was the only part that was good . My tea glass run empty and I wasn't even asked if I needed a refill . The place wasn't really busy at all so the poor service wasn't because of being more customers than they could take care of . This place is a true drinking business . Eat here at your own risk . One time good , next time nasty .
