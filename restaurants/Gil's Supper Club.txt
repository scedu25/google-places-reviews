Gil's Supper Club
Rating: 4
Text: Was recommended by a client that they had great food so after the job I called my wife and we drove to gills to have supper. The staff was very polite and helpful.  I really want to try a little of everything so we ordered 3 on trays with sides and took half of it home. We were very please with all of the food. It had that nice mom pop feel.  Everything seemed home cooked and not from out of a Box which is a very nice change from today's venues.  I am excited to add this to our list of date nights.

Text: Love Gil's Supper Club!!  Bartender was very friendly and social even though we were having dinner and not drinking.  Prime Rib was mouth watering and the home-style green beans and mashed potatoes were pretty close to my mother's!  Love going back to Gil's!
