Text: They catered for my wedding and I have nothing but great things to say! We ordered pizza for 400 people and everything was amazing! It was delicious, my guests loved it! The salad and rolls we're a big hit as well! Will highly recommend to anyone!

Text: Everything I've ever had here is amazing! Until last night. I ordered the small marinated chicken salad with ranch dressing. You seriously make ranch dressing with Miracle Whip!? I'm still trying to un- taste it! So gross... entire meal wasted. No more salads from Mangia!

Text: It's all about the sauce. Unfortunately theirs isn't very good. There is no atmosphere at all.

Text: Their 4-pepper soup is amazingly yummy. I love their pasta dishes that are RED sauce based. I recently had one of their alfredo dishes...was not impressed with the sauce (but I'm picky when it comes to alfredo sauces. It was flavorless and tasted more like flour.  However, I'm still giving them a 4 star because they do not skimp on portion. If you are a big eater, their dishes WILL fill you up!  And their 4-pepper soup is really the main reason I come here. 
This place is in an odd location, but worth a stop in.

Text: The food was great. The sauce on the lasagna was a little sweet for my husband's taste but the shrimp Alfredo and brushetta were delicious. Will definitely go here again. Maybe they need a bigger building.
