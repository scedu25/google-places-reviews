Text: Staff was fast and very friendly, even on a busy night. Homemade mac & cheese was fantastic side dish and our entrees were delicious! We will definitely eat here next time we're coming through!

Text: I ordered the "Eclipse" burger. Very good! They definitely have extra napkins for this messy goodness. Great service and a clean & bright appearance make this a great place to eat. The homemade bread and sweet butter were also excellent.

Text: Friendly service and excellent food. I had their BLT off the specials board and it had delicious ripe tomatoes, smokey bacon, delicious brioche style bread and good lettuce. Not your average small town restaurant.

Text: Food - Excellent, very fresh eggs, and toast was some of the best I've ever had. Plate was loaded to the edges, omelet loaded with cheese!

Service - Needs improvement. This seems to be the kind of place where if you aren't a local and don't know the waitstaff, you won't be seen to for some time. I'm very patient, however this was one of the longest breakfast waits I've ever had, from seating, to ordering, to waiting for the check. Definitely took away from an otherwise great breakfast experience.
