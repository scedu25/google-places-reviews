Grandpa John's Nauvoo Cafe?

Text: Ordered a chicken strip basket for my granddaughter and chicken salad for myself.  Strips are pre-frozen from a box, you could count the fries that came with it- although the fries were good.  Chicken salad was awful!  The salad was from a bag mix and they hadn't even washed off the chemicals before using, the chicken was not flavorful, and the only other thing on the salad was a few cherry tomatoes and some croutons.  Horrible food!!

Text: We showed up today at closing time and didn't realize that until after we had left. We were tired of fast food on the road and the kids grandpa's name was John, so it seemed like a good fit. The food was great! So glad we stopped. Looking back, we feel terrible we didn't pay attention to closing time (today was 2pm) - but nobody rushed us, they didn't hurry our order or tell us they'd be closing soon. Very professional and welcoming staff. We'd definitely stop again the next time we head south east!

Text: We all ordered the cheese/hamburgers which were delicious! Try the deep fried potato chips! They were a yummy change from french fries and onion rings.
