Text: Ordered a pizza and garlic cheese bread was told 25 minutes, got there a few minutes early paid and they handed me my garlic cheese bread.  After waiting 25 minutes with cheese garlic bread in hand I am told it's going to be another 30 minutes and that they would send someone to deliver it.  After another 45 minutes the pizza arrives and was given a $10.00 gift card for the trouble.  The bottom of the box and the pizza crust completely soggy I then had to drive it back.  Because at this point I just wanted my money back but forgot the gift card they gave me back the difference of the gift card from what I paid.  I guess my time and frustration is worth nothing.  WILL NEVER RETURN BACK  EXCEPT WITH THE GIFT CARD TO GET ALL MY MONEY BACK AND WILL BE SURE TO SPREAD THE WORD.
