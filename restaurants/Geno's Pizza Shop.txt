Text: Usually good. A bit pricey. Takes a long time to get food. Big parking lot and remodeled restrooms are nice even the family one! Serive isn't always the best because of the limited hours they are usually super busy. Got there 15 min after opening told 55 mi wait took 90. :(

Text: The pizza was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was good too.  The kids played video games and had good time on the old tractor tire thing afterwards.  Only problem and the only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that they overcharged my friends that were excited about taking me here as it was my first time only to be harrassed by the woman who rang them up wrong when they asked nicely why it cost them 90 bucks for three pizzas and a few pops.  Long story short it waa an accident by the server who was very nice and apologetic about it all, she accidentally wrote one pizza down twice.   I get it, some people like to just complain about shit, people like my dreaded mother in law, but these are nice people that just didn't want to pay for something they didn't receive.  They weren't rude in any way until the lady with short hair started getting a little pissy with them for something I don't see as unreasonable in any way.  I mean I worked in the restaurant biz for over  10 years and I wouldn't have been mad at someone for noticing that they were overcharged for something, even if was only a buck.  Especially when they weren't being rude about it.
