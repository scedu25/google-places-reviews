Lui Lui Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: This is a more upscale restaurant for Athens, but the prices are still very reasonable. For example, an entree was only $13 and a starter only $2-4. Bread was included with the meal. Service was very prompt and pleasant, and not overly intrusive.  I gave it 4 and not 5 stars because the ambience is a bit "stark".  The interior feels sort of like your dining in a minimalist hotel restaurant. Not sure that sentence captures the vibe properly...the decor is simply unremarkable, even forgettable really. Not meaning to be unkind but it is. Still, the food was good, prices more than reasonable, and  service fine.

Text: Food allergies! Eating out can be a challenge when you have allergies. Lui lui makes the experience an enjoyable one. They are very careful to prepare your food safely and there are many menu options available for people with all sorts of dietary restrictions and many of the ingredients are locally sourced. The restaurant is a beautiful fusion of casual and upscale. I come here when I want a good meal and a relaxing cup of tea. It is nice to have a safe place to eat that doesn't break the bank! Added fun: on Tuesdays they feature a special sushi menu!

Text: Been going here for probably 8 years. The food has always been great, best place in athens for a good price. Jade isn't the owner anymore but the new owners have been there for years before and do an excellent job. Love the herb butter. Some of the best items they have are the lamb, Mediterranean chicken salad, roasted red pepper and the carrot ginger soup. BUT everything is good here. Wine menu prices are great too.

Text: There at the last minute, with the book club meeting from Athens Uncorked. Had to move to Lui Lui because of an unexpected large crowd at Uncorked, and a big book club turnout. Staff at Lui Lui were great, and the munchies were excellent! Thanks!
