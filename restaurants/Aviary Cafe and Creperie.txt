Aviary Cafe and Creperie
Rating: 4
Text: I very much enjoyed dining here. It was a lovely Parisian chic themes cafe. The ingredients were top notch, the service was pleasant, the Mimosa had proper parts including a garnish, and the crepes...made with quality hands and a fair amount of love. The only reason I cannot give it a full 5 stars is because of its inability to provide an outdoor dining option. One of the signatures to Parisian cafes are their patio/porch seating. This option provides a wider range of comfort for a wider demographic. Other than that, it was superb. Good job Aviary!

Text: I really love coming to Aviary. :-) The ambience makes it feel like such a special place. They have really whimsical and artistic Decor which changes with the seasons. I love the downtown location which is in an old building and seems so charming.

My mom used to make crepes when I was a little girl and I think they're creep to the best in town. They always have a lot of special dishes that you can't find it any other restaurant in Springfield.

Text: The crepes were AMAZING!!! The handicap accessible entrance was kind of hidden from the street, but the host was very helpful and patient in helping us find it. The ambiance is great and I loved my Italian cream soda.
