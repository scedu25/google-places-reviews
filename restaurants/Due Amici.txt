Text: The atmosphere and the friendliness of this place are the best. The appetizers, drinks and entrees were all delicious but even as hip and centrally downtown located restaurant, the prices are disproportionate for the items. For example, 4 regular size "trendy" fried ravioli for $16. Local craft beer at $12. Should you try it? Yes, at least once.

Text: This is an upscale trendy place in the heart of Columbus. Dinner was fabulous. It just took a little too long for our group to be served. The wine selection was great.

Text: Had a quick business lunch here and was impressed with the unique ambience and walkability from the business district. The vegetable pizza was full of flavor and the crust was cooked perfectly. I'd love to come here for a nice dinner with my wife and try a few more dishes off the menu.

Text: Really enjoyed the food here. We came with a group so we were in the back private room. Service was great, atmosphere is also very nice. I would like to come back sometime just for dining and drinks.
