DESTIHL Restaurant & Brew Works

Text: Great place with great beer.  We we're able to stop by while traveling for the day.  The service we received was very good and reasonably fast.  Food was very good and creative, and our burgers cooked properly.  I was please to be able to get a 4oz pour of anything they had on tap, and that everything was available to go.  My only complaint is that it was a little too nice, too "corporate" feeling.  I like the brew pubs I go to to feel like they are a place the people brewing the beer would want to hang out.  Not sure this was that place.  That said it was still very good, and I would definitely come back if I only lived closer.

Text: One word Excellent! Ryan our server was awesome. We had a time crunch due to being on our way to FOBAB!, and 3 of us were in and out with dessert in about 50 minutes. Staff is wonderful at clearing the tables and making sure drink orders are fast and filled. Our favorite place to go every year!

Text: We were visiting from out of town and came across this amazing restaurant! Food was out of this world and service was amazing. Everything is so fresh and local and the atmosphere is really on point. I would recommend it to everyone. Wish we had one near us now!

Text: Their motto is "Support Flavor, Boycott Bland". Destihl totally lives up to this motto.  Everything I have tried has been great. The chef puts together some unusual and different combinations of ingredients. They all have been unique and delicious. One of the top 3 restaurants in the area.
