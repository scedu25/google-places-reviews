Text: Small bowling ally. No screens so you have to keep score yourself. Has an attached restaurant and bar with great food at a reasonable price. Also located next door to an ice cream stand.

Text: Nice atmosphere, kind help and good food! Very reasonable prices for bowling alley as well. Had a very well lit and spacious bar as well. It's all inside one building without being on top of one another. Nice place overall to spend an evening with the family without spending too much money!
