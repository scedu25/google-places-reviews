Text: This place is fantastic.  Dive bar with constant live bluesy music (7 nights a week), affordable craft beers (4$ flying dog last I checked), AND the best pizza in town (big fresh toppings).  I mean common.  5 ?

Text: Just had an amazing experience. To come into an establishment where they really make you feel like they care. I had a tough day and the cook with the beard and the young lady in the back really made me feel special it made me come on and have to make a comment. Hats off to the village idiot I will definitely return and bring a group of people to enjoy the atmosphere and the staff.

Text: Best pizza in town. Good craft beer selection. Service is poor. Difficult to get a seat after 5.
