Costas Pizza & Steakhouse
Rating: 5
Text: We we're traveling home to Ohio and didn't want fast food so we ordered ahead for dining in. The service was friendly and fast on a  busy Saturday evening. The thin crust pizza was perfectly cooked. They offer an extensive menu including one for children.  Beer and wine are available. Check the hours as they close mid afternoon and reopen for dinner also open later in the summer.
Try the baklava! YUM
