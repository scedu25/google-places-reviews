Text: We had our rehearsal dinner in Cleveland Heath's private room and it was perfect! Not only was the food amazing but the space and service was excellent. Many positive comments from our loved ones. Natasha and Keith, the new owner, were super easy to work with and very accommodating!

Text: Cleveland Heath is such a wonderful place to have a high-quality, casual dinner.  Their ever-changing menu of comfort food serves up delicious meals.  Cleveland Heath is our default go-to when we want to go out but don't have a new place to go out and try.  The kitchen is consistent and reliable.  The ingredients are of a high quality.  The servers seem to really care about the work they do and take the time to get to know their customers.  The owners are so friendly and care about the experience of their customers.

Text: There's actual bartenders here that will make whatever you ask for without saying "well, I can Google it" when you order a drink. Fun to sit at the bar and watch the bartenders.   They're very knowledgeable about cocktails!

Text: First trip, for my parent's 65th anniversary. Service was excellent, and the food was very good. Something for everyone. They easily and graciously prepared gluten-free items  (which were outstanding ). Great beer selection,  too. Will go again soon!
