Text: Awesome food and high quality craft beers. The atmosphere is on point with the brewery scene. The staff is friendly and service is quick. Most definitely recommended for anyone who is into good beer. A wide variety of styles to choose from and haven't found one I didn't like! Cheers!

Text: Gella's is one of my favorite places to eat in town. They brew their own selection of beers and cream soda/root beer. The kids enjoy the kids meal delivered in an old fashioned cardboard car. The food is often a little unique and very good. This is much better than Applebee's. The selection is a variety of different foods. Great place to get together with friends, family or co-workers.

Text: We had Gella's cater our wedding reception, and the food and service were phenomenal! Kris is a gem in the rough. We had a wide variety of appetizers for our dinner, and she was great at helping us pick out what we wanted out of all the tasty selections. She was so easy to work with and was available to answer any questions I had regarding the menu. My applause to Manuel and his kitchen staff. The food was amazing; guest are still talking about how good it was! Kris and her crew had a beautiful set-up that made it easy to get through the buffet line. Clean-up was a breeze, and Kris made sure to leave out what she could for guest to snack on throughout the evening.
My husband and I wanted to stay local, and we are glad we choose Gella's to cater our meal! Thanks again for the great food and service.

Text: Could possibly be best place in Hays to eat! Inviting atmosphere, excellent food and great tasty beers. The red cream soda is a favorite of mine. Always get the steak red potatoes and the Mac n cheese. Hasn't let me down yet!
