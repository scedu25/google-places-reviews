Text: Best buffet ever. Service is excellent and food is always good and hot. We have been to other places and food would be cold and they would make excuses and say buffet food is not supposed to be warm. Here is perfect.

Text: My wife liked her lasagna and I had one of their "duets", which was a half order of their seafood special and a half order of their scallops -- it was incredible. Atmosphere was good. Our waiter was good. Food was great.

Text: One of my favorite restaurants. It's my go to fav!  I had the Crispy Chicken and my cousin had the tenderloin.  All the food was delicious.  I had the peach tart with ice cream and she had the philo wrapped brownie with ice cream. Both were fabulous.  Our waitress was top notch!  I'll be back. I always am!

Text: Excellent, locally sourced food and service. Great wine list by the glass and drinks. Wonderful desserts. Stylish setting but casual. There's not much to critique here. Definitely a favorite place for any occasion.
