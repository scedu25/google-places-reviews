Text: First and foremost my wife and I want to thank you for the courage to reopen a restaurant in North Platte with the undertaking of cleaning up and restoring such a great place.  The food is excellent and the service has been great.  Your Prime Rib is the best in town!  Thanks again!!!

Text: Severely disappointed!!! Went in on non peak hours.  Waited ten minutes+ to even Get seated... once finally seated never saw anyone other than the kid who poured our water.   Watched some of the higher ups from around town walk in get seated and drink orders within 5 minutes.  Our 4 top walked out.  So did 2 to 4 drinks a piece plus appetizers and full meals.  Won't be back for a long Long LONG time

Text: Mark has done a great job with the place I highly recommend it. They also have gluten free bread for all you people staying away from gluten. My go-to is the gluten-free BLAT.
