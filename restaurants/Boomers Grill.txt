Text: We happened upon this venue while taking a scenic route from Missouri back to Nebraska.  What luck!  The wait staff were attentive, polite, efficient, friendly.  The food was good.  The establishment was clean, including the bathrooms! The decor was sports themed and if I lived closer I would totally love to watch my favorite teams on the screens here.  The only problem, I didn't see any Nebraska Husker signage.  I choose to think that was just an oversight but I would be glad to send them some "Go Big Red" items if needed.  We will definitely stop in the next time we are in the area.  Thanks for a nice experience.

Text: Always good food and friendly staff. Customers need to know tips are waitresses major income. I have seen customers leave only small tips or even none. Should leave at least 20%. A lot of People in small communities don't really seem to understand this. Boomers is the best restaurant in Holton.

Text: Excellent service, big menu, sandwiches to steaks and seafood. Generous portions. Great find for our late Sunday night dinner. Open until 9:30pm. Not easy to find those hours outside of larger cities.

Text: Good food and excellent for a small town. Daily specials are usually a great choice. They have done a great job working to compete with sports bars in larger communities.
