Text: Quick filling all you can eat buffet with great service and a wild west decoration. A good salad bar as part of the $8 all you can eat while on the Hotbar you've got Fried Chicken of course, sausages and onions, white beans and ham, mashed potatoes with white or brown gravy, green beans, corn, scalloped potatoes and a few other things I can't remember.
They are a bar so get your drink on and of course they've got 10 different types of homemade pies
