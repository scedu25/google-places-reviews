Text: Probably my favorite sushi place. It's the best I've had in North America. Their prices are fair, and their service is very fast. Staff are always friendly and welcoming. Spent most of my Wednesday nights there since their prices are 50% off, almost all items, on Wednesdays.

Text: Amazing food! And happy hour from 12-4 gets you half off a select few signature rolls. They were amazing. Service was a little lack luckster but the food made up for it.

Text: This is our favorite, go to sushi place in the area. Whether dining in or ordering carry out the food has always been top notch. We've ordered almost every roll and appetizer and have always been pleased. Wednesday's is half price maki and you can usually find a deal on Groupon. I highly recommend going here if you're a sushi lover!
