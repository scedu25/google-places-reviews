Text: Great little hometown diner.  We just missed the buffet, but the burgers made up for it.  The chili burger was amazing.  The full portion was more than enough.

Text: Good food and great service!  This plays serves mostly home-style American food.  The food is good and fresh.  The servers are attentive and friendly.  I do wish they would post some more information online, such as their menu and hours, but we have always enjoyed our visits here.
