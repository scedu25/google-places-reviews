Text: Pretty good food. I would avoid burnt ends and ribs. Ours were pretty dry. But wings were some of the best I've had and staff was extremely helpful.

Text: The Brisket is fantastic. Make sure to order the burnt-ends brisket.

Neat pole- barn environment.

Would like to see more local craft brew beers. Lot of typical mass-produced beers.

Text: Great ribs!!  Got there about noon and ordered. It's quiet that time of day, so there was no waiting.  The Rib dinner seemed a bit expensive at $18.00, but they brought me enough to last three meals!  The Ribs were excellent and the potato salad and coleslaw were both just as good.  Next time I'm hungry for ribs, I'm heading back there!
