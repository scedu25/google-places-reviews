NewBo City Market
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best places in Cedar Rapids and clearly one of the drivers of the city's economy while it continues to rebuild after two devastating floods.  Wheelchair accessible. Many locally owned stalls for food, handmade products, plants.  Numerous events occur here to help bring people downtown.

Text: Newbo is a fun place to stroll and putter about, and newbo Market is a good place to check out.  Browse around the vendors and their products, which are locally grown or made.  My favorite vendors are a bakery with wonderfully rustic breads, a coffee stall with a good latte, chocolates stall, pet vendor with a lot of fun and useful items for pets, and many others.
There are metal tables and chairs out for noshing or relaxing.

Text: A very cool place to come as a tourist (or someone new to town) and get a good glimpse at some high-quality, locally-made food and goods. I went on a Thursdays where there were relatively little crowds (but still a good amount of people!). The market is big enough to have something for everyone, but we were still able to walk around and see all the shops in a half hour or so.

Text: It's fair to mid-land.  According to what you want.   Several food venues. Some are good-some not so good.  Plants are sold at one shop a little pricey but they look very healthy.  Pretty crowded on a thursday afternoon.  They were doing aerobics outside (hot day 2) and so there was no parking to be found for blocks around.  Maybe not the best place to draw that many people to if you also want people shopping.
