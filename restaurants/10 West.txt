Text: This was thee worst experience I've had here. Had the ribs they were very fatty. Simply the worst food.The menu advertised jalapeño lime corn on the cob and the corn tasted old. I paid over $70 for horrible food. Waited an hour to get this horrible food. Should have gone to Big Boy instead....

Text: The information on the website for 10 West was highly inaccurate with the exception of there being a lovely view of the river. My husband's rib eye was overcooked and needed to be re done. The menu advertised shoe string potatoes which came out as coated french fries.  My fish tasted like a frozen fish stick.  The condiments were served in plastic cups. The long and short of it is that this is not my experience of a Mariott Hotel.

Text: Poor service, reheated breakfast buffet, over priced. Save money and go to First Watch down the road.
