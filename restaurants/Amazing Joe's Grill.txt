Text: Though it's a tad pricey, the food is well worth it. I feel the portion sizes were very reasonable and the food was most delicious. The service was most excellent; very attentive to our needs and were quick with refills. For going on a busy Friday night, out booth was pleasantly quiet and comfortable. Highly recommend this place!

Text: One of my favorite local places. Not too many choices for a vegetarian, but all the meats and a few seafood and pasta dishes are well represented for the locals. Their greatest advantage is the quality of their staff and service - truly outstanding. Attentive and accommodating, the manager checks in with EVERY diner. The rare mistakes are corrected without question. GO!

Text: My steak was juicy and delicious, my baked potato was cooked to perfection and topped with cheese, real bacon, butter, and sour cream, and I finished it off with steamed broccoli. Our waitress sat down and made us feel right at home.  The owner checked on us after we received our food. Fabulous experience and I will be coming back soon! !
