Lazy D Restaurant & Lounge
Rating: 5
Text: Picked up some burgers from Lazy D and they were great. The single burger was quite large, probably 1/3 pound, had good flavor and was not greasy. The fries were cooked crispy and had a fantastic breading on them. The price was right as well.

Ordered the steak sandwich and a drink.
The steak was soooo tender and delicious.
The french fries were crisp and really good.
Highly recommend this place.
Certainly not fancy, just good.
