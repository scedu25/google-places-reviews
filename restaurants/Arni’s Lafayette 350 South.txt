Text: Love the food as always. We wasn't real happy with the waitress. She acted rather rudely when we ask for a booth.

Text: Honestly we go to pizza king and this time Decided to get our pizza here at this location...and it was horrid. the box had Pizza grease and sauce on the outside (messy) the cheese sauce we ordered was burnt? And the pizza was okay.. I guess pizza king has better tasting ingredients. I'm disappointed an I hope whoever reads my experience knows I'm not trying to be maltious but honest. and hopefully this was a one time disaster for them, seeing their ratings and all. But I wanted this to be as honest and real this was supposed to be our "date night meal" ?

Text: Lot of food to be sure, just no real flavor. Soups were gelatinous and cold. They microwaved twice (that did not make sense since it was the special). Chili spaghetti had beans but no seasoning. Sandwiches were ok, but lacked mushrooms (that was supposed to be an ingredient).  Note that when they advertise a "sub" in their specials, they don't mean any sub, just the Arni's sub. The wings were the best part.
