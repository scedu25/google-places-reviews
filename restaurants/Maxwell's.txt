Text: Revised review: new owners (thank god). Sunday buffet now has eggs so you can legit call it a brunch. Still not top notch brunch but definitely better than before.  

Good place for drink specials. There is a 99 cent margarita night and decent cocktails. Large beer selection. Food is needing about 1 notch higher in quality but its getting there.

Text: My wife and I we're greeted and seated however.... after 15 minutes of waiting for service we left. They weren't overly busy and were definitely aware we were there but no one made and attempt to take even a drink order or even to "say we'll be right with you" . To the owner - for a coaching opportunity check your video cameras 9/9 at 8:10p

Text: I quite enjoyed the location, atmosphere, and food here. The handmade chicken strips were particularly good. This is one of the first places I would think to bring someone from out of town.
