Nine Irish Brothers, West Lafayette

Text: Good atmosphere great whiskey selection. I heard about their go to items. Which from fellow companions are top notch. However I went off script and tried mussels which weren't the best but the sauce for them was really exceptional. Recommend anyone in town who's not been before to give it a try.

Text: I've been wanting to visit, but I never had time. I finally did!! Worth the wait & delicious food... Especially the service... My service went above and beyond. She offered the best food that is best to take home & it not escape its container. (Shepherds Pie) & the Best Dessert that goes in a sealed soup container (Sweet Irish Whiskey is   delicious BTW)... My husband deserves to have a fabulous dinner too after a long in the factory and I have to eat alone. But at Nine Irish Brother's, it's family!!??????????

Text: Service and food was very good.  Much more than fried on appetizers menu-nice.  Beer flights and authentic Irish brands.  Owner researched in Ireland to bring original Irish pub to Lafayette.  It's cozy, personal feel is result.  Outdoor dining is very nice.

Text: This is the best bar in town. Has live Irish music on Friday's and Saturday's, delicious Irish cuisine. The owner makes sure to entertain the customers himself and the stuff is super friendly and polite, always with a huge smile on their face ready to assist you.
Thumbs up for Alex

Text: This might be my favorite bar/restaurant in West Lafayette. The food is always top quality, the beer always perfectly poured, the waitstaff friendly.  There's literally no downsides to this place as hard as I'm trying to think of one, I love it unconditionally. If you're looking for the most authentic experience of an Irish pub you can get outside of Ireland, or maybe Boston, this is where you should go.
