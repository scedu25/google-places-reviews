Text: Very good quality. Made fresh to order. Top notch ingredients. Knowledgeable and well trained staff. The location is a little odd being in a strip mall, but that doesn't matter once you go inside. Prices are a little steep, but compare well to places that are twice as much. Highly recommended.

Text: Nice, relaxed atmosphere with consistently excellent food and wait staff.  My husband and I love to introduce friends to new wonderful dining experiences and this is our favorite place to do so.  Jessica was our server and was very attentive without being intrusive.  Love the dining vibe.  Just the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or just have lunch.  Highly recommend The Henderson, salmon dinner and ribeye. Enjoy!

Text: Food is great! The guy that answers the phone to take reservations needs to take some lessons. I elected to skip making a reservation as he is so irritating to work with.

Text: I don't drink alcohol, but the mixologist is very original. The food is amazing. I greatly enjoyed the house salad, the lamb rack, and vegetables and sweet potatoes. All amazing. The flourless chocolate torte was incredible.
