Text: Just what we were looking for. A real place with real people.  Selection was good enough.  Food was tastey enough and the waitress was friendly.  We would come again.

Text: Words cant describe the HORRIBLE service we experienced!! Wait staff was rude,inconsiderate,and had no intrest to bring drinks if you werent sitting at the bar. The food was TERRIBLE. Out of 10 people 2 ate their food. Will never return there.

Text: Came in for lunch after my car broke down and was not disappointed. They have a special everyday and it was a prime rib sandwich for me. The meat was perfectly cooked and stacked high on the sandwich. The manager/owner is friendly and the environment is great for anyone.
