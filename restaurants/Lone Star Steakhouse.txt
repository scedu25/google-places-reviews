Text: Service was fantastic.  Food quality was poor. Very bland garlic potatoes,  shrimp were over cooked and tasteless. Rolls were the only think that we enjoyed.

Text: It was good but not anything that makes me WANT to go back. It will do,,,,has been exceptional before, it could be again with a concentrated effort.

Text: The food was ok, the service was good but it was too expensive for the quality and quantity of food. Texas Road House is better food and you won't leave hungry for about the same price. I recommend saving your money and having a cook out at home.
