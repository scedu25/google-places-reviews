Text: I was looking for a quick meal while staying at the Westin.   We decided to eat at the "hotel bar" because of the starvation factor.  

The atmosphere was comfortable and dark.  

But what made it stand out was how a young man named Jason, who's serves at the bar, went above and beyond which is so rare these days.  

The meat came out dry which can happen anywhere.  I let Jason know that but he was more than happy to comp our meal. No questions asked and he insisted. Nice.  

We then got to chatting about the night life and Jason went to the other servers and got us answers instead of saying "I don't know". Great to have someone that actually cares about their job.  

And here's the kicker, I love an Old Fashioned.  And J said it was his speciality.   Man was he right!  Excellent drink.  You'll have to try one for yourself to see the difference. He puts the same time and care in that drink as he does the patrons.   You can't lose there.  

Great Times!  Thanks Jason.
