Text: The service was amazing! The food was excellent! My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday for our first time and we had a fantastic experience. Definitely plan on coming back. There are seats outside as well. You can also bring your dog and the restaurant offers water bowls for your dogs as you enjoy your meal. If you are thinking about eating here, you won't be disappointed.

Text: Good place for a quick bite to eat. Nothing blew me away food wise but it was all good and well priced. No complaints but nothing really to rave about either. Worth checking out and hoping next time they'll wow me.

Text: Late night menu is only the pizza side of the menu but it is MUCH better than the other late night pizza options in the area. They also have a fantastic happy hour special/ great outdoor area.

Text: Pretty good buffet brunch option, at $20 per person, which includes a Bloody Mary or Mimosa, and allows you to get up to 4 more of those drinks for $0.99! The food didn't blow me away, but was still good and our server was great.

Text: The Review is for "Park City Grille" - Service was great!  Great window light, cute, clean, large patio (although we ate inside due to heat)
Great old photo canvasses on wall throughout.  And, drinks great and my tacos. Best ever ' loaded' -  ck it out and support local biz?
