Down Home Barbecue
Rating: 5
Text: This little family owned restaurant has the best barbecue in town. Everything is freshly cooked each day by the owner himself. He smokes the ribs, the pork, the chicken, and the baked beans. He oversees all the other cooking, no one is turned loose to cook anything by themselves. He makes the slaw and the potato salad from scratch.  Nothing is served directly from a can or bottle.                       
The owners name is Bob Allison.  He has his apron that calls him Mr. Bob, and he's proud of it. 
Stop by and see him. Wednesday through Saturday,  from 7a.m. to 7p.m..
