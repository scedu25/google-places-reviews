Text: Can't beat the freshness and the friendly service!  This is the real deal for Thai cuisine.  My favorite is the mango sticky rice but it's only in season a very short time.  Boo!  But I always finish with sticky rice whether or not the mango is available from Thailand.

Text: Food was great. Service was atrocious. If you go order for carryout or ask for the guy with long blonde hair to wait on you. Gave us better service in his 2 minute stop by than the 2 girls who had us as their table did in any of their visits. Legitimately this was the first time I didn't tip my waitress in my life. I'm usually a 25% tipper. But when I have to almost beg to get any refills silver ware ect brought to my table... 
At some point the girls who were waiting on us even started avoiding making eye contact so I couldn't even get their attention to ask for anything. And I'm a restaurant gm so I'm not rude to my waitress ever. No clue what their deal was.

Text: Authentic food, the staff is a lot of fun, very knowledgeable about the food they serve.  Huge portions, and you can get as mild or spicy as you want. I keep going back for the yellow curry (but i always have to sample all my friends' dinners).... sooooooo good!
