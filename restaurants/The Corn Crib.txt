Text: First time stopping in today! Great staff, very friendly. She even showed me where to get my iced tea and the condiment section was neat, stocked up. Nice, clean environment. My meal that I ordered came out hot and fresh! Very tasty French dip sandwich. I ordered a medium iced tea and I was surprised at how big the cups were! :) I will be coming back with my family soon!

Text: This place is part of a gas station that looks like a barn. But the food is always great and the service is as well. I had the grandma's special which is fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and baked beans. She had the breaded porkchop with mashed potatoes and corn.

Text: I ordered the Denver omelette and the onions and peppers were nicely sauteed.  My hash browns were perfectly done with the right amount of crispness.  The cook did a great job preparing my breakfast and I would highly recommend stopping here.  Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is homey and friendly.
