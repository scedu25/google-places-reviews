Text: Getting here is an adventure in itself- take either the Golden Eagle or Brussels Ferry and then drive through the beautiful countryside. The hotel has been around since 1949 and still serves up "country" food in a family-style setting. Even if you show up alone, you'll still get all the sides. Come hungry.

Text: Family style dining...homemade sausage I think...good fried chicken, roast beef. Their chicken noodle soup was crap but the chicken and dumplings were good...so a draw there. Homemade peach preserves and a great pickle tray for starters...beets apples corn. Good time.
