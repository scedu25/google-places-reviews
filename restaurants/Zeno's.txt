Text: Great pizza, great customer service, wonderful ambiance. I ate the funky chicken pizza and it was delicious. Lots of space for big party's.  No kids menu. They do offer a gluten free crust.

Text: The pizza has always been excellent.  We always get 1/2 taco and 1/2 Canadian bacon and pineapple.   Last night the CB/pineapple was just blah.  No taste,  no flavor.   Didn't even taste like I was eating a cheese pizza.  I asked the waitress if they did something different and she said "no we can't change the recipe".  But something certainly was different. Always have had great pizza there, except last night.  Taco was as good as always.
