Text: If I could give less stars I would. The WORST food & service!! & super expensive! There food selection was horrible , Food was cold, tasted horrible & charged our 10yr olds as adults! They were rude, couldn't get our drinks right! The whole family felt really sick after we left! Will never go back! If you guys want good Chinese I would go to stir fry or huhot! Don't go to this place!
