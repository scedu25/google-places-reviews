Text: I don't often review places, but this restaurant was a great surprise. Awesome atmosphere, employees seemed proud to work there, and the steak portions were huge for the price. I almost can't believe the amount of food included with it. Cooked to perfection as well. Normally I'm not wild about prime rib, but if all prime rib was like that it would be my favorite cut. Also loved the espresso tenderloin. The building was so cool!

Text: Awesome attentive service, nice atmosphere.  Generous portions and AMAZING food.  They were able to accomodate my gluten intolerance!  Blackberry pork chops and chicken florentine highly recommended! Fruit
Flambe was the perfect finish.  Definitely a most stop next time we are near Kearney.

Text: We enjoyed everything.  For the price it was worth every dollar.  From salad and fantastic soup to awesome facossica bread to the blood orange sorbet to cleanse the palate to the 2" small prime rib, and sides. Best service we've had in a long time. 
I'd say this is way better than many of the places in Omaha.

Text: We had a large group here and our waiter was great at keeping track of everyone's orders and drink refills. The crab cakes and salad bar are wonderful.

Text: Quaint place with excellent friendly service.  The Bloody Mary with house infused pepper vodka was EXCELLENT.  I would have given this restaurant a higher rating if the food was just a bit higher quality.  It didn't seem consistent. Some items would be great, others would be just "OK".  Nothing was below average. The prices are very fair and the environment is relaxing. The staff is welcoming and I would go back.
