Prime On The Nine

Text: Traveling back to MO from CO we took a detour through Dodge City and decided to seek out a good steak house.  We went to Prime On The Nine based on the reviews.  High reviews are accurate!  The 14oz D.C. Strip was one of the best strip steaks I've had.  If you're looking for a very tasty steak with great service and atmosphere, then you should give this place a try.

Text: My steak was great. Same with the baked potato and carrots. The stuffed shrimp were killer as well and I'm not a shrimp person so that tells you it's good! Not very busy but did have some wait with our drinks and the bill. Would definitely go back. Nice view as well.

Text: Delicious in every way. I had the most delicious chicken fried steak for have ever had in my life. It was enormous and came with roasted jalapeño gravy, which was delightful. We were there on a very busy night and our waitress did a good job of taking care of us, even under less than ideal circumstances.
