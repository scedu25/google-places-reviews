Mango Restaurant

Text: Don't waste your time searching for a place to eat. Mango is what you want! The plantain chips and cilantro salsa was probably a food that we could eat every day and never get tiered of. I'm not exaggerating, they are that good. The service was perfect. Warm, nurturing, funny, and generous. Our server even brought us complimentary drinks for our anniversary! My husband ordered the beef loin bowl. He says that it was like the best burger combined with the best sushi that you have ever had. It was tangy, crunchy, savery, but without being heavy. He claims that it made him "feel like he was tripping balls man!" I ordered the salmon bowl. Wow. Just wow. The servings don't seem big, but we ate and then walked all over the city. It's been 3.5 hours and I'm still full, but not uncomfortable. And I am NOT a light eater! Seriously, I am screwed for life now because nothing will be that good again!

Text: Amazing experience. Mango was highly recommended to us and it didn't disappoint. Our waitress took the challenge of picking our food for us, to share tapas style. Each dish had great flavor, and it was an overall great time. We were satisfied but not stuffed. Highly recommend!

Text: The chicken over potatoes in creamy walnut sauce was awesome!  The spices were new to me and very flavorful. The service was also good!

Text: Fist visit was in 2014 at lunchtime and we had a great 5/5 experience - good, flavorful food and fast service. Second visit was today for dinner. We were seated right away without a reservation, but waited over an hour for our food. Neither the hostess nor server gave us a heads up about the wait time and the server never once informed us of the wait or apologized for it. The server did not check in often enough and did not bring drink refills timely. Portions were smaller than our previous visit and flavors were mediocre - definitely not worth the cost. Server was clumsy and dropped a dirty knife on my white dress and didn't apologize or act too concerned. She dropped silverware off of other plates while clearing them too. Honestly it was so bad (the knife along with the long wait) that we expected something to be comped, which of course it wasn't. Glad I got to spend the rest of the night out with a stain on my dress! THANKS MANGO. I won't be back.

Text: Absolutely beautiful restaurant with a warm ambiance perfect for a date night at a table, or professional hangout at the bar. My fiancé and I stopped here by chance while touring the neighborhood and following our noses. This is the first Peruvian restaurant we've been to and it was delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection and far beyond what we expected. Service was kind and friendly, even when we struggled to decide what to get and kept ordering more and more food! A wonderful place with understandable high reviews.
