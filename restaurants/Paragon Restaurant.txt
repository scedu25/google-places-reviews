Text: 6/16/17, went in for dinner. We were seated & literally sat for 13 minutes while people walked around cleaning tables and servicing other clients. Not one person stopped to greet us. After 15 minutes of waiting we walked out, with workers noticing but no one stopping us or apologizing for the wait.  The food is decent but the service is beginning to lack. Very disappointing...ended up giving my money to Texas Corral.
