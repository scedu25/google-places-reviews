Text: Food was Great, but our Waiter left & didn't even come by and tell he was handing us off to another Waiter. We had to ask for help getting our bill. If the Waiter issue had not come up, I would have given them a 5 Star Rating.

Text: I went here so many times, each is a treat. But at this point I feel like menudo, ceveche, chorizo, carne asada & legit Mexican tacos with lomo(rib eye) would do good in this town. There's nothing like that around here. Every Mexican restaurant is so identical to El Nopal. Prefer more authentic stuff that isn't Americanised. I think this restaurant is the only one that can pull it off. Consider it por favor? At least one day a week or something.
