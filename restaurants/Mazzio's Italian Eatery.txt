Text: Visiting from California, good pizza. They switched the spicy sauce on the pizzas which was great for the kids. The Kens supreme pizza is delicious. We ordered take out and the service was friendly and fast.

Text: Local favorite. But i failed to see the hype. Place was not very clean. I had stomach pain after eating the pizza, bread sticks we ordered. Few of  my group liked their pizza, calzone. You get lots of food for the price, calzones were huge. Prepare for leftover unless you are with super hungry folks.
