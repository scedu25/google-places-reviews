Text: We arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening in September. It was a little busy, but not swamped. After being seated, we decided we wanted to move to the bar. No problem. The server was extremely nice about it. The bar area was a bit more quiet and we were able to take advantage of the happy hour. We had a delicious meal, great service, and felt the prices were very reasonable.

Text: Not your average chain. It has a better atmosphere. Service is always friendly. I have never been disappointed with the food. Honey mustard is delicious.

Text: Our party of 7 had lunch there today and the food & appetizers were delicious. Our server Hannah was fabulous & very attentive. She took care of our every need. We kinda mentioned that we were celebrating our son's birthday ( he turned 25 ) and her & the other servers brought him a birthday dessert & sang to him. They made our day very special. We will definitely go back again.

Text: No too many vegetarian options. But the vegetarian options there are, are very good. Loved the veggie wrap! Curteous waitresses. Clean bathrooms and clean in general.

Text: Very impressed by the menu and food options! Everything from a simple salad to seafood and steak! Food was great....service left a bit to be desired! I asked if they had a certain beer on tap and she looked and said yes, then brought me a beer that was NOT what it was supposed to be.  I asked if she was sure that is what it was and she replied, No! What?! Seriously, you are THE BARTENDER and do not know what beer you have on tap or what you just served!
