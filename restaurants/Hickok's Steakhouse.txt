Hickok's Steakhouse
Rating: 2
Text: Steak was tender but I ordered medium well and got rare.  My wife ordered medium and got rare.  The salad was very ordinary.  Atmosphere was not as quiet as I had hoped. I will give them a second chance since they've just opened recently,  but I hope things improve.  Would love to have a place that I could take my wife for a romantic dinner.

Text: It was great, steak was done to taste, big plus. Price was higher than I anticipated which makes me sad as I believe this place will close sooner than later being in Hays because people don't want to pay a lot (heard people complaining as they reviewed the menu). My wife and I agree it was worth the price. We left stuffed and satisfied. Left a large tip as the wait staff was very attentive. Hope to be able to dine again.

Text: Went a month or so after they opened and the service was a little slow, but not too bad and the food was excellent. Nonetheless, the manager noticed waited a while without us saying anything and apologized. We've been back 3 times since. The food is still fantastic and the service was great every time since.  Great place for a great steak!

Text: The food is always hot, fresh and made to order. The staff are friendly and hospitable. It is a casual dining experience with made from scratch food and in house cut steaks and entrees. I have yet to have an issue with service or food quality.  Just what Hays needed.

Text: We ate here the week the restaurant opened and was very impressed with the service! While pricey, it’s nice to finally have a “nice” place to go in town for special meals out. Also, I think it’s well worth the price because the portions are very large and you also get soup or salad and complimentary fresh bread. Great atmosphere, great food; can’t wait to come back.
