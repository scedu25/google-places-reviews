Text: Minus the hair, the pizza was okay, but the guy making the pizza was a real piece of work.  We asked the waitress if they could split the ticket between 4 of us, and then he came out front grumbling about having to divide it up and said something about us "being adults" and how we should be able to do it ourselves.  He was audibly trying to do the math on it in his head, and when I suggested we could just do it ourselves if it was that difficult, he snapped at me.  Real nice customer service.  The guy is a real jerk! Also, the place has no public bathroom, so if you like to wash your hands before using them to eat pizza, you're out of luck!

Text: Don't advise going there around noon. Our waitress never once asked us if we needed a refill. She didn't seem nice at all. Then when we went to leave we asked for a to go box. Well it was rather small so we had to ask for another and she gave us an even smaller box. It wasn't a really good experience.
