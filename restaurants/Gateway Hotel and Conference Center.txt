Text: Nice rooms, nice restaurant. Has a lobby bar/grill with comfy/cozy seating. Great for groups, teams and families. Great place for conferences, receptions. Overall the entire place is a really good value. Great partnership with Iowa State University.

Text: Located just off the highway. Attended a social event in a conference room. The staff was helpful and professional. Everything looked clean and organized. Would definitely look to here for future needs.

Text: Very happy with this hotel. Rooms are always clean and they have a friendly staff. The wifi is only soon but pretty much every room has an Ethernet port so if you have a wireless router you can bring with you that would help.

Text: Great stay. Nice, clean, beds comfy. Toilets/showers clean and working. Restaurant in the hotel, and nice to be able to stay where the conference was. Would stay again.

Text: My room didn't have the option to run the fan all the time with the air conditioner, so that wasn't ideal for me. Also the bedding smelled lightly of cigarettes. Otherwise it was fine.
