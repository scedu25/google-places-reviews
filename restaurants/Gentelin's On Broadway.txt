Gentelin's On Broadway

Text: I will give the restaurant a 4 because the food was really fabulous. I ordered crab cakes and they were excellent. However I felt like our server took one took and my husband and I and didn't care. She took forever to take our order even though it was very slow when we got there. She was short and dismissive but nice about it. The bus boys and food saved the experience and I would certainly go back for those reasons.

Text: The food is terrific! The staff are attentive. The restaurant appearance is very nice. The price is high but certainly worth it. Would have given 5 stars had the tables not been quite so crammed in. Worst experience was loud, obnoxious man across from us, not the places fault.
We would certainly come again. I would request a table by the window to feel like there is more space. You really should make a reservation.
