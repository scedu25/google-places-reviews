Text: My ribs were okay. (overpriced for what I got) My server- Lindsey? wasn't very attentive. I heard her and the other servers talking about inappropriate things as I was sitting in a table close to them. I thought this was a family establishment.

Text: Unassuming place, but very good food and service. I got their poor cowboy sandwich and it didn't disappoint! Will definitely be going back.
