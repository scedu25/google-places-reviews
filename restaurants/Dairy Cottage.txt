Text: Women are always in a bad mood acting like you're bothering them and there's always a horribly long wait time of at least 20-30 minutes or longer. They're bad about forgetting stuff you ordered when you go through drive thru... but the food is good that's the only reason it's getting 2 stars or itd get 1

Text: So I've only been here twice and it was for ice cream, but today I wanted to order food. I asked a couple of questions about the menu and the person at the register acted annoyed she had to answer my question. Then I had to repeat my order to her because I noticed she didn't ring it up correctly. Then she goes to make my drink and she drips marshmallow all down the side of my cup, so how does she remedy that? Well she grabs a dirty ass towel with God knows what on it and wipes my cup off even up around the mouth of the cup. Um, gross. Then she brings me the drink and it's wrong. Then she told me I ordered wrong, but she'd fix it and acted annoyed again. I finally get the fountain drink I ordered, but she mixed it in the milkshake machine and made my drink a foamy mess. I won't be back.

Text: This place is disgusting, making food with no gloves, dirty tables, food is over priced, private part wipes. Do not eat here unless you like dirty food! The floor needs cleaned, the seats are sticky, it also smells odd. Just ew ?.

Text: Food is okay. Freezing cold inside trying to eat makes for a very unenjoyable experience. Food is a little over priced for what you get and charging extra for the sauce when you order mozzarella sticks is unheard of.
