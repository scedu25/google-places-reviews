Text: Absolutely bomb sushi, and the other stuff is good too. Steven, as always, is one of the best managers in town. Update: 10/19, had Misty as our server. Extremely attentive and friendly. As always, phenomenal food.

Text: I have reviewed this restaurant before, but every time I visit the kind people at Wasabi  Bistro, they have new tasty treats to try! I enjoy an icy cold sake with my sushi, but rarely try something new because I don't want to commit to a whole bottle. The sake shot sampler is amazing! I got to sample 4 very different tastes for only $4.  SO worth it!
The pineapple sake was an entirely new flavor for me; sweet and light and very flavorful. If you like pineapple at all, you'll love it. (And if you don't, you can swap that shot out for another!)
The unfiltered sake (the cloudy one) was yummier than I had imagined. It tastes almost like coconut water, and has a clean finish I didn't expect.
My favorite is the Ozeki Dry. Like its name, it is an exceedingly dry sake with not a hint of sweet or fruit. It may not be for everyone, but I love it. (If dry isn't for you after a taste, just swap it!)
The last one I tried was Pear. It is very pleasant, with just a hint of fruity sweetness. Smooth and nice for sharing.
If you love sake and want to branch out, or if you're interested in some exotic wine tasting, this is the place to go!

Text: We ended up walking out of another sushi place in town because we'd been sitting so long before even being acknowledged. Went here and had fast, friendly service and the food was great.

Text: The Wasabi is actually horseradish. But it's okay because an actual god works there.
