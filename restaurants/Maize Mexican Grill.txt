Text: Fairly priced authentic food.  Efficient staff that keep this very busy place running well. Easily one of the best mexican places in town. I am never disappointed when I eat here.

Text: The service is great, and the food is good. It's not the best Mexican food I've had, but it's good enough that I like going there and will keep coming back. There is not a lot of seating and they are always busy. So, if you go during peak times, don't expect to find a place to sit, and be prepared to wait in line. That being said, it's worth the wait and the staff is super fast.

Text: Best Mexican food I've found in Illinois. They aren't a super fancy place but they just do everything really well. Definitely recommend if you need a quick lunch, though it's a small building without much parking. Definitely a better place to walk to if you are on campus.

Text: Growing up in Arizona, I have some high standards when it comes to Mexican cuisine. Maize delivers. You can't go wrong here. My go-to items are the tacos al pastor and the tortas, but everything is great and tastes like home.

Text: This is an excellent restaurant. The food comes out quickly and is excellently made. The Mexican cuisine is familiar but original enough; avoiding the familiarity trap. Then there's the fact that it tastes excellent. 

Be forewarned, the restaurant is in transition right now. I didn't knock off a star because technically when I went it was a "soft open". The are transitioning from a takeout style of dining to a full-on sit-down experience. 

Thus we waited in line to enter the place because we had to order before we sat down. Also, they did not have a soda fountain yet (they told me it's coming May 24th, '17.)

Other than the growing pains, the food and service are excellent and the meals come out lightning-fast.
