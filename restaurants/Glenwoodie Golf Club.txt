Glenwoodie Golf Club
Rating: 5
Text: Course is in great condition, even after drought conditions in the early summer.  Greens were sanded slightly, but they still were fast and true.  Fairways were immaculate and pace of play was great.  Back nine is much tougher than front nine.  Watch out for 14 and 16, very tough holes for low handicappers.
