Text: Friendly staff. Food not bad. Husband loves their enchilada meal. I like their soup and sandwich combo. And they have a good selection of children's meals.

Text: By far the worst place to eat in Beatrice if you don't want to set for over a hour. It's a Thursday night and it the place has maybe 12 people here only three tables ordering...... will never eat here again!!! I feel like I should let people coming in they will be waiting over a hour to eat!!!
