Danny Boy's Pizza & More

Text: AMAZING PIZZA PLACE. You will not be able to get pizza from anywhere else after you eat here, because it will not compare. They make their own dough. Not greasy. Other reviews have said it is pricey, but I would say it is competitive. You do have to pay with cash or check, but as others have said, there is an ATM in the building. Dine in, carry out, and delivery options. This is the right choice if you are craving EXCELLENT pizza (and who isn't?). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

Text: Drove from Rock Island to enjoy a birthday dinner and it was worth it! Great food, fast and wonderful service and the atmosphere was on top! Cash or checks only, just glad I had my check book!

Text: Decent place with a clean atmosphere.  Pizza is good but not any different than the myriad of other Harris style joints around the Quad Cities.  They do not take credit cards, but they have an ATM machine by the entrance.  If you're home to Geneseo, it's a recommendation, but I would not make a special trip here from the Quad Cities.
