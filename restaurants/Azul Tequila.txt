Text: Omar was one of the best servers I've ever had. Not only did he help with making a decision he was very entertaining and made the whole visit great. The food came out super fast and despite being charged the wrong amount on my card, he took care of it right away and was very thorough in fixing it. First time here and definitely can't wait to return.

Text: Restroom trash can was heaping over with tissue paper covered with feces, toilet was also covered with feces, service was unbelievably slow as we watched our server co mingle with the rest of the staff. We were one of two tables in the entire dining area, they were extremely slow so there is absolutely no excuse for the poor service. I can see why they were slow, no one wants to go there. This was Saturday about 5 p.m. , should have been packed.

Text: The margarita was excellent. The enchiladas didn't seem to be made with a true corn tortilla and the filling had no seasoning just chicken.
