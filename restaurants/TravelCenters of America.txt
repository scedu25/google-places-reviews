Text: Let's see pretty shower room and clean but no place to set anything down and had to be about the most dangerous shower I've ever taken the floor was so slippery. I thought I was going to fall for sure. Luckily I did not. Now let's talk coffee.. no decaf and was going to get regular coffee...heart problem be dam...but they are out of the French vanilla creamer.. so no coffee for Julie today. At least I did not spend a penny here.

Text: Very large quiet truck parking lot. Three quarters of the lot is dirt and gravel. Buffet food fresh and well stocked even after 9pm. Store and restaurant staff friendly and helpful. Not to many places for truck parking in the area. This TA is a very nice place to stop.

Text: Very large restrooms, lots of these "large" truck stops don't have restrooms big enough to handle all it. This one does.
