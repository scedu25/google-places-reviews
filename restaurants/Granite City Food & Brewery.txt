Granite City Food & Brewery
Rating: 4
Text: Late lunch on a Sunday. Place was mostly empty, but kitchen was still fast and food was fresh. Terry deserves 5 stars, he must have been a waiter at a much nicer establishment in the past. The food was ok, the slightest bit better than fast casual chains, but not worth the premium prices. They do brew some very decent beer and their loyalty club is pretty good. Just like the food, it won't compete if you're from a larger urban area, but it is better than most locally. They were doing some Oktoberfest specials which were sort of Bavarian themed, I guess, but not like anything you would find in Germany, stick to the regular menu.

Text: Have had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. They staff seems to always be attentive, while ensuring you have all of your needs met. The food has always been above and beyond, their Idahoan Nacho's are truly a feast by themselves. Their Kentucky Mules are always a great drink.

Text: Not impressed with their over priced breakfast.  Their signature hash browns had no taste other than watery potatoes.  The scrambled eggs were tasteless.  The bacon and sausage were sitting in grease in the pan. They only have one person working the omelet bar so unless you want to stand and wait 20 minutes you end up eating of the buffett.  The only good things was the caramel roll.  Then I got the bill. $21.35 for the brunch and a pop. No bar drinks just a pop.  Never again.
