Panda Cafe

Text: I work nearby and would often visit Panda Cafe for their amazing lunch special. For just about $7 I could get rice, an entree, a side and soup! The portions were always perfect and the staff was decent. One day in July 2017 I visited and found not 1, not 2, but THREE dead gnats floating in my wonton soup. I'm not sure how the waiter even missed it... but nonetheless, he sat it on my table. I called my the hostess over and told her about the gnats. She didn't apologize or offer a discount or a complimentary meal, but she simply said, "Ok," and took the soup away. She brought back another bowl of soup (which I was skeptical about because I doubt they make each bowl fresh), and brought the rest of my food out. When I was done eating, still no offer of a discount for the gross, inconvenient experience, nothing. I haven't been back since. I would not recommend this place simply because of their poor hospitality and ability to shield their food from insects.

It would get a five star rating if only they offered discounts to honor our Senior Citizens and Veterans.

Text: I got the General Tao's Chicken and my wife got the Orange Chicken. Entrees are reasonably priced, come with rice and egg roll or crab rangoon, and you get a fortune cookie and truffle after. The fried rice was excellent, both chicken dishes were great, and we were filled up. 

The decor is nice, very green, but low lit, with beautiful hand painted artwork at the booths. The bathrooms are single seaters, but very well kept and spacious. 

The staff was friendly, and we got our drinks quickly, and our food within 15 minutes of ordering. We'll be coming back!
