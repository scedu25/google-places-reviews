Text: This is a very nice place to eat. It's out in the country and they have a large selection of delicious food to choose from. The restaurant decor is very inviting and the waitresses are friendly and very careful to give great service.

Text: I like the building and the way it's set up but the food's too expensive for the quality and when you finish, they bring the bill, you pay, and if you decide to stick around to eat just make sure your glass is already full bc the waitress/waiter won't come back.
