Text: Delicious. Trendy and a small menu. Not a ton on low-carb options but the Cobb Salad fits the bill perfectly. Remember to pay for parking meter.

Text: The staff were attentive and helpful, the menu was interesting, the food superb. Anyone that gave this place less than five stars would complain that you gave them a used present if you gave them a gold coin from the wreck of the Attocia.

Text: Just did the Easter Brunch and flat out loved it!   Smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, mac and cheese (to die for), sugar baked ham, large shrimp, mashed potatoes from heaven just for starters.  Didn't count but had to be 50 main items plus 30 deserts.  The cherry pie was tart to perfection.  
Our family has a new holiday tradition at Triumph Grill.
