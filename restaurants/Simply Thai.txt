Text: Having spent a few months in Thailand, I can say this is really authentic Thai food. Great service and incredibly spicy stuff. I like it _really_ hot, and normally they offer a spice level of 1-5 ,  but you can go all the way to 40 (which is not a good idea).
But they also accommodate if you don't like it hot. My friend even asked them to remove the black pepper, and he was able to thoroughly enjoy his fried rice.

Text: What's not to love!  Great Thai food that's consistent!one our favorite restaurants in a city that is filled with decadent selections.  Good service, solid wine selection and the menu is filled with great choices from pad Thai to curry.  You can't lose with this one.

Text: Usually eat here once a month with family and the food is always great! Service is great as well. For appetizers, usually get the Fried Tofu. I enjoy the Loaded Fried Rice with vegetables and tofu (Spice level 4) with the hot chili oil on the side. The loaded fried rice has great flavor and truly you can't go wrong with the dish. My wife loves the Woon Sen Pad Thai with tofu and/or vegetables. The sweet potato noodles in the Woon Sen are really tasty. Definitely recommend this location and the staff and service are great!

Text: The restaurant was clean and the team was friendly.  Our food arrived all at once which was a little frustrating but it was flavorful and delicious.  Their house salad is one of the best around.  My husband had the chicken pad Thai and I had the sweet potato noodle pad Thai with 4 heat!  Delicious and I have enough for lunch tomorrow too!  We will be back ?.
