Text: The food was good. Larger proportions and well presented. This place has not just booth tables, but also has tables in booths for more privacy. Why 4 stars? It took a very long time to get our food as in 75 minutes. Also it was very loud and had to yell in order to place my order or talk with friends. We stayed at the Hilton garden inn and enjoyed the short walk.

Text: Excellent service, wonderful ambiance and the food was outstanding.
We were after the best burger in St Louis and i think we found it!  The Classic was outstanding, served with hand cut fries.

Text: Annie Gunn's offers refined comfort food. In the mood for steak and potatoes? You can have that here, but it is elevated to an entirely new level. Wonderful ambiance. Great service. You need to try the shrimp.

Text: Great place for steaks! The New York strip steak one of the best I've eaten! It was thick cut and flavorful with a perfectly seared and season outer edge. The Crab cakes were excellent.  The andouille sausage added a unique flavor, making them especially good. I was not impressed with the monkfish chowder.  Although it was flavorful, it was mostly corn and potatoes, it was hard to find a piece of fish in the bowl.

Text: I wasn't sure what to get when I came here as I am not a steak guy, so I got "The Classic" Hamburger and some potato soup (I know I'm boring).  The potato soup was a standard potato soup and was pretty good. It was a good burger though and one of the cheapest options on the menu for you budget diners out there.  The Classic comes with 2 pieces of "Annie Gunn’s Brown Sugar Cured House Smoked Local Hog Belly" which sounds pretty fancy, but kind of get overwhelmed when you put the pickles and other standard hamburger toppings on that it comes with.  If I were to get a burger again, I'd pass on the bacon.  I do have to mention though, that the burger also comes with a mustard though that is the best mustard I've ever had.  It was great.  I'd order a burger again just to get the mustard.  The homemade pickles and fries were really good as well.
My wife actually got the Filet and really liked it.  I will even admit it was good (again, this coming from someone who never likes steak).
