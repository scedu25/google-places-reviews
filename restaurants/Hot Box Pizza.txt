Hot Box Pizza

Text: The product itself is pretty good. We ordered a large cheese and large pepperoni pizza and bread sticks. I would rate the food at 4 stars. We went in to pick up the pizza and were greeted with greasy windows at the front door. Looking a little more, I could tell the windows haven't been cleaned in a long while. Going inside I noticed the floors where really dirty and half the tables had old cups and trash on them. You can always tell when a place is dirty because it was just previously busy. This was not the case at this store. This place has a serious management problem and it is too bad because the food is pretty good. I can't recommend it.

Text: The pizza I had which was the vegi delight tasted absolutely disgusting. Not worth the money. Wish I could get my money back or a reorder.

Text: We ordered a pizza via telephone for delivery.  A sweet girl named Kelsey answered the phone.  She was very friendly and bubbly.  After waiting quite a bit past the time we were told I called to make sure there wasn't a problem with our address.  Kelsey answered again.  She was apologetic and went above and beyond to make it right.  A nice gentleman brought our food.  It was a great service and we will be ordering again soon! ?
