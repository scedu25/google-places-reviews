Text: Great environment and really good quality food. Staff  was very nice and accommodating. We stayed almost 45 minutes over their closing time and yet not a single time we were reminded to leave. Looks like they pay close attention to menu items and keep what is working for customers. Definitely recommend.

Text: Enjoyed beer samples, trying things we would not have if Austin did not suggest. Food is good and tasty. Price point is higher than prefer. Austin has embraced the Ale House business, immersing himself in various brews. He takes care of you from sit down to finish making you feel at ease to enjoy the brewery selections. Kudos to Austin.

Text: Good food and good beer list.  An all around great place to dine.  List one star for slow service, but still all around good.

Text: Whether it's a main entree or lighter fare you're after, Reds is a local favorite in the North Liberty area. Salads, sandwiches, and burgers abound in unison with a beautifully revolving beer list, showcasing the best that local Iowa produce farmers and brewers have to offer. Recommended for those who love 50+ beer availability or atypical "pub" food.
