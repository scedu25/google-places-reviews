Playa Azul Authentic Mexican
Rating: 5
Text: I am very happy to say that we recently moved back to Nebraska from another state. I was happy to see that Playa Azul was still in business. Should have been no doubt that they were still in business with the delicious food that they serve and the ample portions. I'm happy to report that their food is as delicious as ever and very reasonably priced I might say. Keep up the good work!

Text: Went a few times and out of those couple times 3 times they didn't have my food ready . Didn't even write it down to be made. No apologies for the inconveniences acted like I owe them something. Never going back.  Good taste ok.
