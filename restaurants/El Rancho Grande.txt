Rating: 2
Text: Bad food, bad Service.  The only reason I give two stars is because we complained and they took 25% off the bill.  I definitely will not be back.

Text: I would hardly call this Mexican food. The worst I've ever had. Ate here night before last and I will not be back.

Text: My 2nd experience here was as perfect as my 1st!! Drove from the Kalamazoo, MI area with my fiance' to share a night out in this gorgeous lakeshore town that I'd stumbled upon a few weeks earlier.  Nothing against South Haven (where we traditionally frequent), but this town, it's restaurants, and it's appeal is truly where It's At!!!!  
Katie, our waitress, was not going to let us settle for anything less than a 5-star visit...and we were equally impressed with a gentleman that delivered a spicier salsa to our table that we requested.  He didn't leave our table until we tried it & gave him our thumbs-up seal of approval.
We also were treated to a special night of live music in the bar area from a wonderful 3-man band headed by Jim, a very genuinely nice and fun-spirited man of many hats (as he explained he is a State Farm agent actively invested in the Orland Park, IL area who is also friends of this restaurant's owner Pete.
We didn't leave this establishment without getting a healthy dose of terrific Mexican food, service, atmosphere, fun, and a 1st class impression of the owner, Pete and his family/friends.  
My fiance' and I know where we're headed on our downtime now, and we couldn't have found a more perfect place to relax & have great food & friends than El Rancho Grande!!!
