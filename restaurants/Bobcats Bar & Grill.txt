Text: Came home for the 1st time in 3 yrs. Decided to try this place w/ my parents & we were not disappointed! They had great food. Huge portions for a great price. Fresh & hot! I will absolutely be back when I come back for a visit. The waitress we had was wonderful also.

Text: Food here is always great!  Try the tenderloin sandwich or meal or the chicken strips are amazing!!  Little shrimp appetizers are great and the Buffalo wings are my all time favorite!  Early dinner hours are busy but have a frozen sangria and wait it out!

Text: Food was great! Atmosphere was fun and quaint with big windows. Bathrooms a little dark but very clean. Only bad part was no changing table.
