Mexican Village Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: I've been a loyal customer of Mexican Village (both their Detroit & Utica locations) for decades.  Their food is consistent - I have NEVER been served a bad meal in either location.  Whenever I have friends from out of state visit, it's the restaurant I take them to.  I'm adamant about no national chain food for my visitors - Detroit based only (visitors need to know about Metro Detroit's diversity, its different ethnic cuisines, & great eateries!!!)  Both restaurants have great food, affordable prices, & are staffed by people that provide good, courteous service.

Text: Nice, clean and friendly environment. I attended a Baby Shower. The catered food was great and Margaritas were fabulous. Not being bias because I really don't care a lot for Mexican Cuisine. If you do, you won't go wrong here.

Text: My wife and I love this place. We've never had a bad meal there, the staff is friendly and the food comes super fast even when they're busy on a Saturday. Can't miss when you're in town, a must-stop.

Text: You are going to want to drink the salsa. No, I'm serious. Pro-tip: You can order some salsa (and chips) to go and they put it in a to-go drink cup. Love, love the chicken chimi, pro-tip: ask for cheese to be melted on top of it. Fajitas are top notch also. No need to go over to the Mexican Town area for that other place, this is all you need.
