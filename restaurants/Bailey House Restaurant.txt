Bailey House Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: I've visited many casual sit-down restaurants over the years, and Bailey House is one of the nicest I can recall. It has the appearance of a fancy diner, but the prices are quite reasonable. The portion sizes are unbelievably generous as well. Service is friendly and attentive. I can usually find something to complain about with most restaurants, but Bailey House is as close to perfect as I'm going to find. If you ever wind up in Camp Point, this restaurant should be part of your visit.

Text: The restaurant itself was very cool. The building used to be an opera house. There was a lot of town history on its walls. The food was great and the server was very attentive. I'm sure my wife and will stop by again.
