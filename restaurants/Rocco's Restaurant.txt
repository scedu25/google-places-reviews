Text: Service was exceptional, extremely friendly & comforting, made for a great experience. Got a plate of spaghetti and meatballs which was very filling. Delicious food and generous portions! Owner was there and thanked us for coming as we left. Would highly recommend this establishment to anyone in the South Bend/Notre Dame area!

Text: The best food I have had during my trip to South Bend. Pizza, salad, and cheesy bread were all fantastic. Service was quality and the owner greeted us and checked on us. There's a reason this place is known for best pizza since 1951. Highly recommend if you are in town!

Text: One of my favorite restaurants anywhere! The pizza is great, the staff efficient and friendly. Even on a crazy night after a football game, when it is packed, you never get the feeling that you are being rushed. Can't say enough good things about Rocco's!
