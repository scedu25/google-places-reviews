Hickory House

Text: The food was good. The service was good. However, a reservation is a must! Plus, if you are considering going here because of the menu items and prices you see online... don't. The prices and menu online was not updated. I spent more money than expected, wasn't able to get food items I was wanting from the online menu, and was very disappointed.

Text: We just tried Hickory House for the first time and it was really good. I got the Ruben sandwich and it was delicious. We also got fried mushrooms as an appetizer. There were many in the bowl to share. The waitress also kept our drinks full the entire time we were there. We will go back.

Text: Wonderful, friendly, and attentive server. Unfriendly and a bit rude male host. I had the ribeye cooked medium. It was perfectly prepared. The best steak I've had in years! All the food was well prepared. Will be going back!

Text: They can't get a simple carry out order right.  Ordered soup, ended up with a cup full of cottage cheese instead and I won't be inconvenienced by going back.  Sad...

Text: Food is always great.  Tonight's server, Bryan,  was exceptional - kept glasses filled and anticipated our needs.
