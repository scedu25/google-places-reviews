Text: My first time going and I plan on going again! Everything was splendid! Atmosphere, staff, and food! Started out with perfectly stuffed mushrooms, continued with a wonderfully balanced Gregory salad, and finished off with seared swordfish on a smokey bed of cooked lettuce and topped with tangy red onions and sided with garlic Brussels sprouts! Excellent!

Text: Thank you to our waiter Patrick for an awesome evening! From the moment we walked we were completely thrilled with JB Hook's. Great food, and even better service. Patrick turned what we expected to be a good dinner into a truly wonderful experience. We will definitely be coming back!!

Text: This is a followup to my last post but because of the unreasonable rules where one has to wait a month to enter another review on Travel Adviser, I'm going to enter it now. 
Granted, the previous post was accurate on how great the service was and how delicious the food is. 
I gave this low rating for two occurrences I noticed. The first being the "Trip Adviser" rating site sign in the waiting area to review this restaurant and also when the bill is brought out, there is a card asking to rate it on the "Trip Adviser" website and also the servers are asking to rate the restaurant. This drive to get customers to rate the restaurant was excessive. The second occurrence I saw on this restaurant's review was the replies from the manager who put "thanks" for the not so good rating. One would think the manager would take the time and effort to look at why the rating was low and reach out to the rater.Last, to get to the eating area, one has to go through the bar which allows smoking.

Text: The view from the outdoor patio overhanging the cliff is fabulous. You can see all the boats and houses. The food is exceptional. We had wafer crackers with a tomato, and  cream cheese dip brought to the table for a starter free.  Then the potatoes were brought to the table with butter, sour cream, bacon bits real, scallions. The prime rib was delicious. All in all a great night.
