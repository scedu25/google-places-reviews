Text: The service was quick and friendly . They have the best seafood we've ever had , and for what we got the price was good . We got the seafood platter , would recommend it to those who love seafood . We wasn't sure we would like the clams but it was excellent. For those who posted it took a while to get their food , it is no longer than any other sit down   Restaurant. Enjoy your company .  Our food came out in a timely manner .

Text: Food was great but the Potpourri was overpowering! Otherwise I would have given it a 5. Do not go here if you want fast food. This is on the grill steak and lobster and it is a great place to eat but it is not fast food
