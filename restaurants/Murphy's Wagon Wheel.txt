Text: If you've never been here you must stop in!!!  They have the best oriental salad!  Love the grilled cheese sandwiches and the popcorn is unbeatable.  Comfortable family atmosphere, music low enough one can comfortable visit.  The wait staff is super friendly.  Ball games and beer, what more can I say.   We have been coming here for over 35 years now.  Come share a fun eve. here with friends and family!

Text: Service was ok, drinks never got refilled, though we were next the wait station. If she had come back to check on us maybe she could have had the kitchen give us better food. We ordered burgers medium well and they were so overcooked they were burned, dry and crunchy. They were awful and we could barely eat them. It really would have been nice to have some extra water to wash them down.  I normally give positive reviews, but aside from the fries and the free eclipse glasses, there was nothing positive about our experience. They did come highly recommended, so maybe we caught them on an off day.

Text: Burger not seasoned well. Very inconsistent good from one time to the next. Server was friendly. Decor needs updating
