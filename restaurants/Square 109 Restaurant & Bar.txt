Text: We were in there on a Saturday morning and they had several empty dirty tables with a seat yourself sign. We sat down at a dirty table and waited over 10 minutes with no service. All of the servers walked by without a word. A guy and his son came in after us and sat down at a dirty table next to us and within two minutes the table was cleaned and their order was taken. You must have to know a a waitress to get any service. Food loomed good, wish we could have tried some.
