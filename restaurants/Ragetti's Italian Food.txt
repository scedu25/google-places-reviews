Ragetti's Italian Food
Rating: 5
Text: Our family met at Ragetti's and had a variety of items from the menu.  The pizza was very yummy....some of the best!  Everything is homemade.  Servers were pleasant and accommodating.  My husband got the tortellini and said it was delicious.  The servings were huge and big enough to share! The chicken wings were fabulous! and the desserts were yummy too! My mother in law enjoyed the tiramisu. The server brought a 6 inch complementary  birthday cake to the table as we were celebrating my husband's birthday and it was good too!
