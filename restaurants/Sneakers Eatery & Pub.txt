Text: Ordered nachoes for a app took a half hour to get and when I did get it it was just warm my burger order was screwed up had to send it back to have it done right the server was just as much to blame for the mistake as the kitchen for not checking her order before serving it. I did see the cook come out of the kitchen repeatedly during our wait I would also like to point out I came in at 4 pm and was the only table won't be returning

Text: Use to love coming here. Mixed drinks have really gotten terrible. And the karaoke night has to stop. Suffered a migraine for 2 days following my last visit. For the love of all that is holy, at least please turn down the volume. Especially if I'm going to be sober because you can't mix a drink.
