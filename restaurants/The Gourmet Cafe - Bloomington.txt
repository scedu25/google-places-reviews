The Gourmet Cafe - Bloomington

Text: This place has good drink specials in the summer and good appetizers, but the service is hit or miss and the quality of the entrees don't justify the price. This is a good meeting place for drinks with friends, but if you're looking to impress someone or for a true fine dining experience, give this place a pass.

Text: A great low key place to stay, location is great, surrounding area is quiet and the rooms are amazing. The staff is very professional and Kim was amazing the entire stay. It is rare that you meet someone who is so passionate about their job and it show with Kim.

Her garden Benedict was out of this world and having need met without hesitation just made my stay feel like I was at a friends house. Thank you Kim and Scholars Inn for your great attention to detail, warm atmosphere and comfortable setting. You are first class.
