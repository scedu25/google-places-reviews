Jeff Ruby's Steakhouse, Louisville

Text: I've been to a few nice steak houses and this has to be up there with the best. Our steak was truly flavourful and the mac & cheese to die for. To top it off our server was wonderfully attentive. The assistant attentive yet almost invisible. The ambience of the place fit together many unique aspects in a most wonderful way. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our date. One of the best dining experiences we've ever had.

Text: This place is perfection when it comes to food service atmosphere. No other restaurant compares, never disappointed!! Family size portion so you always have something to take home. Steak is amazing you can cut it with a butter knife. Drinks are excellent if any issues they'll take it back and not charge. If you're looking for an amazing place to go eat whether it's a first date special occasion or just because this is the place to go

Text: Great atmosphere and delicious food! We did not make reservations so we had to wait about 20 min. to sit at the bar, but that was our mistake. Definitely call ahead to make reservations!! The staff was very nice and friendly. A bit pricey but worth every penny! Highly recommend!

Text: The dinner was fantastic. Communication between staff must be incredible, because I booked online and noted it was our anniversary. Every staff person, from the host to the servers, all knew and congratulated us throughout the evening. Very nice touch. My wife and I both agreed it was the best steak of our lives, and we come from St. Elmo's country, which is a high benchmark. Another small detail, but made an impression, is their take home bags. They provide a reusable, fabric grocery bag for your leftovers. It's a brilliant marketing move, as we will use these over time, versus the standard paper bag provided at all comparable restaurants. Overall, 5 star experience and definitely worth the drive from Indianapolis.

Text: We dine at Jeff Ruby's about once a year since we live about 6 hours away. The service is always top notch and the food is excellent. I always order the bone-in fillet. This is one of the best steaks I've ever had. We look forward to going back every year.
