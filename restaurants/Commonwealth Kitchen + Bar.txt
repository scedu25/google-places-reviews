Text: I now have another reason to cross the bridge to Henderson. The food and service was excellent, the atmosphere laid back, and the receipts in a book a fun touch.

Text: I was disappointed. Everyone talks about how good this place is. I ordered a burger medium-well. It was still bloody in the middle. They were very apologetic and took it back and cooked me another that was done but dry. They also gave us a free dessert by way of apology. So good points for customer service. 

 They had live entertainment that was NOT good. The kid was an average guitar player at best but should have never opened his mouth to sing. 

Overall I found the place to be over-priced and pretentious. Just not my kind of place. I guess I'm just not a hipster.

Text: Date night with my husband.  We love to try new places.  Unfortunately this will be our only visit here.   Poor service (to the point we had to ask another waiter to bring our original drink order)   Meals brought out separately 12 minutes apart - Had to hunt down waiter when we needed a refill on our drink order.  Chicken Salad on Flat bread - flat, flat, flat in taste.  Overpriced, poor service.  Sorry will not be returning.

Text: Great service, good food and excellent cocktail, all at reasonable prices (although the pistachio lamb entree was priced a bit high considering the lack of sides other than standard potatoes). It's not a place you would go for fine cuisine, but it seems to excel at what it does and who it is. We definitely would return.

Text: Gastro pubs are quite rare in the Evansville region so this place is especially valuable. Menu options are rock solid. Bourbon options are very good. Wine and beer options are decent. Environment is casual and social.
