Rick's White Light Diner
Rating: 3
Text: So drove into Frankfort and had to stop in and eat at Rick's. The place is super small, but the food was good, yeah just good. It's  helpful if you like Cajun food. Again the food was good...not great, but paid for great. The place is a bit expensive for what you get. Got 2 po boys and water and it was $40, $46 including tip. Also if you have to use the restroom better go before you get to Rick's. Getting to the 1 restroom in the place was an adventure. It's in the basement and the stairs were something from an evil dead movie.  Was definitely an experience.

Text: This place is awesome, the food is great and the people are even better. If your looking for good local food and beer this is the place to be. My wife and I went in for a quick meal and ended up spending three hour having great conversations with the staff. It's a place worth making a detour for on your way anywhere.

Text: Great food (despite high prices). Cajun-themed options, plus all day breakfast and sky-high (tall) tricked out burgers with all the fixins! They don't serve tap water, so when you ask for "just water" be prepared to shell out over two bucks. Food is good enough, I'll probably go back.
