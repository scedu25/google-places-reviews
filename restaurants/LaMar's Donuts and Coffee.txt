LaMar's Donuts and Coffee
Rating: 5
Text: I went in early on a Sunday morning, and the line for service was wrapped all the way around the store! The staff was really on top of it though, moved people through quickly, and got me my donuts and out the door faster than I thought possible. I highly recommended donuts and the service.
