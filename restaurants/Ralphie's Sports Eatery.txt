Ralphie's Sports Eatery
Rating: 3
Text: Not a bad restraunt, but what kind of sports bar doesn't have all the sports channels on their DirecTV? I realize this is Buckeye country, but me and my friend are from out of town and wanted to watch the UK game and they don't have SEC Network. Other than that they have good beer prices and decent food.

Text: Decent food, decent prices. Nothing spectacular or stand out. Typical bar type food. Burgers, pizza, etc etc. Drink was a little watered down, barely any taste to it. Waitress was good, didn't come around too much or too little. Place was kinda dead, another waitress/server played on her phone for 20+ minutes in easy view of everyone there. I'm not one of those "no phones while working" person, God knows mines attached to me all the time, but I was always taught to at least do it out of view of patrons. Especially in the food service industry since phones have high levels of bacteria. Other than that I would have no problem returning here again.

Text: 20 wings for 10$, best deal in T-Town. Wings could be made with a little bit more sauce though but still the best around

Text: I like there Cajun ranch wings the most out of everything here but I will say my food quality and service has been inconsistent. Twice I've order 30 wings and they jam packed them into two styrofoam containers and the end result was a ball of disgustingness. When they are packed in there aluminum trays it's usually pretty dang good. If it was consistent it'd be a 4

Text: Wings were good just not enough sauce. Waitress excellent
