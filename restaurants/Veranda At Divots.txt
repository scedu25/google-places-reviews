Veranda At Divots
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is excellent! The staff are very friendly and helpful! If you're planning an event at the DeVent center, be sure to ask for Todd---you don't want the other one. She's frustrating and adds unwanted stress. However, the rest of the staff is very willing to help out and make your stay pleasant!
