Text: Good food with fast, friendly service.   The new waitress, Jocelyn, was our server; she was very kind and very knowledgeable of the menu, as though she'd been there for a long time.

Text: I always drove by but never stopped in. I finally did a few weeks ago with my fiancé and I have to say I love the environment and I liked the pizza and service....enough to fill out an application. Nice place for family and great service.

Text: Ordered delivery- cold pizza & wings. The turkey club tasted really weird/ gross. They usually taste pretty good

Text: Good pizza. Adding extrs items is way to expensive though. You can go to long horn for what delivery will cost you.
