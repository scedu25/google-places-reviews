Text: takes forevvvvvvvvvvver for them to prepare your food and it's slightly overpriced when compared to similar food establishments in town.  the food is good but I don't feel it is worth the time and the wait.  this town needs a fazolis or davincis

Text: A little pricey for the amount you get. Took a family of 5 and it was $32. That was for 2 adults and 3 kids and 1 kid didn't order she ate off of our plates.
