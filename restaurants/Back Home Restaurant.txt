Text: Service was great and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  The food was good but not the best.  The ham was very thin, over cooked, and very dry.  The pinto beans, cornbread, and broccoli casserole were amazing.  This was my first time here so maybe the ham isn't always that way.  I will definitely be coming here again to give it another go.  If anything, the friendly staff and at home atmosphere warrant another visit.

Text: They are a triple threat, great food, friendly service and great ambiance.  Best fried green tomatoes I have ever had. Rustic homey decor that they have for sale. I loved this place and will be back.

Text: A restaurant should be consistent with the quality of their food. This one was great when I first moved to the area five years ago.  Second visit was just okay.  Third visit I decided they were using canned vegetables.  Seriously, don't know if I will return. Just not tasting like home cooked food anymore. Maybe things have changed, but I don't like spending my money on food that is not what it is supposed to be. Try for yourself.

Text: Great little find.  Food was amazing.  The pretzel balls and cheese were the best.  Make sure to get 2 orders at least!  Getting seated was slow, but otherwise a great experience.
