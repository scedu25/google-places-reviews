Text: Best Food Ever! I wouldn't recommend going to El Vaqero, because one of the worker at La Pachanga said they order a steak when they cut into BLOOD came out!

But La Pachanga has good food,great service, and really fast food

Text: I know they were busy during family weekend but we stopped by mid-afternoon on a Saturday. Service was good and fairly fast. That's why I'm giving them 3 stars. Food on the other hand was disappointing. Chicken quesadilla was served soggy on a plate with runoff from something (melted cheese?). Refried beans didn't have much texture and were almost like a soup. Tamale, cheese dip and salsa were ok.  Not a good first impression.
