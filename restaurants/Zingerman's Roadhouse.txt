Text: Service is great and food tastes good. It does seem overpriced, however. I understand that the company sources its meat locally and they are ethically raised. Even with that considered, $17 for a mound of mashed potatoes and greens and a very small amount of pork seems to be too much. Food quality is great but just seems too pricey for a normal lunch.

Text: First time here. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Prices are a bit high but the food is locally sourced and made from scratch. Definitely will be recommending to other people and I will be back!

Text: WOW!  My friend and I went to celebrate with a birthday breakfast. The experience could not have been nicer!  Mandy, our waitress was friendly and amazing! She brought us some special treats "on the house" AND was happy to accommodate our special variations on the menu to provide us with a lower carb breakfast.  Wonderful service!!!!

Text: Great restaurant. The staff and food are top of the line. The BBQ and chicken are something you will remember. As the desserts and adult beverages are unique.

Text: It's a pretty penny to eat here. I wouldn't say it's always worth it, either. The biscuits and gravy are delicious but they never make enough and run out by noon during weekend brunches. I understand the demand, but if your brunch goes until 2 or 3 then you absolutely need to make sure you make enough biscuits to have on hand. I have found that the service isn't as good as it used to be. The ribs are phenomenal and I will return for specific items on the menu!
