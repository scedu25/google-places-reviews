Text: The most authentic Sushi and freshest fish anywhere in Ohio. This Sushi Bar was my very first Sushi Bar experience. I became a regular and would go every day at one point. The owners know me by name as well as a few of the servers. The restaurant has a very homey atmosphere where you feel like you're walking into a home rather than a restaurant. I've tried a LOT of other sushi and I still believe that this place has the BEST tasting and FRESHEST fish you can find. It is by far the most authentic sushi bar I've ever been to. Amazing place, amazing service, amazing food. You will not be disappointed with the amazing hospitality this place has to offer.

Text: Great little sushi restaurant but kind of hard to find from the road. It's back in the strip mall area. Food was expensive but delicious and it's bring your own alcohol.
