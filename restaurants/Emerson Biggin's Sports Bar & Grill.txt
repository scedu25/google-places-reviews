Text: First time visitor at 5:30PM with friends: lime margarita (supposed to be strawberry) was served in a plastic cup, tasted so super sweet I could only force myself to drink 1/2. Also ordered a Dr. Pepper at same time, it came out about 10 minutes after the margarita. Service was ok, very long waits between seeing our server. Ordered food - it looked pretty but tasted bland. IF I ever return I'll order water and eat before I enter.

Text: Went in for breakfast at 10:00 a.m.  Ordered our coffee which was delivered quickly. Only 3 other tables were occupied but after waiting over 10 minutes for someone to take our order we left. We receive much faster service and delicious food at IHOP. Sorry we didn't get to try their food.
