Text: This is an old haunt of my husband and his mom's. It is one of the few places they will order Chinese (Cantonese) food, and they will go out of their way to buy from this two-store chain.

The new owner here seems lazy and like he doesn't care that you're there, which is a shame. They really need someone more customer-service-friendly at the front of the house, and perhaps someone who can talk to and relate to the "round-eye" clientele a little better.

Their decor is elaborate and their food is delicious. The taste of the food is what keeps this place going. I really recommend bringing groups who are fascinated by Chinese culture and love Chinese (Cantonese) cuisine. It's a beautiful place to sit and eat Chinese/Cantonese food. Old-fashioned and quiet.

It could use a good cleaning and updating. Just saying. Otherwise, nearly perfect.

Text: We were rudely shooed away 50 mins before the posted closing time by a disgruntled, disgraceful, and disrespectful man. The guy was acting like a real beefstew...a rusty nail.
