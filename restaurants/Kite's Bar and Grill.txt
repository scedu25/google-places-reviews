Text: Kite's Bar and Grill is a casual pub for the college crowd.  The food is pretty good, and the beer is beer.  I'd come here again.

Text: It's a decent sports bar with decent bar food. Nothing that stands out as more than average. Except for the color of the Horny Toad Margarita that didn't make me any hornier than normal.
