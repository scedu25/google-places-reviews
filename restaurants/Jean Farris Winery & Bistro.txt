Jean Farris Winery & Bistro

Text: Best burger EVER!  Hands down my best dining experience in Lexington yet.  Chef Nate is extremely talented and incredibly personable.  Dessert was over the top and I? can’t wait to come back.  If you’ve never been to Jean Farris and are thinking about it, think no more.  It’s worth every penny or should I? say dollar!

Text: We used to love the wines and were wine club members. Sadly, the wine is undrinkable. I'd rather have box wine than anything from Jean Farris. We just paid for our final wine club wines...$83 for two bottles of wine that will go down the drain.

Text: Reservations made in advance and they were so rude  (Jessica)  and could not accomdate a group of 20 even though that was what the reservation was for. My first time here and I will never go there again!!! Very rude employees. We left and went to another winery that was happy to receive business from 20 customers!!!

Text: We tried 2 flights of wine, the sweet and the house blend and we weren't that impressed with any.  Everything seemed overpriced. We like to support local business but not when it takes advantage of you.
