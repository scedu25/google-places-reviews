Text: If I am going to be put on hold when ordering, I would like the person on the phone to have the courtesy to tell me I am being put on hold--instead of putting down the receiver and ignoring me after I start my order.

Text: Pizza is ok.  Breadsticks ROCK MY FACE OFF.  My wife and I frequent the place usually just for the breadsticks.  And for fun-factor you can play a guessing game, as the price of breadsticks goes up and down seemingly with the phases of the moon.  But always a decent price.
