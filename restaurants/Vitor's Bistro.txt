Text: Very tasty breakfast. The doughnuts were yummy. Had the French toast. Someone had the omelette. No leftovers. Must have been talking.

Text: This is a big-city restaurant with a small town feel.  The sushi was freshly prepared and as good as any I've had.  It was a bit pricey, but they have a nightly happy hour that will get you half off.  The chef specials were where they really shined, I've had shrimp and grits in Charleston and this was better.  The salmon, pork and pasta dishes served at our table were equally amazing.  We also had a side of brussel sprouts that you have to try.  Sorry, none of us made it to the dessert menu...

Support your outstanding local businesses and give this place a try!!!!
