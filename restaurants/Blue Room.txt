Text: Wow! Definitely something special. Those mozzarella sticks were so golden and crispy, the cheese just melted in your mouth. The burgers are perfectly cooked and juicier than an orange. They do not taste like oranges though, thank goodness... that would be weird. They have double bubble for sale at the counter, 5¢ a pop. I ought to say that's a great deal if i've ever seen one. There's this woman, Madelyn O'Brien, who comes to eat occasionally and she might be the coolest person in town. She was Time's person of the year in 2006. She is the most interesting woman in the world. Stay thirsty my friends.
