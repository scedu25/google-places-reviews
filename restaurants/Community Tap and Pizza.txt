Community Tap and Pizza
Rating: 4
Text: I ordered the Texan Burger from Community Tap online using Yelp about a week ago. Had a $2 delivery fee. Texan was reasonably priced at $10.99. Delivery took about 45 minutes. Very delicious! Choice of a side also. I chose french fries. I just ordered the same thing again. Highly recommend you to try the Texan if your in Fort Dodge and want to try a good burger.

Text: Great pizza and service local hang out. They have weird specialty pizzas like the crab Rangoon pizza which is actually really good only get a small tho cause it gets old after the first 5 slices

Text: Stopped here while traveling. The pizza was good. The drinks nicely priced. Only 3.50 for my margarita. The beer selection is quite limited. No porters or stouts, thus only 4 stars.
