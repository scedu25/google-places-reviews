Text: Locally owned & operated. Great menu, huge portions. Separate bar & dining area. Happy hour, kids night (Monday), & seasonal specials. They also have a private room for rent. Been going there close to 15 years. Added bonus, cookies served with lunch.

Text: This place is a VERY consistent restaurant.  Staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is always out prompt.  Even when it is crowded you can find some room at the bar and have a local brew while you wait.  Smoke wings are the best!  Pastrami Rueben a close second. Sunday brunch you can get chicken fried steak, green beans, and mashed taters!  It is also crowded and parking is limited so get there early!

Text: They have it all... I've eaten there with kiddos and I've gone there on a casual date. Lively bar on most weekends. Quieter restaurant side for a late bite. Oh, the smoked wings are  awesome!

Text: One of my favorite places to eat in Columbia.  Why? Go on line to their website.
The menu. You can't go wrong, all is good.
The service. Exceptional. 
No, l do not know the owners nor do l have friends that work there. It's simply a good place to go to for all of the above reasons.

Text: I have been many places and have had many wings, but man, their smoked wings are unbelievable. By far the best wing I have ever had, and many people agree. No sauce needed, no ranch needed. Just pure smoked and lightly dry rubbed wing. Try it.
