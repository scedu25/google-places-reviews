Text: To begin with this restaurant was so filthy l can't believe it hasn't been shut down by the health department. The salt shakers, sugar container etc on the tables were so grimy you didn't want to touch them. Then there's the food, it was equally as bad! In the old days you could count on super clean and good home cookin in small towns, obviously these folks didn't get the memo

Text: Good food, waitress had a great personality and lots of locals inside. I used to work in construction and ate at a lot of Hometown diner's and really miss it. I'm a truck driver now and once in a while I eat outside of my truck and this was worth it.
