Hilton Garden Inn West Des Moines
Rating: 5
Text: We choose to stay here every time we are in Des Moines for business. The hotel has recently completed some updates. It is clean and nicely decorated. They also have those delicious HGI Welcome Cookies! One benefit to this location is the ability to walk to the Jordan Creek Mall. If it's nice weather, I utilize this feature and take in an afternoon movie. The area also has many nice restaurants within a close driving distance. We haven't ever utilized the pool area, but it appears to be a nice plus if you have young children.

Text: Great place for a family to gather. Made to order breakfast with lots of fresh fruit. Large jacuzzi, long swimming pool for play or just swimming laps and a very large kiddies play pool. The beds are extremely comfortable. Love this place. It would be good for anyone.

Text: Nice Hotel and really helpful staff.  The ONLY reason I did not give it a 5 star was a smell in the hallway that was present both days we stayed.  You could not smell it in the rooms, just the hallway and it would not stop me from staying again.
