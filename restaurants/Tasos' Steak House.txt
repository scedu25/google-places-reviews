Text: Make sure and get there early because they do have a rush-hour especially on Saturdays but I was seated quickly and very attentive waitress. The food is very delicious here will definitely be back. Jack stix are good, the batter could use some spice, fish dinner(cod) and fries. Mmmm

Text: If you're looking for a meal that looks and tastes like it was made in your small, local diner, then you've come to the right place. All food is comfort food.

The wait staff are quick and responsive. The food came out in a timely manner. I enjoyed the food for what it is.

Text: Food was good, service was good. My sandwich which came with bbq sauce was a little dry. I asked the waitress for a little more BBQ sauce, which she brought with no problem. Till I got the bill and they charged me .39 for BBQ sauce. The. 39 was not going to break me, but why should I be charged for it when it should have been on the sandwich to begin with?
