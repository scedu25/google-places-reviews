Text: I've been to this establishment several times since moving to the area. Very friendly staff and service has always been exceptional. Everything I've had on the menu has been even better than expected. In my opinion, they produce the best craft beer of all the local/regional breweries in the area. Keep up the good work!

Text: Excellent food and service. Made a small error on our order and 2 people came to our table and apologized. Then comped our drinks and gave us 2 of the original order.

Text: Very good service and just a Great selection of food.  The Dank macaroni/shells and cheese are Amazing! Beers are all good but not outstanding really.  Lots of 3 to 4 beers on a 5 scale.  Love the atmosphere here and prices are quite reasonable.  Guest tap of East Grove farms meads always really impressive.  Worth the stop when in this area!!

Text: Solid experience. Good wings, great beer. Solid service. 

Came with a party of 40 people - fun spot. Not the best venue for a big group, but it worked out okay. Would be happy to come back with a smaller group. 

Hear there's also a great happy hour.
