Text: This place is great for a quick lunch. The food is great, the stablishment is clean and the staff is super friendly. It does take a little while to get your food, so come with plenty of time or order by phone and then pick up!

Text: Very good lunch sandwiches. I love the pies, especially a warm piece of pecan pie with ice cream. They have all kinds of specialty drinks too.
