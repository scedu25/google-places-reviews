Sonka Irish Pub

Text: As I pass through on my travels I decided to stop here. The beer was good and the prices are decent but not that friendly of a staff of people. I guess you have to be a regular to get good service.

Text: Great place for socializing and enjoying pub food. Their burgers are my go to. Good  selection of beers on tap. They also have outdoor seating but only a few tables. Never empty but also never overcrowded.

Text: Great atmosphere with a pool table and t.v.. several different kinds of beers, good Irish and American food. Separate bar with small eating area and a bigger room with several seating places. There is also a 2-4 table outside area. Clean. Friendly staff. We have been here often, usually in a large group.

Text: On Wednesdays, they have a deal of half off appetizers. This means 10 wings for $3. Great selection of beer too. Awesome place to go.
