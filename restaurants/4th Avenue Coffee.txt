Text: Very enjoyable place to visit and have coffee. They have several varieties of coffee and they serve tea and I believe other drinks. They also have a very elaborate display of many different kinds of candy for sale. They have snack items and little cakes and cookies not sure about sandwiches. I've only been there a few times but I've enjoyed myself immensely. It is also a nice place if you just want to go and have some coffee and read a book or whatever. You would be you would feel comfortable being there by yourself.
