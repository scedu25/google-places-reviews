Four Points by Sheraton Kansas City Airport
Rating: 3
Text: Four Points are not the high end Sheraton. They are definitely more budget oriented, but they do not lack in comfort or style. In the bathroom, you will find your typical individually wrapped hand soap and a bottle of lotion. But instead of individual bottles of shampoo and conditioner, you will find wall mounted shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers. It, unfortunately, has a bit of a gym shower feel. But that is it for the bad. Bed was comfortable, even if the pillows were on the soft side. I did not get to try the restaurant this time. But from a previous visit, the food is tasty. Oh, another bad: if you have a room that joins to another, be prepared to hear everything. I was able to hear every moment and sound of something that should have been private. Not cool.

Text: Nice comforter but the bed felt like two fulls side by side. Dim hallways and hard to find light switches in room. Great price though. Nice TV and full restaurant and bar downstairs.

Text: Rooms on the ground floor are a bit noisy due to high volume of traffic in the hallway. Rooms are small but comfortable. Nice amenities. Very good housekeeping. Excellent sports bar restaurant with good menu selections.

Text: The room was very nice and comfortable to be in! The food was great but the service was not great at all.. it took way to long for the food to be made and I felt like the server hardly ever came over to our table to see how we were doing.

Text: Hotel is good with the basics, haven't had any issues but I haven't been wowed. Everything is pretty basic, and little things like crooked mirrors, odd lightning choices and such is okay but a little bit of an annoyance. Food can be a hit but lacks in service. Slow wait times and little to no attention turns me off after eating there 5 times.
