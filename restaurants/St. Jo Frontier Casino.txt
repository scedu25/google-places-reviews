Text: The brunch buffet was good... Enjoyed the view of the river...the service was great... Then we went to the casino... It was full of people... Which was fine... Busy place... The drive out there from Kansas City was beautiful... I would go there again... Enjoyed myself.

Text: (Restaurant Review) You pay a big price but get quality food. Very nice looking place, roomy, and if you get deals it can be pretty cheap. I cannot say for sure that the waitresses get drinks refilled on time, but I never have any complaints.

Text: My sister and I have always enjoyed the Wednesday night prime rib.  Tonight was terrible.  The beef was tasteless and waterlogged.   Couldn't even cut it with a steak knife.   Usually you can cut it with a butter knife. And the dessert selection was minimal.  But... The staff were very friendly.   
The broccoli was cooked perfectly and the carrots were great.   The candied yams melted in your mouth.   The dinner rolls were divine.  So disappointed in the prime rib.   Maybe next time.

Text: Small casino offers great buffet.
More of a local casino than a big corporate casino. Missouri river access close by.
