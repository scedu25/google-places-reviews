Text: Hosted wedding shower here. Used the back room. First server was great, but change of shift left us lacking. Good for informal gathering or casual dining. More of a bar like atmosphere.

Text: Went here the other day as it was recommended by the front desk man at our hotel, glad we came here! All of our food was so fresh! I think they actually make the bread/dough in store! The pork tenderloin that my aunt ordered was freshly breaded! Beer was good and the prices were quite fair, considering they could charge more for their food since it's close to holiday world. Glad we stopped here! Great small town America local business

Text: Maybe it was do to the event or something else was going on but the service in the bar was very bad tonight the first drink I had was pretty quick however the 2nd one took all of 20 min to get and the bartender actually served a couple of people she knew before me not happy about that then when she did wait on me she told me they where out of the. Brand I drink so I changed to different brand but as I was leaving I saw another bartender get a customer 3 of what I ordered not good there at all
