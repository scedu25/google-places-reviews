Text: Maria was our waitress and she was very knowledgeable of the menu items, she was also very friendly. Despite the fact that my boyfriend drinks water like a camel his glass was never half empty, and the food was ready surprisingly quick, especially for the quality. Highly recommend, and will be returning.
