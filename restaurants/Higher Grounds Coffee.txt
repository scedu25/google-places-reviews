Text: This was a little of a throw back in time for me. It is hard now to find a simple sit down no frills coffee shop.  Oh don't get me wrong the place was beautiful the staff welcoming and made a good cup of simple coffee.  The were patient with me as looked over the menu and asked my question.  They gave me few extra minutes to pack up and didn't try to rush me out the door at closing.  And the dark roast wasn't overly bitter forgot to add sugar and didn't even notice.

Text: This place is a must-go any time I'm in the area. They offer a wide selection of fun coffee flavors to mix and match. The food is pretty spot on as well, definitely love the paninis.
