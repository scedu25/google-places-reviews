Sweet 'n Saucy

Text: Great restaurant and family who own this spot.  Always like to see the family actually working in the Family owned restaurant.  

Came in for a bite while on vacation and really enjoyed all the brisket sandwich.  Prices are probably half of what I would pay for at a BBQ joint here in Los Angeles.  Thanks for the great meal and I hope to come back again someday.

Text: Food tasted good but nothing special considering the price. We did get filled up though. Onion rings were good but very greasy which bothered me later in the evening. I enjoyed trying the variety of sauces available.  The cornbread muffin is worthless, though that would be the case wherever I go. The baked beans were good. Flies were annoying. Don't believe I've ever been to a restaurant with so many flies around. Overall the place appeared clean.  There are better choices of places to eat in Fairfield.

Text: I'm from Texas so I'm picky about my BBQ, but was drawn in from across the street by the smell. Prices are good and the food is fantastic!!! I got a pulled pork sandwich and slaw and it was to die for. Definitely coming back next time I am in town.

Text: Awesome burnt ends. Usually awesome sides. Usually awesome sauces. Sometimes sides seem off a little. And I think I've had a time or two where the sauce had begun to ferment\go sour which is gross. But that kind of thing happens everywhere.
