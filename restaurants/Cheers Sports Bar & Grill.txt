Text: My friend and I have been to Cheers 4-5 times in the last year.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  The waitresses are friendly and the service is fast, most of the time.

Text: Normally a great place but tonight the bartenders were to drunk to be at work, forgetting things and customers were ignored.  How do you drink an Irish car bomb with no glass? Just a shot glass and a can of beer, how is that supposed to work.  This is normally a great bar and the older man that has been there is great but the 2 last night are new and need some training or be replaced.

Text: Great food, but surprised service was lax tonight. Seemed laxe tonight. Seemed like whole staff turned over and was stressed out and under duress. Food was still great, tho. ?
Cheers! It's all good.
