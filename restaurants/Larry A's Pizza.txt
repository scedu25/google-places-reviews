Text: This place is by far my most favorite pizza place in Macomb, Illinois. I love when owners are very much involved with their businesses and gets to know their customers. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the customer service is outstanding. I love the quality of food. There is nothing I dislike on their menu. I work at Best Western in Macomb and I always recommend Larry A's as a great place to eat.
