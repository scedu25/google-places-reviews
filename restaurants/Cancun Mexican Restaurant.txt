Cancun Mexican Restaurant

Text: The food was good, except their shrimp enchiladas. They advertised it as shrimp enchiladas but it had imitation crab in it..and more of that and only 6 pieces of shrimp throughout the entire plate. Unbelievable..and they called it shrimp. It should had been called seafood. Where they are located, they probably get busy with locals. But I was not impressed at all. The waiter assisted another patron that walked in after me before seating me. But their salsa and guacamole was good. Beans tasted good.

Text: Worst Mexican food I have ever had!!!! Avoid this place!!! Whoever said this plce is good owns this place or knows the owner! Even the employee I will not say which one, said it's awful! Just get chips and salsa. Old hamburger meat was the beef no flavor and white cheese on everything. Horrible horrible horrible!!!!
