Text: Atmosphere like a old sports bar. Food is the best around. Ribs and beans is the best on the menu. Great staff. Great service!

Text: They have the best chicken wings. Nice and crispy yet saucy. I'm usually not a wings fan but their wings have me craving them all the time.

Text: Best ribs I've had. So tender. I always get the smoked with bbq sauce. Fresh cut fries as well. Great quality.

Text: Service was a little slow, but very friendly! Food was alright - nothing to write home about but decent. Deliberately retro it's a fun stop on the way back from Point Pelee.
