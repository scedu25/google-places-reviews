Text: The service seemed ok, food was decent, and fairly quick. But they were taking cash only and staff repeatedly stated they were having issues with the system being down. Then when we were going to pay, our server asked if it was cash or card and we were told cash only when being seated, he acted like they could take a card but it would take much longer because they have to reboot the system. It still took 20 minutes to get a hand written bill to pay cash. Just seemed like peculiar behavior.

Text: The best bands around! Decent prices on drinks poolside tables to watch the band. Parking is a little tricky but you can do it if you're wearing your gripping track shoes :)

Text: A tourist bar, a Cheeseburger in Paradise for Lake of the Ozarks. It's probably a great place to visit by boat, but arriving by car is a bit of an adveture. Poor beer selection, though their sandwiches are decent. Come with a big group after dark, or expect a vacant atmosphere.

Text: Food was good, the service was decently fast. The loud music by an annoying band that warmed up for the entire time we were there (over an hour and a half) when they started they were pretty awful, hence minus 1 star.
