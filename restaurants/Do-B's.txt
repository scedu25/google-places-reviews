Text: We stopped here on our way to Wichita. The place was great! Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and the owner was exceptionally nice. I had the California and it was delicious. Hubby had a Philly and enjoyed it, too.

Text: Amazing food and definitely worth the wait. Sure, I wish it was slightly cheaper, but this isn't McDonald's or fast food folks. It's quality, cooked with love and skill. 

This is hands down the best burger joint I've eaten at. The family that owns it is always kind and charismatic. 

Anyone who was upset over the wait or the price should probably go eat at McDonald's or burger king so they can shove the frozen patties down their gullet in the 30 second it takes someone who couldn't give less of a rats ass about their job to microwave them and slap them on the grill.  If all you want is something to toss in your stomach go elsewhere because any hum drum garbage would do.

This is real food. It takes some time and it's real, quality ingredients...that's why it's so damn good. You don't scarf this food down. You let it make love to your mouth.

Text: Daryn and the Do-B's crew have never failed to amaze. Great food and excellent prices. Fresh produce and local meats make every delicious menu item even better. 
On Wednesdays, they offer 1/2 priced wings. And these aren't any old wings. They're good sized and all are seasoned with ingredients Daryn grows and extracts himself. I recommend all flavors and if you can handle the hottest of the hot, try your hand at the Insanity Wings, THEY'RE HOT!

Text: This food is very amazing. I am absolutely in love with their fries because they have a nice kick to them. Their chicken is also very nice and has a tiny kick also. Their milkshakes taste like an old fashioned milkshake. Love. Love. LOVE ?

Text: One of our favorite places to eat...anywhere, and we eat out a lot, traveling.  Food is amazing, I have tried a lot of the menu and never had anything bad.  Service is excellent.  Atmosphere is quaint.  It's a relatively small place, and you might have to wait a while when they are really busy, but it's well worth the wait.  If you are traveling through and can only try one place, this should be it...or J's Carryout if you just want a straight-up burger
