Text: Great food, great people, great atmosphere. Nothing else to say really. They use local organic ingredients. Food is vegetarian/ vegan. 

Their pizza is the best around.

Text: Nice lunch spot right off of Detroit. Be prepared to see some creative dishes that cater to vegetarians in a unique atmosphere. Food is great, I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.
