Text: The burgers are fantastic!  I had the Italian Stallion burger.  I was absolutely blown away - what a unique combination of ingredients.  In addition to bun and burger, it has slices of italian beef, pepperoncinis, and cheese.  It's unbelievable that in this day and age someone can still reinvent the burger.  My wife had a regular cheeseburger and it was excellent too.  The patties smell and taste like they came off my backyard grill.  The wings are excellent also.  We will definitely be eating here again and exploring the rest of the menu.
