Text: We had dinner here.  The service was good even though they seemed to be short handed and our server was taking care of a bunch of tables.  We had a shrimp scampi appetizer, if was ok.  I don't remember what they called the salad but it was pretty good.  The entree was the kicker that gives them 5 stars.  It was a three cheese ravioli and it was incredible.  We did split the entree and, get this, took half of it with us!  It was wonderful the next day for dinner too!  Thanks, Gilardi's, we will be back.

Text: The food is amazing if you haven't tried it out you are missing out.  This small yet artistic hole in the wall restaurant gets most of their ingredients from its garden out front and local farms.  There are plenty of specials to choose from so the menu is always different, but at the same time many great items are set on the menu so you can always come back and have a certain dish.  Plenty of wine to choose from as well to compliment the perfect dinner.
