Text: I drive by on 71 everyday for work and have been meaning to stop in for the last couple months.  Had the sampler with ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  Ribs and pulled pork were very good.  Brisket was a little tough for my liking but was still good.  Also soup of the day was cheesy potato sausage and was amazing.  I was stuffed but they brought out desserts to show and the pies looked amazing.   Guy's sitting next me said it was really good.  Staff was really nice and friendly.  Highly recommend stopping in and I'll be back again.

Text: We were heading back to Kentucky and looking for something local and found this great spot. Everything we had was fantastic! I especially liked the smoked chicken wings. Friendly staff, tasty food, what else do you need? You have to try this place!

Text: We came here after reading some of the reviews for good BBQ.  It was not very good.  Perhaps it's because we just had BBQ at a famous place in Kansas City a couple of days ago.   This certainly did not compare.

Other than the food, which was not terrible but not very good either, the rest of the restaurant, wait staff, etc. were good.

Text: Best BBQ joint in a converted Denny's that I've ever had! Seriously though, the meats are more than serviceable, and the staff is very friendly, in that, "Oh, sugar," way. Two housemade sauces, and one golden sauce from a bottle. Very popular with locals, and easy access to the Fairfield Inn next door. Probably the best meal in town for travelers.
