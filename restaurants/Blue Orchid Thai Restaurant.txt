Blue Orchid Thai Restaurant

Text: Great food, and a helpful staff. There pad Thai is very very good. Plenty spicy on its own. If your daring enough ask for it spicy, they will certainly make sure you get it spicy. Best regards to those who dare.

Text: Love the food. So many fresh items and great flavor.  The service is okay though.  The last visit had us waiting over an hour and a half for our food. There food is so great, but you have to plan for time it takes to get it.

Text: I love Blue Orchid! Crazy amazing flavor! Staff was INCREDIBLE. And our server gave us perfect suggestions off the menu to order. We loved it. And have been back at least 5 more times. Will continue to make this a go to.

Text: I am fun out of town. Met up with a friend that was suggested this place. The food was great! I have nothing to compare to since it was my first Thai experience. Great flavor,  location a little tricky for parking but figured it out.  That was not a deal breaker.  Our waitress was good,  seemed pretty busy for Sunday evening. Good to see as the establishment was large.

Text: Staff is really nice and service has been fairly quick every time I've eaten here. I just think the food is generally just okay. The tom yum and tom kah soups are fantastic and the rest of the food here is sort of bland. The papaya salad is just pure chili spice, but there isn't the depth or complexity of flavors that I've had with other papaya salads. The pad thai isn't anything to write home about. I'd say there are other better places in Lincoln.
