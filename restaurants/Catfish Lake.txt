Catfish Lake

Text: I've been coming here since I was a little kid. I've never had a bad meal at Catfish Lake. I usually get the Famous Fish Dinner (which is fried carp) and it is always excellent. I also like the walleye dinner and the fried oyster dinner. I tried the hot beef dinner for the 1st time tonight and it was incredible. Chunks of tender beef on toasted bread with a rich brown gravy served with homemade mashed potatoes and a side.

Text: I had the chicken fried steak. It was great. My wife had combination fish dinner. Also great. The service was terrific. Took care of our every need quickly and efficiently. This is very unusual and rare these days. Super nice date night with my wife. Entire staff needs commended.

Text: Service was good. Prices very reasonable. One of the best chicken fried steaks I've had. My wife enjoyed the catfish. Didn't enjoy the after dinner entertainment: IT WAS A TORNADO!  We were there that Friday when the weakening tornado ripped the roof off the bar part of the building.

Text: Great food, no frills. Always a good time. Foods great, atmosphere is good & the kids enjoy feeding watching the fish after they eat. Recommend the walleye & chicken dinners. Tons of food. Plenty enough to take home & have another meal.

Text: Tonight's dinning experience sucked. When your two main cooks call in sick why would you have two inexperienced teenagers fill in as your main cooks!!! We waited 1 1/2 hrs for our food. When you sub a customers side dish I think they should be told beforehand not when the meal arrives!!!! It might be nice to offer a chainsaw the next time you plan on serving overcooked meat!!! But on the bright side our waitress was awesome!!!
