Charlie's Steakhouse

Text: Hostess attempted to seat our party of 5 at a table for 4, but we were able to switch to a larger table without too much hassle. Waitress was friendly but once she delivered the food, we didn't see her again for at least 40 minutes, but maybe she was on break or possibly working in an adjacent room. She did eventually bring our tickets & apologized about the wait. It was really busy & our food was good & we didn't wait long for it. The place was clean & loud. Stear clear if you have peanut allergies, as there is a large bucket on every table.  Several TV's give it a bit of a sports bar vibe & the appetizers never disappoint!

Text: Bad food slow service bigoted servers with homophobia...... if your looking for a trump style enviorment this is the place for you. However, if you dont want to listen to gay and racial slurs you may want to stay clear.....
