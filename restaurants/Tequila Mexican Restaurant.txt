Tequila Mexican Restaurant

Text: Honestly, one star is being too generous. Walked in, was a mad house. No bid deal, we got seated just fine. Not once did a server come over, greet us, bring chips and salsa... Nothing. Over 20 minutes later, two failed attempts to get a server, we left. Complete and utter mess. Never go if you have the option. Just go across the street to The Shoe and enjoy the mom and pop feel.

Text: The cooks are legit. Authentic beans, rice, and (my favorite)cheese dip made on site every morning. The margaritas are strong af.
