Harvey's Diner & Pub
Rating: 5
Text: Two years ago we found this little gem. We were on a ride and Harvey's was the first stop... ended up staying all day. The owners and staff are second to none. We have been here several times since. It's not every day you get greeted with a hug. Love this place.

Text: Very good, varied menu, well prepared. Prices are good for the quality. Nice place to go during weekday evenings. Would not recommend for brunch. Staff has problems keeping up with the demand when large groups are there. Mixed drinks are excellent.
