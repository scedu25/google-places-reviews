Text: Best restaurant in Ohio! Friendly staff. Amazing food. I love the Scottish/Irish feel to the restaurant. Also, coolest bathroom faucet.

Text: We went here after reading all of the great reviews. The beer was great, the atmosphere was cool, but the food was okay. I had the black and tan burger medium well. It was very well and a bit tough. My husband got the ribs which were good but a little dry. It is missing a star for the food but it could be because I ordered the wrong thing. I would come again and try the appetizers which looked awesome.
