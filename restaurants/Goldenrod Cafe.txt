Still great food.
But service was verrry slowww@ 0830 in the  morning.
Only 1 waitress working.
When I was finished with food, 2 more girls came
Into work.
(All the girls were talking and talking  about how  they over slept)

Text: You know how every small town has that one restaurant that all the locals eat at? Well you found it. Great home cooking. If you are tired of fast food and want some good home cooking, comfort food, this is the place.
