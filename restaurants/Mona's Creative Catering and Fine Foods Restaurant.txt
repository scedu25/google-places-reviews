Text: One of Pikeville's best! I absolutely adore this place. The trio (tuna salad, pasta salad and egg salad) is my favorite. I could eat this stuff everyday. The fudge is TO DIE FOR. The BBQ beats all others in town. You want to go here for lunch and dinner. Homemade specials and desserts. You can't beat it!

Text: Great food options. I went with a big group and their staff found a way to fit all of us in one of the corners of the restaurant.
