Text: A nice cozy spot. Exuberantly tantalizing to
the tongue. Restaurant it's self has an esthetically pleasing interior and an outdoor option as well. Very hippy ?? Even meat lovers would love it. Very filling and delicious food. You'll leave full, satified, and feeling healthy.

Text: You don't have to be a vegan or even a vegetarian to LOVE this cozy cafe. The food is delicious and creative; and the drinks are marvelous. They have a great draft beer selection, and you haven't lived until you have their peanut butter banana smoothie!

Text: An intimate dining room, with a haughty vegan menu. If the prices were set to be commensurate to the portions they'd be a gem. Never fails to satisfy.
