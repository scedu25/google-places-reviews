Text: This place is horrible! They have awful service. I tried it for the first time a few days ago and I thought the food was good so I was willing to overlook their terrible service and came back again today. I was enjoying my food when I noticed a piece of hair in my food. When I called the waitress over to let her know, she got an attitude with me like I was wrong! Then when she brought my new plate of food, she slammed it on the table and walked away. Not one time did anyone apologized for there being hair in my food! Never again will I ever eat here and I will let everyone know what horrible establishment this is.

Text: Good portions and selection. Went for lunch and got the sesame chicken. Was served a small spicy noodle soup bowl before getting my meal. Enjoyed my meal!

Text: This one used to be one of my favorite places. I visited again today after a long gap, and I see that the quality has dropped significantly. I found food stuck to the silverware they gave me. I found a dead insect in the water jug. And their water glasses turned from clear to brown in color.

Text: Very friendly staff. Decent food. We were hunting for a place that had more of an authentic taste. The food has been modified to the taste of Americans

Text: We walked in at 8:05 and were told "Hello. We close at 9." Should have left then. Huge portions but not interesting. Same giant cuts of barely cooked red and green peppers on all wntrees. Very ordinary.
