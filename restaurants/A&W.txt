Text: Service was great. Absolutely no beating A&W root beer for sure. Burgers are a little on the small side. With the ambience it is a good experience.

Text: Great old-fashioned A&W. Orders are placed from drive in stations, of from phones at the dining room table. Lots of nostalgia and great food. Friendly service as well.

Text: Only complaint is if you order in and want water they have plastic cups by a water fountain you get on your own. Food is always great!!! Chili cheese coneys are the best!!!

Text: Love that this place still has the old time drive in, the root beer was as delicious as I remember it being when I was a kid!   I'll definitely be back!
