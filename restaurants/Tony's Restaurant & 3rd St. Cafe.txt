Tony's Restaurant & 3rd St. Cafe
Rating: 2
Text: 5 minutes to be seated and our order placed. 40 minutes for a steak sandwich and fried artichoke. The steak was served cold on a bread that was not toasted and clearly not freshly baked. The artichoke was delicious but it doesn't take 40 minutes to bread and fry an artichoke. 2 tables who arrived 15 minutes after us were served before us. Decent food, nice wait staff but poor service for generic food.

Text: Great place if you are looking for something fancy or something casual. They do a great job if providing both. They also have a wonderful room to be rented out for special occasions.

Text: We used to love Tony's but now the portions of food are very small and greatly overpriced.   

We paid $12 for crabcakes as an appetizer and got 3 . Each one was the size of a quarter and not even a full bite.  Plus they were bland and tasteless.  The $17 sirloin was so small... Maybe 6 bites if that.    The lasagna was good but also  a very small portion.  We drank a few beers and with the  tip... spent $72 and was definitely NOT worth it.     

Sad to say... Tony's is not what it used to be and we won't go back.

Text: Poor service. Waited 10 minutes for our waitress when seated. I finally had to go ask the hostess to send a waitress to us. 
Table of 5 next to us said they had been there over 2 hours. They werent very happy. 
My filet was tough. My husband's steak was way overcooked, returned, then it was rare. We ended up just taking it home to cook it on our own. 
Bill was $75 for two of us. No complaints if food and service was good, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
