Text: I love this bar. Last time i was here was my 21st i got the birthday drink and it was made honest. The other bars I went to that night didn't offer the one birthday drink and where watered down. I've always enjoyed taking to Byron too.

Text: Byron's is a one of a kind place. A music room of legendary proportion. Byron, Roger, the staff and all the patrons will make you comfortable. If you've heard about it, it's better than the story you were told (and I've heard some doozies! Well maybe told some ...). And it's like that every time I've been there. I don't know what else I can say, please go and support live music as well as this small town gem! PEACE!
