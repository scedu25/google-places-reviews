Text: Even if you are not Polish , you will enjoy the delicious foods that are prepared here.  Friendly atmosphere, however a little tight.  Must mean good food that keeps them coming back. Yum.

Text: An authentic dining experience from the food to the atmosphere. You descend down into a cavelike atmosphere to encounter a tight-knit crowd dining on authentic Polish fare that is prepared with passion and care. Very cool.

Text: Absolutely charming atmosphere. Hanging lights, very old bar, decorated with Polish items. Amazing polish food. Great perogies, pork chop, and schnitzel. Large portions. All very affordable. Worth the drive into Hamtramck. Note: Cash or check only and you must walk down a flight of stairs to access.

Text: Been going to this restaurant for over 40 years ! Great pickle soup ! Dip your potato bread in the soup while you wait for your Polish plate to arrive. Wash your food  down with a cold, Polish draft beer direct from the bar. Save room for dessert: cheese  & prune blitzes. Yum !
