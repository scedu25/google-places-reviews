Text: Food was above average had prime rib, was just ok. Wife had trout was really good. Server was horrible was busy taking to friends rather than taking care of customers not just us but others.

Text: Travelled alot for work. Most overpriced place I have been to yet for what it is. Go nearby to Applebees instead. Food is better and half the price...  way overpriced drinks as well.

Text: TERRIBLE service. Our waitress(Jennifer) was short, rude and acted as if we were inconveniencing HER! Food was average and doesn't deserve the price tag. Never going back and wouldn't recommend it.
