Text: Tried the Shrimp Tempura and American Dream rolls and they were fantastic. The lobster Rangoon tasted fantastic but was served just way too hot. The miso soup didn’t taste as fresh as I’d like, but had good flavor nonetheless. The staff were all very polite and smiling. I would definitely come back.

Text: Lovely relaxed atmosphere, delicious food. We loves going here for lunch or dinner dates!
The only criticism I really have is their bathrooms have a weird smell and are a little dingy.

Text: We were on a long road trip and didn't want fast food.  Checked reviews and tried this place.  I have other favorites for Japanese food near home, but this place was fine.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Hibachi food was good and served pretty quick, hot and tasty.  Didn't try the sushi.

Text: You get a good amount for what you pay for and the food is good. I got the salmon teriyaki bento box and it was really good.
