Text: Fantastic array of vegetarian and vegan options! Rare to find in town.  Freshly made whether ordered in, or out for delivery. Quick delivery service, too! Great selection for any type of diner. Prices are a bit elevated but it's to be expected for fine dining, larger portions and such high quality of food.  Love the environment for a classy evening meal, when eating in.

Text: It's Bowling Green, OH, not Chicago, NYC, or...  for a small college town, does it get much better?  Super friendly staff, and the best food they have the ability to make.  Is it really 5 stars? Heck no, but in BG, yeah, yeah, it is.

Text: Great dinning area's and wonderful deserts. Menu is a bit large, food is expensive and food is hit or miss. Even if you come back a few days later the same dish might not be that great the next time around. Still a decent place though
