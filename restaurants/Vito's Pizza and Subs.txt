Vito's Pizza and Subs
Rating: 5
Text: We have been customers for years and absolutely love the food. We have had a few later then stated deliveries but it was clear to see why when we did a pick up once on a Friday night. 5 people were in line when we got there and in five minutes there were 5 more. The workers were running around like the place was on fire but were still very polite and professional. When someone is selling something that is of superior quality there will always be demand for it and therefore a wait kinda goes with that. We stopped in recently and talked with the manager for a few minutes and found out though it's not well known that Vito's has done a ton of charity fundraisers ever since the company was founded and that they are head quarted right down the street. Good to know that the business does those kind of things right here in our area, customers for life!!!

Text: Worst of several bad experiences at several locations. Will never patronize any Vito's again I've had it! Not sure which was the most upsetting, the raw pizza, the two hours I waited for it or the rudest customer service experience I have ever had at any eatery. Do yourself a favor call any other restaurant!
