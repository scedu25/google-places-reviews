Text: Spiderwebs everywhere. My 7 year old even said don't touch the walls, you'll get a web on you. They were out of everything we tried to order at first. Service was horrible at first then we got another waitress. My husbands chicken sandwich only covered half to 2/3 of the bun. Cheap prices which was the only saving grace. The whole place needs a deep deep cleaning. Gross.

Text: One of the best spots in town for breakfast and lunch.  Staff and owners go the extra mile to provide quality service and food.  Great place if you like your coffee strong!  Have recommended to several.

Text: Always amazing food. When ever I'm in louisiana I always make a point to set my alarm for 8 am just so I can get up early for the amazing corned beef hash. Anytime I go to any other diner I compare them to this place.

Text: Food was good. Waitress needs improving. Smile a little.Not a fast-food place so the wait is ok. Had 2 others come in and join us, didn't get waited on she even went up front didn't get waited on came back to table for a few minutes and then just left. Maybe an off day. It happens will go again.

Text: If you find yourself in Louisiana MO and you are hungry, you should check out Mom and Pop's Donuts & Diner.  The Cowboy Skillet is "killer".  Gina was a super server and the owners a delight to meet.  I am going back tomorrow before heading home.
