Timber Ridge Lodge & Water Park
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were big and very comfortable. We started for one night only, but we made sure to get to the water park both on the day of our arrival and on the day of our departure. This was the second time we had started at this property and it was just as awesome as the first time. My wife and I love the 2 hot tubs and the water park and the lifeguards are always on already and do a great job. The child activities in the weekends are really fun to. This is a family favorite of ours and we plan on continuing to return every year.

Text: Was pleased that they offer rooms for the day so you can go to the water park and have somewhere to change. These rooms are close so it was very convenient. Only downside was the number of slides. Only one indoor area that we found, but perfect size for s single day.

Text: I loved this place. My 4 &6 year old were in heaven. The pool was clean. The rooms were clean. Staff was very nice. Seems all would go out of their way just to say hello when passing by.

Text: Great place for that quick weekend getaway. The two-bedroom suite was nice except for the narrow area that holds the dining table. The water park was great. The restaraunt and arcade were decent. Good times overall.

Text: The water park was clean and had enough variety for our two small children. The daily rate was absurdly high and disappointing that there wasn't a less expensive option on a Monday. The room we were given had peeling paint all over the bathroom and a small layout. However having a bedroom with a door and a kitchenette is a great feature.
