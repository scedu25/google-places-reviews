The Kitchen Restaurant

Text: Good food and good service. All day breakfast menu too. Reasonable prices for classic American style cusine in a clean and bright atmosphere. The chicken fingers looked homemade! Not great food, but very good for what you're paying. Recommended if you on a I-80 and want a comfortable place to get a bite to eat and don't want the usual fast-food blah!

Text: The food was good and the staff friendly EXCEPT for one of the cooks. He pitched a fit that was audible through the restaurant especially by me because it was my order and a full hour and a half before closing.
The manager and my waitress took care of me, the salad bar was good but not as big as the Petro across the road. But the RIBEYE WITH SAUTÉED ONIONS AND MUSHROOMS WAS THE BOMB... GREAT. IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND I WANTED BEEF STEAK.
The manager and staff covered my tab because it was my birthday and the cook was an ass. He's lucky to still have a job. I could have been a real jerk about it. But I calmly explained I could cause a scene but I really just wanted a good meal for myself. I gave my waitress $20.00 and wished her Happy Halloween on my way out the door.
This restaurant is a clean establishment with great food and a great staff except for the one cook that should find another place to work.
