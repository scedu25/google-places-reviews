Alexanders Steakhouse

Text: Went there for a social event. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The cuts of meat were great. They gave the option to grill your own or have the chef do it. I chose the latter, and he did a great job. Steak turned out so well.

Text: Excellent chops and great salad bar. Even a self service grill if you want to cook your own steak. Lots of fun and highly recommend!

Text: Told waitress up front I am allergic to wheat and cannot have any wheat touch my food. She said no problem and brought me a steak with Texas toast on top. Informed her I could not eat it. She apologized and I could see the chef cooking a new streak on the grill in the middle of the restaurant, but using same tongs to turn steak as the Texas toast he had on grill for others. Told manager I cannot eat that and he apologized and cooked a steak in the back. I surely am not the first person to eat in this high end steak house with a gluten allergy. If you have a gluten allergy I would avoid Alexander’s, period. They were polite but not aware at all of allergies.

Text: Phenomenal steak! Probably because I let them cook it instead of trying to do it myself.  Yes, that was an option.

Text: A favorite of ours.  Steak is always so tender and taste so good.  Like the atmosphere there also.
