Text: This place was great! I had a super shake and it was outstanding. The whipped cream was phenomenal, the shake was so good. The burger was also really good. The atmosphere is really unique and made the entire experience that much better. I highly recommend going here if you are in town.

Text: We stopped here on a road trip after reading about the place on a site for roadside attractions. It mentioned XXX had been featured on the Food Network so we decided to give it a go.
Upon first glance the restaurant wasn't impressive. There was construction on the premises and the inside was small, crowded, and gave off the vibe that we were in for cafeteria food at best, concession stand cuisine at worst.
Boy was that impression misguided. The food was delicious, despite being simple and cheap. We each got a different entree and side and I even got the home-brewed root beer and dessert. Every single bit of it was fabulous and our waitress was sweet, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable about the place's history and recipes.
I'd recommend XXX to my family and friends and intend to stop by there again if I'm ever in the area.

Text: This is a very unique diner. The food was really good, and the experience was really fun. It seems like it will be cramped, but we had plenty of room to eat. You MUST try the root beer. I ended up buying a 6 pack of bottles for home.

Text: First off the waitress was very sweet and attentive my 5 year old sone loved her. The food tastes like home cooked. The root beer is excellent. French fries are nice and crispy. The only complaint is the burger patty seemed small I wish I had ordered the 1/3 pound burger instead of 1/4 lb. If I lived in the area I would come here often.
