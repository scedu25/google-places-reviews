Text: The meat shop/store was very clean and well displayed. Tha lady operating the store was very friendly and offered us a sample of their pineapple jalepino bratwurst. It was delicious! We definately will be stopping by on our way through again! They also will freeze whatever you are wanting to buy if you call ahead. What a great country meat shop/store!
