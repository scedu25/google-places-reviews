Text: Always great for a tasty plate of food. Service is exceptional even when they are busy. Fun atmosphere where you can interact with the cook and server freely. We stop through just about Everytime we are in the area. BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY IN A 100 MILE RADIUS

Text: The bacon cheeseburger and onion rings were amazing! And very large portions!  The restaurant us a bit small and it was packed!  The waitress got to us quickly and we got our food fast! Prices were reasonable!  The waitress did an amazing job taking care of our large group!  If we make it back to the area, we will be back!

Text: Great casual food! They've got huge hamburgers and extra-generous fries/Susie Qs. Lots of old favorite foods here, and friendly service, all at very reasonable prices. If only the dining room and parking lot were larger, I'd give it 5 stars!

Text: Great cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Pick the susie Q french fries. Brings back memories of a 1950s diner. They are very busy but worth the wait.

Text: This was our first visit.  My pulled pork was dry and tough but the BBQ SAUCE was wonderful so it helped a lot. My husband had a not so tender tenderloin and said he would get a hamburger next time. A great atmosphere and we will try it again. Awesome waitress.
