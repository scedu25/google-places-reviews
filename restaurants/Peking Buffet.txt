Peking Buffet

Text: I love Peking Buffet. I used to come here as a child before the flood in 2008. Food is as good as i remember and I'm happy to see they added sushi and edamame. Ice Cream is perfect to eat with the fortune cookie you get.

Text: We were looking for something quick and filling.  I liked the amount of offerings and was happy to see lots of seafood.  We went at about 5pm figuring that like most buffets the food would be coming out fresh for the start of dinner rush.  Boy were we wrong, it was definitely leftovers from lunch and all of it was at least a couple hours old.  Everything was obviously good if it had only been not older than dirt.  It is pretty bad to pay over 40 for 3 for a buffet that people walked away hungry from because most items were inedible due to age. Did notice about 6pm items being refreshed and it getting busier.  I will never try again due to I live out of town but if you decide to try it definitely wait til after 6 to make sure you have a chance at edible food.

Text: Had a very nice lunch today at the Peking!  I've eaten there about twice a year.  I like Asian food, but also like to try different places.  I've always liked the Peking, but my last trip was the best of all.  I couldn't find a thing i didn't like!  Everything tasted fresh and tasty.  I decided on my way home that this is my favorite Asian Place.  Of course, there are lots of Asian places in the area that are good, but this place just seem to be a cut above this time.  I'll be coming back soon.

Text: Food was fair, this place is FILTHY!
Restrooms can probably not even get clean without a total gut job.. I was super disappointed in the clean level, even for a Chinese restaurant...
