Text: The lunch buffet is not very large, but the food is of really good quality.  I would really have liked to see pork dumplings on the lunch buffet.  The service was great.  I'll be back.

Text: Friday lunch buffet:  Half of the entree items were gone and no effort was made to replace them.  Almost every item on the dessert cart was gone as well.  It seemed all concentration was put into phone orders instead.  Some of the items that remained in the buffet looked like the sauce that once covered the food was dried into a circular crust on the metal plate.  Only when the bill was delivered were we asked if we needed more water.  The bill was $6.75/person with no discount for the sparse offerings or lackluster service.  Although, my fortune cookie had an actual fortune in it instead of a random sentence.
