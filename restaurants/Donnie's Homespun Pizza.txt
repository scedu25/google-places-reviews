Donnie's Homespun Pizza

Text: This location is happening.  It's quarky and it is fun.  However the pizza crusts we super bland and a bit doughy for deep dish.  The prices were good but in the end the prices did not meet the quality concerns I had.  The toppings were limited and there was a lack of slice integrity.  Wish I could give it higher rating but it's just not quite average.

Text: When we called to order the girl who answered the phone was very short, and not helpful, and when we ordered our pizza the dough was flavorless and the Jamaican Jerk pizza was super bland.  We will not recommend to anyone.
