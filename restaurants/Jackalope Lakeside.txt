Text: Well I thought it was hard to review this place initially as I’ve been here so many times. After contemplating it is actually really simple.  Consistency, consistency, consistency.  It can go from great service, amazing food quality and menu to not so good service, lower food quality and menu change.  Great location and a traditional local hot spot.

Text: I have gone many times and had wonderful dinners.  This time I was disappointed.   I ordered the lobster bisque and it tasted so different. More cheesy.  I also ordered the perch and it was dry. The drinks were good and I also liked the coleslaw.  The baked potato was under cooked.   The waitress was incredible , lived her.

    After a long day of traveling we enjoyed a light dinner with our friends from Lorain. I chose the delicious lobster roll with roasted vegetables and a lovely fresh salad. 
    The food and atmosphere were both satisfying and delightful.
