Short's Burger & Shine
Rating: 4
Text: Our Friends Reunion visited Shorts and loved the beers. We friends remember this spot well as the spot of the shoeshine guy in the 60's so it had a special place in our hearts. My wife and I had hamburgers the previous eve and pretty good though they didn't compare to the grass fed burgers in our hometown of Asheville - but then we wouldn't expect it to. Overall a very good experience...Bernie

Text: The food had the potential to be great but fell short on preparation. Had the Maynard #11. Bacon was far overcooked as was the burger. Half the burger had no seasoning and the other half had too much. Obviously the sauce was rushed and not evenly spread out. This order also lists avocado. What came on the burger was the equivalent of a single small slice. Overall the burger was very disappointing especially because it would  have been great if put together properly and with the care it deserved. Service was good. Not much else to speak of based on atmosphere.

Text: We did not try the beer selection here so the rating is for the hamburgers only. A lot of exotic toppings available for the humble patty.  French fries were good as well.

Text: Our service was excellent.  Left full but not overly stuffed.  Look forward to eating there again.

Text: Fair prices, great service and delicious high quality fresh food. The fries are mediocre thought but you come here for burgers not fries so can't take a star off for that. The place is pretty cozy and soothing. Pleasant experience to dine in.
