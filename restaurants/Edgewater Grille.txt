Text: Service is always been just fine. The food is getting worse each and every time I come here. Bulk eggs were rubbery, bacon was like jerky, hash browns are powdery. And sausage links felt microwaved. I'm sure if asked your patrons would pay a smidge more, as prices continue to rise, to recieve better food quality!

Text: The Edgewater Grill is a buffet restaurant in the Pzazz resort complex. Each day it has a particular special. During our stay at the Catfish Bend Inn, we enjoyed breakfast there. The buffet selection included many hot and cold items including fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, biscuit & gravy, cereal, cinnamon rolls, etc. There is also an omelet chef to make your personalized omelet. Our breakfast was very good and I’d recommend it if you’re at the Catfish Bend resort.

Text: Poor food service. Sat night all you can eat crab and prime rib was awful. All the Food was cold....had to wait for someone to Finally serve us at the Meat and fish bar. Poor service at that. Shame on you all....$20 each person was not worth it.  What happened to you. Used to be the place to go.  Not any more. Sorry.
