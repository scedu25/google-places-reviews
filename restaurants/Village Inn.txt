Text: Food was edible barely. Pancake and turkey sandwich were pretty much the only thing that were good. French Dip was awful and aus jus was just as bad might have been on the verge of going bad. Reuben bread was hard and dry. Waitress brought 3 yr old chocolate milk in full glass without regard to that might get spilled.
Will not visit this location again.

Text: They need more help. Very busy during lunch.   No Manager came around to  see how the meal was.  Waitress was doing the best she could. The food was hot and prepared well.

Text: Food was just OK. Service was sad. A smile would have helped.  Hard to enjoy a meal with a depressed waitress. Won't go to this VI again. Sad.
