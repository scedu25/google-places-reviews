Text: I called to place a delivery order. I explained what I wanted personal pizza and wings which I have ordered before and had delivered. The lady responds they only deliver small pizzas or larger I said okay give me a small. One hour and ten minutes pass I call to ask where my order is she gave me an estimate of 30-45 min when I placed the order. She ask my address and says it just went out should be there any minute. 25-30 minutes go by I call back. They immediately put the blame on me saying I told them it was a pick up. Then after I explained I called twice and both times they acknowledged It was a delivery still my fault. However they did ask if they could get an address they would deliver showing they never wrote my address down the first two times I called. Also showing the quality of service if they planned to deliver me almost two hour cold pizza.

Text: The staff isn't like you get at Applebees or Friday's or some other, big corporate, fast casual dining establishment. They don't tell you how happy they are you came, or to "have a nice day". The decor, is old table's from Wendy's and other things thrown together. And it's great. Just because the furniture is old doesn't mean it's dirty and just because the staff isn't gratuitously friendly doesn't mean their not good at their job. And the pizza is awesome, which is kinda the point.

Text: Probably the best in town!  Had the double meat and cheese pepperoni and it may have been the best thing I ever ate!
