Text: Manager is very rude. Arrived at 9:15 with closing hour listed at 10. At 9:40 I tried to order a drink and was told they were closed. Was done eating at 9:45 and waited on ticket. Server no where to be found and manager comes out and tells me I needed to leave and they closed at 930  I apologized and said I was waiting on my ticket. He said it was upfront. I tried to show him where it said they closed at 10 and he said well it's now 10 and you need to leave. Went up front and no one had my ticket and server was MIA still. Guy at the counter had to go get a menu to look up the price of what I ordered. He looked very young and uncomfortable due to the manager muttering what I can only assume to be profanity a million miles per hour under his breath in Spanish. 

If you want good service out of a Mexican place in Princeton go to guacamole's. Always excellent service and great food. This is where I would have went if they had not closed at 9. The only reason I went to El rodeo was because they closed at 10...or so I thought. Los Aztecos closed at 930 or I would have went there. Only chose El rodeo due to closing at 10 as I didn't want to hit up a place minutes before close. Needless to say there are 3 Mexican places in town so good luck to El rodeo getting business with an attitude like that. I won't be back but I am sure that they don't care.
