Text: We arrived at noon on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We ordered breakfast and it was really fast and excellent! We will make the 40 minute drive for this good food and service!

As always we have a great meal and excellent service!!  Have never had a non-excellent visit to this place!  Thank you for a taste of home away from home!!

Text: This was awesome! We tried Denny's first & left after waiting 45 for our food. Went across the road to Flap Jacks & were in & out in under half an hour on a very busy Sunday morning. Food was excellent, prices reasonable & service top-notch.
