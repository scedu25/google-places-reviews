Text: It was neat to see the show. We were in a large group and made reservations. They ran out of food and three of the ten people didn't get food. Nothing! Wouldn't pay the extra again!!

Text: The tenderloin roll was definitely worth the try. It was extremely good!! This was exceptionally high quality sushi. I've eaten sushi all over columbus, and many other places. This is in the top 3 ever. !!! Very meaty rolls, and its SOOO GOOD!!

Text: It was decent. The chef seemed robotic and that made it less enjoyable to watch. In fact, nobody that works there seems to enjoy working there. The food was pretty good, but I think they must use MSG, because I ended up getting ill. The kids always enjoy it, but not my best hibachi grill experience.

Text: Good sushi. Not A bad experience for a small town. I got the Buckeye roll. Pretty Delicious. Note to self - Japanese restaurant and Pad Thai don't go. Sushi good, Pad thai is weak.
