Dos Primos Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: Two years ago I definitely would have given them five stars, but it seems over the past couple years they have gone downhill steadily. The food is nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We used to go in once a week now we don't go at all. Was once our favorite spot, so disappointing.

Text: This is the place to go for the most delicious Mexican food and the best Margarita's in town! They also have good and fast service. This is one restaurant that you will return to!

Text: Great food at a great price! Only downside is the extra charges for extra sour cream when there is barely any on your plate but I can live with that!
