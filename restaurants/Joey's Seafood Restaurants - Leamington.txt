Text: Loved joeys till my last visit. New menu with half the options removing me and most of my friends favourite dishes. Prices raised quite a bit and me and my table were served over cooked fish and burnt shrimp. Upon mentioning it to the waiter she didn't even offer a refund. Paid $45 for two people and we had water. Not impressed.

Text: Food and service is excellent. Ordered the shrimp appetizer, well seasoned and an excellent start to the meal. I though the wasabi sauce was weird when I read it on the menu, but it really was a good way to balance out the dish. I ordered the trio of fish, and they are cooked well and complemented the side dish (rice and mash) well.

The service was excellent. They even ask you, upon ordering, if you would like to have your apps served before the entree. The entire tables gets served all at the same time so no awkward waiting for your friend's food to arrive.

Text: Had shrimp tacos.  Very good. Nice creamy coleslaw served with it and all you can eat fries. We only ate what came with it and that was plenty.  They were very good crispy, season ed fries
