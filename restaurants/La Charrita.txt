Text: Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Findlay. Service is very good and attentive to our needs. Atmosphere is good and not so loud. One can actually carry on a conversation without yelling. Food is delicious. I recommend fajitas. Golden margaritas are the best anywhere. 5 Thumbs up.

Text: We are locals who frequent La Charrita as our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Last night (Monday 7-3-17) our party of 12 came for dinner at 6pm.  The parking lot was packed.  It was a holiday "weekend" (July 4th) and the closest restaurant down the road was closed. I counted over 20 tables seated not including our large party & 2 other large parties.  We were quickly seated at a nice big table.  It was clear that the staff were all busy working hard!  The service was slower than normal, but the staff was very friendly & our server tried to accommodate our very needy party with a smile on his face.  A few things were forgotten and it took a while to get things that we asked for.  But we understood that our server was busy tending to his other tables (he was not standing around ignoring us).  Our 15mos old twins were a little restless but it did not seem to bother the staff...they were very kind to us & to our kids too! Our food was delicious, as always (fajita quesadilla).  The only tip I would give would be to schedule more staff on occasions like that.  Normally I would give 5 stars!!
