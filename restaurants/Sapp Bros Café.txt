Sapp Bros Café

Text: The store is clean. Parking lot is smaller than I'd expected. The food at the cafe was typical Sapp Bros. However, I wasn't at all impressed with the service level from my server. She took my order, brought my meal and returned shortly with my bill. Never checked if I needed anything else nor refilled my water. I received the same level of service when I was ready to leave. I waited at the register more than 5 but less than 10 minutes for her to come take my money. From the oder radiating off her clothes she'd just returned from having a smoke break. Absolutely unacceptable service quality. Next time I'll walk across the road to Applebee's!

Text: Best truck stop EVER!  The ladies bathrooms are amazing- they have a bidet! And they have everything you need on the road and more! Very pleasant staff also! Oh and the Apple Barrel has great food! I pick Sapp Bros over TA or Loves any day!

Text: Decent food selection of ready to eat food, burritos, pizza, chicken wings, sandwiches and other.  Love their coffee, especially with the extra boost of caffeine. Typical truckers stuff to buy and gift shop stuff.

Text: Large menu selection, exceptionally tasty food. My steak dinner was cooked perfectly...juicy and tender. Enjoyed browsing the gift shop, too.
