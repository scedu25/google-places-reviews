Text: My wife found a bug in her rice. The gentleman that came to assist tried to pick it up and dismiss this as just burnt food! The bug was big enough to see antennas on it. Let's just say she wasn't happy. She did not alarm anyone as to what was going on. She asked him to please remove the rice and replace it for others that were eating. He walked away with the bug mid conversation and didn't come back! We had just started eating ..I get these things will happen. However she couldn't stomach eating her food.  They still charged for both of us until we walked up to pay. She confronted this man about how rude he had been and how wrong it was to charge for something like that. He then agreed to take her food off.
 The food is pretty good ..when its served without bugs...service is lacking in numerous areas.

Text: I love this place as long as it has people in it the buffet is great full of flavor best in Kentucky I think but it won't get 5 stars until it stops letting the buffet get cold when they aren't busy.. And when it's hot turn on the air when it's cold turn on the heat

Text: It's tough to find good or even decent Chinese food in the Danville/Harrodsburg area. Chinatown Gourmet is one of the better Chinese buffet in the area. My first visit one just okay. My second visit was better. Hopefully, the third time will be a charm.

Text: The food was good and plentiful, but the gentleman serving the customers was yo involved in conversation on his head phone to really listen to his customers.
