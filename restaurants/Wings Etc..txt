Text: Good food, decent pricing, nice staff, and not a loud atmosphere like other wing places. Nice and relaxing. Recommend the place to friends over bww regularly.

Text: Best wings in town.  Hot, crispy, Large, and moist in the meat.  The bar is a little dark but still plenty of room, and separate seating area from bar for families and groups. There are plenty of TVs to watch the Sunday game on and their weekly specials are a great deal. They have a wide variety of sauces with several similar to the other place with small wings and large prices. This is my go-to place for wings.
