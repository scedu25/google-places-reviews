Text: Really good food but occasionally spotty service. I've been here twice. On both occasions the food was very good and some dishes were excellent. Everything is home made and they really pay attention to the food. They have a pretty good wine and spirits list too.  I felt on both occasions that the service could be improved...better training for the young wait staff is needed.

Text: Zola has a really nice atmosphere with a lot of natural light and ample outdoor seating. The food is good though probably a bit overpriced, at least for breakfast/brunch. Service is generally good. They have very good coffee!

We received very poor service last time we were here, which included the server getting angry with us for asking a few questions about the menu. The server was then visibly discussing our table with another employee and eventually a different server handled our bill.

Text: Had brunch this morning and everything was great. Sat outside and enjoyed the nice day. Had a spicy Bloody Mary ; very well done. Everyone in our party loved their food. I had the corn beef hash with eggs and it was great. This place always has good food and service. Check it out.

Text: While the variety on the menu and the atmosphere were great, it was more expensive than I would have expected. The food was very good and the selections plenty. They offer organic food, gluten free, and healthy foods. The place is great to go out and meet up with friends or just with a date. For 2 ppl, brunch, we spent $75 with a tip. We will return as a splurge.

Text: Addendum:  I was able to reach the owner later in the day. She listened to my concerns and validated them. She made a good faith effort to make up for the problems i experienced earlier today at lunch. so the food remains excellent, and apparently service is still good. I have deleted my previous review.
