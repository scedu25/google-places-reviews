Quatro's Original Deep Pan Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: A true Southern Illinois staple! We have always enjoyed their food and atmosphere and last night was no exception. We had a group of 12 adults and 7 kids. They took great care of all of us... Thanks for the shirts (the kids love them)!

Text: We come here solely for the pizza. Sometimes it's very good and sometimes it is just okay. Service is very random as well. There is a better pizza place in town other than here.

Text: We were staying near Carbondale to visit the Shawnee Hills Wine Trail and decided to try Quatro's based on TripAdvisor reviews. We liked it so much the first time, we came back again before we left town. We tried a couple of different flavor combos and everything was fresh, hot and delicious. They also have really cheap drinks if you're interested- and if you order a soda, you get to take the cup home :) Exactly what we expected for a place in the middle of the college living space

Text: Had a great experience my 1st time here. Brett was our waiter and even though it was his first week he was on top of things. Our drinks were always filled and table cleared. He went above and beyond. Very friendly atmosphere. I will come back again.

Text: This place is a staple in Carbondale and everyone in this area has a Quatro's cup in their kitchen. It's a inexpensive, local place that is great for families or couples. You have to try their deep dish taco pizza, which is my go to, but most of their pizza is pretty good. It's not Chicago pizza, but it's the best in the area. I usually get good service here and in general the restaurant is usually well staffed and friendly.

My only complaint about Quatro's is the fact that they don't deliver very far. Carbondale is not that big of a "city," but because I once lived on the edge of town (ten minutes away/less than six miles), they refused to deliver. Their delivery limits seemed a bit arbitrary and really bummed me out when I lived in that location.
