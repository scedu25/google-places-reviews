Text: They had no fruit on the salad bar at all and it's July 14th. I got a side salad and it was just lettuce with cheese on it and my salad dressings on the side. I couldn't believe they didn't have tomatoes, cucumbers or eggs and black olives. Very disappointed with the salad bar. They didn't even have soup on the salad bar.
