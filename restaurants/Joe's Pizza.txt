Joe's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: I grew up in this town and always loved their pizza. Moved away years ago and finally went back and took my husband. Neither of us eat cheese so we got a cheeseless taco pizza add green bell peppers and onions. It was so good. I've never found another place like Joe's.

Text: If you're ever in Paris, Illinois or cruising through I would highly recommend coming to Joes Pizza. I've had many friends from other towns come try when visiting and they all love it as well, can never go wrong with any pizza you get. Also must try the veal!
