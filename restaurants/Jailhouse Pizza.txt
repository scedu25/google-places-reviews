Jailhouse Pizza

Text: I would have gave 5 stars but it is a little pricey for a pizza place. Other than that we loved it. Upstairs is great history, the food is great, the people, the view. Stromboli was excellent. Great place.

Text: Great food.  Friendly staff.  Excellent location with beautiful views.  Very close to a large park with historic monuments and river access. Really enjoyed our visit.  Building is amazing.  You should check it out.

Text: The young man that served our table was nice as could be. Pizza was good, 35 bucks is absolutely to much for a single pizza, especially when all ingredients came out of a can. Neither the girl that sat us or the one that took our money was pleasant, this is the kind of service I expect in Louisville, not Brandenburg. All in all, not a bad experience. But will try somewhere else next time.

Text: Top notch pizza and atmosphere.  
The pizza is awesome, and they even offer a 12lb pizza challenge as well for those who are brave enough to eat 12lbs of pizza between 2 people.  
It is awesome to see the old newspapers in the wall, eat inside old jail cells, pose on an electric chair, and see where the gallows were.

Text: We went on Tuesday night not crowded easily seated booths lack cushion old and need of updating. The pizza was OK we had a three topping 14inch  pizza just two of us. Crust was good the ingredients were from a can no fresh mushrooms which was a reak turn off. The inmate salad consists mostly of lettuce and cheese a few onions and small diced tomatoes so not much to it.  I would consider this a family novelty restaurant not a serious contender for great pizza mainly due to the canned ingredients. Family friendly needs some updating.
