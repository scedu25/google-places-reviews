Text: Had there Keto plate and it was very good. Staff was very nice and a little quaint restaurant that's downtown. It's a little out of the way of you're trying to stay near the bars, but sometimes that's a good thing.

Text: One of my faves in Lincoln!  Everything they make is well-crafted and delicious--I haven't struck out here yet! This is actually the place that convinced me that chili and cinnamon rolls CAN be a legitimate meal combo, with their  flaky cinnamon rolls and robust chili.  And the new winner, for me, is The Garden pizza.  It's a beet and vegetable pizza with a turnip béchamel sauce...I know you're skeptical, but trust me and go for it! It's inventive and delicious with just the right amount of cheese and salt.  

I've had many long conversations here, and they never rush you out.  Ambiance is cute, with little fresh flowers at each table, and wooden doors hanging on the wall.  Parking here can be a challenge on busy nights, so make sure to come early to have time to park if you're meeting someone.

Text: Quaint little restaurant with a rustic look and feel. The coffee was very good, and the egg and sausage biscuit sandwich was great. I really liked their sausage patties.
