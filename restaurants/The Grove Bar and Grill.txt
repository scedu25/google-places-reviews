The Grove Bar and Grill

Text: Nice place, nice people, but I wasn't impressed with the food. It wasn't terrible, but my reuben was cold in the middle and cheese wasn't melted. My dinner partner's tenderloin was a bit on the tough side. Still want to try the cod, though, I've heard tons of great stuff about it. Not going to base my opinion on a single visit. Also went for the Thursday hour beef special  UT they didn't have it. Hopefully I'll be able to change my star rating.
