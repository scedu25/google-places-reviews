Text: We ate at The Mill in Buehler's last Fri night and it was so good! We went for the salad bar, but didn't realize they had an all you can eat fish fry also, and it was delicious! All that for $12.95, and our nice waitress let us take extra fish home. Highly recommended ????

Text: Love this Ohio owned store. Prices are a little higher but so is the quality. Best store by far in this area. Great organic selection as well as gluten free. Fresh bakery and deli that is wonderful. Fresh produce and an in house butcher shop with a fantastic fish and meat counter. 
There is a state liquor store and the best selection of craft brew and ciders anywhere west of I71. Shop here.

Text: Good deals but there's always a fine print to their adds and you must watch your price tags often will be wrong. Ex. Today bought 1 cucumber the tag labeled cucumber priced 99 cents nothing else. It was 99 cents per pound. No biggie just watch out. Most everyone is polite and small town friendly there used to be one sour woman who used to be on the 1st register but I haven't seen her in ages so its safe to frequently shop here without rude service.
