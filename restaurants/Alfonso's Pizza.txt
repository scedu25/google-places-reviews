Text: Their pizza is very good. I haven't tried the other items on their menu. Seating can be an issue at times but worth the wait.

Text: For local good food this is the place to go. Staff is warm and friendly,food is down right amazing for the area. Only negative thing I would ever say about this place is that it's not closer to my house. Try it! You will love it!

Text: My wife and I routinely drive all the way from St. Louis to get the pizza here. The pizza is great, and the family that runs the place is just fantastic.
