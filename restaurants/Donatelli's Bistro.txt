Donatelli's Bistro

Text: The service was good, however a little ambitious with the clearing of the salads and bread.  Spaghetti and Meatballs were horrible.  Absolutely no flavor in the meatballs or what little sauce was served.  No salt/pepper on the table to even doctor it up.  I've been here before and was always good.  Very disappointing this time.

Text: After moving into the area 1 1/2 ago, we decided to try this place because some friends of ours frequently done there. Not a good experience. Granted, it was 100 degrees out, the restaraunt was struggling to maintain 80 degrees.   I ordered the chopped salad which said it was mixed greens-it was iceberg and romaine. Additionally, I asked for salmon instead  of chicken for the salad. The salmon was very dried out, maybe poached? I'm not sure! My husband's spaghetti & meatballs was very dry and bland. We found this establishment to be quite overpriced for very mediocre food. The service was fine though!

Text: The food was delicious, but the service was marginal with the food being cleared off the table before we had finished eating.

Text: Great Italian food. Always great service. I recommend the fettuccine Alfredo and the Canolli!
