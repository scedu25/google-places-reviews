Text: Prices have continued to rise and quality decline! Person on the phone was so rude, we canceled the order and won't go back. We have been ordering pizza here for over 10 years!

Text: Good taste for a cheap slice on the go. Never had a "bad" slice from here

Text: They have told my wife the bill on the phone order and the poor delivery guy has to get the wrath of her on our last two orders when the price changes (goes up 4-5 dollars) on delivery! Get it right and don't expect our business anymore!

Text: Great food and drink. Quick delivery and the pizza is always warm. Only thing I could ask to improve is sometimes the online order tool is wonky, but that's out of the stores control.
