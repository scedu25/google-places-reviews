Text: We came here for a halfway to St Pat. Day Party, fun atmosphere. good food, & they had an outdoor area, where they were grilling with a large screen tv with the Bucks game going. They also had a stage for performers, we enjoyed pipers & Irish dancers. There was a nice fenced in play area for kids, outside. Inside there was a bar with tables & plenty of seating, darts  & restrooms were clean & maintained. This is a club which offers membership, there was a fun family vibe, lots of lil kids running around. We enjoyed the Hooligans perform but it was late & there were a lot of loud people befind our table so we didn't stay very late. All in all my husband & I enjoyed our visit.
