The Thurman Cafe

Text: Absolutely loved this place! It's like going back to a different era where the people waiting on you reflect the area and the neighborhood. There was an elderly couple in the booth to our right who's grandson it turns out, works the evening shift. They were treated so kindly. Our waiter hugged three people who came in, separately I might add, knowing his customers. The music was being controlled by two gals at the bar and they were playing all 80's and 90's rock, it was great. The place has great energy. The food was off the charts too! I had The Thurman Burger with fresh cut fries and both were perfectly cooked and fresh. My wife ate something too that looked equally delish and I recall her loving but...my memory sucks and she's not near so, trust me is was all good. A lot of people make good burgers (and most not this good) but you will not get this experience and enjoyment at most places. Loved it.

Text: This is a great little bar and grill.  The food portions are huge for the price and the food was great.  If you are looking for a bite to eat while traveling through the city this is a great little place to try.

Text: I am very impressed with this place. The burger I had here was definitely in my top 5 EVER! Great staff. I would give this place 5 stars if there was no graffiti in the restroom, and very uncomfortable seats. But besides that, AMAZING experience. Thank you.

Text: Seriously the best burger I've ever had. The wings are MASSIVE, and the service is awesome. Probably the coolest local joint in Columbus that my husband and I have found. Two thumbs up.
