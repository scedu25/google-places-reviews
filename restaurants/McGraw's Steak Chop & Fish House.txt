Text: I'm not sure why all the negative reviews but I come here all the time . Yes it's "pricey" meaning it more than your usual resto for dining . The service has always been good and the food has always been above "GREAT". 5 stars from me and this is a review from going here over a year now consistantly. Who cares about dish presentation when the food delightfully tingles and dances on your taste buds? Get over it people ! ?

Text: My husband and I went to McGraw's last night to celebrate his 35th birthday!  We were very pleased all around with the service we received.  I called earlier in the day to make a reservation and left a message. When they opened, the restaurant called me back an hour before opening to confirm.  We arrived early and were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a great ambient feel at night and most of the seats have at least a partial view of the river at sunset.  It's so nice to have a quality restaurant in Lafayette that can offer a more intimate experience.  There is a great wine list to choose from, as well as specialty cocktails and a full bar.  We ordered cocktail shrimp and a crab cake for appetizers, they were so delicious.  The bread was very nice to have while we drink and wait on our meal, with two butter options made in house.  My husband and I both ordered filet mignon, they were cooked PERFECTLY!  The side items really complimented the meal; we had baked potatoes, salad, and the primo mac & cheese.  Our waiter even brought my husband a birthday dessert on the house, how thoughtful!  He was very helpful and attentive the entire time, as well.
McGraw's is really a great special occasion location with one-of-a-kind service.  Even on a Wednesday night, they were packed full.  Now I see why!  We can't wait to go back again!

Text: Expensive, and gets crowded, but it is upscale, and worth it. The Prime Rib is soooo good. Only available on Fridays and Saturday nights, I believe. Make a reservation for weekends. It is pricey, but if you want a romantic, delicious meal, and a phenomenal wine selection...this is it. Their craft beer selection is very good, as well. Everything on the menu has been outstanding. I have not been disappointed with any of it. I was surprised to see they had 18th street brewing co's Hunter Vanilla. Somewhat a rarity when I had been there, and yet they had it. Not bad, at all. Do yourself a favor, and treat your wife, or girlfriend to a really nice meal. Great view on the river as well. Can't go wrong.

Text: When we arrived, the evening sun was lighting up the trees across the river after a new snow.  Picturesque! Loved the black and blue salad-- best I've ever had with crispy onion straws and chunks of blue cheese. The rib cap was wonderful too.  We also like spending summer evenings on the patio overlooking the river. It's a little out of most people's way but well worth it!
