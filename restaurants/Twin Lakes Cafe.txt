Text: Okay, first, Google will take you across the street from this restaurant. After the light, it is on your right. Google is wrong. I am right, hah!

Second, being a guy, I wanted a burger. They have Angus burgers that sounded really good. But I had read the reviews and so many people mentioned this fried tomato sandwich called The Blue Moon. So I tried it. Fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese, blueberry jam, Wheatberry bread. You have to be a little crazy to come up with that combination, right? But, then....
Have you ever taken a bite of something you were not sure of...it just didn't sound right...and then you realize that these flavors were meant to be together? One of those bites that sits you back in your chair with your eyes closing in pure pleasure!?? Well that is how this sandwich was! You will automatically moan under your breath! 

Third,  homemade chips. Regular, blue cheese coated chips, etc. A white bean cheddar melt that isn't on the menu, you just ask for it (white beans, grilled onions, cheddar on Wheatberry bread and then grilled...hush till you've tried it). Raisin pie, peanut butter pie, etc. This place will be every bit as good as you imagine. Trust me. I got you to the place, didn't I? Have I steered you wrong yet!?

I'm just having fun, lol. But seriously, this place is all that and then some. It is SO worth your time. As you can tell, I loved it!
