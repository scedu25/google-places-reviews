Text: Great atmosphere and service. Stopped by before a concert at The Truman and was not disappointed. Service was quick and pleasant. Wine and beer selection top notch. Food tasty and well-priced. Cool vibe.

Text: Stopped in here with brother when visiting home. I love how much KC has changed from when I was growing up. High quality pizza with nice, hip ambience. Highly recommend the Le Hog pizza. Delicious.

Text: Some of the best pizza in KC! Amazing crust. Highly recommend the margherita. Downside is it's usually full and since it's a "sit where you like" kind of place, the servers don't help you find a seat or give any kind of order to the people waiting. It can be very frustrating on busy nights.

Text: Love the vibe and air conditioning.  On time server.  1/2 pork sandwich and 1/2 pear salad.  Tasty decent portion.  Pear salad favorite although 2 wafer thin sliced pear slices we're skimpy.  The sandwich has only 2 thin strings of mango.  Lost in Can't Tasteland.  Maybe chopped bits better.

Text: The food is always spectacular, I get something different every single time and I am never let down.  Quick service with the drinks and I love the fact they have their own brew there too!  The show venue is one of the best, and the crew running the show overall is the best around.
