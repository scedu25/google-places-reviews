The Caroline

Text: I enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area.  I had the house steak.  Very very good!  One of the better steaks I've had in a long time.  They didn't have the beer I wanted on tap, but that happens all the time.  Nice local place.

Text: My husband enjoyed his steak.  They were out of the IPA he wanted.  The bourbon mushrooms were too salty.  My salad was average.  The menu is limited.  The waitress was attentive and kind. My biggest dislike was that there was only one unisex bathroom closer to the outdoor patio section.  It reeked of urine.  Deal breaker for me.

Text: I cannot say enough good about The Caroline! Excellent food, service and wine list. We have friends that drive 60 miles to eat here. I have eaten in the finest restaurants in New York, Chicago, London, and Los Angeles and i must say, The Caroline is right up there! We recommend it all the time as "the best restaurant in Troy!"

Text: My husband and I LOVE, love, LOVE The Caroline.  The food is ALWAYS delicious.  The servers have always been knowledgeable, efficient, and helpful.  We were pleased with our most recent experience of hosting our son's and fiance's rehearsal dinner at the Caroline.  It surpassed our expectations.  The two servers were so very cheerful and attentive.  Very organized, and they took our order and got our food out in a very reasonable timeframe.  Everything was scrumptious!  I worked with Barb Kolter in making all the arrangements for the evening. She was very patient and accommodating.  We had an absolutely WONDERFUL rehearsal dinner.  In fact, my husband and I are returning tonight for an anniversary dinner together! I can't say enough great things about The Caroline! Keep up the great job!
