Text: Over all, I liked this place. We had two burgers and fries with drinks add it was under$19.  Food we decent, not exciting, but it tasted good with decent portions.  The girl at the counter wasn't very cheerful, ahs I think that is my only real dig.  I'll be back and give her another shot... Maybe it was just a bad day for her. I do recommend Misty's.
