Text: Food is always top notch authentic Mexican.  Service can be slow sometimes due to the tremendous crowds thus restaurant has. Worth the wait.  Plenty of seating never too long of a wait.

Text: For a small town mexican eatery, they had a great selection, service and the food quality was quite tasty. We stopped in as we were passing through on a long drive home and weren't impressed by how long it took to get our food. But, we felt refreshed after a leisurely meal and really enjoyed the food. They were very accomodating with our sloppy attempts to practice our spanish, as well!
