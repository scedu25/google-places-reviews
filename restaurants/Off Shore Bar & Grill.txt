Text: One star because you have to give it something to review.  Waited 15 minutes for menus.  Then drinks.  Margaritas in solo cups without salt..What??  Ordered food.. Waited watching people who came in after us eat...finally waiter comes back.. "what was that order again?"  All on a Friday afternoon at 1:30??  Needless to say we will be having lunch elsrwhere...

Text: The food was pretty decent - we had the chicken finger basket and the blackened catfish w/ shrimp and side salad. No complaints on the food, but not necessarily 5 star. However, the view, staff, and view earn it the 5 stars.

Text: We love visiting the hotel for weekend trips and the bar/grill is on property so it's convenient.  The food is ok, nothing really special.  They make a big deal about the burgers in the menu but no one asks how you'd like your burger so you can expect very well done.  Pizza was good.

Text: Macaroni monday was awesome. They were short staffed but super friendly. The view is great.
