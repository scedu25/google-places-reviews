Text: Wish I could give it higher than just 5. Ico Store is a wonderful jewell that everyone should experience at least once. Awesome food, wonderful people and a truly awesome experience. Well worth the drive out of your way to find it.

Text: Speedy service no matter the day (except sundays when it gets just too crowded). Besides that, love the staff and the food, also best place to buy magic cards.

Text: I've visiting Scott's Iconium Store (Ico) since I was in my mother's womb, LITERALLY! It will forever be "Scott's Ico" although Wayne & Ginger are retired now, I hope the Legacy & Store stays the same! I'm sure many people feel the same way.
