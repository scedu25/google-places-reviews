King's Chef Buffet
Rating: 4
Text: This place is okay if you want pretty good food and lot of it. Lunch buffet menu is the same day in and day out. Black pepper chicken and the spicy chicken are really good. What shines here is the sushi bar believe it or not. For an all you can eat feature, the sushi made here is really tasty and fresh. Never disappointed in the variety or flavor.

Text: Doesn't look special from the outside. But hold on to your socks because once inside you are greeted by a lovely waterfall against the wall. You wait to be seated. It's very clean and the staff was phenomenal!  The buffet is extremely well kept. As you enter the actual buffet, one cannot help but notice the 2 gigantic yet exquisite prism like chandeliers that grace the food selection!! There is a whole host of almost everything imaginable to eat so no one will walk away hungry. Delicious food!!!

Text: I really like the sushi bar.  I have loved King Chef for long time, even as my dietary requirements have changed.  I highly recommend their take out and delivery service.  If you are really hungry the buffet can't be beat.  Oddly enough, my favorite item on the buffet is the green beans.  I don’t know how they cook them but they are addicting.   One thing I appreciate about this restaurant is that even though it is already extremely popular, they still work at improving.  The most recent improvement is that you can place your carry out or delivery order online and have it ready at whatever time you choose.  I can place my order at work and pick it up on the way home.

Text: Food is good and the service it fine. One thing I love about this place is that I was staying late one night really late and they started cleaning. Then clean every nook and cranny of the seats and booths. they super clean the floor too. I was seriously impressed with their cleaning process and it made me like this place a lot more.

Text: Great food, great service, reasonable prices. There's nothing to dislike about this restaurant. Need a salad? They've got salad. Need a sugar fix? They have dessert too. It's one of the best places to eat in Warrensburg.
