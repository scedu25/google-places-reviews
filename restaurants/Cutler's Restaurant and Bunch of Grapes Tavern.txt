Cutler's Restaurant and Bunch of Grapes Tavern

Text: Appetizers were good but the 14 oz steak I ordered was 7 oz of fat. I brought this to the attention of my server and she didn't seem concerned at all. There was 6 in my group, one from my table took two bites from his steak and didn't eat anymore. One would think that when our server saw that he wasn't/hadn't eaten a 30.00 steak that a question would come to mind........crickets! Two others were over cooked. It took 20 minutes to get our check and to finally leave. Would not recommend this restaurant.

Text: The atmosphere and staff is always impeccable. The pork belly appetizer is amazing. The arugula salad is also very good. You honestly won't be disappointed with any food you get here. The wine menu is okay but, the cocktails are the best. I'm a wine person myself. They have live music which adds to the atmosphere and the lighting is also very dim and romantic. They have a patio if you prefer the outdoors.

Text: Best of Athens. Only one other Starbucks in town (Kroger&here). Foods amazing. Drinks even better. Hotel attached and very clean grounds.
