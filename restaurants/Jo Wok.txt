Text:     Nice little Asian restaurant with a clean cozy atmosphere with counter ordering. 
They also have a drive up window. 
    They offer a good menu selection with reasonable prices. Pretty quick service. 
    However the food itself is ok, but to me nothing special or outstanding. Personally it's just a matter of taste and maybe what I'm not used to.  For me, I've had much better. But also I've had much worse.
    Located in a good area with ample free parking.

Text: We were staying at the Kalahari and decided to go out for something different. I am glad we went to Jo Wok, it was great! Everything was so deliciously fresh and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly too. It was not  very spacious but they allowed us to put 2 tables together to fit 8 people. *Caution, when they say spicy, they mean spicy.

Text: My wife loves Chinese food so we make it a point to go to at least one while on vacation.  This is a better way to go than eating at Golden Corral unless you have eaten to much of this type of food.  Good bang for the buck.
