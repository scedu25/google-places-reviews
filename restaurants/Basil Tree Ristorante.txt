Text: I LOVE this place. The drinks are delicious, the food is delicious, and the staff are amazing! My husband and I went there for date night and we were really pleased that we did! Do yourself a favor, and eat here! Just know, you get a lot of food! They start you off with warm yummy bread, followed by soup, then your main course. The portions are a good size, so keep that in mind when ordering.
P.S. If you plan on getting pasta with meatballs in it, be aware that the meatballs are HUGE! I asked for 4, when really I just needed 2.
