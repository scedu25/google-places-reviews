Text: Amazing pizza for a great price but can't handle large crowds that come late in the night. 
Come for cheap, good pizza that you will wait 10 minutes to get.

Text: I LOVE the pizza here! But I hate the service. If you come here with the expectation of the worst terrible service you'll ever experience then you'll have a fairly ok time. It's not hard to understand and order of a 12 inch pizza and an order of breads sticks, but the bread sticks must have run off because they forgot to bring them until we were done. At least they comped us for them. It irritates me to eat here which is sad because I love their food. I order from here very little because of their service.

Text: Very good if you want pizza. Right next to campus and it's not too expensive. There are a lot of options for your pizza which is nice.

Text: Waited over 2 hours for a sub sandwich and 10 wings. Restaurant absolutely unresponsive and would not answer phone. Was told that my food was in route and then waited for 45 minutes. My food never arrived. I eventually had to cancel my order after 2 am because I had to go to bed. I will not do business again with Jeff’s Pizza Shop. Woke up the next morning to see three missed calls from Jeff’s at 2:46am, nearly 3 hours after I’d placed my order.

Text: EDIT: Down to 2 star. New wings are $18 dollar popcorn chicken with some bbq drizzled on top. Pathetic excuse for wings. The cheapest bag of walmart chicken would be better.
Avoid the wings and at least the rest is ok quality for being overpriced.
