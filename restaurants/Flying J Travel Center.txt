Text: Employees seem like they were horribly trained, almost every time I go to this location they have problems with my ciggaret coupons which has resulted in me losing over 4 mobile coupons. I will be contacting the stores district/corporate office and the tobacco companies I receive my coupons from to discuss the issue further.

Text: Pretty sad when you stand and patiently wait for one of 5 team members to finish there ultra important conversations about last night and/or playing on the cell phone. Then someone else walks in and gets serviced first. If I had not started laundry I would of immediately left. The lot is big which is nice but rutted due to improper asphalt for commercial vehicles. I won't be fueling here anymore.

Text: This Flying J Store ....seems to be part of a growing trend with the Flying J side of the Pilot / Flying J company- DIRTY AND FILTHY !!! Terrible odor of the Urinals hit You as You walk into the Mens restrooms! Urinals that haven't been cleaned in days! Restroom floors that look like they were mopped with dirty mop water and no cleaner!! Dirty floors in the Convience Store and Drivers Areas as well! Flies in the Convience Store area...Outside Entry area sidewalk is nasty as well!! These conditions were the same a few weeks earlier when I had stopped here. Management needs to be fired!!
