Text: Shoulda’ read the reviews! Longest drive-thru wait ever. I would’ve backed out if I wasn’t stuck. At the end of it all they didn’t even have my food Lol.

Text: Shittiest A&W ever. They forgot about me at the drive through for a solid 5 minutes. I ordered a freeze. And waited another 10-15 minutes to even get to the window because there was one single person ahead of me.

Text: Stopped in this place on our way home on 12/26 around 5:45pm.  Ordered 5 meals for our family.  My daughter ordered a hamburger with bacon lettuce and mayo.  When it came out it had cheese on it (happens to her 50% of the time), so I took it back to the counter and asked for one without the cheese  like we ordered.   They handed me another one and it had cheese on it again.  That is where I lost my mind.  Come to find out an hour down the road that my cheese burger had everything on it and I asked to hold the lettuce and pickles.  Absolutely horrible  experience but seems to be the trend everywhere anymore.  Unfortunately for these places I'm not going to tolerate it.  Make them do it right and get your money back.  Stop letting crap service be the norm and letting substandard work be acceptable, even in fast food restaurants!

Text: For how long it took to get the food it probably should've tasted better. There was a huge wet spill on the floor that the staff just walked around the whole time instead of cleaning it. Freddy's across the street is quite a bit better

Text: When you walk in to a restaurant and the floor is slick with that greasy feeling, you should know to turn around and leave. Having been on the road and just needing a late lunch, it was right across the street from the hotel. So you think how bad could it be. 

Not having a Long John Silver's in our home town, we like to eat there when we are on the road. The fish was very dark, that means the grease is old. When they change it, if they ever do, they spread it on the floor so they don't have to pay to have it hauled off. Saves money on floor wax.

We spent the next 8 hours just hoping it didn't make us sick. Just skip the meal if this is the best you can do. The waitress repeated the story about it being hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk to at least 3 different guest/victims while we were there.
