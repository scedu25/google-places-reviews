Text: Absolutely love this restaurant.   The service was great.  Our waitress was  accommodating to all of our needs and had a great sense of humor.  We ordered cheese and sausage pizza on extra thin crust.  Yummy!  Plus they had french dressing.  Most restaurants don't have french.  Great dinner!

Text: Everything I've had is really good. I like the Ribeye sandwiches, and I've yet to find a homemade soup I haven't enjoyed immensely.

Text: Pizza good, service-not so much. Waitress first couldn't remember 2 easily recognizable drinks (ice tea and diet coke). Then we ordered a pizza with only 2 toppings, she had to come back a few minutes later to ask what was on our pizza also. The place was not even half full so it's not like she was over taxed. I suggest having the servers write down the order before leaving the table.

Text: Good food, high prices, but service is very slow during weekday lunch hours. Ask for your check early to be sure you get back to work on time. They do better as a dinner place. Love their spaghetti!

Text: The food was fine. Decent decor. Cheerfull if inadequate service. No sign of mature host or manager. Got home to find part of my uneaten food was not included in to go bag as we had discussed.
