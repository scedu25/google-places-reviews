Text: Fantastically fresh and delicious cuisine, and a quaint setting. They're a fair ways from Indy, but worth the trip. Their beef is obviously their crown jewel, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't get a steak.

Text: Food was amazing! I've been back several times and the wagyu melts in your mouth. Schedule a Sat tour at their farm if you have reservations that evening.

Text: Attended a wedding yesterday. I wouldn't recommend their catering. They took a head count for guests and still ran out of food. Their beef and salmon was under cooked. The chicken was dried out. They ran out of potatoes and mixed vegetables and skimpy on the salad.

Text: Drove 3 hours to get here just for the Wagyu beef and it was worth it. We ate outside and the ambience was great. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.
