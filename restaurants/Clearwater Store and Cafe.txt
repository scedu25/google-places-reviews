Clearwater Store and Cafe
Rating: 5
Text: Best eating place if you're in our around Piedmont or Clearwater Lake. Food is great and inexpensive. And the owner and staff are always very friendly and helpful. There is a nice little fishing shop attached to it with a nice stock of stuff you might need when it camping, fishing or hunting. I would eat here every day if I could.
