Text: It was great to visit Bruno's again. First time in the new location bc I moved away 25 yrs ago. I was delighted to recognize all the old decor items from the original restaurant.  That being said, the pizza is good.  Not great. But! The Boiler Gold beer on tap is a local brew and delicious.  I had 3 pints!  We arrived 15 minutes b4 opening but they waved us on on anyway which was really cool.  The service was spot on. Bruno Dough Is Great With THE Cheese sauce.

Text: Stopped in for family dinner and had a wonderful experience! We ordered Bruno dough and pizza. Both came out perfectly and with little wait time. We did accidently confuse our server with how we wanted the check split but she was great and very patient and polite.

Text: Bruno's has always been my family's favorite place to eat.  My parents went on dates there long ago and it's a family tradition.  Delicious pizza (the Bruno dough is wonderful too) and everything else I've ever eaten there has been great too.  Great memoribila to look at and great family and employees to support.
