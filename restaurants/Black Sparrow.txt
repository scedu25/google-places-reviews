Text: It's a nice little pub. The food was okay but nothing to write home about. The beer list is extensive and well-rounded.  Yes, some of the beers are very expensive but, in theory, you don't drink those to get wasted, you sip and savor. Our waitress was fantastic and the place was clean. It's worth checking out.

Text: Great food. Great beer selection. Good wine selection good. Good cocktails. You have to get the Romanescu & goat cheese appetizer as are their pizzas - caramelized onion, fig, blue cheese is my favorite.

Text: Good selection of beers and food in a fun environment. But what makes it 5 star is the brunch. I've had some genuinely spectacular dishes at their brunch!

Text: Seriously some of the best food in town.  The core menu is amazing, the drink specials are creative, and the beer selection is amazing.  Definitively make it to brunch if you can, but be sure to come early or be willing to wait.

Text: New to the area and this place had good reviews so went to check it out. Walked in and saw two customers, and the bartender. Sat down for almost 15 minutes and no one greeted us or said anything.
Bartender just glanced over occasionally.
Got up and left.
