Pepper Sprout

Text: Normally I love this place.... but tonight's dinner left me disappointed. 
Drove in from Cedar Rapids and paid over 60$ on dinner for 2 I usually expect to be wowed if I'm spending that much cash on dinner (we didn't get drinks) 

I got the shepherds pie and my husband got the rabbit pasta... I added chicken to my dish and it was dry. Not to mention the shepherds pie sauce was extremely sweet. It was difficult to make it through the dish because the sauce, I don't think it complimented the vegetables very well. 

I'm sure if I would have said something they would have made me something else but it was busy and I didn't want to inconvenience the chef.. 

I will return to pepper sprouts again but will make sure I understand what I'm ordering and maybe ask more questions

Text: Was visiting from out of town and found this was close to the hotel we were staying at. While it's a little pricy, I'm glad we took the short walk over as the Tenderloin that I ordered had quite the wonderful flavor. My girlfriend had the Fall Risotto and said it also had a really good taste. If we ever make it back this is definitely a restaurant we would both want to return to.
