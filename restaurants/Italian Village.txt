Text: IV's has great pizza and a charming atmosphere. The new addition really feels nice if you aren't a fan of the sharpie laden walls of the original parlor.

Text: It's a pretty unique place - it's a total dive, but in a characterful and interesting way.  The food was good and affordable.  I'll likely be going back.
