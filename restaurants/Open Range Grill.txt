Open Range Grill

Text: Excellent family run business.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Owner is engaging and great to talk to and she is easy on the eyes too. Beef comes from their own ranch. The place is large and cozy at the same time.  The woodwork is very nice. This place has a meeting room,  pool table,  live music on certain days, plenty of seating, and a half bar. 
Food is excellent as well as the craft beer. 
This is a Top 10 spot for sure.

Text: Excellent burgers, friendly service, clean restaurant. Hubby had the Lonesome Man burger (onions, bacon, aioli) and I had the basic Range Burger. Both were excellent.

This is a casual restaurant in which you order at the counter. Drinks are self serve and your food is delivered when ready.

Highly recommend this local restaurant.

Text: A breakdown forced a stay in Ogallala. Open Range was recommended by a local. What a treat. Fantastic burgers!!! Among the best I've ever had. Locally raised beef and quality all around. Try the mushroom fries and bull fries!  Colby and the crew are doing it right.

Text: Stopped here on our way back to Eastern Nebraska.
Great place for a sit down meal. Good burgers. Good fries.  Good beer selection. 
Rustic, yet clean environment. 
If you're passing through Ogalala and want a good meal, stop by here.
