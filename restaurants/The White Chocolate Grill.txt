The White Chocolate Grill

Text: Just visited this yesterday. Definitely get a reservation if you’re going on a Friday night, the wait can get long. Also, the parking lot fills up quickly. 

The food was solid! The halibut special was great, especially the honey glazed carrots. The jambalaya and chicken crepes were delicious. The portions are pretty generous so keep that in mind when ordering appetizers with your main meal. Overall, great restaurant!

Text: Very nice. Food was good. Salsa artichoke dip was great. Staff was friendly. Reservation recommended. Decent size. Price was average. Fresh lemonade was a bit too sour but what should i have expected, right?

Overall great spot for a romantic evening or a special occasion

Text: Average.  The drinks are okay.  There's not much to say about the food.  Service seems to ignore new faces and concentrates on regulars.  It is definitely not worth the price.  It's just the name that is creative.  Everything else is just blah.  
I will go to other similarly priced places next to them that have far better service and food and ambiance.

Text: The words that best describe my experience is "so delicious". I had the fillet steak sandwich with a side of couscous. Perfect service. Highly recommended!
