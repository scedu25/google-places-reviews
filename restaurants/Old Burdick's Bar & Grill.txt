Text: The food was very good on both of my visits. Staff was nice. Being a southern I wanted some sweet tea and the waiter Zack made some. It was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to other people.

Text: We came in to the Burdicks in Kalamazoo MI for a Rehersal Dinner and the service and food was awesome. No one had to wait for drinks the food came out hot and fresh. The staff was so much fun and had a great sense of humor. I would definitely recommend booking am event or just going in for dinner for sure. Plus if your book an even Kendra the event coordinator made everything so easy to set up!

Text: Went for dinner while pasing thru Kalamazoo and tried Old Burdick's in downtown.  Great burgers and fries and yummy boneless wings.  Good value for the money and great atmosphere. Cheap beer too!

Text: I hadn't been here in a long time due to previous issues with poor service. Unfortunately, things haven't changed. Took just under 30 minutes to get draft beers and part of the group waited for well over an hour for food. And they were not any busier than the average downtown restaurant for a Saturday night. Getting the waiter to stop at the table was next to impossible. Spoke to management after clearing our own table to make room for food plates. Minimal concern expressed. I now remember why i haven't been here in a number of years.
