Text: This is one of the best places I have eaten while on business trips.  The restaurant is very clean and comfortable.  Each time I have been here I ordered something different and have always been pleased.  The waiter had good recommendations and the food lived up to the good word.

We will return again when we are in Lafayette.

Text: Best steaks in Indiana. Hands down.   Service is amazing too.  They have this manager named Ryan working there (a girl) that really seems to know her stuff.  She keeps this place in great shape and the servers are amazing.    Would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looming for good food at a price that won't break the bank.   Highly recommended.

Text: Used to be pretty good, but our most recent visit was disappointing.  No-one came to take our drink orders for a good 10-15 minutes after we sat down.  Our server was not friendly and seemed impatient.  The food was fine.

Text: Not bad, but honestly can't say great. Tables too small for 4, food was average, prices high for quality of food. Service was great and company was great, but for my money, and better prime rib I'll go to the "Irish" place next time.

Text: Attending a conference and ate there twice this week. Very good food both times and great service!!! Table side salad bar is a great twist on the traditional side salad. Steak was cooked to perfection!
