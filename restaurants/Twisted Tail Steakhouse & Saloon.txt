Text: Stopped here while on a bus trip this evening with 32 people.  To give them 5 stars doesn't begin to say how great this place is.  The staff was great and the service exceptional.  Then there was the food...Oh, My!  Now, we are a talkative bunch, to say the least, but when the food started coming out there wasn't much talking only people eating!  The meals were phenomenal!  I had the ribeye and I think it was the best I ever had, for sure!  Everyone was raving about their food...now, to have 32 people agreeing about their food rarely happens.  What a great experience this group from Springfield, OH had tonight!  Thank you to the entire staff for making is welcome ANF feeding us the best food ever!!!

Text: Food was good, even though all 3 of our ribeye sandwiches were ordered mid rare, and all came out DONE! And grey. They still had good flavor and were fairly tender. Service was slow. We had to wait a long time from the time see were done eating, until we got our to go box and our check. But I think our waitress was also tending bar, so she was busy. They should have more staff on hand.

Text: Excellent food (we were there on a Saturday when the have prime rib), very friendly staff.  Located in the middle of nowhere yet expect a fairly long wait... this is a busy place!
