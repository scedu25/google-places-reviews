Text: Friendly staff, nice little shop!. I had the half chicken salad on a croissant sandwich and kale salad. It was yummy. I need to return and try the different bread and deserts.

My 1st time there I had a cup of coffee and a scone. The scone was good. The coffee was ok, but I am picky with my coffee.

Text: Le Quartier Baking Co is a fantastic  little shop. The food is in the top bracket, some of the highest quality that I've been privileged to consume. They have a unique selection of breads and pastries, but they also have great sandwiches and breakfast items. The do a periodic Sunday Brunch that beats pretty much anywhere in town, as far as I'm concerned.
