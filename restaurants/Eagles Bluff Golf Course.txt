Eagles Bluff Golf Course

Text: "What could be" is the theme here. The course offers tremendous views, an interesting layout, and a handful of really good golf holes. However, the conditioning is really suffering right now, and some of the tree overgrowth is outrageous. Pump some money into it and they might have a winner.
