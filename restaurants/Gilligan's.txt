The Red Hot Chili Poppers, just like the band, were out of this world. The sour cream served with this dish was as thick and white as my thighs. 

The Mexi Wedges we got, combined the greatest things of the Mexican and North American culture and placed it onto one plate. 

I enjoyed my eating thyme at Gilligan's. You should check them out.
