Rumor Has IT

Text: We came because of the 20 beers on tap while staying at the nearby campground. They don't accept anything other than cash. No worries they have an ATM, which charges you to use obviously. I ordered a hamburger. I literally got a burger paty on a plate...for $9.50. No toppings, no bun. My husband said something to the waitress and she brought me a bun...that they charged me 50 cents for when we got the check. My margarita had no tequila in it at all, but at least it was only $4. Hubby got 2 craft brews and the big cat fish dinner, the fish was so dry he had to drench it in the coleslaw. If you're just coming for the beer, it's fine. If you want anything else go down the street and find something else.

Text: While traveling through here, we stopped here as we had did a couple of  years ago while visiting. We found the margaritas delicious, and the staff & other customers very pleasant & accommodating about our questions. I recommend this establishment
