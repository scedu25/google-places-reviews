Text: Ordered a burger and salad and fries and sweet potato fries, told them my intent was to put them ALL together and eat them as one dish. Said this REPEATEDLY that I wanted all my food at the same time. Got the sweet potato fries then a while later the salad (which they'd bright out first and I had said AGAIN That I wanted ALL at the same time) then even a while later the burger. My son said his pizza was ok (he's a pizza LOVER all pizza is awesome, so ok isn't high praise from him)

All in all my burger and whatnot was decent ish, I just don't understand why it's so hard to get all my food at the same time

Text: Burger was fantastic. My family enjoyed their food. My onion straws were burnt and the guy took them back and made them himself and they came back perfect. Overall, will dine there again.
