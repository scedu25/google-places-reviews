Text: I have been going to this location since I was a child and they have some great wait staff that have been there for years also. The prices are fair for the portions and the chips and salsa are always good. My husband and I have our favorite items and they're consistent in quality and taste. It's fresh food that  doesn't taste from the can and there are a lot of options now to customize your meal to your preference.

Text: Talked with mgr about only getting 1 ring of green pepper with our fajitas. She replied... rudely.... that's what you get. There were enough to onions... but 1 complete circle of green pepper... no  other peppers... and 2 pieces of tomato.... worse service. NEVER RETURNING.

Text: Wait staff was great! Food was cold, we had to wait for an hour to get our food. Most of the orders came out incorrectly made.

I never liked the food though. Just not my taste.

Text: Price was good for lunch and taste was good.  Fast service was nice also.   Staff were friendly and put my tea in a to go cup.  Music was not so great though... typically dance/pop took away from a good mexican experience.
