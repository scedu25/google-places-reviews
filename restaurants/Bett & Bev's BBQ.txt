Text: Beef brisket sandwich was really good. Had the spicy sauce: wasn't very spicy, but had a really nice tang. Friend had a smoked turkey sandwich and it was delicious. Will be back again.

Text: Loved the sauce and our sides, but the meat was overcooked. Will give them another try and order a different entree.

Text: A really good reasonably priced BBQ joint.
I had the "frip pie" which is homemade Ripple potato chips covered with pulled pork baked beans and coleslaw.
It was only $5 ( a Thursday night special).

Text: Today my wife and I came to Jefferson to go to the casino. We were going to eat there but they did not have a good selection of food so we decided to look around Jefferson to find a local place to eat. We decided on bett & bev's BBQ. I was honestly a little skeptical when we pulled up and it was what looked liked like a run down old Pizza Hut. One we got inside you could tell that they were a small town local place that cared more about the food then the appearance. They had the saucy trio as a special today. It was 3 meats sauced up and on a bun I got it with a side of beans and a drink. My wife ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of frips and a drink. The food came out quickly and looked amazing. The saucy trio was excellent the BBQ sauce was a great homemade sauce and the baked beans tasted like they had gone through the smoker. My wife loved her turkey sandwich and said the turkey was juicy and flavorful. She loved the frips which are homemade fried potato chips. Over all it was a great little find in a small town. If I'm over this way again I will be back.
