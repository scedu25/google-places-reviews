Text: Good Chinese food and great price! You get a lot for what you pay for. Has a wide variety of option between chicken, beef, etc. They also have sushi options. Much like any other Chinese restaurant, but faster. The drive-thru only set up is perfect. I've never had to wait too long, orders always took around 5 minutes. I ordered Orange chicken with fried rice. Came with a side of salad, crab rangoon. and drink. All for about $7. A+ +, 10/10.

Text: The majority of comments agree- a reputation for rude/bad service, but good to decent food. The only reason I order delivery here- there is a higher chance the food will be good than any other chinese delivery in Lawrence. The owners could care less how they or their employees treat their customers. Unfortunate the only good delivery chinese (sometimes) in Lawrence lacks any understanding on how to treat people decently.
