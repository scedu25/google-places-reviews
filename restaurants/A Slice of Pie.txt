Text: Had t he peach with cinnamon sauce. My husband the cherry/raspberry.  Filling on his was great, mine was too sweet.  Crust is good but I thought It was too thick.  Good pie...not great.

Text: This place is very expensive but I honestly have to say it's worth it. The portions are generous and the taste and quality is very Good! I had the chocolate pie, pecan and coconut cream and I have no complaints. I would spend the money again and recommend other's to try it if you have not already.

Text: Coconut Cream Pie! It's the best I've ever had, and I'm picky. The slice is huge, with whipped cream top (my preference over meringue). It's very smooth, and the whipped cream is thick. Good buttery crust too. Pie perfection! Sprinkled with toasted (not burnt) coconut. I'll drive back there just for the pie.

Text: The place is pretty small, but the pie is very good. Difficult to move around inside due to the table layout but if you just want to come in and grab a slice to go it's perfect.

Text: Decent variety.  Delicious pie.   Never heard of a Ritz Cracker Pie, too bad.  Small venue.  I would recommend.
