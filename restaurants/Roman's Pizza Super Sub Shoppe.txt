Text: We've ordered from here a few times. The food is always delicious. The delivery is not bad for the area, most places take an hour plus. Staff is polite and pleasant.

Text: I spent $17 on a small pizza and half side salad. When the pizza came in the toppings had slid off the pizza. When I called about it they asked me to text a picture of the pizza because their full time driver delivered the pizza and that has never happened before. After sending the picture to two people and calling in the owner or manager (her name is Jenny) asked me if I dropped the pizza. When I finally started to get upset she said I'm the one making it a big deal. She was just trying to get the facts before making it right. No effort to fix the problem. The most unprofessional handling of a customer complaint I've ever encountered. I have never met someone so rude in the customer service industry. Don't order from here unless you want to be treated like garbage.

Text: If you want good pizza in the canal area, I recommend Renaldi's. Friendlier staff, better food, and better prices. It's right around the corner

Text: Pretty good , definitely different then the commercial taste. It's a good change up and it's worth the money. Service could be a little faster pick up times are 30/35 mins.
