Text: Food has declined in quality. Used to be great. Slow service now (also used to be great).  Service gets worse and serving size gets smaller with each visit. This will be my last visit here. :(

Text: Their sushi is so good! The servers are really nice and the place is also nice inside too. They have good prices and fresh fish. I just love this place.

Text: I've eaten here for years and it's always been amazing. I hadn't been for a year or so and went yesterday to have dinner with a friend while I was in town and it's still my favourite Japanese place.

Text: This is a hidden gem in Danville, Ky if you enjoy sushi, Hibachi, and Japanese quisine. My boyfriend and I decided to try it one night and LOVED it!! We ate there a couple more times that same week and keep going back. The atmosphere was quiet, cozy, comfortable and dinner was DELICIOUS! It is very affordable as well. Instead of driving to Lexington we now drive 15 minutes to a nice restaurant we enjoy very much. THANK YOU!!
