Text: Fantastic food and great service. The staff was in their best costumes.  The salad bar was just enough. The Ribeye steak was cooked perfectly. Nice evening!

Text: We love lake Carroll.  But lately the club house as been horrible.   We eat their 3 times a week.  Food is always good service is horrible.   As I am writing this I have waited over 40 min for 1 beer 1 glass of wine and zero food that we ordered 36 minutes ago.  I will however give the bar tender credit and a few  of the other wait staff credit.  They were very apologetic but it was too late.    They could tell we were upset.   So thank you to them for trying to make it right.     It's easy folks.  People expect excellent service.  And your tip will reflect that.  Tonight we refused our meal after waiting an hour.   We feel bad but needed to be done.    We still love lake Carroll.

Text: Love the food, but the salad bar is the standout! Fresh beautifully displayed and a large variety of topings and pasta salads..the soups are the shinning stars as is their waitstaff. Very pleasurable afternoon overlooking the beautiful Golf Course. 5 stars!
