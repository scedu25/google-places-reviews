Text: Tasty food and friendly, attentive service. The lamb shank, gyro platter and mushroom hummus were wonderful. This was our first visit and we will definitely be back.

Text: Love this place. Just had the large Falafel Greek Salad and it was terrific...fresh, healthy and tasty. Our server Olivia was friendly, professional and made our experience there exceptional. Can't wait to come back.

Text: Well... this was a place that we once loved.  The original owner has moved on and the caretakers aren't taking care of the details. Salad clearly out of a bag. The humus that was once the best\creamiest is now gritty and no longer finished with a drizzling of olive oil as the menu describes (now swimming in lemon juice instead).  Everything is in decline and that just makes me sad.  Mexican music blaring the whole time (I'm a Mediterranean restaurant) didn't improve the experience.

Text: This review is purely service since unfortunately  we were not there long enough to order.  We tasted this restaurants food at the taste of Hilliard and decided to go there for dinner this evening.  Upon arriving the first employee let us know there would be about a ten minute wait to get a table, 2 adults and 2 kids (1 high chair).   That seemed perfectly acceptable seeing as they were busy and the food smelled great.   Not more than 3 minutes later another 4 person group walked in that apparently another employee knew and he sat them immediately in front of us even after the first hostess told him we were there first.  With that we left and as we were walking to the car this employee tried to salvage the situation by claiming they were "waiting on the best table for us" clearly not true just trying to cover up his obvious mistake.
