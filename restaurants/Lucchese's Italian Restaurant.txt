Lucchese's Italian Restaurant

Text: Got in just before closing so our meal seemed a bit rushed. Hot but dregs of the former fresh. Wine selection was great. Appetizers were good and the staff was a bit worn out from a recent influx of people for an event in town. I will go back during a quieter time during dinner hours and and am certain I will have a better experience.

Text: Food was great, our first time there. Service not so much, and our credit card was overcharged, and we haven't heard anything back about that.

Hopefully this will be corrected, we would love to try again.
