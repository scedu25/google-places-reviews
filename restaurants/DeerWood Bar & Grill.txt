Text: Great beer prices! I had the chicken figers and fries and they were cooked to perfection. Don't let the outside fool you, it's nice inside and everyone is super friendly.

Text: Great food and service! Very polite bar keep that makes the best burger around..hands down! 1/2 pound burger and fries with all fresh ingredients (fresh pattied beef, toppings,etc.) Will most definitely be returning again. Better than the truck stop food for anyone passing through.
