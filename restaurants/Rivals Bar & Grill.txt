Rivals Bar & Grill
Rating: 2
Text: Poor kitchen management. Took very long for us to get food when we were one of two tables and the burgers were terrible. Flies on our food the whole time. 

Waitresses were friendly but one was eating at the bar and left three tables covered in food and beer for 45 minutes. While the other was bussing the tables that this girl needed to clean. 

Good atmosphere, and good selection of drinks, but maybe just order fries.
