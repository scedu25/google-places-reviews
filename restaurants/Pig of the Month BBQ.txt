Text: Can never get anyone on the phone.  They say they will return calls in 24 to 48 hours, but don't.  This is after they inform me they aren't able to deliver on the date specified - so it's an important call.

Text: An awesome BBQ place, and I like their packages. They are like Omaha Steaks, but with BBQ. Their shipping service is top notch. Mostly I love their delicious quality foods. They have the best Barbecues, with finger licking taste. The various BBQ baby back ribs are awesome here. Even their Bacon & BBQ sauces are unique and very tasty. I must recommend Pig of the Month BBQ.

Text: Love love love this company! I have to hide the ribs when they come in so my sons don't eat them before I have a chance. The ribs are the best I have ever had and we love the pulled pork and sauces too.

Text: Just had the ribs for the first time.  I have to say that they are the best ribs I have had in a long time.  Never even made it to the dinner table with them.  Stood at the counter and finished them off.  They're that good.  Thanks Leah.  I will definitely be getting some more of them before long. 

thanks,
keith
