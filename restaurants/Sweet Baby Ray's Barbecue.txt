Text: Just came back from my first and last visit to that place. Would have given it 0 stars if I could. Restaurant was pretty empty - 2 more tables except us. With the type of service and the attitude of the manager would not surprise me if they are out of business soon. But i should have guessed it from the smell of an old building from the moment we walked in the hallway. The appetizer - Fried pickles was the best of the food we had. The three meat platter did not live up to expectations either. Ribs were dry and the end cuts were chewy too. The pooled pork was OK. Due to the poor treatment and the bad attitude we got from the manager after speaking with her we will definitely not go there ever again. I would not recommend this place to anyone. BG Avenue and Rose Garden Cafe which are up and down the street are way better in terms of food and service! Proceed on your own risk!

Text: Fast service, good food,ample portions and reasonable prices. 
Casual dinning for the entire family. I get my baby backs dry rub and add sauce as needed.
The soft drinks come in a glass large enough that you may not need a refill. The ribs are meaty but not fall off the bone type. Tasty but not as juicy and fatty as I prefer. But for a quick meal at this price they are still good.

Text: Food was great. The service could have been a lot better. I had to keep asking for the same thing. They were nice, friendly, and polite but just not on top of it. The drink menu was limited and the drinks seemed very watered down.
