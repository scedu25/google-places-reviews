Text: Good buffet. Recommend getting the buffet to go if in a rush. The remodel inside has given it a much nicer atmosphere. Tandoori chicken is my favorite! Desserts could be improved.

Text: A quick lunch, buffet style. Excellent flavors and a food variety. I was there pretty early so everything was fresh. The bar had spicier food on one side and less spicy food on rhe other. 

The service was okay. I was brought water but not offered anything else. It was too late in my meal when he checked back to both with the chia tea I would have ordered.
