Text: We went there to celebrate my mother-in-law birthday. We called for a brunch buffet reservation for 10 people. When we arrived, they have already setup a pretty long table for our group. The staff are nice and attentive to our needs. Service is great! 

The pastries and desserts are yummy! I have to go back twice for it.
