Text: WOW what a diamond!  This place was fantastic.  I won't spoil the surprise, but you will love the menu.  Great salad bar too!  The bartender was incredibly friendly and attentive.  This is what service should be.

Text: My girlfriend and I visited this place today. The wooden awning over the entrance is rotted and broken off on the sides. We were promptly seated and our server was with us in no time. Upon looking at the menu online the Pecan Crusted Chicken is listed as $12.95 for Early Birds. However, the Early Bird menu we were handed listed it as $14.95. The front door of the restaurant says Visa is accepted. I planned to pay with a Visa Debit Gift Card. I presented the card to the server and asked if they were accepted. He said no. He blamed it on an outdated computer system. From the moment we entered the building it felt like we were being looked down upon as lower class people for no reason. My girlfriend ordered tea but was only offered of unsweetened tea even though there was no sugar available on the table. I am very disappointed.

Text: Old world steak house, great wine list, good steaks, severs are all well trained.
General Manager, bartenders are very experienced,  a must for those you like fine dinning. Cocktails like 1970. They have fine Cabs laid up at cellar temperatures not found in the area.

Text: Have enjoyed dining here on several occasions over the past 25 years.  Did have my 40 birthday get together here.  Food always good.  One of if not the best salad bar in the area.  Just thinking about this place is making me hungry.  Looking forward to the next time my family and I will dine there.  I usually enjoy seafood and my wife enjoys the steak.  Believe they still use a cleaver with their menu printed on it!  Beer and wine available.  Good setting for a family gathering or a business diner.
