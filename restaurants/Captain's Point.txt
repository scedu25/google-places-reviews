Text: No different than it was in years past.  Nothing has been updated in the area they have open now.  $6 rum and coke, a $6 cover charge for a band that started 20 or 30 minutes late, didn't stay to find out, then heard from my friend they started charging $10 cover to people that were coming in after 10:30 or so.  When they left around 11:00 they said there weren't 50 people inside and outside combined at that place for a decent band that was playing.  So all in all, same crappy place that will go under soon. Also, after finding out what the person running this place is affiliated with, Lakeview doesn't need that trash.

Text: Over priced and Over Hyped. Went to see a fantastic band advertised to play at 9pm. Left at 10:15, no band yet. $6 rum and coke. Great bartender though.

Text: If I could give this no stars, I would. All the reviews posted around the net are more than a year old when it was under different management. We ate there this past Labor Day weekend and it was THE WORST service ever. 

1. The parking lot was basically empty, during dinner hours (not a good sign).
2. The menu posted online is not what they give you in the restaurant
3. They apparently don't know how to cook: our "Medium Rare" steaks came out "Well" done. When we sent them back, the cook sent out two "RAW" steaks he threw in the oven. WTF?
4. The lobster tail special was two rubber lobster tails with a side of upset stomach later
5. Salads were warm, as was the dressing
6. The Alfredo dish came out as a "red sauce" dish, that "wasn't updated on the menu"
7. Our waitress, God bless her, came back balling, apologizing for the poor service
8. The cook/manager refused to talk to us

We left without paying. We don't expect the place to be open much longer.
