Text: Not a big fan of the food here.  It's just okay.  A lot of people love it for some reason tho. You do get pretty large portions.  Service is usually really good.

Text: We were here a few hours after the eclipse.  The wait staff looked exhausted. I wouldn't say the service was top notch but because of the extreme circumstances, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The food was excellent. It arrived quickly. The temperature was perfect. And the quantity was more than I expected. Even the next day when we reheated the leftovers, it was excellent.  If I'm ever in Jefferson City again, I will definitely return. I highly recommend the Madison Cafe.

Text: Restaurants have forgotten who they are; however at Madisons, you remember.  The food is true to taste, and unbelievably affordable.  Our waiter, Darryl, made the experience by actually taking care of us as patrons in this fine establishment.  From the the bread, to the seafood that tastes like it was caught hours ago, we can't wait to try everything else!

Text: Decent food, decor could use some tlc. A little pricey, lunch specials are a good time to go for better value. Pasta is pretty good, steaks are not.

Text: Stopped for lunch on a Friday at noon. Thought it might be really busy as it it located very near the Capitol, but it wasn't bad at all - the tables outside were mostly full, but there was one table for two left for us.

Service was very attentive. Warm bread came right away. My hearts of palm salad was terrific. My wife had the seafood bisque and the caprese, and those were delicious, too. The waitress put my Coke refill in a to-go cup because we were nearly finished with lunch. Would not hesitate to stop here again!
