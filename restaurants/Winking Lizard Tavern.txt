Text: Stopped for a bite on way to guns n roses concert. We all liked are food. Quick service even with alot of people heading to concert. Prices were also very good lower than expected. Will go back next time I'm in the Cleveland area.

Text: Great food. Beer selection was great. Awesome, awesome environment and the staff was incredible and they were so sweet to my kids. This is a place I wish wasn't 4 hours away. We loved it! 

My wife said: "I would totally eat at the winking lizard again if we weren't on vacation and obligated to try different places" 

that's a big compliment coming from her. We both like to go as many places as we can. If we lived in Cleveland, this would be a staple!

In for a bite with friends before the Indians game and had a great experience. 
Our waitress, Ember, was amazing.  Very annetive and entertaining. She was cracking us up!
The food was good and the beer was cold. 
Stop on by! (And tip Ember well)

Text: NOT "family friendly" as advertised, arrived at 5:30 to be turned away as you must be 21+ after 5. Nothing posted online, had looked into in-depth before arriving - hour drive to end up settling elsewhere due to time constraints. May be delicious but we didn't find out; very poor experience, won't be returning.

Text: The food was absolutely amazing! Our server, Russ, went above and beyond taking care of us the whole time we were there, which being a sever myself, it’s hard for me to find amazing service when I go somewhere. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Cleveland area and if possible, ask for Russ as your server!
