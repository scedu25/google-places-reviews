Text: Staff is great, but the management sucks. They need to remove the managers they have had for years and try some new ones who ACTUALLY care about their employees and not themselves. 
Otherwise the food is great, staff is friendly, and I would go there again. I just do not support the managers.

Text: I ate at this Applebee's 3 nights in a row on a trip out here. The first night was just because it was the only thing I could find to eat. The food and service was great and it was so much fun too. They were having a karaoke night and the place was packed and everyone was just having a good time. I have told people for months about how much fun I had! Will stop in next time I'm in town!
