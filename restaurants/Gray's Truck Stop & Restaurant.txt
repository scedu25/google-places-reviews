Text: We enjoyed our roast beef and mashed potatoes on bread. Really good comfort food. The salad bar was good too. 20 bucks for two people to walk out stuffed is a good deal. Adequate service comfortable atmosphere

Text: I've had worse food, i just can't remember when. The waitress was the best fake friendly i've ever had but no service at all. I can see hangover food being accurate, but split gravy and mushy steak isn't doing it for me sober.

Text: I have been here several times and each visit I have been thoroughly disappointed. The staff is very nice and the atmosphere is alright but the food is just not up to par.
