Geno's 140

Text: We got to Geno' s 140 at 1:15pm we were the only ones in the dinning room. We didn't have our orders taken until 1:35. The food was great but trying to get someone to wait on us was very difficult. We were told several times by waitresses our waitress would be with us soon, but come on 20min. We almost left. It seem like it's this way every time I eat there.
