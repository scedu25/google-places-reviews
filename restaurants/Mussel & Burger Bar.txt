Mussel & Burger Bar

Text: No doubt, great burgers, but gourmet, grass-fed burgers are easy to come by nowadays, and most places are less expensive.  This place is intended to look like an upscale burger stand - chalkboard walls, lots of earth-tones and wood, warm lighting, mason jar glasses and paper tablecloths.  All of that is fine, but what's with the prices?  As I said, the burgers are great - their meat mixture (blended into the burger) is excellent, their house bun is good too, but I found their sauces and sides to be suspect.  The potatoes I got tasted like someone spilled the salt shaker in them.  The waitress said it was the oil mixture on them.  I ate a few before it became impossible to choke them down (my friend's larger cut potatoes were fine though).  From across the table I could smell the garlic in the sauce (burger sauce on the side) on my friend's plate ...too much, wow.  The prices say that this place has a high opinion of itself.  The casual motif aside, I say if you're going to charge top dollar, then everything should be perfect, or at least almost perfect, and it's not.

Text: If you're in Louisville, make an effort to stop here. I went here for dinner with my co-workers, and we all were blown away by the quality, taste, and presentation of the food. The burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly.. and the mussels were top notch (and so was the bread!). We ended up going here twice during our trip.. and it was just as good the second time.

Text: We were passing through Louisville Kentucky on our way back to Michigan and I read that mussels and burger restaurant was a place to make sure you stopped in. I convince my husband to go out of his way and we both can't get over how awesome the food and the service were. We are celebrating our anniversary and they surprised Us by presenting us with a delicious bourbon cheesecake with homemade ice cream dessert. The burgers the muscles were top-notch and the atmosphere was truly enjoyable. Both my husband and I promise ourselves that next time we're passing through we will definitely be stopping for a great burger and a plate of mussels!

Text: This place has has a very nice atmosphere and it seems like it would be a great place to take a date. I had the veggie burger which was house made and was delicious. Their fries are amazing as well. Meals are a little costly but your paying for the atmosphere and the fresh ingredients. It's definitely worth it.

Text: I always bring people from out of town here, and everyone loves it. Every item on the menu is delicious. I love the curry mussels, so creamy and delicious. The drinks are incredible, not too sweet and not too much alcohol, the mojito is a must! I highly recommend this restaurant.
