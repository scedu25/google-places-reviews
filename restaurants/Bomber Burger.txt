Text: Step back in time and brace yourself to have some fun with the owner! Delicious burgers served with a side dish of sarcasm, this is not a place for the easily offended. Get in, order a tasty fat burger with some fries and have a sense of humor! Will not disappoint as you get your monies worth here in both food and entertainment. Cash only, tip well my friends. ?

Text: Very good burger!  3/4lb of 100% black Angus beef on a specially made bun.  Fresh thick cut crispy fries.  Atmosphere is quite rough vintage and colorful language is abundant.    Only for a lunch time crowd now though.

Text: Waited 45 mins or more for carry out.  Burger was 1/4 inch burnt on both sides.  Everyone says it's the best.   Although I was greatly disappointed I will trt again.  Everyone says it's the best.
