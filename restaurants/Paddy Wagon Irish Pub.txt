Paddy Wagon Irish Pub
Rating: 5
Text: Food was excellent but if you go during Happy Hour expect a wait. All the sandwiches looked great. Irish nachos were excellent.
Rating: 5
Text: Has great wings, and a decent variety of beer on tap. I would recommend this place for anyone that wants to sit back play pool and watch sports on the tvs.

Text: Food was very good.  Guiness burgers and fries. Live music.  Friendly staff and eclectic crowd. College kids aren't back to school yet. We had a great time ( our kids are several years out of college).

Text: Great enviroment overall, not a big bar goer but highly recommend this to friends. Laid back atmosphere with good hard to find beers. Our server Erica was very friendly and knowledgeable. Irish Nachos are killer

Text: Wasn't expecting much for a college town bar. But the food and beer selection surprised me. Also, order salad dressing on the side....they were a bit heavy handed
