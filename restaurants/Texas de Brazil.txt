Texas de Brazil

Text: Made a reservation for a birthday. They told us that we would be seated shortly so we sat at the bar. It took us over an hour to be seated. What is the point of a reservation if they consistently seat people that walk in before us? The food was great but the fact that we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time after making a reservation to even be seated. Will not be returning due to this issue.

Text: Love Texas De Brazil. I went for my birthday, had a bday coupon. If you love meat, this is the place for you. If you're not, the salad bar is phenomenal. I used to get the meat, and salad bar. Now I just get the salad bar with all the trimmings. Smoked salmon, shrimp, bacon... excellent. Lots of cheeses, and veggies. You can get full off just the salad. Also, included is the lobster bisque soup my husband loves. Gave me a free dessert for birthday. A favorite of ours, service is always good.

Text: Pretty amazing place.  Went there for a bachelor party a while back, and having mine there in a few weeks!

They continuously come by with these swordlike skewers of meats.  It's a little at a time, which is great so you can sample a lot.  

One nice thing is they are unusually good for an all you can eat about not pushing "fillers" like some other places sometimes do.  They bring out mashed potatoes but don't go out of their way to fill you up on cheap stuff.  That includes the salad bar.  Oh, the salad bar.  Why would you eat salad at a place like this?  Well, the salad bar is no joke.  More like a meat and cheese bar.  Full strips of bacon.  Amazing lobster bisque (at least the night we were there), or as my friend referred to it "Bacon Sauce".

We pretty much all ate until we were in pain.  It was amazing.

Text: So delicious! One of my favorite places in Detroit. They bring several meats right to your table and carve them right on your plate. Great place to go with a group of people. The meat is always cooked to perfection. The service is great most of the time...when they are slower the service gets a little spotty. It is great to visit when they are busy because the meats are all over.

Text: Was very disappointing. A lot of the cuts were undercooked and raw or fatty. While we were waiting to be seated we had thought we read that dessert was included and come to find out when receiving the bill that it was not. It would be helpful to have a real menu at the table to understand what is included. Was not impressed with the dessert either. My creme brûlée had more of the texture of a flan. About the only thing that was good was the salad and soup bar. Definitely not worth the money.
