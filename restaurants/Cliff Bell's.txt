Text: Oh man I love this place. Even if you don't like jazz you should at least stop in for a cocktail and checkout the old-school decor.  The acoustics in this place are stellar. No matter where you sit in the club, even if you can't see the stage, sounds phenomenal.

Text: I booked a large group dinner to celebrate my birthday at Cliff Bell's, and I wholeheartedly regret doing so. The evening started out well; we enjoyed the historic setting and the ambiance (which is why I chose it in the first place). Our servers were friendly enough and our food was decent. But it all went downhill once we asked for the check. Five minutes after leaving it on the table, one of the servers came by to tell us she forgot to add a $10/person cover charge. That was shocking, to say the least, since half of our party had already paid upon entry. We immediately asked to speak to the manager, who came over and said he'd make an exception for us. While that was nice of him, it didn't improve the situation. We ended up waiting over ONE HOUR to pay the check (granted, we had provided several credit cards but I don't see how charging them could take over 15 minutes). The whole debacle nearly ruined my birthday, and my friends left dinner with a bad taste in their mouths. I feel awful for inconveniencing them, especially those who went through the trouble to make the drive to Detroit, arrange babysitters, etc. All of that said, I do not recommend Cliff Bell's — especially for large parties. There are far better, more professional establishments in Detroit that would certainly respect and appreciate your business more.

Text: One of a kind Art Deco Jazz club. Good music, good drinks, and ambiance for days

Text: First off, Cliff Bell's is gorgeous.

The building housing Bell's combination jazz club, bar, and restaurant was designed by "Architect of Detroit" Albert Kahn, and the club itself was designed by noted architect Charles Agree. Opening in 1935, and fully restored in 2005, every inch of the interior is glowing mahogany hardwood, leather, and brass. Wall-sized wood panel murals adorn one wall, leading towards a beautiful art deco sunburst behind the stage, and all under an amazing curved wood ceiling. Truly one of the saved gems of Detroit architecture. 

Hear jazz most nights and enjoy one of the fabulous cocktails.  Reservations are a good idea if you don't want to wait. The vibe is upscale but still casual, and it's the kind of place you can wear a sport coat or a t-shirt to, but why not look good in a place as good looking as this?
