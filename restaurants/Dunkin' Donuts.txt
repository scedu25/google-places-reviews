Dunkin' Donuts
Rating: 3
Text: Food is good but they are not normally well staffed.  It tends to take a long time for orders to be made and sadly not always made correctly.  They have recently changed their business hours and are no longer condusive to busy early morning  work schedules.   Also, they offer bonuses for placing orders online but don't have their entire menu online leaving people ineligible to get any additional credits towards the free beverages.

Text: Went there today at 8:00 AM to get my boss some donuts for National Bosses Day. When I arrived I was shocked to see the doors were locked, despite the posted opening hours of 6am. 

Several other walk up and drive thru customers also had their hearts broken this morning when they discovered that DD was closed and they weren't going to receive their donut holes and coffee.

My job is safe, but I feel for those other poor bastards that had to arrive at the office, empty handed on National Bosses Day.

Text: Being in a hurry we thought this would be a good place to stop and grab a coffee and a donut. We got there about five minutes before 6 and they were supposed to open at 6. Another lady showed up at exactly six, but no one opened store. At five after six, someone showed up to unlock door - on other side of building first, letting in guy who had just gotten there. We were already grouchy about late opening and then having someone waited on first that got there after. The guy orders breakfast sandwich and girl waiting tells him it will be about 15 minutes. He is in no big hurry so he says that is fine. Then the girl disappears in back apparently to go cook it herself. After about 5 minutes the other lady waiting says she is leaving since they are so late opening she does not have time to get to work. A few minutes later, girl has still not reappeared to even take out order we take off with no food - 20 after six.  I will never set foot in this place again.

Text: Consistently under staffed and horrible. I even talked to the owner directly. Embarrassingly incompetent.

Text: No donuts on shelf. No bagels, no muffins, just empty shelves. But for a store with no donuts- seating area and bathrooms a mess. Don't go here!
