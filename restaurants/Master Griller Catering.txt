Text: Worst service and experience I have she had to deal with. Jon lies about what he will provide you for you wedding day and then over charge you. He promised five servers and only two showed up an hour late. It took them two hours to serve the food that was cold. At the end of the night he tried to charge us 400 dollars more then he promised further bar service. His bartender even started crying because she knew he was lying. Please do no use him as a catered for your wedding, he is a crook.
