Text: Nice little spot not too far off interstate. Nice selection (not all typical bar food) good taste and good service. Was a little slow in getting food but otherwise a 5-star review.

Text: Too many changes over the last few years. Aside from the pb and j my daughter for some reason would rather eat here, I really don’t have a reason to come back. Get a chef that knows how to cook a steak and salads out before the main course. Miss the way it used to be.

Text: Food / staff / atmosphere is on point! Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 is they need more microbrews! Great potential!

Text: Stopped in last year on the way back to Indy and was really surprised by the modern decor and upkeep of the inside! Great service, great food, beer could have been better and could have more TVs. Will be back if in the area again!
