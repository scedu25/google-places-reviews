Text: Quaint little cream shop. Old fashion look. Order while standing outside reminded me of my childhood. I cream was yummy. Plenty to choose from on the menu. Prices were reasonable and staff are amazing. I will be making a few more Day trips to Excelsior Springs just to stop here.

Text: Delicious ice cream and malts. Ordered relatively quickly for a large group. It was worth standing outside in the chilly fall air.

Text: Tried it a several times and just don't get it. Sonic has better ice cream. It's not bad; except my shakes or blizzards have been almost all milk and not fully mixed. It's just not special or interesting. Nothing new, original, or particularly good about it.

Text: Nice local ice cream joint. Prices are a bit high but all in all a good place for your frozen treats.
