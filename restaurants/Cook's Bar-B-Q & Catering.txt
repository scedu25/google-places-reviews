Text: This place is run by honest, service oriented people. The food is perfectly prepared. The smoked pork, chicken and beef are wonderful. Really good BBQ!!! The potato salad is as good as my grandma's. Cook's catered a dear friend's funeral reception. They came and set up and put down beautiful table cloths and even brought fresh flowers. Wonderful people.
