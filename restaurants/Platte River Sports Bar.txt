Platte River Sports Bar
Rating: 1
Text: The Good: It does have a TV, and I can confirm there was a sports program on it.  
The Bad:  I'm not sure how they can call it the Platte River Sports Bar, when it is physically attached to Denny's and their menu IS the Denny's menu.  The restaurant was practically empty of patrons and after hearing the other couple order, was empty on a few menu items according to the server.  I ordered a Coors Light draft which came from a warm glass and the beer wasn't much colder.  I cut my losses at that, and moved on.  
Overall:  Do yourself a favor and find another bar/restaurant to watch sports in.  I will not be going back.
