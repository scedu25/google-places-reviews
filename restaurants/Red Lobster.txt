Text: I came in not to long ago from out of town. I am a Red Lobster fan, so of course, I had to come visit your location.  The food was great, love those biscuits, and I just cant say enough about how good all the food was and there was not a long wait at all!  The most pleasant part of our Dinner was Regina, She was the best waitress, hands down, that I think I have ever met.  She was very attentive to our needs, was very polite and her manners were so professional.  She did not hover over us like most waitresses, but she came back to always ensure that we were all good and no one needed anything!  If more people in this world were like her, kind, humble, and sweet, Our world would be such a great place to live in! Thank you Regina for making our trip to your location a SUCCESS! We will be back!

Text: We love the Lob! Comfortable seating and great good. The shrimp tacos they serve are really good with a spicy sauce on top. Three are almost to much to eat served with rice. Great sweet tea and of course the cheese biscuits almost full you before the meal comes. The coastal atmosphere make a me feel like I'm on vacation!

Text: service was great,  not hovering over you while you ate.  Food was good.  Lobster pizza crust a little soggy and chewy,  not crispy as other times.  The Mediterranean shrimp was awesome.

Our drinks took a little bit to get so Eric gave us a free dessert!! We had a an amazing time!!! Can't wait to go back!!!
