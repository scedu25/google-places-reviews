Beer Barrel Pizza & Grill
Rating: 1
Text: Went to Beer Barrel looking for a good pizza.  They did not have it.  One of the worst pizzas I have had in a very long time.  

The crust was tasteless and bland.  The pizza sauce was bitter.  It tasted like tomato puree not pizza sauce.  They must be using the cheapest sauce out there.  However the pizza was not cheap.  It was one of the most expensive in the area.  

Twenty years ago Beer Barrel pizza though still expensive was a real treat, one of the best in the area.  A top notch pizza worth every penny.  But the pizza we got, plain old pork sausage, was trash.  I took the left over home and gave pieces to several people who also thought it was about the worst pizza they had ever had.  

Service was good, the restaurant clean.  But the food was horrible! Will not be going back.

Text: As a traveler for work I eat in hundreds of restaurants each year. I'd rate the Beer Barrel food as a little above average, nice atmosphere but super SLOW service. Tried it twice. Once the place was pretty busy and again with only a few tables of customers. Same slow service both times. 35 minutes to get a burger. If you are in a hurry don't eat here. If you have some time to kill not bad. Prices reasonable. Portions good.
