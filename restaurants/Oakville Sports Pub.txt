Text: Pizza had a hint of Swiss which I liked but the wings had no sauce and service was on the rude end.  Nothing special.

Text: We have been here a few times, but this past time was amazing.  We were here on Saturday and there was a lot of drama with some drunk kids fighting, but the service staff even though they were running around trying to handle the situation, was apologetic and kept us in drinks and food.  We came back Monday (just a few of us) and we were recognized for being the fun ones, and even though Tap haus was closed (they had the beer my husband loves) we stayed and hung out because one of the guys there said he recognized us and they really wanted us to stay.  Then the bartender? hooked us up with the beer we loved despite tap haus being closed.  We felt like freaking VIP's.  Being bikers, it is nice to feel appreciated.  :D Thanks Sports Pub!  We will be back frequently now.
