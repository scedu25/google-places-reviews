Text: I will never eat at Minerva's again. I use to love going there. They had the best sea food Mac and Cheese. Now they have completely changed the menu and I got very sick after eating from their new menu items. Also, for homecoming my brother went to Minerva' s with his date and they only gave them 4 dinner options and raised prices tremendously. All 4 dinner options were the same price $24. My brother payed  $24 for a chicken strip basket and a drink for his date. Absolutely ridiculous. Do not recommend eating here at all and especially not on a special occasion such as homecoming or prom.

Text: I don’t even want to give it a star. The prices are way too high for the quality of food/service that you get. For that kind of money, I expect a full glass of beverage; my food to be spot on. Save your money and go elsewhere!

Text: Not even worth a 1 star.  Just ate here and food was not done.  Had to return the baked potato as they were raw and cold.  Ribeye was dry and nasty tasting.  Waitress said she would have a manager come talk to us but they never came out.  Just took off 20 dollars.  Wow!!!  Don't have the balls to come resolve  with the customer in person, now that is REAL GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  NOT.  GUESS 4 Brothers looks better and better to eat anymore. Ate there a couple weeks ago and ribeye was phenomenal and half the price.   My first time here and YUCK NOT COMING back!!!!

Text: I was extremely disappointed and saddened to learn this evening that Mike Rashid is no longer the manager.  I have lived in Sioux City for more than 40 years and he is by far and away one of the best managers and "people persons" I have ever met in ANY metro Sioux City restaurant.  In fact, he is one of the BIG reasons that myself, family and friends came in to dine at Minerva's for lunch, dinner, holidays and Sunday brunches.  Needless to say my business will go elsewhere if I find out Mike was treated badly.

Text: After seeing some Facebook posts about their change of menu, I decided it would be fun to check it out for my birthday dinner.
Here we're the positives: the hostess was very nice, my family and I were all seated right away (which was great because there were 7 of us plus 2 toddlers), the restaurant was clean, and a manager and supervisor came to talk to us just to see how things were going (this was before we got our food.) Also, I particularly enjoyed my entree (Honey Almond Chicken pasta) and our appetizers.

Here are the cons: I seemed to be the only one who truly enjoyed my meal. My husband and sister-in-law both ordered the Cajun linguine, and while they said it was good, it didn't have a Cajun flavor/seasoning they expected. My brother ordered one of the pizzas and he said it wasn't anything special. And everyone else said their food was just okay. I don't know if it was just a bad night or if they haven't quite got the menu change down, but I was disappointed that no one else was pleased with their meals. Also, it took an incredibly long time to get our food after ordering. Again, I'm guessing this has to do with adjusting to the new menu.

I am leaving this review in hopes that they see this and take some of the criticism to heart in order to improve their dishes. It's one of the only restaurants on this side of town and would hate to see it suffer.
