Eli's BBQ
Rating: 4
Text: The barbecue is great! The sides are just ok, (which Is why the 4 starts) but everything else is pretty cool! The eat in area is very nice with hand drawn art work in the wall that will have you and your company walking down memory lane trying to remember who those famous faces are. It’s also quiet. Large outdoors eating picnic style place. With a cover so no worries for sun or rain. 
Parking in the rear and on the street. It can get crowded down there because people really like Eli’s and I think you will too!

Text: Had the ribs for lunch. Simply amazing. Meet was tender with a slight crisp to the skin. Wonderfully seasoned that paired perfectly with their barbecue sauce, which is unique- a little tangy and sweet without being too much of either. Worth a stop in. Also, very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. Wish y'all were in Lexington so I could make this my new lunch spot!

Text: BYOB.  Don't bring your vegetarian/vegan friends.  This place focuses on good KC style BBQ meat, and they do it as good as anyone else.  Sitting on the picnic tables and sharing a case of beer with your good friends while munching on perfectly smoked pulled pork and ribs (I hear the turkey is really good, haven't tried the brisket).

Text: The ribs are very good but the quality has slipped a bit as this place has tried to keep up with the volume. parking is tough but worth it. during the summer the whole area gets filled up because they have lots of outdoor picnic tables to take your food to. The nice part about this is that you can augment the food you eat with chips drinks or birthday cake.
