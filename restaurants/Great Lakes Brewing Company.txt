Text: Service was terrible.  The hostess was absolutely rude the server was bothered by serving us.  The sausage sampler was very good but the pesto chicken sandwich had bacon jerky instead of bacon on it.  I loved the feel of the place but the staff suck.  Better people would make for a better experience

Text: Delicious food! The pulled pork sandwich was amazing and the fries are great as well. It's a really large building but usually always busy. Definitely recommend!

Text: We went to the restaurant portion and had a great time. The food was absolutely delicious and wonderful selection of their beers and other mixed drinks as well. We went on a saturday around 7, so it was extremely busy. Expect a wait. But it's completely worth it.

Text: Great Lakes brews some incredible beers, certainly one of the best Midwest breweries. Typically, there Oktoberfest is wonderful but this year's wasn't up to par. Nonetheless, customer service was very helpful when I emailed my concern.

Text: Myself and a group of guys get together monthly for good food and drinks. We like to try something new each time and make an experience out of it. For May, we chose Great Lakes Brewing Company. We started off with a 1 hour tour of the brewing facility. It was very interesting and tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. You get four beer samples along the way as well. We then ate dinner at the restaurant right after. It was very busy but we got a table right away. The service as fine and the food was quite good. I had a huge burger and some appetizers. The beer is high quality but quite filling so keep that in mind when ordering food. We had a really good time and will definitely go back. I would recommend to anyone who likes quality beer and learning some history of the area.
