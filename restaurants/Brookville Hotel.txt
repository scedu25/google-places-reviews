Text: The best fried chicken in the region. Well worth a stop especially as they are just off the interstate. Don't miss it!

Text: Brookville Hotel is world renowned for their fried chicken. It's a very quant restaurant and meals are served family style. The decor throughout the different dining areas is awesome. I would definitely recommend stopping in if you're going to be in the area. Reservations are encouraged especially on weekends.
