Text: This restaurant is nearly impossible to get to by land, but easy to reach via the Mississippi river. Great atmosphere but drinks were only ok. Margaritas used purchased drink mix and liquor selection was marginal.

Text: their menu says "if you're in a hurry, you're at the wrong place".  That is spot on.  The waitress forgot to enter my food order until she brought everyone else's.  It still wasn't there when everyone was finished eating after almost 2 hours since arrival.  I'll still go back though, because the food is good, when/if you get it, and it's convenient to get to from our Marina!
