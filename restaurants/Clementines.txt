Text: Had lunch here in July 2017. A little pricey but not too bad. The food was good, the portions were good, the service was good. 
Good selection of Beer.
The atmosphere was rustic and casual, very relaxing. Perfect for a summer vacation lunch. Seemed like it would be great for dinner too.

Text: Amazing food of the stick to your ribs variety. I had French onion soup that was delicious and a robbery that was perfectly cooked and seasoned nicely. My better half had deep fried shrimp, also delicious. Also it has a very old style bar that it's great. Service was excellent and very fast even though the place was extremely busy.

Text: 60 minute wait but worth it. We were able to sit and have drinks while we waited for a table. The drinks were good the Wait Staff was excellent. I ordered the special of the day which was prime rib. I believe I make the best prime rib and there is was as good as mine. It didn't say how big of a cut it was but I'm guessing around 20 or 24 ounce. Ordered broccoli meddling with my meal. Cooked to perfection. I would have given five stars except for the restrooms needed attention.

Text: Onion rings were scrumptious. Prime rib special  was excellent. Service was great. Can't wait to go to it again! Just remember to get there early cuz there's a waiting line. Music outside was really good.

Text: great place! we were lucky enough to beat the rush, on the way out we noticed the long wait line but after having their food we completely understood. everything we ordered was great but a must try is the onion rings ??
