Text: Stopped in the other day while exploring/cruising on the bike. Very out of the way and a nice ride getting there.  Lots of cool motor head stuff on the walls. Live bands on weekends.  I found the beer excellent and the people very friendly.  My kind of place.

Text: Great beer and great food. I highly recommend the cream ale. Their annual 5K is also a lot of fun!

Text: Would be nice if the hours were posted correctly. Says here they are open on Wednesdays, after driving all the way there, found them closed. Bummer.

Text: This place is probably ok if you just want to drink beer. However, if you want to eat, call before you go or eat somewhere else first. First: you order off the board either at the bar or at the window, which is fine, however the only choices were flatbread pizza, tenderloin sandwich, or fish sandwich. But they sold out of the tenderloin.  Second, we sat for a couple of minutes to review the beverage "menu" and not one person even acknowledged us. Menu=limited at best. Customer service=poor. Spend your money someplace else.
