Text: We normally love this place and have ate here many, many times. This will be the 3rd time we have ordered take out wings and food that were not the greatest and forgot once again something in my order. The lady who was cashing out seemed to be more interested in bar people all 3 of them.  We spend 40 to 60 every time we order take out. Wings were the best but I'm no longer coming back. I gave it 3 more times thinking bad day, maybe busy, or something like that. Tonight was it. Very sad but we won't be back!  I've also called in and its like they don't care. I dont want free food I just want my 40 or 50 dollar food to be good and all there.

Text: A hometown favorite for me! Great service and friendly staff... Awesome Greek food. I absolutely love their Greek potato salad. Best potato salad ever hands down! Usually visit once a week and always have an enjoyable visit with consistent food.

Text: Really good food at reasonable price. Right side is bar and tables, left side is tables and you can see in the kitchen. Clean throughout with great staff. Great place to eat in Downtown Fairborn.

Text: Tenderloin Sandwich is definitely a go-to for me when I go there!  I get mayo instead of mustard.  ?
