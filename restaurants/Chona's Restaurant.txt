Text: Let me start by saying that I am a very picky eater. There, I said it. I love good food and enjoy eating it. I was very pleasantly surprised by this joint. I ordered some lengua tacos (tongue). The portions were plentiful, the tortillas were home made and delicious. The flavors were right on point and the service was proper.  I would recommend this place to family and friends without hesitation.
