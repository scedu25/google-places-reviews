Text: I really enjoyed the lunch box special. Great combination of chicken teriyaki and sushi. Neat atmosphere with Japanese folk music involved the background.

Text: Their bento box is everything. The fried tofu is just amazing. I've been searching all over Louisiana for a bento box as good as this to no avail. Even if you don't like tofu, get the fried tofu bento box. I don't know what they do to fry it so well but my god it's perfect. The atmosphere is nice and I felt comfortable eating their alone. The waitress was korean and said that the kimchi there is good. I did not get a chance to try it though.
