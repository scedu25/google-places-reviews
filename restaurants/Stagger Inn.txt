Text: A cozy place to eat. It tries very hard to be a dive bar, but their food is too good. They are even proud to serve Stag beer...from draft ?. You will enjoy this place but don't tell anyone.

Text: If you like real pubs and honest people, this is the bar for you. A long time Edwardsville establishment that just keeps getting better.

Text: Bartenders are not real friendly, but the music is cool and beer is cold. 
 It's a cozy place to just chill.

Text: Pretty good food; for lunch or with some beers, it's great. Use to go all the time, but it's been a few years. Now I just go once in a while to meet up with old friends and it's the perfect little place for that. Live bands, good service, good food, fair prices. Can't complain at all.
