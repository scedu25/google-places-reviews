Text: Excellent experience! The food was awesome. Rob, the owner, came to our table to make sure we were satisfied and we ended up having a nice chat with him. Our server was also excellent! We will definitely be back!

Text: The bun for the burger was too big to eat with burger. Sweet potato fries were unseasoned. But their bread pudding was fantastic! Time wait was short. And service was okay.

Text: I enjoy it here. The homemade salad dressings are fabulous. The setting is nice, it's a warm cozy feeling. The food is decent Italian fare that really is equal to most Italian places I eat at but it's still done well enough that I will visit it often.

Text: Ambience is nice and cozy.  Food is good.  The salad is served in a metal mixing bowl.  My wife didn't care for that, but the salad is good.  I used to eat here a lot years ago.  I felt it had slipped a little, but still VERY good.

Text: Meal was good. Service was fine. We were disappointed they charged us when we asked for extra bread.
