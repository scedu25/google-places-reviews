Text: My wife and I visit this restaurant on a regular basis, not just for the wonderful food but for the feel of family. We love our waiter Ben, he is the top of the line and treats us and all of his clients with such professional work ethic you would think he owned this business. The real owner George, is such a down to earth person and always takes the time to thank us for coming. We thank you George, Ben and all the help at this fine establishment, keep up the wonderful work, you make it look like fun.

Text: Wife and I found this place tonight. We live in Fairlawn and heard about it. Never been there...GREAT!  Really enjoyed the decor, food environment, people...nothing to not like.  

Waited only 10 minutes for a booth at 7 PM.  While waiting went to bar to get drinks to take back to waiting area.  Bar was full.  I don't like to reach thru people to order drinks that way so I looked for an opening.  Tender came out from behind the bar because he said he noticed me waiting and asked if he could get me anything.  Took my drink order, got them, walked them out to me, took card went back, brought out to sign...what service! Above and beyond.

Going to be a go-to place for us!!!

Text: Over priced pasta.  The food was good.  The waiter was attentive and slightly personable. At $18-$20+ for most entrees I couldn't help but feel like they are trying to force the fancy Italian restaurant vibe. Stick to the sandwiches and pizza, which are more reasonable.  And whatever you do don't pay the $5.50 for a side of broccoli.

Text: Randomly stopped in for dinner while in the area. SO glad we did!! From the moment we approached the entrance and smelled the lucious Italian smells of sauce and.pizza, we were happy we chose this place. We had wanted a nice, sit down restaurant, quiet enough to talk but good food. We were not disappointed! We all had pasta dishes- the sauce was so good! Great bread and crisp salad included with dinner. We will be back!!
