Text: Not happy at all! We would never ever go back! The Waitress we had was very nice and that's about it! I understand the cook was the owner. We ordered one calzone and it had three pieces of pepperoni in it. We also added italian sausage cheese and onion. We were very disappointed not to find much at all. They were very proud of the dough though! If your looking for a loaf of bread with very little sauce, go for it. We ate and complained to ourselves. After the "fact" we called the waitress over and explained our feelings. Giving another chance, we asked her to send us another, explaining we have no problem paying for the first one and would pay extra for the way we want it, but at least and some stuffing. She understood. After waiting 30 minutes the cook/ owner (we were told) walked out of the kitchen, past us and went behind the bar. He acknowledged us and we said hello. Ten minutes later came another. The bread was burnt and worse then the first one. The waitress came back to check on us. We showed her the outside and opened the inside for a look. She agreed "not much there". We explained we would never come back. We paid for both! We asked to speak to the cook/ owner. After waiting 8 minutes we gave up and walked out. To avoid this, I would never walk in!

Text: The food is great.  Lots of parking out back and entering that way is even easier.  Go cheer Jim up.
