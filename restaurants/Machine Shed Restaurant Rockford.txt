Machine Shed Restaurant Rockford

Text: I'm 63 and was there with my  Nephew, his darling wife who are both in their early 30's and their children 6 and 8. I'm giving you our ages because I think it says quite a bit about a place that can satisfy 3 generations all at the same time. Everyone enjoyed their lunch. The only thing that I didn't like was there was a fly buzzing around our table as soon as the food came.

Text: Machine shed just catered my son's wedding and we couldn't be happier! The bride and groom wanted a taco bar and the shed hadn't done one before but were very excited to do it. And they nailed it!! Everything was delicious and their servers were so friendly!! Highly recommended!!

Text: We have been coming here for decades before we even met. Today, Friday night at 645, we were very disappointed. The hostess did not give us a drink menu or pork- tober.  Our server was not good all around.  The meatloaf I ordered was not prepared as shown in the menu. I ate only a small portion and did not take it home. It was a very slow night. The pork combo my lady ordered was satisfactory.  Parmesan pork was good. Other two were overcooked.  The manager did not stop by after I told our server I did not like my meatloaf.  (We hadn't seen him for over 30 minutes)  The floor in the entry/store was very slippery. As we were leaving and I almost fell, I made a comment, the manager looked at me and walked away without a word. 
I really can't imagine what else could be wrong.  
Oh! We both liked the Cole slaw.
