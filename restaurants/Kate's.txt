Kate's

Text: Definitely a dive bar, complete with cheap drinks, ice cold domestic beer and old-school truck stop food. While working in town for a couple months, we came here quite a few times. The food and atmosphere was pretty rough, but Kate and the other girls were fun and we did enjoy coming back in spite of our stomachs. I'd recommend trying this at least but once, and you'll see what I mean.

Text: I recommend! Friendly staff, fast service, and amazingly cheap. Just wish they had a little more room because it was starting to get full after we ordered. The music could be slightly louder also, due to hearing other peoples' conversations. The appetizer platter is enough to make two people super full! Can't believe we ordered meals too! Lol.
