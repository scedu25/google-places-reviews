Text: Probably the best veggie burger I've ever had! It's amazing. And you HAVE to order a ginger-aide. Dude... a total game changer. Everyone who works there is extremely helpful. The staff works as one to basically just serve us. This place never disappoints. Make sure to leave them a tip and to order a cookie.

Text: One of my regular favorites. I love the Buddha bowl but the real food to go for is the brunch on weekend mornings. Food quality is amazing and the staff is ridiculously friendly. They always apologize if something is even 30 seconds late. Be aware parking is tough on weekends during brunch.

Text: Very popular place with quality food and service. Prices may appear higher than expected until one appreciates they do not use processed ingredients. Order and pay at the counter with table delivery. No WiFi but broad selection of magazines.

Text: If you've never been, it's totally worth a try. You'll get hooked on something. The veggie burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD. It's better than a beef burger and healthy for you. My father has a strict diet and can find a few things to eat here. Fun atmosphere, great food, and reasonably priced.

Text: Love going here. Very busy around lunch time at Easton on the weekends but if you wait a few minutes sitting at the bar is great. You get served like a real restaurant and it's easier to get drinks at the bar. Everyone that works there is extra friendly.
