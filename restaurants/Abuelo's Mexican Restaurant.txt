Abuelo's Mexican Restaurant

Text: Great Tex-Mex restaurant! Had a good gluten free menu. Not 100% allegen free but several items to choose from. They will even bring out gluten free chips and salsa when you get there since their normal chips have flour.

Text: The back patio by the water is beautiful. They had a couple playing the guitar & singing outside while we were there. Food was awesome! It was a very pleasant experience. The staff was very friendly & good customer service. Highly recommend.

Text: Good Food. Mediocre Service. High Prices.
We ordered the veggie fajitas (good tasting!)
Abuelo's Charged Us FULL MENU price for  the fajitas,  even though other fajita types (shrimp, chicken, etc.) Can be ordered at "lunch" prices. Happy Hour drinks are still too  steep compared to other restaurants' happy hour drink prices! ??? Server was disengaged  (possibly nervous because of the language challenge?) Not very attentive or interactive. Other servers there are usually good.

However, we do, like, other menu items.
Please adjust your prices to entice repeat business. Thank you!

Text: Abuelo's is, so far, the best restaurant experience I've had in Wichita. The atmosphere is on point, the food is delicious, especially the chips and dips. Staff are amazingly friendly! I can't remember what all we got but we had plenty left over to take home and eat two more meals. This is definitely a place I'll be returning to and worth all five of those stars.

Text: There's definitely better Mexican food, but I doubt many places can match the location and atmosphere.  Good service, very generous portions.
