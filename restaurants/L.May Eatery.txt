L.May Eatery
Rating: 5
Text: This was an amazing dining experience, possibly one of the best I have ever had. Amazing service and some of the best food. It's not cheap, but the food you get is fantastic making this still a great value. Daily specials and featured wines. Spot on service with a cozy and yet no too loud atmosphere. Excellent location for a romantic date.

Text: I love this place. One of my favorite restaurants. We eat here almost every time I visit my in-laws. Everything from the service, to the salads, to the entrees and desserts are fantastic. Never disappointed.

Text: Great atmosphere, and wonderful food! Small menu, but generally, that means the food is well thought out and prepared. We were looking for something that was a good representation of downtown Dubuque, and L.May didn't disappoint! Great gluten free options for my mom, and she was super pleased with their gluten free pizza crust! If you want a good experience, definitely try L.May!

Text: LMay’s is our favorite restaurant in Dubuque.  We had a Rehearsal dinner in the lower level and it was perfect! The room is private, the food was delicious and the staff was courteous, efficient and so nice to work with. I highly recommend!
