Text: Great service and great food. They also have a great deal of vegan options by choosing tofu and using a different broth without fish in it. I'd gladly go back again. Prices were very reasonable too.

Text: The service was pretty good and the food was outstanding.  I had the Baan Thai Shrimp.  It's listed as a little spicy and I asked them to kick it up a bit, which they did. It was excellent.  The soft spring roll was very good also.  I would definitely go back.

Text: This restaurant's customer service is horrible! Make sure you ask them to repeat your order to you! Make sure if you ask for beef it's not ground beef...

Text: This place is a treasure. Fresh food, clean atmosphere, courteous staff and delicious arrangements have me coming back every single time. I've not once had an unpleasant experience here and I've dined here over 50 times. At least. I can't express enough how great the food is here. It's worth driving from KC just for the Pad Krapow.
