Lion's Choice

Text: The food is absolutely delicious! The only reason I'm giving four stars is because I went there two days in a row. It was my first time trying it and I was super excited. Both times I went the ladies that helped us were just not very nice. They got us what we needed and did a great job but the greeting was annoyed sounding. The place was really nice and would be a great place to eat in. I would recommend it! Just as a reference, it's like Arby's but 100% better. Go here if you love roast beef.

Text: Lion's choice as a chain has better sandwiches than other big roast beef restaurants. This location in particular is very clean, quick, and is easy to get to from the highway. Definitely worth a stop.

Text: Best roast beef sandwich I've had! I love how salty and moist the meat is. They were having trouble getting people's orders right both times I came here but they were quick to correct them and very friendly. Seems like a nice family atmosphere.

Text: Ya, it's a fast food place, but the food is about as close to homemade as you'll find. The roast beef is real! I mean actual roasted and sliced beef, unlike Arby's roasted "beef slurry" concoction. LC has two choices of BBQ sauce, skin-on fries, pulled pork and soups, all good! They even have tiny ice cream cones for .25 if you still have a taste for dessert after your dinner!
I only get to eat at Lions Choice when I pass through the St. Louis/Sullivan area a couple of times a year, but if they ever open one in Chicagoland, I'll travel to eat there! The staff at each of the locations have always been friendly and helpful.

Text: Always good service here. Prices are a little higher than I'd like but the food is so much better than chains with similar menus like Arby's that I think it's well worth it. Their fries are excellent and I love the condiment selection.
