Text: The Palace is in need of an overhaul for sure. Now i know it's a bowling alley but this was the place to go when i was younger. Renovate this place and make it presentable. The ceiling tiles look like they have been up there since smoking allowed inside businesses. I expect better from here.

Text: I've always been a fan of the Columbus Square Bowling Palace. Truly feel it is the number one stop for all your bowling needs in Central Ohio. With it's 24 hour hours, it really is a great place to hang out with your family and friends. Used to come here as a kid alot and it was always a great time. While I am not a really good bowler per say, I would really like to improve my skills possibly. I've eaten at the kitchen/restaurant numerous times and it has always been good since I tend to eat quite a bit. And the bar is an interesting place as well with alot of great people. The bathrooms are also very clean always and that's a major plus for all places in this day and age. The General Manager John is a really nice guy and he really makes bowling in Central Ohio a great activity for pretty much anyone and everyone regardless of their skill level. Really hope to do business with this company in the future on a variety of levels.

Text: This is the greatest place to bowl if you are really good at it. It is better than Wanye Webb’s Columbus Bowl because everyone there is really awesome #goat

Text: Needed to kill an hour so we stopped in.  Attendants were all helpful. Seemed pretty clean.  Had to pay an atm few as the vending machine that sold socks only took cash.  Arcade games had a pretty wide variety.
