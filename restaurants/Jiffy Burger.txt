Jiffy Burger

Text: Absolutely amazing to find a place like this so far off the beaten path. Great classic American burger joint. Outdoor seating and indoor, large menu, and great service. One of the better classic burgers I have ever had. Fries were fresh and delicious. Ice cream options were tempting. Will be back again for sure.

Text: There was nothing outstanding about the food although it was still good. But the decor was fantastic, straight out of the 60's-70's era.
