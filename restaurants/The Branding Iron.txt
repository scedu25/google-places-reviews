Text: Worth the drive, very good burgers and fries! I got the buffalo burger, I highly recommend it. It's nice to take a break from chain restaurants, this beats them easily!

Text: The only actual restaurant in the greater metropolis of Goessel, and a really good one, at that. Variations of burgers, including buffalo (usually in limited supply) are offered. Go for the grilled onions and jalapeños on any burger you get. That's my advice, at least. Pickup/takeaway is offered as well.
