Vinny Vanucchi's Little Italy

Text: Salad is beyond compare. Appreciate the gluten free menu items, but my entree was too heavily spiced for my palate. Server was very attentive, and it's a fine atmosphere for relaxing and catching up with a friend I haven't seen in a long time.

Text: Vinny's has been our first stop in Galena for the past 20 years. In the past, we've always had great food and service. However, we stopped in a couple weeks ago looking forward to our Vinny's meal... unfortunately we were very disappointed. First time in 20 years! Salads were smaller, bread was just not the same and meals tasted reheated and were smaller portions. Our waitress was great... only negative thing was where we were seated. There were 2 very large groups in the room so we could not hear each other talk. If this is the new norm there we will sadly not be back:(

Text: Worst service ever!!! I just sat at the table... nothing to drink, burnt Calamari, cold and hard bread! No one came back to check on me! Still nothing to drink!!! At least 8 people just standing around....i have been waiting so long I have time to edit the review!! Still nothing to drink!! 20 minutes and waiting! Still have the burnt food in front of me " no one has even walked by" I've never experienced anything like this!! They did take off the Calamari, took apx an hour from entry to paying my Bill!

Text: Food is consistently good here and the decor is lovely. Service is always friendly. It's a Dubuque staple and I hope they never close.

Text: Excellent food! Mouth watering garlic bread and fresh garden salad. 
Our server was super kind and knowledgeable. 
Will most definitely be returning!
