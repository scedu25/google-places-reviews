Text: I just really enjoy everything about this place.  I took my mom here for Mother's Day Brunch and it was wonderful. The food is really good and the drinks are spectacular. I'm a sucker for a great atmosphere and they have it.

Text: I was not impressed with the liquors at Journeyman after doing 2 of the flights. The only one which tickled my palate was the coffee liqueur. On the other hand, the venue is beautiful and historic. The food served at staymaker is delicious and fresh.

Text: The food (pizza we had) was excellent. So many wonderful options other than pizza to choose from when I return. Liking forward to bison burger in the future. The old fashioned as well one of the best I've had. But the main thing they're pushing their spirits were awful...I did the whiskey flight..there was not one we liked! Food and cocktail we had kept the 4 star rating. As well as atmosphere huge space.

Text: Excellent food during their Sunday Buffet.  $20 per person seemed a tad high, but the quality of the buffet is unlike a traditional restaurant.  I ordered a mimosa, which they make with Brandy rather than sparkling white, and is was too strong in the Brandy; I didn't finish, nor did my wife.  That was the only distraction from a great experience, and I fault myself as the waitress did warn me.  Again, five stars.
