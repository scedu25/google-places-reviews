Text: Friendly, inviting, relaxing, the perfect atmosphere to stay a while. Quite a selection, if there is anything special you can have it made to order, just make sure to call ahead, maybe the day before, and request it.

Text: We visit here every time we are in Malvern. My husband plays in a band so we get there every few weeks. The pizza is out of this world, with a light crispy crust and the freshest toppings. We always take pastries home for the kids, too. So good!
