Text: Had the drummies. They're like chicken wings and drumsticks that are lightly breaded and fried. Surprisingly light and meaty.

Text: The food was amazing and price were very good for the quantity and quality of the food. Service was a little slow for my patience but the place was packed and they only had 2 servers. All in all a great place to eat and relax!!
