La Cabana Restaurant

Text: Best Mexican food around. We've had people join us from as far as California when visiting, join us for dinner.
Best Chicken Quesadilla around!
Best Mexican Shrimp Cocktail!
Best FLAN around, homemade, and topped with an awesome Butterscotch Carmel with a cherry on top!

Service is always great, food is fantastic, atmosphere is calm. Staff is friendly and accommodating and owner/manager is very nice. Makes everyone feel welcome, plus he loves our English Mastiffs and even has come out to see them.

Dessert choices are limited and price for desserts are a bit more than average, but worth every penny!

Please visit to help keep local businesses viable to our Aurora community alive and thriving.

Text: Wonderful from the minute I entered till the minute I left. Friendly staff greets you with awesome chips and salsa and proceeds to take your drink order right away and bring you good cold pop. Then they bring more chips and salsa and the menu. The food is reasonably priced. They have some awesome Mexican food. HIGHLY recommend.
