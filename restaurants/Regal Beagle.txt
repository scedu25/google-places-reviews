Text: Enjoyed the Buffalo Fish sandwich special.  Saw the Crabcakes and was really torn, wish my stomach was big enough for both.  First time here and would highly recommend coming back again.  Very generous portions!!!

Text: Friendly staff and quick service. Good cocktails and variety of beers. Food is great! They have a wide selection of sandwiches which are served with chips. They also have salads, dinner entrees, a long list of appetizers. It's a bar grill type of restaurant.

Text: Best food in the area. Staff are attentive, but not very well informed. I.e. - in order to answer any questions, must go ask a manager or simply telly that they don't know.
