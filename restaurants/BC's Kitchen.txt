Text: Absolutely the best ever vegetarian sandwich. Cannot say enough about how good I thought this restaurant was. The waitress, Amber, was just wonderful. So friendly, welcoming and dedicated. Do not hesitate in ordering the vegetarian sandwich, you will not be sorry. 
Lemon meringue ice cream pie- to die for.

Text: My wife's Wednesday night special pasta was great but the Bill's hamburger was dry and flavorless.  Menu said it comes with blue cheese but be aware that there's Manute microscopic pieces of blue cheese on the burger.  For a $16 hamburger I was expecting more.
