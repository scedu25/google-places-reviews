Text: Fresh home cooked food with country charm. Staff was quick and friendly. Didn't order from the menu, but everything there sounded pretty good too. Fantastic evening out with friends

Text: Hadn't been here in several years. I was pleasantly surprised to see it had been remodeled and cleaned up. Good variety on the Sunday buffet. Can't comment on the menu. I didn't look at it. They do have all day breakfast.

Text: Good size portion.  Meat and gravy tasted great.  Mashed potatoes tasted like instant ones.  Should have had buffet.

Text: We like there buffet. But you can also order of menu. There is a bar upstairs that on most weekends has a band. But you can oder a drink while dining also. Good place for singles as well as families, large or small.

Text: Yummy, homey food! Nice waitress. We all got the buffet and it was really great! The main dishes were all excellent as was salad bar and soft serve section of dessert. Not impressed with baked goods or soup, but everything else was excellent.
