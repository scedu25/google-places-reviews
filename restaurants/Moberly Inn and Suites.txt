Text: The short time I stayed in the hotel left me with a fairly good impression of it. The rooms were clean and amenities provided were sufficient for a short stay. The location was slightly unfortunate. My room's window in relation to the bed led to the nearby stoplight shining through rather brightly at night. Other than that, the hotel is more than okay for a short stay.

Text: Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! My sister and her husband stayed two nights and switched rooms three times. All the rooms and the bathtub were filthy, the pool was a Health concern - there was no chlorine in the pool and it wasn't safe to swim in. The second room had big red ants that would bite! The complimentary breakfast was unfit to eat. Staying at this hotel was a nightmare. There were many other things that are pretty bad, too many to mention. Do not stay here. It's not worth it. The staff is also questionable.

Text: The pictures from the website are very outdated. Upon arrival our door would not open, the front desk woman was able to get it open but randomly during our stay the door would not open it needs repair. The window in our room was open, with the air running, when we went to shut the window it slammed down, nearly smashing my boyfriend's hands in it.  One of our pillow cases was severely stained, brought to the front desk for a new one was told one would be brought to the room, when we returned from the wedding we were attending the pillow case was still not there. The bathroom floor was dirty and sticky. Upon coming back from the wedding we realized we had no toilet paper, or Kleenex in our room, we had to go back to the desk for this.
Our neighboring guests were loud keeping me awake past 2 am., called the desk to ask the guests to quiet down, after I had already asked the guests to quiet down myself, the guests just got louder. I never heard the desk agent call their room, or go to their room to ask them to quiet down. Then the neighboring guests were up again, waking me before 8 am. 
Overall this is the worst hotel experience if ever had personally.
I manage a hotel, and I hope my guests never experience the poor service, and stay we had, or I wouldn't be doing my job.

Text: Arrived at midnight very tired. Asked for non-smoking room on the ground floor. Instead got a smoking room on the second floor. Rooms were filthy,pubic hair on the bathroom floor. Could not wait to leave. Was not fully stocked. What a dump.
