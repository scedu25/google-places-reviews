Text: My family and I go to celebrate my wife's birthday, and upon arriving we were not greeted or waited on. Nobody asked for our drinks or gave us the courtesy of more than 2 menus for a family of 6. And the best part was that we were the only people there. It wasn't like they were busy. The attentiveness staff was so sad. Horrible attitudes. Definitely Not going back.

Text: Avoid this place like the plague if you value basic human decency. The service was appallingly poor. At first I thought that it was a singular occurrence, but as we settled down to eat it quickly dawned on me that the hostesses, servers, and the owner of the restaurant were downright rude (with the exception of one person). I had the unfortunate opportunity to interact with all of them during my first time there. Never have I been spoken to condescendingly and belittled in a restaurant setting. While I understand that there are busy periods which may lead to stress and short-temperedness, you should never take it out on the customers. My group and I came after day's long trip to the aviation museum with the intention of quiet conversation and the enjoyment of Vietnamese cuisine, but we were met with unprovoked glares and snappy vitriols.

Text: Took mom to Linh's Bistro for dinner, and we were disappointed. This restaurant is an embarrassment for the Vietnamese community in Dayton and a disgrace to Vietnamese food. I ordered egg roll and egg noodle soup with meatballs. The server came out and brought me  two. The egg rolls were thin and over done. In addition, they were old and tasteless. The fish sauce had no taste. I turned to the egg noodle soup and hoped it was better since the egg rolls were a big disappointment, but no. The so called meatballs turned out to be one meatball, yet they cut it into many pieces to make it appear to be "meatballs" instead of just one meatball. The meatball was tasteless. The broth had no taste. Vietnamese soups are famous for the broth. The broth supposed to be flavorful, yet this one had none. Mom ordered rice noodle, yet they made egg noodle. The server came out with egg noodle instead of rice noodle and told us to just eat it since they didn't want to remake it. WHAT?!?! Absolutely ludicrous!!! A total joke!!! The server was upset that we told her we wanted rice noodle. In addition, she was rude to us the whole entire time we were there. She didn't bother to refill our drinks. I highly recommend others to go elsewhere and not waste money at Linh's Bistro.
