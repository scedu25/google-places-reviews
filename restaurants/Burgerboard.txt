Text: A REAL burger joint. I stopped in here from out of town and got the double cheese with grilled onions and a raspberry shake. If you want a tasty, greasy spoon style burger, do yourself a favor and come here. They're just as fast as the fast food chains down the street, but more flavorful

Text: I used to love steak and shake. I don't know what happened but it changed. Burgerboard is what steak and shake used to be. Awesome food at good prices. And the best ice cream around.

Text: Small flat burgers like Steak and Shake - not meant as a negative just descriptive. Get the double or triple burger and add onion and ketchup and you are off to a good start. Add their fries ( thick and potatoeey, not like S&S) and you've a got a great meal. Not a healthy meal but one you will enjoy.

Text: Had a large order during the lunch rush, but they got it done in no time. The order was perfect, the shakes were exactly what I asked for, the staff friendly and it was a lunch enjoyed by all!

Text: The best hamburgers in Jacksonville! The fries are the frozen kind, but are acceptable.
