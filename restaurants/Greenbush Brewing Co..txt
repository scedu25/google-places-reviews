Text: Great beers. Good food. I think the music is too loud but the annex across the street and the GB bar next door are very good alternatives. All of the employees were polite and friendly. I would love to visit here more often.

NOTE: Try the Hot Rods beef sticks at the Annex. Two thumbs up from me!! WOW! They are really good!

Text: This place has it all: great craft beer, delicious food, and legos for the kids! If you're looking for a great place to grab good food and some great local brews, you should definitely check out Greenbush. Keep in mind they also have a tasting room just across the street if you'd like to taste the beer and take some home in six packs or a growler.

Text: Was really excited about eating here and doing a tasting. It was around 6:40. Walked in and we put our name, and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We waited about 15 minutes and then the hostess said they were too busy and wouldn't be able to seat us at all that evening.She said it very rudely, and we wouldn't of been to upset if she just would of said this in the beginning. We then went to there other restaurant next door and they also said they couldn't seat us, but no one seemed to be waiting. Wish we would have been able to experience this place.

Text: AMAZING place, must stop if you are in the area. Fantastic, large selection of beer, great service, and phenomenal BBQ. We shared a 3-meat platter and it took us forever to finish, so it would be great for a family! They have tons of seating options, and both times that we stopped here (on a weekend trip!), the service was friendly and helpful; you get the feeling they really care about what they're doing here. Waits can be a little long, but if you're flexible on where you can sit, that helps, and there's plenty of room to enjoy a beer if you're waiting on a table. Both times we were able to snag a seat at the bar and take ourselves off the wait list within 10 minutes.

Text: I am seriously in love with this place. Even though I'm not old enough to drink beer though. But their Black Cherry Soda is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Their food is decent and all but their chips and dip is really good. If I could give 100 stars I would :)
I reccomend coming here.
