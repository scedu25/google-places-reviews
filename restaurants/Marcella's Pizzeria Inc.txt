Marcella's Pizzeria Inc

Text: Marcella's is one of my favorite restaurants. Their garlic rolls and thin crust  pizza are so delicious, and I love the garlic, and their chicken strips are my favorite, with a side of fries. Their service is also quite good- very friendly. Their decorations are cute, too! :)

Text: We've been here several times for eat-in meals and order out pizza and we've never been disappointed. My husband says their calzones are the best he's ever had. Our kids are picky eaters, but have no problem here. The service is friendly and the airline/airplane decor is neat too!

Text: Awesome cheese potatoe bacon soup. Great lasagna, chicken and shrimp fettuccini. Friendly but forgetful server. Would highly recommend if you're in the area.

Text: You really cannot get bad a meal from here.  They do use excessive amounts of garlic, especially in the pasta.  I took off one star because I felt like the good would be out of this world amazing if I didn't taste and smell like garlic for 3 days after eating anything off their menu.  Their Karen's pasta is absolutely to die for (just remind them that garlic is to enhance the flavor not overwhelm it).  The pizzas cannot be beat.  The Chicago style deep dish is the very best I ever had.

Text: For starters, they served delicious complementary Garlic Knots while we waited for our food to be prepared. Once the cheesy, bbq chicken pizza was ready (within 15 mins!) it was half gone by the time our server returned. Excellent dishes, great service, and reasonable prices. A MUST if you are in the area.
