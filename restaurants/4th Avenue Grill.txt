Text: Disappointing. Fries were very greasy and soggy, incredibly salty. Server wasn't personable or friendly at all. The only saving grace was that they were OPEN!

Text: We love this place for the hand cut fries, delicious burgers, and low prices. The service is a bit spotty though. Still, it's worth a drive for the fries alone.
