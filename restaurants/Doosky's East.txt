Text: Warm and welcoming atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and owners. Locally owned and operated. Timely service along with great food. Accepts and accomodates to any size party, from a small get together with a couple friends to dinner rehearsals for weddings, company Christmas parties, class reunions, baby showers, bridal showers, any age birthday parties, etc. You name it they'll take it and make sure it is a great experience at an affordable cost. Wide selection of food and drinks. Just an awesome place to go, a must check out restaurant!
