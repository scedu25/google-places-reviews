Text: I've visited the Plaza several times and each time I've enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. It's a shame that the server, whom we always have, is really rude. At times we're ignored, treated as if we have inconvenienced him, or given a little "sass" in his responses. 

With the resurgence of downtown Colimbus, there are many other places to go.
