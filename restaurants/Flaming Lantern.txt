Text: Absolutely wonderful place to eat.
The service from the waitresses was outstanding, came to the table often about drink refills and was patient while we chose oue dishes.
It was clean and smelled nice on the inside.
Seating was nice and comfortable.
Good was exemplary...fresh okra fried perfectly, potatoes were baked and cooked properly, the meat (ribs and steak) were cooked and seasoned wonderfully.
The portions were just right even though we took some home with us.
Very awesome experience and will be back again.
