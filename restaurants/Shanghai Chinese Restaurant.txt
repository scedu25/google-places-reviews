Hands down Shanghai is the very best in it's field for miles around. Thank you Frank and your lovely wife for offering your fine establishment to Emporia Kansas!

Text: We came for lunch here.  Had sweet and sour chicken and chicken lo mein. Lunch was 5.75 and came with fried rice, small bowl of egg drop soup and a crab rangoon.  It was delicious!!!!  Only issue was the service was slow.
