Text: It's alright, but the wait staff is inattentive at best, food is passable for super cheap Chinese buffet.

Text: Love their hot and spicy soup-it is the best in town. Their coconut shrimp is also really good. The owner will do anything for you to make your dinner the best it can be.

Text: Today is August 19th 2017. I have many times called in a order. So, my husband and I decided to order from hunan moon. Should of know something was different when it came to order our egg rolls, we always got 2 pork egg rolls in one order we always got 2 orders.the lady that took my order was an English speaking woman that was another clue something didn't feel right. She told me that you only get 1 egg roll with an order. She said I could get 2 spring egg rolls in one order. So said ok. I picked up our food, and the food was horrible! It was cold. Egg rolls terrible! My husband also thinking like me and wondering if they are under new ownership. So I need to hear from the owners to be sure they still run Hunan Moon.! Because if not we are not going back. If they still own it then they need to get rid of the female hostess the man I think he's the cook. We are very disappointed.
