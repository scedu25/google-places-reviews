Text: Tried this restaurant for the first time this weekend, and we will be back. Everything about this place was wonderful... the food, the drinks, the service, even their soundtrack was amazing. I’m originally from the South, and this food tasted like home but even better. It must have looked like we barely ate our meal because the portions were so large. I would definitely recommend this place to any bbq lovers looking for a relaxing great southern atmosphere.

Text: First time visiting. Service was great.  We had Ashley as our server-she was sparkley and efficient.  They have blackened catfish!  Great find to have catfish in Cincinnati. Pulled pork was good, like that the sauce is on the side. Generous portions.
