Text: The food was outstanding, wait staff knew the menu well and was very helpful in choosing a dish. Food came out fast and fresh from the kitchen, well seasoned and tasted great. The pop tart is the best with the home made ice cream is to die for!

Text: Maybe a great place for an event or meeting, but not so good for walk in . Waited nearly 15 minutes, watching the server chat it up with a big party at the next table over - after we had to get menus ourselves from the bar - before walking out. Too bad. We were really looking forward to the pizza!
