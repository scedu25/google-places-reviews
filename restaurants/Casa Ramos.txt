Text: This place has authentic Mexican food. The quantity was enough. The service was very quick and kept asking if there was anything more we needed. Very attentive service. Good prices. I would make the drive from Wichita just to eat there.

Text: giant plates of delicious authentic food.  a bit pricey if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, but an excellent value even if you over order.  even better as leftovers.
