Text: The thick crust is excellent, even for those that may not like thick crust. Plenty of space to keep it from getting dry and a nice flavor.

Text: I had ordered lunch online from this location, expecting it to take maybe 5 to 10 minutes longer than the estimated delivery time.  I was supposed to get my order around 12:55, but by 1:30 it still had not arrived.  I called to see how much longer it would be.  The male associate on the phone said the driver just left so it would be another 10-15 minutes.  I had said I already waited over a half hour extra from what the online confirmation told me.  He had stated that they preferred people called in their orders that way they could give a more accurate time frame.  How am I supposed to know to do that?  If I can order online, that's what I am going to do.  If the online time is not right, they should not have that at all.  I then said I wanted a refund.  He told me that he could offer me a $10 credit to my next order.  I stated I was not going to order from them again and I wanted my money back.  He wasn't even offering the amount of what I paid for my order, which was over $15.00.  I asked for a manager, which is what he was, then said I wanted my money back.  He then assumed I didn't want my order anymore as well.  I told him no, I want my pizza and my money back.  I am still waiting for my refund......

I normally do not have problems with Jets, but I will not order from them again in Gahanna.

Text: Excellent chain pizza joint! With everything from deep dish crust to traditional to thin and crispy and even some of the best gluten free crust around! Crust flavorings are excellent too. Try the turbo crust!
