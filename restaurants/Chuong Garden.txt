Text: Good food. If you're providing food for a large group, this is a great option as they offer "party trays" for all options. Also very friendly service!

Text: Very disappointing! Food was horrible! My boyfriend and I usually come to this restaurant once a year when we are in town visiting his parents. However, we went there tonight and the food was horrible! We orderd Mongolian Beef and the meat was just above cold, mushy and tasted funky! When we asked for the bill the lady came to the table disnt ask if everything was good or ok (Considering our plates were full) just said ok and gave us the bill($30). We were very disappointed and will never go there again!! Service was rushed, utensils were thrown on our table. The entire experience was unpleasant! This was once a good restaurant now it seems like they just dont care! Save your money!!

Text: Honestly, it's a cheap place to get a quick Chinese-American bite. I've never had trouble with service here and the food has always been good for the price. Heavy traffic during your expected times given how close it is to the college.

Text: Ordered sesame chicken w/ fried rice and an order of egg rolls to go. I picked up my order and she was very nice. The food seemed as it had just come off the buffet that was about to be cleaned and tossed. It's temperature was just above cold. It didn't seem fresh cooked at all. I've never seen a container of fried or steamed rice so small. It was cute it was so tiny. I won't be eating here again. Do yourself a favor, wait and go elsewhere.
