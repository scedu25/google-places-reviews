Buehler's Cafe at Towne Market

Text: Extremely overpriced on some products. That's my biggest problem with the store. They also want you to be part of a rewards program for certain offers that honestly don't even save you much. The price is a real problem. But the store does have some redeeming qualities. There are exclusive products you can only buy here like their Dali's Lobster Macaroni just for example. The staff seems happy and is very friendly too! It would get a higher rating if their prices weren't so high and trust me, I think they could find a way to make it work.
