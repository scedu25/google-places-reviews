Text: My brother and his wife had a last minute anniversary party with over a dozen people. The staff was great and got into the fun with us. The food was wonderful and even though there was one ordering mixup, I have a patient sister-in-law and they (the staff) worked very quickly to fix the mistake. We're all human and we didn't let it ruin the fun.

Text: We went out for my daughter's birthday and nothing was said about us celebrating. As Santana was walking by he noticed a gift being opened. He was back in a flash with fried ice cream! This place is focused on the customer! Top notch service.

Text: Food was great kinda... but if to wait a half hour to order in an hour and a half to get our food that is entirely too long of a time to wait to get your food the only tables there was ours and 3 others. And to top it all off we had four people's meals at my table messed up.
They also skipped out on the food on our plates I ordered the trace fajitas and for $17 I got three pieces of shrimp 5 fries size pieces of steak and I meatball sized piece of chicken, and some onions and peppers which were not cooked all the way.
It's a great locally owned businesses but the kitchen is obviously lacking. would not recommend any of my friends to go eat there probably won't go either again myself.
