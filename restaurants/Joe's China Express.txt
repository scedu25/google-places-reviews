Text: Totally taste less food, fried rice? just plain white rice,  your'e better off with a microwave meal any day. I never had complained about any food but this one I paid for the plate tasted 2 bites and left, the only thing I took was my fountain drink.... The way I see it... it's that you shouldn't eat this unless your'e in jail and starving....
This is Luis from El Paso TX

Text: Not fancy but good. The pricing makes it affordable for my family of 6 and a drive thru to boot. If you are looking for chinese that tastes pretty good and are in a hurry don't overlook Joe's.
