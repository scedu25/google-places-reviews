Text: The staff are energetic and the atmosphere is fun. It is hard to decide what to order with the variety on the menu. I love the outside bar and the huge seats. They swivel and are very comfortable. 
The spinach dip is my favorite and comes with warm pita bread and chips. Their servings are large which makes it easy to share with others.

Text: Nice menu selection and so-so service, however only YOUR server gives good service, they do not work as a team to ensure comfortable and prompt service, will walk past table full of empty dishes and glasses, sit and talk instead of offer refills or sweep up the messes all over floors. Bartenders also pretty inattentive,  sit long durations with empty glasses while they talk to coworkers and their regulars. We now prefer to just order take out, and drink elsewhere
