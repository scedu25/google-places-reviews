Text: I have a new favorite brunch spot! We literally walked in and immediately got a table, the food was delicious, the staff were all very friendly, and my coffee never ran out. ? 10/10

Text: Wonderful cafe!!! I had the chicken breast sandwich with bacon, jalapeños, guacamole, and pepper jack cheese and oh my goodness, talk about good! I got a side of fruit which consisted of cantaloupe, blueberries, and strawberries and all were pleasantly sweet and full of flavor; perfect side for summer! I also ordered an iced coffee (vanilla latte) and it was also made to perfection. They offer breakfast and lunch as well as soups and salads. I don't recall if they serve dinner but either way, I HIGHLY recommend paying this place a visit!

Text: Their portions are huge and the food is great. A great place to go for brunch, but expect a wait. They make good coffee and also serve liquor.

Text: Excellent breakfast experience. Curtis did a great job as the server. Nice historic building. Great food. The breakfast pizza was good and not overwhelming. The wife’s traditional breakfast was prepared perfectly.
