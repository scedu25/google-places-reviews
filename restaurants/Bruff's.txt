Bruff's
Rating: 3
Text: Food was good for a sports bar and grill.  Very noisy, but it's what you get on Sunday night football.  Good service.  Good place to stop while traveling.

Text: We like Bruff's once in awhile. Way better than the average fried food place. I've tried the steaks and their a good deal even though they're in a true historical beef town with higher standards than most places for beef.

Text: Great Food and service I give them low marks due to them having the cable news on, I go to these place's to get away from the New's. But Sports or weather is fine but leave the news off. I may even return if they did.
