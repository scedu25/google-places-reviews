Boathouse Restaurant

Text: Nice restaurant. Variety on menu with moderate prices. I have severe allergy to shellfish, but restaurant very accommodating in preparing food separately. That is always a plus for me. Great wait staff who checked back often to see how things were.

Text: A great place for a good lunch or dinner. Expect Family dinning experience ... but you will see business travelers as well. Reasonably priced good food. Great view to the lake.

Text: Food was excellent. I had chicken breast stuffed with Brie cheese. It was covered in caramilzed apple slices, slivered almonds, apple butter cream sauce served over white rice. I think I will be able to make 3 meals out of my dinner. Server was so sweet. View of the lake was awesome. A place I would love to go to again. Thanks Victoria Pflueger for suggesting this place. Had a wonderful afternoon at Grace College visiting you. ?
