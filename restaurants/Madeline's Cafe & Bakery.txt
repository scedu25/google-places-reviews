Text: Food was good but having to pay extra for chips was something new......and the amount you got was not worth what you had to pay. Like the original Madeline's decor better. Service was great as always.

Text: A coffee shop with a really good lunch menu with a variety of sandwiches and salads. It's a nice alternative to the fast food or Mexican restaurants in Lexington. There is also a nice back room if you want to have a small lunch meeting and I've always found the staff and service to be good and the food is excellent.
