Text: We have always ordered a stuffed pizza, never dissatisfied.  Friendly staff.  Might have to wait a few minutes for a table,  worth the wait.

Text: Not good food. Was informed my meal would be taken off of the bill and then wasn't. My husband ate his so it must be ok....I wouldn't eat here if it was the only restaurant in Taylorville! Waitress is a liar that said everything was good, specifically the tortellini and meatballs. My frozen meatballs are better and my red sauce is better than their bland "stuff." Don't go here!

Text: Florida's is one of our favorites.  It's always a wonderful experience. We especially like Kathy's Fun Salad and Paisley's Favorite Pizza.
