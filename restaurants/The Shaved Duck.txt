The Shaved Duck
Rating: 5
Text: Shaved Duck gets 5 stars for its food and excellent service.  I highly recommend their good food.  I was tempted to lower the rating, though, because of accessibility.  Getting into the restaurant, via a wheelchair, is where the difficulty lay.  They do have a ramp leading to the back door, but to get to the ramp you have to squeeze between the benches outside and the raised border around the planted trees.  We have a normal sized manual wheelchair --
 If you have a larger than normal chair or a wider electric chair you will not be able to access the ramp.  We did not try to use the bathroom, so i can't speak to its accessibility.

Text: Brunch gets very busy, so either be prepared to wait a little or plan otherwise. Dinner in the evening was busy but we were able to be seated without trouble around the 6 o'clock hour. Good BBQ spot, especially if you're local.

Text: One of my favorite places in south city. Great bbq options. Great soul food options. Even though I haven't tried everything on the menu,  I don't think you can go wrong with anything you pick at this place. I would definitely go back again and again. And I've always had good service here. I would recommend the burnt ends. Smoked meatloaf with mac and cheese. Brussels sprouts and shrimp 'n' grits! And of the course the ribs!!
