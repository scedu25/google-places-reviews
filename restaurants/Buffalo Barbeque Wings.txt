Buffalo Barbeque Wings
Rating: 1
Text: I wanted to order buffalo wings, the menu shows medium wings that are buffalo. I tried to order them, the waitress said they didn't have buffalo wings. So I ordered 2 other flavors. They divided my order from 3 flavors. One being buffalo! She says to me, we can't call it that. She definitely did not explain this. The wings were not good. They were dry. The Chipotle bbq sauce was not bad. It didn't seem like anybody cared. They were all sitting at the bar while we ate.

Text: The Look of the new place is really nice. Service wasn't bad but a little slow considering they weren't that busy. But 4 of us got wings, all different flavors and no one  liked them at all. There was Hardly any sauce on the wings and there was way too much breading. 3 out of 4 of us got sick after eating them. I won't eat there again.

Text: Ordered the pulled pork and mac and cheese. Sadly it missed the mark, the macaroni tasted like a knock off version of velveeta shells and cheese. I gave 3 stars because the pork and the sauces to choose from were tasty

Text: I've been here a few times and service is usually pretty slow and the food isn't that great. I LOVE wings and I've tried a few different sauces here and they're just not good. It's also always dead in here so it would be a good place to catch a game. Can't see this place surviving when Buffalo Wild Wings opens up. Also heard the owner is a little on the creepy side and he presents himself that way. Won't be back
