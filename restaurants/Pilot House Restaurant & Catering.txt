Text: Thank goodness they finally went smoke free. I quit eating here because they allowed smoking but now I will start going back and eating here because the food is soo good. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The BBQ is excellent and pair that with a twice baked potato and mm it's so good. Also they serve Blue Moon draft. If you go on Friday or Saturday expect a small wait because it's a small place but the wait is worth it.
