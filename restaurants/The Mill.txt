Text: Food wasn't very good. Had the fish and chips. The service was ok. The view was wonderful. If we come back we will try the steak.

Text: Used to love coming here. Last time my husband ordered the fish and chips which was beautiful, plenty and hand battered. This time it was literally three small fish sticks shaped pieces and not even a handful of fries. I ordered the special which ended up being boiled salmon with no seasoning, fries with no seasoning and it totalled $22. Mind you my fish was no bigger than a deck of cards and almost the thickness of one. I won't be back for a while. It seems like they're cheaping out the food and jacking up the price. What a shame too. Such a steeple in the community
