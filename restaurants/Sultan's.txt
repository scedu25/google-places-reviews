Sultan's

Text: I love this place! You can randomly point at the menu and rest assured that you're going to leave happy. It's one of the nicest restaurants in the area and yet, the prices are reasonable.

Text: Food is all right. Not the best I've had, but you get a decent amount of food for what you pay for. Terrible service. They don't tell you when they've ran out of ingredients and hope you don't notice. When you do notice, they don't do anything about it...even the manager thinks it's okay to charge people for stuff you don't get. ?

Text: Sultan's  is our favourite of the middle-eastern restaurants in the area.  The menu is complete, the service is very good and the prices are modest. An  unusual menu item I like is lamb shank.

Text: I recommend the chicken schwarma (with a side of garlic sauce), which is the only thing I've ordered from Sultan's.  It's too good to try something else. The restaurant can get crowded, but the service is efficient.

Text: Food was EXCELLENT, but place was not clean, surfaces including menus were sticky. Would definitely return, but would be more inclined if cleaner. Loved the kabobs and Mujandeer (sp?). Portions large, so leftovers were delicious.
