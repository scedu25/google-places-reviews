Four Points by Sheraton St. Louis - Fairview Heights

Text: Mold everywhere. EVERYWHERE. This isn't unnoticeable mold, it's all over the ceiling. All over the walls. In the vents. There is zero chance the staff hasn't seen it, they just don't care. The entire place is incredibly dated for a Sheraton property - poorly painted metal doors, light switches outside the room they control, etc.. This is the kind of stuff I'd be surprised to see at a $30/night motel, much less a $1xx/night Sheraton. The (slick tile) bathroom floor had standing water in it when I got in, I have no idea where it came from, unless the cleaning crew cleans the bathroom by dumping a bucket of water on it. I would never pay to stay here again.

Text: Hate to say this. But I have stayed at motel 6 locations that we're a lot nicer than this.  The carpet on second floor is coming up and really old. In front of room 219 the floor drops about 4 inches at the edge of hallway. The breakfast cost extra and does not come with the room and the biscuits and home fries were cold and hard.   The good think was chief Sierra last night did amazing on my dinner.

Text: I have never written a bad review for a hotel in my life (72 years) but this place richly deserves it. I cancelled my reservation a full week ahead of time but the hotel refused to refund one penny. I spoke with many Sheraton employees (some friendly, some not) and they just shuffled me back and forth. I have a severe tremor. When one guy was giving me a new phone number to call (mostly just to blow me off) I asked if he could text or email me the phone number. He refused both, so for several minutes I struggled to write the number down. The whole experience turned me off not only on this location but on the entire Sheraton brand. I'll never stay with them again and I would encourage everyone to do the same. It's the kind of outfit where if they don't jack you around this way, they'll probably jack you around some other way. I agreed not to post this review if they would do right by me, but one woman flat out said she didn't care... "Go ahead." It gives me no pleasure to write this review, but I'm hoping that someone in the Sheraton establishment will see it and change a few policies.

Text: My girlfriend and I stayed here and went to a Cubs/Cardinals game. We were rather nervous after having a bad hotel experience in the past. Darlene at the front desk is simply awesome. She takes care of you and she geniuniely cares about her guests that stay in the hotel. She made us feel welcomed and right at home. The room was clean and was ready a few hours early before the 3pm check in. The bartender at their bar was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with him. As we were leaving, one of the maids was coming out of a room and she even struck up a conversation with us and was also extremely nice. Overall, hospitality was great, room was clean, and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you to Darlene and everyone else for making us feel welcomed! It was greatly appreciated.
