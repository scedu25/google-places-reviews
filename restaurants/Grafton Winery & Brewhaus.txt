Grafton Winery & Brewhaus

Text: Stopped in for a bite to eat, and to try some of the beers they produce on site.  They brew 9 beers, and since I'm not typically an IPA or Stout drinker, it made it easy to narrow it down to one of their 6 selection flights.  The beers were good, and the bleu cheese burger was amazing.  If you want a typical winery atmosphere, I recommend checking out their establishment up the hill - The Vinyards.

The only reason I have to take a star is due to the fact our food order was somehow not put in.  After waiting a while (our friends were half way through their meal) and finally checking on it, they realized the error and got it out right away.  I understand accidents happen, but they could have at least comped us a drink or something for the trouble.

Text: Wow we had our sons wedding rehearsal here January 27, 2017, I worked with Sue on it and she was fabulous and fun to work with! Anything I wanted she was willing to work with. We had barbecue brisket and barbecue chicken with corn bread ,baked beans,mac and cheese and a salad. The food was wonderful!!!! We were a little worried because we didn't get a chance to taste test before because we were 6hours away. No worries the room was great! The food was fabulous! And the help was very friendly! Our guests were very pleased. Thank you Sue!

Text: Ate here for a late lunch on 5/23.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my wife had the chicken caeser wrap, both came with a side of homemade potato chips.  Wraps were delicious and filling,  chips were good but we would have preferred fries or Lays potato chips instead.  The staff was friendly but definitely understaffed for the amount of customers eating.  Took over 25 minutes to receive our food and had to stand in line to get a refill on our drinks.  Overall, it was a pleasant lunch on a nice day.
