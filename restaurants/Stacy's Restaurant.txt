Text: Great food!! I highly recommend their patty melts. The service is always fantastic as well. The servers don't interrupt or get in your way while refilling drinks, which is great when you're having a good conversation. There wasn't a long wait for the food any time I've been there, in both small and large groups.

Text: "Best place in Junction City, KS to eat breakfast"
I am a Bacon lover, and definitely the bacon here at Stacy's made my day. While in Junction City this is going to be my favorite place to eat breakfast. The Staff, all rock! Thanks to the cooks for making me feel at home with a delicious breakfast. Come to Stacy's and try it, you will not be disappointed.

Text: Just a lively local restaurant. Decent food and fair price. We were here on a Saturday morning and all the local gentlemen were having a ball. Laughing and shooting the breeze. Reminds me of my home town ?
