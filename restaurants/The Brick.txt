Text: Very relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. My friend ordered off menu because he remembered having specialty nachos that weren't listed and the woman helping us was very nice and knew exactly what he was talking about. All of the food is great here, so it wouldn't have even mattered if it could not have been done.

Text: I think this is one of those small restaurants where you go in as a chance of luck and find a very nice food. We were lucky to go on Tack Tuesday and had these amazing tacos for $0.75 each.
We also ordered hot dogs and fish and chips and everything was delicious.
I just want to say that maybe our waitress was having a bad day because she wasn't very attentive to us and we had to ask for stuff from the other waitress.
Also the beer was quite expensive. I know of places who sell drinks for cheap and they taste great.

Text: An interesting yet familiar dive bar/restaurant. A great selection of menu items (burgers, dogs, salads, apps) and interesting cocktails. Lots of craft beer. I'd eat here again!

Text: Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon was seated fairly quickly and the employees were nice. It's a standard bar type atmosphere so that's fine. So I had the fish and chips as pictured it looks good unfortunately not so much. I think the main problem is they don't know how to use seasoning the fish was bland the fries were bland and the coleslaw was bland. So overall just a meh experience.

Text: This place has great live music and excellent food at fair prices. The burgers are great and happy hour is different every day of the week, be sure to check out taco night for cheap and delicious tacos. But the drinks here are arguably the best part, their bar has a list of cocktails that are simply amazing.
