Text: Food service was a 5 stars but the food itself were an eye opener...I ordered a prime rib sandwich OMG was it ever thin. I'm guessing all their food are frozen unless they have their special of the day...there were 8 of us that meet once a month at different restaurants...the salad and chili were "good"...hamburgers and pork tenderloin were thin...the fries and taters tots were good. Will I ever go there again for food...I hope not...to meet to have a drink...yes

Text: You are dining in a true Route 66 legend. Aside from the restaurants celebrity statue you are treated to friendly service and great food. I have visited Old Log Cabin Inn many times and have never been disappointed.
This is a must stop on Route 66

Text: This was our first stop on the Mother Road, arriving here late afternoon after a tiresome drive from Chicago and stopped because the EZ Guide recommended it: we weren't disappointed.
A warm welcome followed immediately by hot coffee and iced water set us up for tasty hot food in very large portions, all provided by a genuinely obliging hostess.
She took an interest in our road trip as well as looking after us right well, and she and the inn deserve as much custom as you can give them.
