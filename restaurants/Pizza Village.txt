Text: The service was great, but the pizza was greasy and the crust was hard. Unfortunately I have had better and I remember it use to be better. Was way over charging for the quality of the food that is for sure.  Paid  $95 for 2 Large single topping Pizzas, cheesy bread, Small Bbq, 7 salad bars and 7 drinks , 3 which were children drinks. Really disappointed and will not go back.
