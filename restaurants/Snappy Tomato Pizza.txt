Snappy Tomato Pizza

Text: We had such a wonderful experience when we stopping in yesterday. Everyone there was so friendly and greeted us right away. Diane (I am horrible with names so I hope this is correct) was super helpful in letting us know what the specials were and making recommendations on what to order. We dined in and the entire time we were there everyone was working so hard. Our food was quick, fresh and delicious. We just recently moved to the area and had a hard time finding a good pizza place. So glad we finally have!!

Text: Snappy' s is AMAZING! I've tried to find a place that had a pizza like the "yard sale" pizza I always got in Florida. I haven't found anywhere that even came close until I found their ultimate pizza! I highly recommend it and won't go anywhere else now!

Text: If you like cold Chicago style pizza, this is your place. I have had them twice now, and both times were cold. I even let them know before hand with tonights order. Cold to the point the inside was under cooked. Too bad, because there isn't much to choose from around here.
