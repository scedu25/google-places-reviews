Text: Casa del taco is the reason I was so happy to be moving back home!! After 7 years away, it's hard for me to NOT eat there every day!!   The food is amazing, doesn't matter what you order--you'll like it!

Text: We live close to 4 hrs away but always make this our pit-stop whenever we head for southern Ohio. This needs to be a nationwide chain, the food is so fresh and of exceptional quality. Best taco out there period.
