Text: Dinner was fab. Show was delightful.  Accessibility was something to improve upon. For the amount of people with disabilities, insufficient room and the loft was out of order. Bathrooms were too far away and way too small. Even the larger stall couldn't fit a walker in along with a purse and coat. More ramps are needed as well. Too many stairs!!!!!

Based on the show and dinner a rate of 5 (1-5with 5 being the best). Ambiance -5. Cleanliness 5.  Service 5. Accommodations 1.

Text: Went for a wedding... The banquet is pretty but I've seen better. Food was served very late, party started at 6 but food didn't come out till 9:20 And when it finally came we had to wait like 20 minutes in between soup, salad, and main course... Further more service sucks.. I had to wait like 15 minutes to get a spoon, I got tired of waiting so got up and got it my self. Also dance floor was very small.

Text: Very good music, singing, dancing in "Forty-Second Street." Story and basis of scenes not made clear enough. Enjoyable.

Text: It is a nice facility. I think they used to have more shows and entertainment options. I go there for C.E. courses. Easy access.
