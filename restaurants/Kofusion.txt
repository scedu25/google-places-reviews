Text: Went for some sushi with my sister when she visited campus. Highly attentive staff. Outdoor seating when the weather permits. Inside has a lava-lamp atmosphere. Sushi prices are reasonable with classic rolls under $10 and special rolls around $13.

Text: Food is fresh and amazingly delicious!  Started off with crab cakes and they are the best I've ever had!  Light and full of crab and flavor!  I had the Halibut.  AMAZING!  My wife had beef stir fry and it was so tender!  Highly recommend!  Table service was top notch!

Text: excellent sushi.  howeve they need a menu detailing what you are eating when it arrives to the table especially on 1.00 sushi nights.  also a take home menu would be great and inexpensive to produce.
