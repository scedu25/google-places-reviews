Text: This review is only for the sushi.  The rice is was over cooked a little and sweet.. And they love imitation crab in the rolls . The rolls cost more than most sushi places in iowa. They could. Really use more options . So the bad is out . This is a really nice place . A golden nugget in southern iowa. The rest of the food looked amazing . I will return and try more food. I know I'm a sushi snob I really hope hyvee changes things up a bit and makes it big .

Text: This place has some innovative dishes. Always easy to find a dish you love. Very generous portions. Their 800 calorie menu is great for seniors who don't want such a big meal.

Text: Made my first order over the phone , person who was taking order was polite and respectful.  Second visit didn't go so well , feels like food was frozen and then reheated . Overpriced frozen food.
