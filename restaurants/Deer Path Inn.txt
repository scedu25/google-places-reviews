Text: We celebrated our 22nd anniversary at Deer Path Inn. We ate in The Bar. Our waiter was Osvaldo. It was the best anniversary we've had. Apps were great, octopus and calamari. We split the Half-Ass steak sandwich. Still took some home. And we enjoyed a piece of chocolate cake. Hat off the the chefs and staff. Top notch all the way! Oh and the English theme of the whole place just makes you feel at home. We'll be back, for sure!

Text: Great bunch, especially if you like seafood. Service was fantastic- attentive but not overbearing. The breakfast selections are fantastic, but lunch is a little weak if you're not into seafood. One tip is you can order a lot of "off-menu" items like omelets, waffles, pancakes, lava cakes, and even ice cream sundaes. The desserts in general were a real home run. Overall I'd recommend the Deer Path Inn for special occasion brunches.

Text: We attended a wedding rehearsal at the Deer Path Inn. We can only say excellent things about our experience. The staff were extremely friendly, the room was beautiful, the food was excellent, it couldn't have been any better. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a spot for your next social event.

Text: If you are traveling in this are and tired of staying at a chain hotel, stay here. This is the kind of place where they learn your name and your preferences and greet you when you come home at night. Wonderful accommodations. Good food options, and some nice nooks to relax in while getting work done.
