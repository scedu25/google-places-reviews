Text: I love Costa Azul. It's cheap, fast and tasty. Never had a bad meal there. I don't know what else you could possibly need in a recommendation. Oh, yeah, the inside is pleasant too.

Text: Friendly service, colorful cheerful interior, reasonably priced.  Near Kalahari and Great Wolf.  I enjoyed my veggie quesadilla, the salsa, and daughter liked the chicken and fries.  Our friends were not too impressed with their burger and meat dish.  To each, their own.

Text: Love this place! Came to Sandusky for vacation and ended up here twice in a our week stay. Prices are great, food is amazing, service and ambience are authentic. We have nothing negative to say about Costa Azul. Seems to be where the locals eat which is great too. 5 minutes from Nickel Plate beach.

Text: Great staff and awesome service, but honestly you're not going to find Authentic Mexican food anywhere in Ohio.  Authentic Mexican food can only be found in Iowa.  Still, Ohio Mexican food is way better than the Mexican food you get in Texas.
