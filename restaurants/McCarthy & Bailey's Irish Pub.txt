McCarthy & Bailey's Irish Pub

Text: This is a good spot to hangout and have a drank or eat good food. Even my friend that doesn't drink alcohol loves the food. He thinks this place has the best shepherd pie. It's a fun hanging spot to wine down with friends and or family. Fish and chips are really good and filling haven't had a bad order of fish & chips yet. If you want to get your money worth with appetizers order the Onion rings there practically donuts. Overall I have no noticeable issues besides some appetizers being portioned too small for the asking price. Staff helpful and attentive and has nice atmosphere.

Text: It's a bit tough to judge because they were packed due to nearby concerts. Service was great considering how busy they were. The kitchen apparently ran out of soup and had to make more, so I was ready to leave by the time it came out, but again, it was crazy busy. The Irish nachos were outstanding. I enjoyed my drink (Nutty Irishman). It was extremely loud, so that sucked. But if I were ever in the area again, I would go back.

Text: Decided to try a new place to eat and had heard the ads on the radio for M&B. It is a nice, clean pub with cozy booths to dine in. Their all you can eat fish was good, a little greasy for me. The fries were delicious. May come back again
