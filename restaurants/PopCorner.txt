Text: It has a great homey feel with great options for soups, salads, and sandwiches. Of course, they have popcorn along with some nice drink options. The taco salad came with mixed greens, meat, guacamole, cheese, etc. and a variety of dressings to put on top. The egg salad was also dressed with tomato and lettuce. The Cuban had a nice spicy mustard and the bread was nicely toasted. The beer cheese soup was great and had a mild spicy flavor. The prices were reasonable. We came with a group of 15 and everyone was pleasantly satisfied!
