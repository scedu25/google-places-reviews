Dublin Bay Irish Pub & Grill
Rating: 4
Text: Dublin Bay has a great atmosphere , a cozy little restaurant with good Irish eats. I have tried many dishes here, and been very happy with almost all of them. The one dish I wish they'd get rid of is their sweet potato & black bean burger. Every so often I forget that I've tried it here - and it has the consistency of warm Playdoh - completely unappealing!  Other than this one dish I'd highly recommend.

Text: Best boneless wings around!! (On appetizer menu called planks). Amazing thick beer battered onion rings. My husband and I love to go here for a date. Love the warm, relaxing environment.  Tap beer (love the black and brown!) and appetizers- so good!

Text: Really good food & dining experience. They have some more upscale menu items than you might expect from a pub, but they also offer Irish food, sandwiches, etc. They make a lot of things in-house and you can tell. Great beer selection and signature cocktails - homemade whipped cream, even!

Text: Solid Irish pub fare with an extensive menu.  Great local beer selection and a cozy vibe.  Came from out of town and just had time for a quick lunch, but I'd come back here again the next time I'm in Ames.  The manager was also very helpful in emailing me a receipt when I forgot mine at the restaurant!

Text: This is the second time I have been here. Great place to unwind. Low key atmosphere. The Irish inspired food is on point and the beer selection fantastic. Tim, who was bartending tonight, has great customer service skills. Will definitely come back next time I visit Ames.
