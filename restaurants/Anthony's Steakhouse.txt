Text: Anthony's Steakhouse was absolutely fantastic!!  My son and his new wife had their rehearsal dinner there.  The room was cozy.  There was an outdoor area off of our room.  I had the steak, it was spectacular!!  Cooked perfectly!  There were around 30 people that attended.  I did not hear one complaint!  There is a choice of three entrees.  It was a really wonderful dinner!  The staff was courteous and the service was wonderful!  Great time had by all!! I would definitely recommend Anthony's Steakhouse for dinner or a party!

Text: The Italian sausage soup is great. The rest of the meal was what one would expect the standard to be for steakhouses. Our server was very friendly and upbeat, might say she was one of the best servers I've ever had.

Text:  Dinner was very good and worth the time and effort to get on their guest list. Reservations are recommended. The Filet with mushroom  appetizer was one of my best dinners that I have experienced in recent memory.  The service was friendly and I would recommend this Steakhouse to any of my friends or family

Text: I recommend this place to my out of town guest & I accompanied them. The service was horrible, the waitress was RUDE! One of my guest order a steak medium rare done & it came well done when my guest said it was wrong & what was wrong with it, the waitress said "did you cut it in the middle!?" If the end of the steak is wrong.... how can the middle be right? This place is horrible and we were treated horribly... I'm pissed I recommend this place... NEVER AGAIN

Text: I was satisfied here, but it wasn't anywhere near great. My steak (NY Strip-rare) was tough and flavorless. However, the sides and my kids meals were really good. Service was great and the food came out very quickly.
