Text: Wow! We ordered baked spaghetti and  lasagna. Each meal was delivered hot in an 8-inch iron skillet with Italian seasoned bread. The salad bar included homemade croutons and six different dressings.

Text: Our first visit and it won't be the last.  Had a wonderful dinner alfresco on the patio, but it is a busy intersection.  Started with the cheese sticks (as suggested by the waitress) for the kids.  Very plentiful and delicious.  We had one of the mushroom apps and it to was delicious.  Sliced portabella cooked in butter and garlic then topped with cheese.  Use the included bread to soak up the juice and you won't be disappointed.   Kids had the cheese bread from the kids menu.  It would have been good if we hadn't already tried the cheese sticks, they were better.  Also had the kids spaghetti and meatballs.   Very plentiful and delicious (meatballs were already cut up too, less work for me).  Hubby and I got pizzas - Garden and Itallino.  Loved the thin (bit not too thin) crunchy crusts.  Toppings were plentiful which can be unusual for a veggie pizza and went all the way to the edge.  No big edge of nothing but dough.  DELICIOUS!

Text: Excellent food. We thought is was a little pricey until we saw the portion size and tasted the food. Lots of selections on the menu. Well worth it, we will stop in again. Very comfortable and pleasing decor. Altogether a good choice.
