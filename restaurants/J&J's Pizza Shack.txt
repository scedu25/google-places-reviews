J&J's Pizza Shack

Text: I was charged for a pizza and said Pizza never came. The only option was to be refunded and charged for an additional pizza. Not exactly acceptable. I won't give a 1, because my service was so mediocre it's not even deserving of that extreme a review. Their Pizza is acceptable, but their service is highly variable. Order at your own risk as 1 out of 20 times you may not receive a pizza. Of course if you care that much about pizza you're probably pretty dumb; it's just food and you're not dying. 

I give this pizza place a "shrug" out of 10.

Text: Worst pizza i have even gotten delivered. Delivered in a bag and way undercooked. I drove back to the restaurant to return the pizza so they could see it was undercooked. For gods sake the sausage was raw.  "Shift manager" denied delivering it to me like that and didnt care at all to try and make things right. Either refund my money or make the pizza right. Your choice. Worst part is that i got the kitchen sink in portage a week ago and it was out of this world. I will never be back.

Text: Honestly the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life. The cheese wasn't cooked and the sausage was subpar. 

On another note, the driver was very polite and courteous.
