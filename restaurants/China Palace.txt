China Palace
Rating: 4
Text: My experience with China Palace was surprisingly good, the food was delivered in a good amount of time. The food was also steaming hot, I ordered wings, fried rice with crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon was a little skimp with the filling. The wings were AMAZING, very juicy and crisp. The rice was also seasoned well, I will have to ask for more soy sauce next time. But overall a 4.5. ;)

Text: This is a great place to go when you want tasty Chinese food in Cape. The food tastes great, the prices are reasonable, and the staff are great. The only issue might be that it can get very busy here from time to time. Still, this not a reason to avoid trying this fine establishment.

Text: Best Chinese place in Cape Girardeau. They offer a very reasonable price buffet for lunch, have take out, drive through and delivery. And best of all, they have BUBBLE MILK TEA!!! I recommend this place to anyone wanting to go out for Chinese food!

Text: Let me start by saying that I've only lived in town for a few months, so I have no attachment to any one establishment. I've yet to find a decent Chinese restaurant in Cape Girardeau, and out of the 3-4 I've tried this is the worst. It's surprising considering the city has good Indian, Mexican, and even Filipino restaurants. I made the mistake of ordering carry out. The food was simply pulled off of their small buffet. I found bone shards in the chicken, and the breading was soggy and mushy. I was also shorted a crab Rangoon in my order of three. I could write it all up to the idea that they're more geared to be a buffet, but the Chinese buffet a block over also does carry out, and at least it's passable. I will not be returning
