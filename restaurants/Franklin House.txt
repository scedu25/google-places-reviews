Text: Wanted the roast beef sandwich which comes with horseradish sauce. Asked the waitress if chef could put sauce on the side. She came back and said he would not do it. Hello....the place had two men at the bar and my table of two. Seems to me customer service would be the better road here. This cook thought being unmoveable was more important than his customer.

Text: A great ambiance and nice selection of microbrew beers on tap. Big fat tasty burgers are the main dish here. The only thing preventing 5 Stars is the really large number of people who smoke inside. It's like a fog at times. My eyes burn just walking in the door.

Text: I went here for my 21st birthday and the bartender was fantastic. He was very attentive and offered a lot of suggestions when I didn't know what I wanted. The prices are quite fair as well!
