Text: They use to have huge servings of food. Lately when I go here its small portions for the same price. They are also in my opinion rather expensive for what you get. Other then that the food is the best Chinese I have ever had.

Text: Tea was week, egg rolls and chicken broccoli had no flavor.  Service was lacking as they were preparing to close.  Overpriced for product.

Text: Ordinarily we order takeout. However my oldest daughter and I enjoy dining in. You can sit wherever you like. Generally there isn't a wait for seating. Even the lunch portions are large. We never finish and normally bring home food. The service is quick and friendly. They always keep our beverages refilled.
