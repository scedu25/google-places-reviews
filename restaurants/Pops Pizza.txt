Pops Pizza
Rating: 1
Text: We actually order Pops frequently from work but I don't know that we will be ordering anymore.  It seems like every time we call any simple request that we have they can't do. I am talking simple..Like please add bacon.  We asked for half and half of a pizza today and was told they couldn't do it by the owner and told us he fired the last cook that did that.  There was no reason they couldn't do half and half because they have the same base ingredients.  Also it was unprofessional for him to tell us that the cook was fired for it.  Food is good but the customer service is something to be desired.  I do believe they have lost our business.

Text: Pops doesn't have superior pizza, but it is one of the best pizzas in Quincy. The service is usually good.
