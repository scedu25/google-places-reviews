Thai House Restaurant

Text: Enjoy the experience eating there but there is not much room to sit. I got the hot Thai Spice which I thought was fairly mild however my friend thought it was extremely hot and states she will never get hot Thai again. The food was served rather fast (within 10 minutes) and the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is rather sketch but the people are friendly. I would go back again.

Text: The owner and his staff are all very friendly here. It is a very tight space inside with seating at tables for 12 total and 2 seats at the counter. If you want to try with a large group I recommend doing a to-go order. Their heat levels are scaled pretty well but if you get it hotter than you can handle then it can really ruin your meal. Mild has a generous kick to it and medium is where I think most people who claim to like spicy food a lot fit in well. (If you've been to Bann Thai you can order hotter here than there). They make a great Pad Thai and Peanut Curry here. I also recommend their Satay and Crab Rangoon appetizers. If you want a drink that is tasty and also cools off your mouth after the spice of your meal order a Thai Tea, it is served cold and has dairy in it.

Text: It's the best Thai food I have had. They are friendly and it may be small so better to order to go.

Text: When I lived in Wichita I worked right down the road from this restaurant so I ate lunch check here multiple times a month. Their pad thai is my favorite! I've moved out of state and have yet to find a place this good. Thankfully my family lives in Wichita so I have an excuse to return for my pad thai. The restaurant is small with very little room to eat in but that should hardly be a reason to miss out on truly delicious food.
