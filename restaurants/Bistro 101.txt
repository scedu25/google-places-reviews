Text: What a gem of a restaurant! Definitely something you'd expect in a big city that offers unique and flavorful dishes.  The best pasta I've ever eaten - a chicken, mushroom and bacon concoction with an amazing sauce. My husband's pork chops were huge, tender and delightful and our girls loved their nachos and sausage and apple mac & cheese. Totally eat here unless you only like plain, run of the mill food.

Text: Best restaurant in central Illinois.  Hard to believe there's a restaurant this good in such a small city. We come every time we're near.

8/18. Another great meal. Steaks and ribs both excellent again. How does Canton deserve such an outstanding restaurant. And the staff does a great job, even when they're busy.

Text: By far the best restaurant in Canton. Food is always fantastic. Friendly staff. Lounge scene is great with live music regularly. Try to stop in whenever I'm back in the area.

Text: The Parlor has been renovated and is more spacious.  Chill atmosphere that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Fun, tasty craft beers.  Live music from local artists.  Highly recommended!
