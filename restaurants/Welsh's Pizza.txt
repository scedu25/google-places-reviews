Text: The food was Amazing! We had the Philly Steak Pizza and loved it! The staff are a great group of people that were very kind to us out of towners. I would highly recommend, and will try to come back when we come this was again.

Text: The pizza is great.  I know pizza when I see it and out of all the pizzerias I went to this one is the best. It is even better than my homemade pizza, and I usually never say that
