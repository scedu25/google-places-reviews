Text: The people there remember us and are always friendly. The food is delicious and keeps us coming back. Great place for a burger or a really good steak. The coffee and deserts are pretty good, too. Try it once and you’ll be like us and keep coming back.

Text: I don't think the food is so great. I have gotten food out of the freezer at the store that tastes better. Price's are way out of line.

Text: We had a group of twenty with a reservation. We ordered our food 30 mins later our server comes back and tells 5 people that they don't have what they ordered in stock. 20mins pass our server comes out and says to 6 people they are out of the new york steak. There was horrible communication between the kitchen and the servers.

Text: Good food but a bit pricey for what you get. The riverside deck seating outside makes for a nice atmosphere.
