Pancheros Mexican Grill
Rating: 4
Text: Very good food. I love Pancheros. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because Pancheros has issues with the consistency of their beans. I don't know if they are over or under cooked bit they aren't always the same.

Text: I have never been treated so terrible by a manager at a restaurant like I was treated today at Pancheros. The manager was disrespectful, rude, very aggressive and intimidating. I will never give my hard earned money to eat at Panchero‘s again in my life! The way I was treated was very unacceptable and I absolutely think something should be done about it.
I will go to social media just to let everyone know how they treat their customers at Panchero‘s.

Text: If you want to catch some sort of disease, please go here. Majority of the employees looked like they hadn't showered in a few days, there were nats flying around the food and they were ruining the tortilla for the burrito by just frying the heck out of it. Super sad because I love Pancheros, but not enough to eat at that rat hole.

Text: Fresh tortillas made in front of you and they mix your fillings together before rolling the burrito so you don't end up with all your guac on one end. Everything I've tried tastes great, too.

Text: Quick and pretty tasty. I come here pretty often and get burritos.
