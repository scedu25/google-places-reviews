KFC

Text: KFC never seems to disappoint. I felt like I won the lottery when they not only were serving chicken gizzards on their Buffet but also chicken livers. A great filling well-balanced freshly made supper cheaper than the golden double double arch. Thanks Maryville KFC.

Text: This place is just another KFC.  Same heart stopping food as everywhere else.  I feel gross eating the food, but it's pretty tasty.  Never had an issue with this location.
