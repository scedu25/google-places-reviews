Maldaner's Restaurant

Text: Our service was adequate.  The server of the table next to us did a better job.  Food was good.  We ordered  Brandy Alexanders after  finishing our  meal.  We waited over fifteen minutes before the bartender even started  making them.   Needed to leave to put more money in the parking meter while waiting.  I  was  excited about going to the oldest  restaurant on Route 66.  I  was disappointed by the time the check finally came.  The tables on either side of us were seated after we were and left before our cocktails had even  been started.  We were here on a Tuesday afternoon.  The restaurant was not very busy.   Sadly I will not return.   I anticipated sharing this place with friends and family from across the state.

Text: Great restaurant that's been in business since 1884. Exceptional food and service. I loved their French Onion Soup.

Text: Maldaners is a Springfield institution. The food is always good and the cocktails have a traditional feel with a twist. The bar and restaurant have an old fashioned feel. Stop in for a good meal in an old Springfield political setting.

Text: I've been here for lunch several times and I've always had the horse shoe, so good. 

If you haven't had a horse shoe, I highly recommend it. An open faced burger, fries on top covered in cheese sauce. Yum!
