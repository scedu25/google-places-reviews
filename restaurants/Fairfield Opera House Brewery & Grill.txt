Fairfield Opera House Brewery & Grill
Rating: 3
Text: Historic restaurant and bar... Bit of a jewel in a very rural Nebraska town. Specials served on weekends which seem to be superior in quality to the regular menu. Bar service is good, very friendly staff - table service was a bit sketchy on our visit.

Text: Impeccable 1st time dining experience here! Can't wait to come back. The prime rib was outstanding as was the rest of the meal. The staff was friendly, the place was clean, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the price was right and the food was delicious. What more could a person ask for? The scenery was pretty cool to look at while you chewed too. (By scenery, I mean the awesome murals painted on the walls of what life was like in Fairfield in the late 1800s.) I think we discovered one of Nebraska's  well kept secrets when it comes to family dining. We will most definitely make the drive from Lincoln again! Thank you for a wonderful time!!

Text: It's really good food, the price is right, the service is amazing. Needs noon hours.  They have a nice beer garden that was just put in, not too long ago, a wine center and really nice looking stuff. Fairfield Opera house is open much more and they are staying busy. The Wine facility is nicely done, and the food here is pretty good.
