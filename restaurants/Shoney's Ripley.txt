Text: Without a doubt, the worst restaurant I've been to in my life.
The waitress billed our party wrong, then when we tried to get it right with the manager instead of helping the situation she instigated an argument with my wife's elderly aunt. 
So the next step this so called "manager" decided to take, was to tell her other waitresses not to go to our table for anything.
To top it off my wife found a dead fly in her salad and the silverware I was given had dry food stuck to it. 
I usually don't write reviews (good or bad) on websites but this special case deserves attention.

Text: We were seated and given menus.  After 15 minutes we had not seen wait staff or received drinks they had not even taken duo orders. Several of them were behind the counter chatting away but they didn't seem care to serve us!  We left and went to ponderosa next door they were much better!

Text: Good place to eat.  It was after lunch so the bar wasn't as fresh as it could have been.  Would have rated higher if food was fresh.  The staff was great.
