Text: I went in late in the evening looking for some food.  Most of the city had been without power for 16 hours earlier in the day and they were not only open but had a full menu.  The bartender (Chad) was very friendly and let me try some of the local beers on tap while I was also enjoying the local sangria.  I had a turkey wrap and it was HUGE!  I had a great time here and will come back if I ever visit the area again!

Text: The food was cooked well but lacked flavor in my opinion... My steak was tender but lacked flavor. My wife enjoyed her salmon but for the overall price we've had salmon just as good at places such as Chili's.

Text: Really great service food was average crab cakes had to much fillers not enough crab. Homemade Ginger Al was delish. The view of Lake Michigan spectacular!
