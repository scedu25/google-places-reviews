Hangar Movie Theatre
Rating: 4
Text: Probably the most progressive and genuinely enjoyable place to eat and/or be entertained. A few slight changes and substitutions would be good for the newer menu, but it is all prepared well and tastes excellent. I enjoy the fact that The Hangar is both a theater and a restaurant; how convenient to bring the dinner and a movie idea into one unit. My only complaint; there aren't enough movie options. I understand the theater has to pick films that will gross the most revenue, but there have been quite a few movies I've had to travel out of town to see (not that I mind getting out more frequently.)

Text: Great place to eat, and of course see a movie.
Rating: 3
Text: The food was a bit expensive.  The service as hit and miss.  The atmosphere is lacking because it is primarily a movie theater.

Text: Won't be back. Big mistake changing things. Awful. Slow service. Not worth the time or money.
