Text: BBQ and burgers and other bar grub, but done exactly right. This is a must stop. Great atmosphere, friendly folks. The kind of place you just want to do well. Food was awesome. Beats the pants off of any chain stop and most of the other mom and pop joints as well.

Text: We are on a road trip and needed a place to stop for lunch. They had a baby back rib special for $8.99, which included a side. We got a half rack and it was delicious! One of the sides we chose was the cornbread and it was amazing.

The iced tea was the best we've had on our 2 week trip.

They have homemade pie as well, I had the pecan pie and it was also very good, especially the crust.

This place is pretty close to Lincoln, NE and I recommend it to anyone who is nearby.

Text: We stopped at the Chez Bubba Cafe because we saw the sign on the Interstate and LOVED the name. What a beautiful thing to find the food absolutely delicious! I had the chopped brisket, slaw and sweet potato fires and my dad had the ribs, slaw and beans. Every last bite was incredibly good. If you are able to save a little room for dessert, I highly recommend the smoked chocolate cake. The atmosphere is casual, the restaurant is quaint and clean, and the wait staff is friendly & knowledgeable (thanks, Megan!).

Text: Brisket grilled cheese, burgers, onion rings, and fried green beans were all very tasty. The cheese sauce on the philly was not good and there was 3 times too much of it. But the atmosphere and staff were very friendly and attentive. Definitely worth a shot and we'll be back again!
