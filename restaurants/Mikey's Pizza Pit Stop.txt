Text: Good pizza, good breadsticks.  
Beware: new summer hours for 2017.  Pretty much 4-9pm.  
If you call the number on their Facebook page (their website redirects there), you'll end up placing an order with their Rochester store.

Text: It was nothing special the food's not good. Takes forever to get your food! Customer-service sucks and their prices are horrific. I don't mind spending a pretty penny on some good food, but with the prices they have for the quality of their food does not match at all!!! Don't waste your time there
