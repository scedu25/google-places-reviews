Text: What a delightful find in McCook! Had the lunch special, Cheese Ravioli with Meat Sauce, and a breadstick. I've had smaller dinner portions served at other places...and so delicious!!! Definitely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed.

Text: Decent food, for the region.  Friendly service.  Took good care of our group.   I'd go again but order something different than the mushroom ravioli.

Text: WOW! WOW! WOW!  So glad we stopped here.  We were passing through and were hungry.  Had passed several fast food places that just didn't sound good.  All of the sudden I saw a "Deli" sign flash by in my peripheral vision.  We circled the block and stopped in.  Oh...My...Goodness!!!  The food was so amazing that we planned the rest of our trip to make a stop for lunch on our way home.  Stop here, you will not be disappointed.  I wish I could give more stars.
