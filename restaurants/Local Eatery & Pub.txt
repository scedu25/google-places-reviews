Text: I have eaten lunch here for the past few years at least once a week. I really like what they offer and the consistency. Great food and fresh iced tea.

Text: I've heard of this restaurant from a number of local friends. Finally made it there to celebrate my sisters birthday. Everyone was really happy with their meals. Unique, tasty and local. My nephew devoured the kids grilled cheese. And hey, there are crayons to color on the table for the kids and kids at heart.

Text: Only reason it wasn't five star was the TERRIBLE service. Food was YUMMY and prices were really good, plus ambiance is nice. They also have nice gluten free options. We were there with a 4-top table after lunch and before dinner...We sat for an HOUR waiting to have our order taken then our food delivered. Tables that were seated well after us ate and paid before we got our food. Waitress purposefully seemed to avoid our table the entire time. I'd try it again because everything else was so good, but they need to make sure service isn't that poor.
