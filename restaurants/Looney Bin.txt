Text: The Looney Bin. Looney. Yup! Looney! You just did the most craziest things ever....you verbally disprespect an act you booked. Note to management- be very careful who you talk too. You never know who they are or what friends (or business ssociates) they may have. This just jeopardized all your future bookings. Totally unprofessional. Unacceptable. Outrageous. Looney! Yup. Looney. Don't disrespect the hand that brings you revenue. We'll take it elsewhere ... And we are! Your loss.

Text: If you want to see one of your favorite artists up close and personal, there is no better venue than the Looney Bin. Cramped hole-in-the-wall bar with the best people and atmosphere you will find anywhere.
