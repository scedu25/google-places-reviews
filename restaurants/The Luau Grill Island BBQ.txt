The Luau Grill Island BBQ

Text: Was driving by this and saw they were open. I have wanted to check it out since moving here but the hours are odd. Anyway...WELL worth the wait. The lady taking the order at the drive thru was nice as could be. I ordered 3 meat combo (chicken, brisket, and rib tips) w/sides and friend ordered ribeye sandwich w/sides. Also had a slice of key lime pie. Portions were nice (yay for leftovers later) food was fresh and hot. The seasoning is awesome as well as the sauces. The potato salad (I am picky about) was absolutely great and the cole slaw is a must have. The baked mac and cheese was nice and cheesy and not dry. If they are open-check them out. Only drawback is the odd hours.
