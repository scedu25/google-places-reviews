Text: The food is good. 
Atmosphere is Great! Especially if you get the table in the bay window!
Great place to side outside in the warmer months!
The coffee is hit or miss.
5 stars for Atmosphere and location
3.5 stars for the food. I do like the eggs Beny.

Text: Food was good. Service was also good. Only thing is I asked for different water twice because there was something in it all 3 times. I never ended up drinking any water because even the last time they brought me a new cup of water there was still stuff in it. Made me lose my apetite

Text: Delish! I love the variety of their dishes, the food is presented beautifully and it tastes great! The atmosphere is very funky and inviting. Certainly a place for brunch or just to meet up with friends and share a delicious ? meal ?. The prices are moderate and the service is great. I will definitely return. 

I returned to Toast for dinner, and I was not let down. It was a Saturday night, but it was not really busy. We sat outside which made for a beautiful night. The food was delicious, but I can't stop raving about their shrimp and grits! It was the best I've ever had, and I come from the south. Just phenomenal. They have a good menu and offerings. We will certainly return!

Text: Very long wait as this place is popular.  Service people very nice.  BUT the pancakes were terrible!  McDonald's has better tasting pancakes.  Mine tasted like they were left under the heat lamp for 30 min and unflavorful.  Bacon and other food was good if unspectacular.

Text: Great place for brunch! I loved the chicken and waffles - they came with a really good gravy on them. If you are given longer wait time for your table, I suggest walking around and visiting the cute shops down the street.
