Text: Our first visit and we loved it. Our waitress, Stephanie, was great and very knowledgeable. We ordered lasagna and a chicken dish and both were excellent. Lasagna was just liker my father once made. The desserts are also homemade.

Text: Our server experience was very nice. One of the ladies was in training so we had two waiting on us. The decor is very, very dated. The tables would look and feel a lot better without the old plastic table cloths. They were kind of grungy. Aside from the decor,  the food was excellent for the most part. The spinach and artichoke dip was one of the best I've ever had. I enjoyed the homemade chips, but I found what appeared to be two eyelashes on the chips. I'm not referring to the seasoning either. I made due because other than that it was delicious. I enjoyed a pizza. Another dish we enjoyed at the table was the grilled salmon which was said to be to die for. A few hiccups along the way, but it was still a place that I would refer people to dine in.

Text: With great food, welcoming decor and a friendly, hardworking staff, this is a great place to eat. Very tender and delicious steaks, the best resturaunt lasagna I've had in a long time, and big portions sizes. It's a nice place that serves high-class food but in a setting that makes you feel like a local friend. No need for dress clothes, just bring a big appetite and enjoy.
