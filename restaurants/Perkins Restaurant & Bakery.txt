Text: I do want to preface this review by saying I've only eaten here once as of the period of reviewing. I enjoyed the atmosphere, quiet and well lit. Waitress was very nice, helpful, not too loud or pushy, just the right amount of attention. Food was good, a bit better than I expected to be honest. I really enjoyed the blackened chicken. Baked potato soup was... Ok. Would definitely go back again. Sandwich was exactly what I expected which was a good thing.

Text: Bernice was our waitress.  She is awesome! Such a good soul. She is the kind of person that you wish was your next door neighbor. I had the steak tips with peppers. My wife had French toast. Our food came out quick and was hot! That never happens anymore. Mine was seasoned well and I used the bread to clean my plate. My wife had so much she took it home and finished it later that night.

Text: Some trouble with an order requesting no mushrooms... But overall a very fine dining experience for a reasonable price.
