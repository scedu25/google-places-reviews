Text: Nice enough waitstaff, but they're always out of smoked food if you're not there before 6 or 7. Very expensive for the quality, I personally am not the one that ever chooses to go there

Text: They have really updated. They have a great selection of steak House fair, tons of craft beers, smoked bbq, and a nice interior. I've lived in BC my whole life and can always remember Findley's being there. It has survived what most long living restaurants fall to: delapitation and cheapening of food without menu evolution. The menu is great, the steak House feel authentic. As a gluten free peep I was able to eat great food and drink good cider while ordering right off the menu.

Text: Atmosphere was good, food was okay.  The spinach artichoke  dip was a bit liquid, but that may have been due to the high temp and type of cheese. The bread that comes with the meal was wonderful, as was the raspberry iced tea.  I really loved the sweet potato mash with pecans. Unfortunately, the steak and lobster were just too dry - the chain should consider marinating certain cuts of meat. The lobster definitely needs to be seved with clarified butter.  The service was friendly and timely for a Friday evening. I would be willing to go back to try other dishes.
