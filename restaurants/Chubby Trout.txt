Chubby Trout
Rating: 3
Text: Lively is the key word here. Good sushi in an environment more like a basement bar. Cheerful staff and a good craft beer selection. Food presentation was ok. Overall a good place to go. Not fine dining but fun.

Text: This is the first time we have visited the new location. I was pleasantly surprised with how much better the food is. I had sworn off eating at Chubby Trout after repeated bad experiences at the old location. I hope they keep their standards high and their sushi fresh like they did tonight. We ordered a flight of their craft beers and I only liked one out of 5 but that's not a mark against them. Just my personal preference...which, by the way, was the barley.

Text: Food was great. Had the Chubby Trout, nice piece of fish, done perfectly, very tasty. The decor was really cool, lots of old barn wood. Would have been five stars, but our waitress was a little aloof about answering questions--didn't know how the green beans were cooked, didn't know if they sold pint glasses, and didn't offer to find out. But otherwise it was fun and we'd definitely come back.

Text: The food was excellent.  The atmosphere is terrific.  It is basically a reclaimed barn inside and is very well done.  The rating would have been higher, but for the service.  Everyone was friendly, but lacking.  The waitress on what appeared to be a rather slow night was MIA during most of our meal and hoping for drink refills was almost futile as when we needed some our waitress was sitting at the bar.  Someone else wrote aloof regarding service.  That is an apt description.
