Coody Brown's

Text: The outdoor seating is nice, so is the ability to pull a boat up to their piers and eat. I haven't eaten anything bad here. The open face prime rib special is excellent. People rave about the blue gill. It's really good, but pricey. The basket is $10 and it comes with only a few very small pieces and a little bit of fries and a side of slaw. The fish sandwich is small too. The tenderloins are really good. The nachos are big if you're looking for something filling, but nothing special. The steak and potatoe salad is also very good and generously portioned. If you're looking for breakfast, they have a weekend breakfast buffet that's tasty.  It gets a little busy here in the summer during busy times of day. Decent place to grab a casual bite overall!

Text: The atmosphere in this bar is great, music, happy people. There is a huge outdoor covered eating area right on the lake. Food and prices are fantastic, great variety. Salad bar with fresh, delicious choices to top your lettuce. Staff is attentive and on the ball, even with full capacity of 150. I love this place!

Text: Great little place on the river! If you are out boating you can stop in too! Owner very friendly and puts a lot of effort into daily specials. You even get to feed the fish and turtles off the deck, so a good place for the kiddos during the day.

Text: Great place to eat and go for a drink. If you’ve never been to Coody Brown’s before I strongly encourage checking out their deck that sits over the water. They have fish food to keep the kids occupied! Friendly staff, good food, a lot of fun.

Text: The food and service were great! It was my girlfriend's first time visiting there and we had a great time eating lunch on the channel and feeding the fish like we were young kids again. Can't wait to go back!
