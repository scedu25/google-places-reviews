Texas T-Bone Steakhouse

Text: Best restaurant in town. This was the first Texas steakhouse I’ve ever been to. My experience was really amazing. The service was really nice. And the steak was really well done. I didn’t know you could throw the peanut trash on the floor that’s really neat

Text: Great fries but my t bone I ordered only had a 2 bite tenderloin on it and mostly fat on my strip part. Alex was very polite

Text: This place is fantastic!!!
Better than Ruth Chris!
I am a big eater and the “Light” menu item was PLENTY of food. Had the 8oz Filet “Light” version and it was all I could do to finish it...for $21.99!

Highly recommend!!!

Text: My only complaint is I ate too much. The prime rib is fantastic. Fun Western atmosphere and a staff that is friendly and really cares about customer service.
