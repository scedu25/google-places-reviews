Text: I stopped by after work and picked up 2 dinners Togo. Food was spot on and worth the 35 minute wait. I live 1 hour away and when I got home, my food was still hot!! Awesome job guys!!

Text: Went out for dinner last night 09/05/2017. Santaniellos is ALWAYS usually good with there pizza that's why we go. Last night not so much!! Quality and the look of the pizza we got was sloppy and not a pizza we usually get. Not only did they get the toppings wrongs after the waiter confirmed our order twice, it was the thinnest crust pizza ever.  Owner came out and said our pizzas will look like he is because they are busy and the dough is fresh??!! Seriously?? The lamest excuse ever. Another pizza was made and was even thinner than the first. More cheese and toppings than the crust all the way around. Very disappointed with the owners "excuse" of the dough being fresh. How about more dough being used. Like I said this is the first time and we have been going there for years and never had any issues until last night. I would definitely think twice about going there and paying 20 dollars plus for a 12 inch pizza when you get poor quality like this!!! Jacks frozen thin crust pizzas havw more dough then the pizza given to us! Over priced restaurant!!! And I'm a local saying this

Text: After reading the reviews we were ready for some great pizza. It was mediocre at best. The shrimp Florentin was ok. The Cesar salad was not a Cesar salad in my opinion, had lots of blue cheese on it.
But service was excellent. 
We probably will not return.
