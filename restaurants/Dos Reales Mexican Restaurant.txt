Text: 5 star food 5 star margaritas 5 star service. Price appropriate. Go here, enjoy a good meal, but make sure you go for a walk to help digest what will be a large meal.

Text: Best queso dip anywhere! Service is incredibly fast and food is always flavorful. Only disappointing thing is that we don't have one near us! This is a must stop when we're in Champaign and it's always great to bring back a large queso.

Text: Food is great. I was a tad salty about the size of my Margarita tho. Pro tip: get the big one!

Text: First visit and it was awesome. I had the Burrito Green Chile and the pork was very tender and had a authentic flavor. Also Modelo on draft was a big plus! Will be coming back soon.
