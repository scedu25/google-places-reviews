Text: Sigh... I have gone to Thai Smile to sit down and eat. Was seriously impressed with serving sizes.Worth the price. Today was 1st time I ordered pick up. First off- Pad Thai was supposed to be medium hot spice. It taste as though no spicy seasoning was added at all. 2nd-I asked if I was receiving same size portion. They say yes-I say no. In summary- visit the restaurant because their food is really good. But I don't think I will place another pick up order

Text: A really great place with awesome lunch prices. I love the lunch menu because it comes with soup. The dinner portion is larger and without soup, but can be split easily.

Text: Thai Smile is a little hole-in-the-wall location with completely unexpected food, service and prices! They offer take-out options, but the restaurant is not a fast-food location. This is one of my favorite locations in town because their food is made-to-order and is exceptional!
