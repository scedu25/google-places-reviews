Text: I haven't gotten a bad meal here yet. Prices are fair, parking is cramped, seating is a bit limited inside but their take-out food has been excellent.

Text: Yeah, I'm really giving this place a two big thumbs up!
Haven't had any luck finding some of my favorite foods since moving to Kansas from Oahu.  The menu here is EPIC! The staff are friendly! 
We got our food quick considering we came in at the end of the lunch rush. 
Two lunches cost less than $15. Wife and I both really liked our food. Cooked to order, hot, and FLAVOR! Yes. Thank you. Plus, lunch came with soup which we are only accustomed to seeing at dinner. 

None of that bland, cold, reheated from a box, Buffett Food like those other Topeka places.

Text: For every 100 mediocre or bad Asian restaurants, you find that ONE that serves amazing food. In Topeka, this is that ONE! Place is incredible!

Text: I have always had a good experience here. I don't particularly like Americanized Chinese food after visiting China and eating the local food but this restaurant is run by a good family and I appreciate their business.
