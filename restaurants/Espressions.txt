Text: I frequent Espressions almost daily. What an asset to our town to have a place to meet-up for coffee or a meal. A little sign by the coffee calls this place the heartbeat of Aurora and I can testify that it truly is. I recommend the Turkey Herb Sandwich. The Parmesan Pasta is my favorite in the side rotation.

Text: The coffee is some of the best I've ever had. Burgers are good. The atmosphere is fantastic for a small town. The Esspresso Cyclone is heavenly.
