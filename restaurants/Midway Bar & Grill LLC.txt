Text: Service was a little slower than I thought it should be, considering they weren't packed. But, everyone was very friendly. Food was pretty good. We had quite a few folks at our table and everyone enjoyed their meals. I thought the fried mushrooms were rather watery for some reason, but I did see other things on the menu I'd like to try on a future visit.

Text: Great staff. Laid back atmosphere. If you are non smoking this is NOT your place. 
Daily specials, including a vegetable. Caesar salad was great. Wine selection is below par as is most off road places that cater to a different crowd. Overall, I enjoyed myself and would return. Madison K or Mindy will take fabulous care of you upon your arrival. Ask for them by name.

Text: Excellent service and food. Was visiting from Alabama. Fried chicken and cherry cheese cake cannot be beat.
