Text: It's a fast food restaurant, I get that. Shouldn't be expecting much as far as super good quality or amazing sercive.  3 stars because the cashier can't provide a simple thank you or acknowledgement when she gave our change back. Customer service is simple, really.

Text: This restaurant should not be allowed to operate. The health department definitely needs to shut them down. My burgers were not fully cooked we didn't get what we ordered and the clerk was rude when we told them the burger was not the way we asked for. Don't waste your money at Krystal's of London. I was there 12-12-16 at 5:20pm
