Text: If you want some GREAT authentic Mexican food to go! you got to stop here, Delicious barbacoa, carnitas, menudo,chicharrones, tamales and much more !  They make the best fresh made flour and corn tortillas in Kansas daily!  The customer service there was also AWESOME! I will definitely come back again Dodge City!
