Text: Food usual Jimmy John's quality, but service iffy.  Like they're doing you a favor a lot of the times.
Our fifteen year old granddaughter won't even come here if I mention it as an option as she felt treated badly on two other visits.

Text: Not the best Jimmy but definitely not the worst Jimmy. Good service but the Sammy was not put together the way I best like it.

Text: Bread was so hard, I feel I could really hurt someone if I threw it at them. We bought 7 for our employees who are working hard packing up shop due to the flood and they all complained of the bread being terribly hard. :(
