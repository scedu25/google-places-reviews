Pearl of the Orient Restaurant

Text: Stay away from this place! The owner forcefully grabbed my credit card out of my hand and charged me without my consent. Food is horrible! They claim "best, fresh sushi" worst sushi I have ever had. The seafood is old and fishy and the place is filthy. anytime you complain or bring something to the owners attention his reply is always "well I've been here for so many years" well times are changed. You can't charge people without their consent. Had to go through a whole process to get refunded. Worst restaurant I've been to in awhile. I cannot believe this place is in beloved rocky river. Buyer beware.

Text: For our afternoon date we were not sure where to go and we went to check something out nearby and spotted Pearl of the Orient. I had heard the name and thought it was over our budget but it turns out we were there during the lunch specials. We were treated politely and we're not rushed out at all. The food was prepared perfectly. We will definitely go back.

Text: The sushi is splendid. This is my second time coming here. They have specials everyday. The place looks really nice, there's an outside area as well. The staff are friendly. I'm slightly shocked that this place isn't more busy for the quality they serve.

Text: Frequent Pearl often.  Everything I've had is delicious and comes out steaming hot!  The bar is spacious and a nice place to dine.  Hope to be out on their patio soon.  The owners/management are gracious and present.
