Text: Food was awesome!  We did the grill your own option and had the New York strip.  They were very helpful with the tips for cooking it to your liking as well as explaining the options for sides.  They have plenty of seasonings to try out.  No wait and we went around 5:45 pm.

Text: Absolutely love this place!!!! My fiancee, son , father in law and I are all from Shelby township, out in paw paw doing work. We visit this place every single Thursday! Love the option to grill your steak in the grill room, un limited sides, tons of seasonings to choose from , and what friendly staff! My favorite employee is Ashley. She is so firendly and has such a smile on her face. My son fell in love with her ( he is 4) and talks about her all the time she was even so nice and made him this cinnamon toast drizzling with chocolate with a #4 on it for him and man it was good! Would completely recommend this place. My son really enjoys all the kids choices they have and are all under $7! Go try it out!

Text: Really enjoy this place! The food is great and you have the option of selecting and grilling your own steak. We would like to try that the next time we come. They also have entertainment some evenings. If you arrive at the right time, you might get seated at one of their swing tables

Text: Great grill spot.  Really like how you can choose your steak and grill it yourself. 

Would be even better if this was outdoors and you could choose your heat / smoke source.
