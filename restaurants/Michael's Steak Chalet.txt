Text: Waitress never asked how our meal was. Salads are tiny portions for what your paying for. The halibut was amazing but my husbands steak was chared black and super fatty

Text: Absolutely delicious prime rib, salad, bread and baked potato.  Prompt, friendly service.  Spectacular lake view dining outside.  By far our favorite restaurant in our 8 years of coming to the lake.

Text: Great location and facility.  Great salad, veggies and rolls. Prime rib was not prime, was most likely select grade. It was a bit tough.
