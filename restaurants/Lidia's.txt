Text: The never-ending pasta meal is always a go-to. They make the best ravioli I've ever had. You also must try the pork shoulder. The Caesar salads are delicious and huge - completely reasonable to split. Seasonal desserts and espresso available as well. We always bring out of town visitors here and they usually leave with a cookbook as well!

Text: Great service and amazing food. We had previously had bought Lidia’s sauce and was impressed. The restaurant didn’t disappoint. This is probably the best Italian food I’ve had in Kansas so far. I can’t recommend enough.

Text: Absolutely the worst service we have had. When we first stepped in, the host just starred at us, creepily without greeting us. The man next to him, which I would presume was the manager then rudely asks "do you have a name?" I thought it was strange considering it was lunch on a Tuesday and the place was about 10% full. I said I did not, assuming he was asking that I had a reservation. Then he barks back "just give me a name". He then sighs and takes us and sits us at the back right next to the wait station. Again, the place was close to empty. We were seated for about ten minutes without being greeted or having one word said to us. Finally, the waitress comes up to us, drops the bread down, quickly pours the water (with some of it splashing out onto us) and leaves without saying a single word. We wait for another five minutes without anything and decided to get up and leave. The entire staff seemed to be in a horrible mood and it was an extremely unwelcoming environment. It was one of the most bizarre dining experiences I have had.

This was hugely disappointing, considering that my wife and I enjoy Lidia Bastianich's show and cookbooks. Unfortunately, we will most likely not be back again and will not recommend it to anyone we know. There are plenty of fantastic Italian restaurants in town without the attitude.

Text: I took my daughter here for her birthday for Saturday brunch. Everything was amazing! The service was awesome! It's a little pricey but definitely worth it! Even the picky teen loved everything she ate (and usually that isn't much). I would definitely recommend it!

Text: This is my favorite restaurant. Period. This is for one simple reason. The food tastes fantastic. Forget the amazing location and forget the kind staff. All I really want to focus on is the fantastic taste of the food! 

One more thing... You can’t go wrong getting the pasta trio. Enjoy your visit!
