Text: This was the most welcoming, accommodating place I've ever visited! I got here super late, and still the staff seemed so happy to have me. Even when I finished my dinner after closing time, they offered dessert and coffee and told me to take my time. I can't say enough about the staff. The food was cooked perfectly to my requests as well. So good. I will make a point to stop here every time on my commute!

Text: Took my wife here for our 2 year anniversary. It was my wifes first visit and she said "It was the best steak she had ever had". I will agree with her statement. I have been here several times and they are the only place that can actually cook a steak medium rare and get it right all the way through. This is my favorite steak house by far.
