Text: I have only gone for the bowling and that is always fun with a group. There is food and drinks available for purchase while you bowl. Arcade is here as well with a ticket system similar to Dave & Busters. Events happen here which results in the place being closed at certain times, but staff and their website both post to make you're aware which is great. Staff is great and friendly.

Text: We had our daughters 10th Birthday party here and the kids had a great time! We had a party host and not only she was great but the  whole staff is very attentive. We were checked on many times which was nice having so many kids there. I highly recommend this place for a birthday party for ANY age!

Text: Great time. This was our first time. My son celebrated his birthday with a few friends. Everyone really enjoyed themselves. The staff was nice as well.

Text: We had a great experience here today for my son's birthday. The general manager (didn't catch his name) was so accommodating and let us sit in a party room free of charge since there was construction going on in the building and limited seating. He also kept checking on us and making sure we were doing okay. Of course all the games and bowling were as fun as could be!
Only downside was the construction, but the staff made sure we were taken care of!
