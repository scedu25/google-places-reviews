Text: My husband had a sandwich. He said it was ok. There was nothing there I could eat on my grain-free diet. 

It's also a store with unique sorts of gifts, but in some cases it's hard to look at the for sale items because people are eating in front of them. Also, some items seem to have been sitting the a while as they were kinda dusty it even sticky.

Text: Cute little place trying to provide a better coffee experience. The latte was good but we tried a Expresso conpanna which we could not drink. Pastries looked good but we didn't try any.

Amanda's also has a fun gift shop with lots of unusual things to look at while waiting for your coffee
