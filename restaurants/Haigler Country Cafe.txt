Haigler Country Cafe

Text: We discovered this little gem last year on our way back home from Colorado. This year, we made a stop for some of their delicious homemade pie on the way west and delayed lunch until we reached Haigler as we headed home. Their food is so good, the servers are friendly, and the owner herself welcomes you. We love this place. It's worth rerouting to enjoy the great food and down home feel at the Haigler Country Cafe.
