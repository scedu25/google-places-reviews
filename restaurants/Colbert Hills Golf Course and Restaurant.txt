Colbert Hills Golf Course and Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Great course, one of the most challenging I have ever played. The greens are FAST very very FAST. The elevation changes causes complex decision making throughout the round. The clubhouse, driving range, pro shop, and bar are all very nice. This truly is a 5 star course, I suggest you stop reading reviews and get a tee time as soon as possible.

Text: The clubhouse is very spacious and can run multiple different group functions at one time. There were at least three groups meeting while I was there. The thing most don't realize is the club has some really good lunch pricing. The food has been very good, both quality and presentation above average expectations. If it we're easier and faster to get to, this would be a 5 star review. With all the new development I missed the turn. 

I'm not a golfer, but I'm sure a person who does golf would find the memorabilia very interesting. If you are near the west side of town and hungry, give this a try!

Text: 100+ degree heat today and not only was there no water on the course,  all of the bathrooms were closed and not a single water fountain to be found.  Greens in rough shape.  Shame because layout has potential,  though not worth the drive from Metro KC.  Definitely NOT the best public course in Kansas, not to mention they advertised a special rate on their website but then charged full rack rates when we paid ($21.00 more)!  Doubtful I'll ever be back.
