Malabar Farm Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Group of 5 went, took awhile to get a server but he was very good, 3 people got burgers and they all were not impressed, very large and lacked flavor. My mother got the chicken pasta with Alfredo sauce and she absolutely loved it. I got the club, they brought it out wrong the first time but once they got it right it was awesome, Turkey and ham were perfect, the bacon was crispy and warm and the three pieces of bread were nicely toasted. Our waiter did bring out free dessert to make up for the sandwich and it was very very good tiramisu. Not worth the money in my opinion, won't be back.

Text: This place is top notch. The wait staff went above and beyond what was required or needed. I can't stress enough how good the staff is here. 

The food was really good as well. Had the fried mushrooms and they were really good. The sauce was okay with them, but that doesn't hurt to much. 

The price is around 20-30 a meal, not really a big negative as they make up for it in many ways, but something to keep in mind.

Text: Adjacent to the lovely L. Bromfield Malabar Farm, set in an historic 1820's brick home, this resturant could have been a more rewarding experience for the trendy and upscale pricing being offered.
The average food quality was quite well offset by the lethargic service. Once was enough for this old traveler.

Text: Beautiful place and the food was really good. The shrimp pasta was very creamy and tasted delicious. Service was good, but it took a very long time for the food and cheque to come.
