Text: $100 down the drain. ?I would never return to this place. Atmosfere is nice but food is horrible. Way overrated!! Bread looked like it was a few days old, chewy and dry. Wine we ordered was not in stock. Fish was dry and and very plain. Side dish from caned corn and black beans had no flavor what so ever. Do your self a favor, spend your time and money somewhere else.

Text: Excellent service. Good food, but not excellent. $70 ribeye (prepared medium) was about 8 ounces and arrived in slices and barely warm.
