Text: Despite the fall of many historic Omaha steak houses, this one stays going and with a force. I don't quite understand it personally. On the one hand, I think their whiskey filet is the best in the city, but they serve it with a bowl of corn at $46. You can go to the Grey Plume or Boiler Room and spend that kind of money with an amazing seasonal side with better wine choices and service. I truly think they are overpriced for what you get in return. 

What kind of premium price steak house will call their side "vegetable" and send you a bowl of corn? I just don't understand an owner who could allow that. When you buy a steak at close to $50 there should be a delicious, fresh GREEN vegetable side. There are sadly many places in town that still carry a following like this and fetch a premium despite seeking every way possible to extract the most profit out of their offering. I'd say go here once for a steak and then keep going. It is just way too expensive for everything past the actual steak.

Text: Very old school decor, which is nostalgic and delightful. No frills, amazing food. The prime rib with the whiskey glaze and cream horseradish was one of the best steaks I've had. And the cheesecake dessert was one of the best things to happen in my mouth in a long long time.

Text: Lunch was served quickly. Steak was tender and flavorful. Lighting is very dark though, hard to see your food. Old school vibe. Friendly wait staff

Text: Best steak in Omaha in my opinion and also the most consistently well prepared. I've been going with my family for as long as I can remember and they've nailed it every single time. No fancy frills here just great steak.

Text: I’m all for spending $$$$ when going out.  But $45 for a steak?  A sub par salad bar (Hyvee has a better one) and no real choices for side or starch.  We pretty much got 3 drinks $20 and 4bacon wrapped shrimp for $16.  Will never be back.
