Text: Nice, clean restaurant with good Mexican and American food at fair prices. Probably the BEST to eat in Ulysses Kansas. All the people are very friendly and attentive. You leave here full and they even offer vegan fare!! There is something for everyone ... a place the whole family is sure to love!
