Text: Went here for our wedding anniversary. The hostess and staff were very friendly. I guess I was looking for more of a romantic atmosphere and didn't find it here. When I Google searched "romantic restaurants near me", this was the 1st thing that came up. Food was mediocre at best. A little bland. For dessert I had a piece of chocolate cake, which was described on the menu as moist, but it was far from that.

Text: Had a good experience here all around. Owner was very nice and treated us  well. Server was tentative to our needs and very helpful with the menu. Food was very good and we watched our food being prepped and cooked. Will be back.

Text: Family owned & run, great Italian food, friendly place, open kitchen to watch the meals being prepared.  Really good wine list.
A definite stop when I'm in Columbus, OH.

Text: The food and atmosphere is absolutely amazing. Authentic, delicious Italian food. Great prices, great portions, great service. I would recommend that you call ahead for a reservation. If you don't call ahead, just go a little later in the evening and you might find a spot- especially if you are okay with sitting at the bar area.
