Mike Shannon's Grill Edwardsville

Text: The atmosphere is nice.  The food though was excellent as always.  Our waitress was pretty good, but not quite as attentive as maybe I would like.  It was pretty busy though, so that's understandable.  We've visited Mike Shannon's several times and I always enjoy the experience.

Text: Unfortunately this place looks nicer than it actually is. They were out of their name brand wine but were able to offer up anotger option. Food is not vegetarian friendly and what we did order came out at room temp and looked like a diner plating. Too bad bc the restaurant and patio itself are nice.

Text: Food, service, ambiance and location excellent. Pricing appropriate to the quality of the total experience. I would and have recommended Shannon's to any and all.
I especially like to take out of town visitors to Shannon's for the total experience.
