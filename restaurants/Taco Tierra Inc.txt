Text: Great food, hot sauces that are actually spicy. Pricing is affordable and staff is clean and timely. It's a wonderful regional staple. Top ten best places for good, affordable food. Can't say enough good things.

Text: This is a very busy little restuarant.  Usually has a wait at the drive through and inside. This may be 5 to 20 minute wait time. Product is fair. Pricing is reasonable.  Servings are a bit better than most.  They have a few dessert options.  It is a local favorite. People will make it a point to stop by when they are in town.

Text: This location is not the best, but it's still pretty good. Food is good, staff is not.

Text: I love Taco Tierra. It is usually packed when we go. I am willing to stand in line to get my favorite salad.
