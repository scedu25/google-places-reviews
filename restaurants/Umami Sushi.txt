Text: Well on Wednesday I called for a  reservation for Saturday at 6. Got there 5 till 6. They tried to seat 7 of us at a table that had 3 people sitting at it all ready. So that make 10 people no arm room. I asked to move the the table that no one was at.  We had to go round and round but we moved. Food was good. We finished eating and we're taking for about 2 minutes after the checks were payed a lady come up to the table and said YOU ALL NEED TO LEAVE THERE ARE PEOPLE WAITING TO BE SEATED. Wow I wish I would have had the check back I would have adjusted the tip for them. Last time they see me there!!! I will go to Louisville and or Etown to eat  hibachi.......

Text: If you are hungry and come here be prepared to lose your appetite 
I feel sick if I could give zero stars I would. Over priced for garbage
The food was absoutley terrifying looking.
I'm positive the miso soup was dish water because it was most definitely not miso soup. The owners are really rude when I told them my food wasn't good and to take it off the bill they would rather watch their customers in disgust. The waitress was very nice I'll admit, not the owners. Do not eat here for your own safety.

Text: The service was very good,  the sushi fresh and the soup, salad and teriyaki chicken with fried rice and vegetables was very good and served promptly. The owner came by our table to make sure everything was as expected. Very nice gentlemen who we have talked to many times before the restaurant got this busy.
