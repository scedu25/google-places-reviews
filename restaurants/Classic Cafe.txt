Classic Cafe

Text: I love everything about this place, so why only four stars? The only thing the Classic Cafe lacks is that one signature sandwich or meal. Portions, prices, drinks (good craft beer!) home made desserts and atmosphere make the Classic Cafe one of those spots you go back to. Don't expect a quiet evening of romance. This is hometown cooking and eating at it's best.

Text: We delivered prescription in Malvern Iowa and I decided to look up restaurants.  The town is only like 1300 people. Anyway we saw the great reviews and decided to eat there and we were glad we did. Awesome everything from service to the delicious food. They have a nice variety to choose from. My husband had the sw chicken pasta and really loved it. I had a chicken and mushroom Swiss melt on sourdough bread and it was the best chicken sandwich I have had.  Their prices are very fair and we will be going back! Thanks for the terrific food Classic Cafe!
