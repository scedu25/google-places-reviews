Text: My local brewery, and happy it is! Best beer in Crown Point is found here, and great pizza as well. You can find me on the great patio drinking half priced pints on Thursday nights.

Text: Poor service. We had to request refills several times (we were her only table ?), waited for over an hour for half our order, when our "server" decided to finally inform us that one of the ovens was out. The restaurant only had 3 tables, there really was no reason for the crappy service. Call in/delivery order or not.

Text: This place is perfect.  Good beer.  Good food.  Excellent staff.  It is small, which adds to the appeal.  Nice outdoor seating for the warm months.

Text: Easy growler and howler fills off I65 - less than 10 min detour.  Inside a pizza parlor.  Smelled good.  Good service.  Easy parking.

Text: One of my favorites in NWI.  Quiet lounge area with lots of room.  Beers are delicious and so is the pizza.  Sunday you get a XL for the price of a large pizza.  Nice place and I will be going back!
