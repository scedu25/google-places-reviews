Text: Rolls hard, chicken looked like it'd been sitting in water on buffet for hours, the potatoes were cold and tasted like poor instant potatoes. Would not recommend anyone eat here.

Text: $10 buffet for the driest pork chops and chicken I ever tried to choke down.  Dessert was no better.  Service topped it off with no drink refills.  Eat elsewhere.

Text: Enjoyed the hotel, décor and pool, but I have only one thing to say about this restaurant...there's a Denny's 10 minutes away and it's worth the drive!
