Text: My husband and I LOVE the Loaded Chips. This is meant to be an appetizer but it is so good, we can each order an order a piece and it's a meal. These are home made potato chips drizzled with cheddar cheese, shredded BBQ pork, green onions, black olives, sour cream and the sweetest home made BBQ sauce ever. You can order Jalapeños on the side if you like things really spicy. We order out every Friday night and the girls are beginning to recognize us. We are so happy they are back and pray their business continues to expand!

Text: The pork tenderloin was the best! You can add a rib or two to your meal. So I added one and it was delicious, moist and then. The homemade chips and cheesy potatoes were delicious too. Friendly service and super food.

Text: Off I35 we were looking for BBQ and stumbled on a fabulous find.  Local restaurant serving better than home made BBQ.  Sauces on the table were both sweet but the red carpet was hot too.  Not fast but crowded with locals.
