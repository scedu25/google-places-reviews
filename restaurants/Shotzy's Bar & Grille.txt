Text: We had a group of 13 Saturday night and our waitress Jaime took great care of us.  She was friendly and efficient.  Each ordered something different and she kept everything straight along with keeping water glasses filled etc.  Food was delicious with ample portions at a reasonable price.  We plan to return.  Jamie made it a fun & relaxed evening.

Text: The food here is phenomenal! The servers are super friendly and very knowledgeable. I only live 15 minutes from this place and just discovered how great it is a week ago. I have already recommended this place to several of my friends and family and I'll be going back very soon.

Text: Service sucks and they are so slow, it takes forever to get food. Staff are more worried about talking to each other or friends. Food isn't as good as it used to be. Atmosphere is nice.
