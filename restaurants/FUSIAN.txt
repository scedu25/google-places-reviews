FUSIAN

Text: I love the concept, and I will continue to patronize Fusian, but I tend to have large gaps between visits.  Why?  The prices are pretty high for what you get, and the sushi just doesn't feel that special.  I really like customizing my own roll, and I enjoy the seaweed salad, but I'd like to be able to rave about it.  I just can't.

Text: My boyfriend and I are from Detroit and were visiting and staying in downtown Cincinnati for the weekend. We wanted sushi and the closest place was Fusian. We don't have any locations up where we are from and had no idea what to expect. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and very helpful. We loved the sushi and experience so much that we went to the Dayton location on our way back home Sunday afternoon. I would highly recommend Fusian to the point where my boyfriend and I would LOVE to have one open up near us!!

Text: This place is really top of the line. I bring my co-workers with me here any time we are working in the area. Great tasting food, excellent service, and a reasonably scenic location.

Text: Make your own sushi. Tuna and salmon are both good choices.

Text: The GM Kat was amazing!!! She is very knowledgeable and so very helpful, our family had not experienced sushi prior to our visit. She was able to put together rolls that were appealing to us all!! It was delicious! Thank you Kat and fusion!!
