Varsity Club Restaurant & Bar

Text: This is a cool little college bar to see while you are visiting OSU. It has some character and I'm sure a lot of local followers. The food was amazing! Pizza was cooked perfect and cheesy with a nice crunch of the dough. Great atmosphere with the NFL Sunday games going to include Cinci vs Cleveland rivalry. Could have had the sound on for the big game but still a great place. Service was good even with several kid parties in the dining room. Could have used another staff member or two but our server did a great job keeping up with us.

Text: Quite pricey for the location and food type. Typical bar food at about double the price that is usually expected. Ambience is homely and interesting.
