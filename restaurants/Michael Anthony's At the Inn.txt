Michael Anthony's At the Inn

Text: This is a great fancy place I like to dine in after a long day of work when I'm in town. Servers are amazingly attentive & friendly and food lives up to the standards. 

Their wood fire pizzas are delicious but my go to will always be their Athens Chicken- wood fired chicken with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  Too amazing and my words wouldn't serve it justice, so definitely go if you're in the area!!

Text: Service is excellent and first class. Had the sweet lamb chops with rissoto and asparagus that was out of this word.  Great place to sit down, take your time and enjoy a relaxing evening.

Text: This and the hotel are hidden gems.  Never had a bad meal or bad experience.  I will be returning very soon if not just to eat to stay as well.  Thank you to the Inn and Michael Anthony's for a unforgettable weekend.
