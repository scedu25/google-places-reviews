Text: A major disappointment. We had a “special occasion” to celebrate - went for the “premium” Barbecue night (Saturday). Paid $39 total for 2 with the soft drinks not included and cost another $2.50 per person over the $15.99 meal.  What we got was an 8 ft Salad Bar and an 8ft Steam Table. The “Barbecue” consisted of 1 tray on the table that had 3 BBQ pork ribs. That’s it! Nothing more. Most dishes were floating in their own fluid - Beans, Corn, Noodles – nothing dry except the fried chicken and white-fish. The signboard in front said that Clam Chowder was available. The waitress said they only have Chowder on Friday - no one had bothered to update the board from the previous day. For that amount of money I can honestly say that I was expecting something much more elaborate for eats. I’ve had a better selection at EVERY buffet that I’ve ever been to and for much less money. This place is a real racket.

Text: We go to Gasthof every few months to get their breakfast buffet and meet up with family. The food and service have always been amazing! It's a little out of the way but well worth the trip!

Text: We went there for lunch and had the buffet. Food was FRESH! Chicken was delicious. Everything was warm. Dessert was out of this world. I would highly recommend this place. Great job!

Text: Went for the holiday bazaar. It was very disappointing. However the restaurant was fantastic. The hostess and server we're both great. Well worth the money and the drive.

Text: Very nice rooms and service at the motel. The village was great. There were a few shops to walk through and two flea markets with unusual items we couldn't find any place else. The people that live and work there are extremely nice and helpful. I highly recommend visiting if you've never been.
