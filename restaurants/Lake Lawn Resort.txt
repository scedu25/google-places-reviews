Lake Lawn Resort

Text: All I saw was the Spa area and it was completely beautiful. I went on a class trip for my beauty school and I have to say the facilities were amazing. And the prices were extremely fair for a fancy resort. I'm so excited to go there on vacation soon. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. And the grounds were just gorgeous

Text: I stayed overnight at Lake Lawn Resort scout the location as a potential venue for my wedding. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The rooms are rustic but very comfortable and clean. The rocking chairs on the porch are a wonderful touch. We ate at the bar restaurant and the food was good. Service was quick and the Friday night karaoke provided great entertainment. The next day I went on a tour with the wedding specialist and she showed me all of the lovely potential locations for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. I couldn't be happier with my experience at Lake Lawn Resort and I am excited to have my wedding there next year!

Text: Here for a lovely wedding in a relaxed location. Italian style buffet that was delicious. Comfortable rooms that include a mini fridge and outdoor patio. I was particularly impressed by the waterfall shower and extra deep bathtub with jets.  Variety of restaurants with lake views. My one dissappointment was when going to the vending machines in the middle of the night for a bottle of water, all of them were sold out of all products. I might suggest restocking more regularly, but other than that we had a pleasant stay.

Text: We've been going her for decades. We love the grounds, pools, work out room, frontier restaurant is wonderful, the Lookout is great for poolside, or drink and watching sports, and good food. We had some issues with our room this time. But the desk personnel took care of it beyond great!!!. Thank you for making our end of summer Fall get away fantastic.

Text: Very nice facility. Helpful and courteous staff. Was there for a wedding, so can't comment on guest rooms. Wish it was a little easier to find your way around! So many doors, and most don't look like a main entrance to anything. Walked around outside for a while until we saw someone we knew.
