Text: Fantastic restaurant. The food is amazing. My dining partner vouched for the authenticity of the cuisine and everything was really delicious. I got the special (duck) and a glass of Shiraz - absolute perfection.

Text: Food is always very good. Drinks are heavy pours. I would recommend the mike's special. You get a lot of food for the price.
