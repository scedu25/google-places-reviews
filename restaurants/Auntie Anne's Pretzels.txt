Auntie Anne's Pretzels
Rating: 1
Text: Over priced and poor service. The person in front of me asked for a water with his order and was told they only sold bottled water and that if he wanted free water he should go to Starbucks (which is right next to their store in the mall). This  non-customer centric approach to business is pathetic.
