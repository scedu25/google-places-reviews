Text: We had the beer town, I highly recommend - it was delicious and huge.  and the buffalo wrap,  my boyfriend didn't think it was that spicy. We tried the pineapple and blueberry creme beer and both lie the blueberry creme,  very good. Prices are  high, but we were lucky to have a coupon. Great location and decor. If you've never been, you'll like it and not be disappointed.

Text: I didn't have food here but had a good bar experience. The homemade root beer makes some amazing cocktails (only $5 or $6 too). I also enjoyed the $12 bourbon flight. My only complaint which reduces my rating is that the bartender didn't seem interested in helping me choose bourbons I'd like to try. When i said i was unsure of what to order he just gave me 3 at random without asking me further questions.

Text: The staff was welcoming and attentive. The beers on tap were great. Ordered the Black & Tan Mac n cheese, it was amazing. Slightly spicy too. Girlfriend ordered the salmon burger which was also amazing. All and all it was a great experience all the way through!

Text: A brewpub in the heart of Kalamazoo. They have a medium sized draft selection, but it's all very good. There's a glass wall on the left side of the building that separates the brewery from the restaurant. Very cool if brewing interests you! I go for Euchre on Wednesday nights.

Text: The Guilty by Chocolate dessert is by far the best dessert . The $5.00 price is a great value for it . Enough for a few people to share !
