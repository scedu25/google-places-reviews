Text: Excellence... staff is extremely polite..  gotta wait on food.... yup... BUT... it's very fresh...the decor is very complimentary also...
If your out to impress.... this is the place to go...  if your out for yourself... it's a very affordable treat... 
Don't come to Cape Girardeau and not stop in... and to the owners and staff....
Thank you... top notch service I would expect to pay a lot more for....   ?

Text: My favorite pizza, I have been in the pizza business for over 20 years and live 4 hours away, but still go here every time I visit Cape. Friendly staff, great service.

Text: Got to be one of the most classiest pizza places I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. It's got good food and a friendly staff. Although the place has a bit of a wait for food, trust me it is worth it. Perfect for the college  crowd and families. I suggest the meat extravaganza thin crust

Text: Nice place, family atmosphere, good service, BUT, they've lost that famous Pagliai's taste when they switched owners
