Text: What more can I say in a positive way that hasn't already been said.  The pizza is outstanding.  The crust really makes the pizza.  I like that there isn't a lot of sauce.  We were able to substitute items that we didn't want for other items we wanted.
One thing that would improve the "upper deck" area would be an elevator.  It is difficult for those needing some type of help to climb stairs.

Text: I am from Chicago and My wife and I drive here just to eat this pizza. It is one of the best thin crust pizzas I’ve had. Come for the pizza and stay for the town and the amazing sunset over Lake Michigan. They make all kinds of amazing pizza flavors and combinations.  I don't know what they do to the sauce or what is so special about the cheese but the flavor is just incredible.

Text: Fast, friendly, and vegan options!! I am vegan and my family is not. They wanted to get a slice of pizza and sit at the park benches. I was able to duck in the restaurant to check out the menu and lo-and-behold a vegan and gluten free section! I got the hummus and pita bread and wow! It was tasty!! 2 of the hummus were spicy and the third one was dill. So, a nice variety, excellent quality. And the summer kids there were really nice, FAST, and friendly. Many thanks! You saved the day for me :)

Text: Food was amazing as always. Sever was great as well.  We sat in the upstairs lounge.  The hostess didn't smile once. Looked like she didn't want to be there.  She had resting (B) face. . For real.  Then she came to our table 20 minutes after we were there and said we has an hour to eat because there was a 4 o'clock reservation for our table.  How rude! Then don't sit us here in the first place. We told her to not tell us tell the kitchen they are the ones cooking our pizza. Other than her unpleasant self. We will be back.

Text: Lots of cheese little crust. Our friend recommended this place to us.  The family loved the pizza the boys ate a pepperoni and ham Pizza. I cannot eat gluten and my daughter cannot eat dairy so we ordered a gluten-free pizza with vegan cheese and pepperoni. It was very good and didn't make  me sick the next day , so they did a good job. The only thing is that I wish I would have gotten less cheese on the vegan pizza because I'm not a big fan of that type of cheese. It was still good though just too thick.  The gluten free crust was thicker than any I've had and had good flavor and crunch. We would definitely go again but have to save up our money.
I almost forgot that the fresh sauce was great although I just saw on the website it does have some cheese in it. It wasn't enough to mess with my daughter though. I just thought the sauce was delicious.
