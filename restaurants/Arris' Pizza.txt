Arris' Pizza

Text: I make this quick and simple. Everybody and their mother this this place is a god send. While they have good food, I disagree. The pizza is not the best but they have some other good items like wings and sandwiches. 

It's great due to being a non chain joint. They do have good water, I mentioned the water cause some places have river water on tap. Which mean you night be forced to choke it down or order a 2 dollar drink.

Buffet is ok, it does get busy on weekends to be aware. Try it out!

Text: Lunch buffet looked well used, and the bathroom wasn't as clean as I'd love to see.  No falafel.  Gyro was dry and the sauce was sour.  It's pay at the counter.  It was budget friendlier than quality.  If you're on a budget I recommend lunch here.

Text: This is a neat place with great food at very reasonable prices. The kids split a large pizza, I had the gyro sandwich and my wife had the unlimited salad bar, all for about $30. The pizza was good. My gyro was fantastic and stuffed full of meat. My wife was very happy with her salad too. We will return to this place when we come back to Jeff.

Text: Always good been going there since the early 1960's.  Have always received good service and food. In the early years they were only open Friday and Saturday nights.  People used to go to the Capital theater and before the show was over would call and order a pizza and after the movie was over the line for pickup orders reached to the post office. My son and his family have been regular customers since the early 1980's!!
