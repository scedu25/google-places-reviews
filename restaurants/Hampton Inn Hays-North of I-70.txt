Text: Upon walking into the room it smelled like pizza so we had to request air freshener. Our keys continuously kept deactivating (they were not next to credit cards or cell phones). In all we had to make 5 extra trips to the front desk just to get back into our room. The grout in the bathroom was supposed to be a beige color but it was black on the majority of the floor. There was hair in the "clean" shower mat and white powder on the carpet that goes up the bottom of the wall. The walls had brown and black grime on them. They really need a better cleaning crew. I do have to thank Eric at the front desk for taking care of the people running around above us after 11pm. We definitely will not be staying here again on our way thru Kansas and I would highly recommend no one else do so either.

Text: Soft, comfortable beds and rooms are well-sized. Only reason for 4/5 is because a lot of the metal/chrome like the shower faucet and fire extinguisher nozzle etc were covered in rust. Breakfast is good and plenty of choices to and have comfortable chairs to sit on. Friendly staff
