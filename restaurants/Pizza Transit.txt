Text: Seriously THE best pizza around! Sarah’s staff is excellent, the atmosphere is so quirky and fun with plenty to look at while you wait, and Sarah is truly amazing. She supports and gives back to her community in sooo many ways! Niles is lucky to have her!

Text: Best pizza in the area hands down! We called on our way back from Kentucky because there can be a wait, so order early. It was a 1 hour wait so just tell them the time you want to pick it up and it will be ready. They have an online app to order with as well that allows you to schedule, this was the only drawback I found, you can only use it if you're paying with a credit card.

Text: Great food, reasonable prices. We love to go on Wednesday evenings in the summer as the town shuts down for a car show. It's nice to order, look at the cars while we wait and pickup yummy food.
