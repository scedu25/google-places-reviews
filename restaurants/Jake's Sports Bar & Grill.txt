Text: Can't wait to be back in town next week and meet friends and family at Jake's. Everything I've tried is great but my absolute favorite...Jake's Platter. Top that off with an ice cold beer and great company and it will be a great evening.

Text: I found this place to be very run-down. Service was the best it could be since there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant. The homemade ranch was good, but the rest of the food was just ok.

Text: We were in a hurry--had less than 45 minutes from walking in till we had to be somewhere else across town. When the server came to the table for our drink order, we told her, and I mentioned that we were in a little hurry, so gave her our food order, as well. Within 3 minutes we had our drinks, and within 10 minutes, we had our sandwiches, with plenty of time to spare before we needed to leave. And she brought us the bill right away, as well. Good food, great service. When I'm in Blair, I'll stop there again.
