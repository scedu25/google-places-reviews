Super China Buffet
Rating: 4
Text: Very delicious, as Chinese buffets go. Best to hit early and/or when busy for freshest selections. The pepper steak often has disproportionately too much onion which is only exacerbated by people like me picking through for the good stuff. Beware of the raw jalapenos on the salad bar. They are VERY hot.

Text: Felt as if I was hitting the buffet at the end of the day. Several items were out, or nearly gone, and the egg drop soup had sat long enough to start jelling. Not bad, but not great either.
