Text: Absolutely disgusting.  Wait staff barely speaks English. "Hibachi" grill is laughable in both offerings and skill.  If you're looking for a quick case of diarrhea and indigestion please waste your money on their high priced "buffet".

Text: Great place to get a fantastic meal of your choosing and size.  Inviting, clean and welcoming staff seats you immediately while the aroma of all of the different variety of foods makes your stomach growl for its fill.  Loved it.
