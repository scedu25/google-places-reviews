Text: Stopped in to visit some family. They have a good selection of craft beer. The service was good. I had the buffalo chicken wrap which was good. While there's nothing bad to say, I felt that it was just another chain restaurant. If you want good food, this is a great place. If you're looking for an amazing experience of dining and food, this is probably not the place for you.

Text: Good food, cold beer, good prices,  great wait staff. The downside is you have no idea by the outside of the building what the heck it is.  There is an empty restaurant next door.  When you walk in the first door you are kind of in a hall way.  One door might lead down to some kind of adult type mens club.  Not sure never walked down or even know if it's open. Then you have the bar.  It's a sports guy's dream.  Every table has two big screen TVS with every sport known to man on it.

Text: Good food and fairly priced but loud environment.  Would also be nice to have more rooms.  I would highly recommend this place.
