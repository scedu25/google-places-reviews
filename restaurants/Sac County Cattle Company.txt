Text: Food was good but service was terrible. It wasn't the waitress' fault, they just didn't have enough help. I asked for tarter sauce and butter and never got it. Most of the people in my group never got a single refill on their drinks. I will not go back again.

Text: They have great steaks at a great price! I've never ordered a petite ribeye that filled me up until now , most people will be able to make 2 meals out of it.And if you order the dude portion , you can probably get 3 meals !
Also great service! I can't comment on any of their other fares , although I am sure they are excellent!
