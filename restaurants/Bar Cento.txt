Text: Dog friendly with an indoor section! Amazing burgers cooked just right, fresh ingredients, great fries, and very friendly service. Great beer selection, and the mimosa was made with fresh squeezed OJ. Will definitely be back!

Text: Went here on a Wednesday, not busy. Told we could sit anywhere (outside). Tables were dirty, waited over 5min for water from hostess then another 5 min b4 server came over, he did thank us for waiting.  Ordered drinks and dinner- a beer and a fancy drink- waited another 10 min for drinks.  The server was kind and polite but seemed that he was not experienced or not trained for this type of restaurant. Our group had Beet salad, burger, and charcuterie sandwich.  The beet salad was tiny. The charcuterie sandwich had about 2 ounces of meat and both the meat and bun were charred beyond "grill marks". We had been here once b4 on a Sat after an Indians game and had better service and normal portions.  Sad when businesses feel they are guaranteed business and don't work for the patrons.  I don't recommend this place.

Text: Ordered takeout after being recommended to get pizza here. The staff was rude and seemed bothered by our being there. We ordered a house salad and literally got a takeout box of lettuce... Nothing else. Just lettuce. The pizza and specialty fries were mediocre at best as well. Definitely not worth the price. I don't understand the hype around the place and would recommend going anywhere else before stopping here.

Text: Worst service ever. The red headed host/server who did not offer his name, never asked for our drink order. Then we waited quite a while for our food. My meal was luke warm cold and missing part of it and my mother never got her meal when she was the first to order. The server put the order in blaming it on my mother for not ordering when we all saw him write it down. The rest of us, even though we ate slowly finished before it came. We ended up cancelling the order and my mother went went without a meal. Definitely not worth the fancy atmosphere for less than mediocre food and terrible service.
