Text: We usually come here for the food. Have great options and the food has always been good. Nice selection of drinks to choose from. Has many TV's to view whatever popular sports are on. Also has pool table as option for entertainment. Occasionally we will order carry out and all of our food has been ready and the estimated time that they stated on the phone. Would definitely recommend this place.
