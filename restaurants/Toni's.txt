Text: Amazing, flavorful food! Quick service! John our waiter was awesome and very personable. He provided us with excellent recommendations. My husband and I enjoyed the homemade crab cakes, soup, fresh salad, stuffed pasta shells and butternut squash ravioli in balsamic sauce. Place is clean and quiet.
We found Toni’s during our travels from Galena into Rockford off Highway 20!

Text: Food was quite bland and very slow to come out. Our waitress seemed very busy and unable to be attentive to her tables.
