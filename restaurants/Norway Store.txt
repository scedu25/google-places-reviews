Text: One of my favorite stores!  I love the emphasis on Norwegian culture and fare.  The restaurant, where we had breakfast, was superb.  I had French toast and loved it.  And the store is huge, with so much variety.  There are always special types of food on offer.  I also liked the history of the store and the Norwegian community of the area - a history proudly displayed via mementos on the walls.  Definitely a place not to miss!

Text: Unique store and restaurant with a great variety of specialty Norwegian and Scandinavian goods. Cozy atmosphere with lots of cool vintage decor, old wood plank floors, and lots of history. There was even a barber shop inside the store at one time. Worth a detour if driving by on I-80.
