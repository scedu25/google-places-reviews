Text: We just had a vegetarian buffet in Taj for dinner. wasted our money.
pretty bad experience - tasted like stale food..
not very good quality
I went in the evening for buffet dinner and they served same food left over from the morning buffet . We usually go to taste of India and wanted to go to Taj for change. It was really disappointing.
When I said to the owner he did not respond well.
Also not sure why the evening buffet costs more then afternoon one.

Text: Good Indian food and friendly waiter. I agree with other reviewers, the interior could use some cleaning and upgrades but the food was worth coming back for in my opinion.

Text: Wonderful restaurant and people. We ordered food for a college event of 100 people in Ames. Their rates, variety and promptness were commendable. Food came right on time, fresh and hot.
Though Ames is 2 hours from cedar rapids but still they charged nominally for transportation. Their food made our event a big hit. 
In the radius of 2-3 hours of Ames, this is the best Indian cuisine restaurant for delivery and buffet.

Very thankful and best wishes.

Text: Not only is the Taj Mahal a restaurant, but the left side of the building is also an Indian grocery, which had everything I needed for Indian dishes that I had a tough time finding elsewhere around the city. 

Pros: 
Fairly large selection for the amount of store space there is actually there. Decent amount of fresh vegetables (including things like curry leaves etc).

Cons:
There was only one person working the register for both the grocery and the restaurant which made checkout slow.
