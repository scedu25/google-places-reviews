Text: Service was great. Presentation was good. Food tasted very good, but, less than an hour later, I was lucky to find a bathroom.

Your Kobe burger came back out. Lost my underwear and was Totally embarrassed on a first date. Do I need to say more.

Text: EDIT: Is it me or did their food get kinda gross and significantly more expensive at the same time?

One of my favorite places in Ann Arbor.

The beer is okay, but it's a really fun place. I just wish they still had the pineapple chicken quesadilla!

Text: This is my favorite brewery in town. The food is good. Brewery Stake Sandwich is a must try. There's outside seating that allows dogs. If you need a table for a big party on a short notice, they can accommodate that. Staff is always great!

Text: The food is so good. Nice beer selection, too. Kind of a crowded atmosphere, but doesn't deter from the experience. Great for meeting friends for lunch.

Text: Last minute decision to come here because of a particular menu item, and we weren't disappointed! The servers were extremely sweet and helpful with our 10 month old and the food was perfectly prepared and not your standard brewery fare (though I'm sure you could get that if you wanted)
