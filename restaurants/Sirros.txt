Text: A great! place. The waitress was especially friendly, knowledgeable and personable. In fact the entire staff seemed happy. The food was delicious and reasonable. My wife loved her sammich, my son gobbled up his big burger and loved the specialty fries, and I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the salad bar (however I would have liked some home grown tomatoes).

Text: Disappointing and over priced. The food is so-so, you definitely pay for something you could probably cook better at home. Gave it several chances to negate going in at the "wrong time", but to no avail. Service is slow and the food is lukewarm when arrived. If you don't appreciate good food, you will probably enjoy this place.

Text: Lunch!  Absolutely the best onion rings I've ever had!  The burger was fantastic and Turkey and cheese with bacon melt was delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try the pizza :-)

Text: Great food with lots of choices from the menu that sounded delicious. Service was a bit slow, but we did come during the Friday night dinner hour. Nice ambience.

Text: Another of several great esting options in a quaint town. Reasonable prices. Many delicious options in the menu. Free wifi. Very friendly staff. Wanted to have stayed in town longer to come back.
