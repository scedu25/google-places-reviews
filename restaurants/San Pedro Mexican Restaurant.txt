Text: The food was good with the highlight being the salsa that came with the chips.  I did ask for a side of hot sauce and what they brought me was milder than what I already had.   The service was incredible and very accommodating.  I will give this place another try.  Hopefully the food will be better and we just caught them on an off night.
