Text: The description of the food on the menu was no where close to what I got. It was supposed to be grilled chicken but tasted like shrimp and had bits of what looked like hot dog. It was supposed to be stuffed with rice and beans and grilled chicken along with mushrooms peppers and onions. No peppers, a tiny spoon of rice and half a teaspoon of beans. There was also no Pico  as was advertised on the menu. The waiter said he could bring me some more rice or maybe beans... Yeah that's gonna fix it.  The salsa was just tomatoes out of a can pretty much.  The other person said her food was tasteless and was also disappointed. We won't be back.
