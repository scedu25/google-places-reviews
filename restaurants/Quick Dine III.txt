Text: My wife, some friends, and I tried Quick Dine III yesterday. It was ok.  It was a little dirty, sticky tables, messy floors.  The food was ok.  The Chinese food was passable: good Crab Rangoon, everything else was fine.  My friend's chicken fried steak looked and smelled delicious. 

There was a hair in my wife's food.  This happens, but there was no apology and nothing deducted from our check. We paid our bill, and won't likely hurry back.  If our friends want to go, I'll try something off the American side of the menu.
