Smitty's Carry Out

Text: If you want a great old fashioned burger...this is the place. I'm originally from Kansas but have been living in the NYC area for over a decade and don't make it back home often. I stopped here with my wife who's from NJ as we drove through town and were looking for lunch. She said (and I agree) it's better than any burger she's ever had. If I remember right they source their own high quality beef you simply aren't going to get anywhere else. Good stuff!

Text: I use to love coming here but the last couple of times have been very disappointing. This time I ordered my food and decided that I wanted to order one more thing after I paid, the lady told me it was too late to oder something else have have it come out on time. I didn't care about that I wanted something else also. So rude. Then to top it off one table was dirty not a big deal but when I asked if they could please wipe the table off, she threw the rag on the counter and walked off. They are  So lucky the place was busy, I'm not one to be quiet at all. It wouldn't have been,so bad if there wasn't 2 girls at the counter and one was just on her cell phone. Sad to say, I'll never be back.

Text: Good burgers and home cut style fries. Small place but the food came out quickly and it was very tasty. I will go back.
