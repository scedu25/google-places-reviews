Text: Good location across from the stadium. Restaurants within walking distance. Biggest hotel bathroom I've seen in a while! Large soaking tub and separate shower. Staff was friendly enough. Carpet in lobby, meeting rooms and hallways was worn and dirty. Carpet in room was nasty, stained and dirty. Mildew in shower. Cleanliness is one of most important things to me in a hotel, and this one needs some serious help in that regard.

Text: Excellent hospitality. Received a room upgrade upon check in and a personal email thanking us for our stay after we left. A few steps away from Busch Stadium, but no loud noise in rooms.

Text: This is the second year in a row we have stayed at this hotel for the Love Life Conference and I could be more pleased. The hotel has had a bit of refreshing since last year and is still lovely. Check in is smooth, the staff is friendly and very accommodating.The bath is very nice, and the visit to the Spa for a massage this morning was easy to schedule and really well done. We will definitely return.

Text: For $200 a night, I at least expected this place to be clean. But no, it's pretty filthy. I tried to add pictures of the filth but they only published my view photo...but let me tell you---the shower and bath were covered in mold, the counter tops had dust and hairs piled up in every corner, and the bed shams (the ones that touch the floor) ARE COVERED IN MOLD AND STAINS! I cannot stress enough how gross they were. the coffee machine was filled with a used coffee pod--who knows how long it's been in there! And the carpet has stains all over as well. Room 225. The view is great though--overlooks Busch Stadium and the Arch. Other than that, I can't say much. We stayed on a weekend when there wasn't a game or holiday--just a normal weekend in October--if that helps anyone.

Text: We were there last night, and have never been to an up scale hotel before....great valet parking, staff was great, great location if going to a game....however, walk-in shower leaks, calling for room service was easy but we never got our food. They have menu for before 11pm and after 11pm. For the before 11pm, menu items looked/sounded wonderful....after 11pm menu, only one thing sounded good. We tried to order from the before 11pm menu at 10:50...we were told we had to order from the after 11pm menu.....we did, and it never showed up. Upon checking out, we learn someone else had the same experience. Of course in the small print, they charge you $8 to deliver it and a 25% gratuity which of course we did not see until after we ordered food. The in room refrigerator had a lock on it but who wants to go back down stairs and get it when all we were supposed to do was break the tab..   They took off the valet parking which was great. Would I recommend this hotel yes, ONLY....if you are going to a St Louis Cardinals game.
