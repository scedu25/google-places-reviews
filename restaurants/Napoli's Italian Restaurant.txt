Text: The waitress was pleasant, but if I ever eat there again I will not order spagetti. I ordered it with meat sauce. It was HEAPING with spagetti noodles and very little meat sauce. It was not worth 8.95 for eating out.

Text: This was the worst food I have ever eaten at an Italian restaurant. These people give Italian a bad reputation. The pasta tastes as it came out of a chicken noodle can soup. The chicken was boild and the sauce was liquid. My wife had the "specialty sauce" the chefs tradition sauce that come from his ancestors is what we were told (lmfao) it tasted like tomato sauce with alfreado sauce mixed in it. But from a jar.  Don't waste your time or money. You will be very dissatisfied if you do.Thinking about this place I get sick! GROSS GROSS GROSS!!

Text: Workers were friendly and food was good. Didn't have to wait long at all since I already knew what I wanted. The only thing that was messed up on was the sauce for the dish which wasn't a big deal at all because it was still good and different.
