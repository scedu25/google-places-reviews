Text: Food was worth the wait, which was average I'd say. Steak sandwich is good and the 4 cheese garlic bread is better. Salad was great as well. Service was very friendly on the phone and at my door.

Text: Just ordered a Medium Taco pizza and a Barq's root beer. I've always loved taco pizza but I have to say that's probably one of the best I've ever had. Ingredients tasted fresh and there was actually a little bit of spice to it. I was pleasantly surprised. The spice could have been from the salsa not sure but 10 out of 10 on taste. Excellent pizza and fast service? $21.75 with delivery. Worth it! If you want mediocre Pizza for a cheaper price tag.. Go with the other guys. If you like quality for a few bucks more. This is the place to go
