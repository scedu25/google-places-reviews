Text: The place is cool. Great atmosphere! The service was good. Very attentive wait staff. My burger was just okay. My dessert however! That was probably the best bread pudding I have ever had! Amazing!

Text: We love this place, been coming here for years. The atmosphere is awsome and takes you back in time and fabulous outdoor patio to dine on. We love the craft beer also!

Text: Food mostly good, but pricey for what it was. Loud surroundings, so not good for elderly or hard of hearing.

Text: I go here time to time for lunch. The food is ok but they got rid of their lunch menu. So its a bit expensive for a lunch location. They also stopped having their home made chips. Their chips with bacon blue cheese dip was amazing. If they bring back their lunch menu I'd add this back to my regular lunch rotation that me and my friends go to each week. .
