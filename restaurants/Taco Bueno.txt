Taco Bueno

Text: Where to start. We have always enjoyed Bueno and we moved to a state that has no Bueno. We stopped at this location in mid-afternoon; wasn't really busy. The drive-thru lane got better attention than the indoor customers. It took 20 minutes to get our order. They never called our name because they gave it to the customer who ordered AFTER us. The worker behind the counter didn't seem to care when we told them what happened. Sorry, Bueno...we will not be back.

Text: Fair food, not much taste. Good value for the money. I like the salsa bar.
