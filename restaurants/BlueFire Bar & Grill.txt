Text: I bussed tables through a temporary service and the first day I started I wasn't even greeted properly... Just told what to do and start doing it. No hi, hello, how r u my name is..... Or nothing. I didnt even know there was a manager on duty until someone pointed him out. Funny thing is I saw him when I got there and he walked right by me looked at me and didnt even say hello. I took my break in the break room which served employees a free lunch but wasn't told about the free lunch only where to take break. I ate what I brought from home which was crackers while everyone around me ate a plate lunch. I asked when my break was over how much the lunch was they said free for employees. Lol, out of everyone in there eating no one bothered to tell me I could stand in line and get a free lunch. Its a very uncomfortable place to work. I didnt feel welcomed and they all were snobby except for one guy and the Korean lady that works there. I lasted a few days then was happy I found something else.

(Not mentioned at check in) Only solution offered at front desk was a restaurant 3 blocks away in the rain..Are you F$!×%&* kidding me !! Way to go Hyatt, nice customer service. 
Couldn't even get a cup of coffee in a hotel I was staying in. ..WOW, total FAIL..

Text: Find somewhere else. When we arrived at 11pm, the front desk said the kitchen was closed and gave us suggestions for other places to eat. The hours online for the Hyatt's restaurant that night were midnight and this is what we planned around.  Ok.  So, we walked around for 30 minutes trying all the bars and grills, found no place to eat on a Sunday, then returned to the hotel. We asked at the bar and the bartender said the kitchen was still open. We then spoke to the restaurant manager, she said kitchen was closed, but room service was available, but only if we put in our order within the next 5 minutes. Nobody knows what happening at this branch of a well established global operation.

Text: Took 45 minutes to get half sandwiches and salad for our table. It did taste good, but not worth a 45 minute wait.

Text: Good food, but horrible service. 4 bartenders on duty and it takes 20 minutes for someone to take your order!  I'd hate to be here in a busy night, lol!
