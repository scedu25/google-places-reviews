Parthenon
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent full-service Greek  Restaurant.  Family owned and operated.  Highly competent staff and a large dining space, including outdoor seating, a small bar, and a private dining room.

Menu is extensive, and includes both standard selections and daily options.  And before selecting a desert be sure to view the 2 cold cases with at least 20 options to see.

After 3 visits, I have nothing but praise for the Parthenon.

Text: Excellent food, friendly and attentive service, with reasonable prices. Everything I've tried has been excellent, but I've been eating their gyros and salads almost every week for four years, and still look forward to it every time.
