Text: I've been to this place a number of times when in the area. Always consistently excellent steaks and homemade soups. Steaks are consistently cooked perfectly to order. Service is very good also. Sports TV's in historic bar area. Be sure and read history of building on back of menu. Quaint place. Uf you are from a city, you'll love the prices.

Text: After an 11 hour drive we found the food descent, the establishment had a musky odor but the additional atmosphere was ok. The waitress was sweet but a little distracted..lol but a nice place overall.
