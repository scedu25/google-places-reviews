Text: I was happy to discover some good, fresh food as we were traveling through the area. Both my date and I were skeptical but pleasantly surprised. Small but good selection of draft beer and wine, great food.

Text: Wow! What a surprise we got the crawfish dip!, and the house salad, super fresh, I asked for a recommendation and she gave me two. The catfish and the bbq shrimp. Me and my coworker asked if we ordered both could we each have half. With a Pleasent Smile, they said no problem. Over the top both were super dishes. True Cajun deep flavors, melted on my tongue.

Text: Very unique dishes. I really enjoyed my blackened catfish and crawfish bisque. Many thanks to my super waitress who talked me into trying crawfish. If I was local, I would eat here again and again and  .  .  .

Text: Food is very good. Been here 3 times, the gator bites are well worth it. Love the crawfish dip, and they perfect cook a catfish filet. I have one complaint: When my fantastic waitress shared in small talk that she was just as hungry as I was, I was saddened when I heard the employee discount isn't very substantial. Every time I've been here I've been well taken care of, and would hope the employees are too.

I love Creole food. I'm going to keep this simple. 
This is the best place to go in jeffco for Cajun/Creole food.  Just a great place to hang out too. 
It's as close as New Orleans as you can get without being there.
