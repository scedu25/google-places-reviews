Text: Great food.  Good quality ingredients.  clean restaurant.  Fantastic service here.  I love being able to flavor my own soda!  The option for bottled beer is also nice. Prices are certainly reasonable for the size of the meal you get.  Can't miss with this place.  Highly recommend.

Text: Great food.  I only wish it was a little less expensive.   Moe Mondays helps (burrito and a drink for 6 bucks), but since I usually only drink water, it's not much of a savings for me.  There is another Mexican restaurant now in the same strip, so they now have a little competition.

Text: The burritos are really good, but they really need to work on customer service. You get rushed through the line an they barely give you time to figure out what you want on youre burrito then the cashiers are always rude as hell. The woman i dealt with today acted like i had the plague an half assed handed me my money, this isnt just a one time thing either it happens everytime. Guess thats why i only come in once like every few months.

Text: Long line due to inept cashier. Food was cold by the time I sat down. Hey Moe's get some kiosk stations, or some more registers. Sucks that I have one more place in this town that I will never go back to. Also, one of the line cooks was too cool to wear gloves.
