Text: This restaurant was fantastic combining my two favorite things, great food and beautiful intelligent women.  The batenders were both friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beverages they sell. I will be back.

Text: Surprisingly good food. Plenty of beer options.
Personally, I find their gimmick of frozen beer mugs obnoxious. Turns the beer into a slushy. Have to wait for the ice to melt to finish your beer.

Text: I usually have the fish tacos for lunch. They are very good. All of the food I've had here is very good. Usually I'm here for business, but I've been here for a night out as well. It's a good place to relax and enjoy a few drinks with friends. Waitresses are great, and very attentive.

Text: This is one of my favorite places. Everything from the starters to the entrees to the desserts meshed perfectly with my flavor-profile. I found the ambiance to be very charming.
