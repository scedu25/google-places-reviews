Text: Their aged rib-eye is one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. All of the meats here are incredible, as is their happy hour menu for cheap, high-quality food. Decent cocktails also but the food is the star attraction here.

Text: Very disappointing.  No ambiance and the chicken was tasteless.  I was hoping for a great, tasty experience.  I might be willing to try the beef one day, however due to the reviews.  Perhaps I should have read those reviews prior to ordering.

Text: Stopped in for happy hour and had the Roast Burger with rosemary fries. The bar menu was half price, you won’t find a better burger and fries anywhere at full price. Came back the following night for dinner And had the seasonal pasta, it was amazing!
