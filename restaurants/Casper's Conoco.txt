Text: Service was very awful! I was just trying to buy some breakfast and it seemed to take a long time for them to make it. So then, I asked the girls at the counter what was taking so long. They told me to "piss off". Very unprofessional service. I will definitely go to Break Time for now on.

Text: Stopped due to being out of drive time. Bathrooms were clean, as was the whole store, even considering it was a wet mess outside. Had the cube steak combo meal and my wife had the pork tenderloin sandwich and onion rings. We were both quite pleased with our meals. Friendly staff and no wait for service. Other than the gravel lot that was wet from snow/rain, this place was great.

Text: The service is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! Today was the first time I have ate at Chester's Chicken in Linn, MO and it will be the last time for me. I asked the lady at the counter what they had ready since I seen the workers still cooking. The lady replied very hatefully, "We have chicken!" I ordered five chicken tenders and five potato wedges, when I got home, I only got three of both. The city of Linn is a college town and a lot of the local restaurants give students a discount. NOT CHESTER'S!! Very low quality chicken for a big price. I'm very disappointed in the service. I would recommend Dave's Pizza and Wings or The Shack. I wish I could give them zero stars.
