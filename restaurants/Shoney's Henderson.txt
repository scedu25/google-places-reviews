Text: I got there with 30 minutes left on the buffet. The food was fresh and was kept fresh throughout my visit. Restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly. The only thing would be that the bathroom could use a little remodeling. Other than that, great place and will come back.

Text: Just had supper at Shoney's(Henderson KY) What a treat! Shirley our waitress took wonderful care of us she is very pleasent and helpful. Thinking about it, Shirley may have been one of our best waitstaff to date. Being on the road, coming into Shoney's and enjoying the down home cooking is comforting, calming leaving one refreshed and ready for the rest of the journey. Thank you Shoney's, Shirley and Staff. You all ROCK!
