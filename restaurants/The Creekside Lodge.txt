The Creekside Lodge

Text: Love this restaurant. Wonderful dishes reasonable prices.  Reminds me of several of the dockside restaurants I used to enjoy while living on the east coast. The menu is an all encompassing American fare.

Text: This spot has amazing outdoor seating. The menu is wide range. There is even a vegan veggie burger which is always a plus. We got the loaded fries and it was a generous portion and could have easily been a whole meal. We also got the catfish nuggets and they weren't our favorite. For 2 beers, loaded fries and a fish platter we paid $35 including tip. The staff was friendly and an overall enjoyable experience.

Text: We ate in the bar. It was a very relaxed and comfortable environment. Food came out fast. I had tilapia and my husband had the ribeye. Would definitely go back!

Text: Very friendly, courteous, and helpful staff.  Excellent food at a reasonable price.  Outdoor dining available overlooking the creek.  When we told our waitress we were staying at the Comfort Inn she gave us a 10% discount!

Text: Let me start with the positives, we were seated immediately, and the atmosphere inside was great, it really reminded me of an old lodge and made me think about what the building must have been before it became a restaurant.  The staff was attentive and friendly as well.

Now the cons.  The food was horrible.  You could tell it was strait out of the freezer, and a can.

I would not suggest going here unless you really want to be horribly disappointed in your choice of food.
