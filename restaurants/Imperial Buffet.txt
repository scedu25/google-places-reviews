Imperial Buffet

Text: Went with family to the buffet Wednesday night. I had to work the following day (Thursday). I was fine in the morning. I had to go back in later in the afternoon and I instantly started feeling horrible! I ended up having food poisoning. The sushi that I usually eat at the buffet tasted a little off. I didn’t think anything of it and to think about it, I should’ve known that it tasted old. I go here many times and this is the many of last times that I am going back. Beware of the sushi!
