the FDC

Text: This place has really made a great comeback! They have redesigned the interior and made it much more comfortable and spacious. They even added a nice outdoor patio area with an herb garden. At times a member of the kitchen staff will come out to the herb garden, pick out a few things, and cook it in your food. It's great to see fresh items on the menu. If you're stopping by Arcadia valley or just swinging by from visiting the Elephant Rocks State Park be sure to come to the FDC. Why go to a miserable fast food chain restaurant when you can help support a local family business!

Text: We were really looking forward to eating here and were hoping that it was better than before.  We were not disappointed.  The food and the service was EXCELLENT!  My husband had the French Dip with Onion Strings and I had the Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes/Gravy.  Everything was delicious and we loved the atmosphere.  Our waitress, Cassie Sutton was the sweetest thing.  She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. She checked on us often and offered to put our drinks in to-go cups which was really appreciated since it was such a hot day outside.  We will definitely be back and we will definitely ask for Cassie to be our waitress!  Thank you for giving the Valley such an amazing restaurant - can't wait to come back.

Text: Cannot give this place a higher rating. We were three weary hikers who came in at around 3 pm on Sunday. Just a heads up: they close at 3 pm on Sundays. I've worked in restaurants and I've always HATED it when people showed up after close, so of course we would never have stayed if we had known. But the staff never mentioned it until we asked after finishing our meal. Instead, they we're incredibly kind and attentive and the food was delicious and came out quickly.

If you're visiting Mark Twain National Forest, I can't recommend the FDC highly enough.
