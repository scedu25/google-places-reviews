Vino's Bar & Grill

Text: This place is a dive, let me start there. However, the beer selection is excellent and the food is top notch.

The staff is friendly and quick. I've been in places like this before where you get that 'stranger' vibe walking in the door...not here...it's been a warm vibe every time we've been in here.

Strongly recommend.

Text: Great food. Great atmosphere. Kathy is the bomb. The Chicken Tender Honey sandwich is the best ever. Great wings, plenty of beer options!!
