Text: Great drink selection for a sports bar. One of the few places to get gumball head on tap! Food is also pretty good as well, I recommend the burgers.

Text: Locals bragged. It was good. Locals bragged it was good. 12 oz ribeye. Locals bragged about sweet potato fries too. Not wrong. Waitress brewed me coffee and let me "camp out" doing extra work from my job and surf Imgur to relax. Chill staff.

Text: Really horrible experience. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. But everything you get here you have to ask for. Get a burger well if you want any toppings you have to be the one to bring it up otherwise you will get a plain burger. The biggest problem here was my waitress, Taylor. She came by my table probably 3 times the whole visit. One to take my order. One to drop off my food. One to collect her money. I needed a fork the entire meal but she was nowhere to be found. It was obvious The check was supposed to be split but wasn't. When we needed her to split it we had to wait for 20 minutes. Just the way she talked to us was horrible. I felt discriminated. I would understand if they were busy, But they were not! Horrible visit will never be back
