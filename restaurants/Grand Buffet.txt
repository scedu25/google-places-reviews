Grand Buffet
Rating: 1
Text: Me and a couple friends went for the first time and it's safe to say we are NEVER going back. Honestly we went up 3 times got 3 different plates of different food and barely ate any of it every time. The sushi was average at best and everything else was cold. When we got dessert everything was stale including what looked like store bought cupcakes. I've tried a lot of Chinese buffets around here and this is by far the worst.

Text: This place looks good from the outside and from the waiting area, but not what it appears. The food is below average (Same as any other chinese buffet) 

Don't go here if you're looking forward to eating crab legs. (This not all you can eat crab Leg it well cost you $3.99) Like what is the point for me to pay when I can't eat all i want? And like do I need to ask them if I can get a refill? I thought it was maybe the individual I encountered, but when I went back a second time, I found more rude people. Seems to me like it's the culture. 

I don't like it what so ever. If you don't believe me, go for yourself and write a review, I would love to hear from your experience.

I would have to agree with the review below (The second review) "If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. Save your stomachs and go literally anywhere else!"
