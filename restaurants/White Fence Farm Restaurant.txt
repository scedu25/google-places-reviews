Text: The chicken is very good here, crispy and lightly breaded. They also have awesome corn fritters, good steaks and mashed potatoe. The restaurant is set up like a museum, lots of cool things to look at. So if you're planning to come here, make sure you set time aside to walk around and check out the restaurant. If you don't want to deal with the crowds, they have a carry out section in back of the building near the water tower.

Text: The chicken is delicious - even cold leftovers. The fish is also delicious. Love the family style side dishes - kind of strange but good - especially the bean salad and fritters. Odd place sort of lost in time but really good food.

Text: I really enjoyed all of the food except for the chicken coating. It had sort of an over used oil taste. The show was really terrific and I think my group will probably come back next year.
