Text: Being a location next to KFC you'd think they strive to be the better chicken house, which most of the time is correct but when you pay for extra sauce(BBQ) and don't receive any... There chicken is just dry and blah. Might as well go to McDonalds where when you pay for your extra sauce it's THERE, at lease the initial sauce will be!

Text: This is my go-to for dirty rice and fried chicken or chicken fingers. And make sure you ask for the Louisiana hot sauce and a couple of Honey's.
