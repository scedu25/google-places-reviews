Text: Probably the best breakfast we've had locally. Omelette was delicious, the hotcakes were crispy and chewy and very delicious. Service was a little slow initially, but that is to be expected with everything being made to order. It was well worth it. This is cash only so be prepared.

Text: My wife and I were going to a auction in Rensselaer with our son and his girlfriend, we were not sure where to get a good breakfast so after reading this review we went to  Martin's restaurant. We were the only people in the restaurant except for two men who already eating their meals. We ordered  our breakfasts, then waited for at least a half hour for our meals to be brought to our table,all four of us had some type of eggs, scrambled, omelets, or fried. The meals were OK but small in size , they were warm but not hot, and the waitress took forever to bring them to our table. We will never go there again,I am not a hard  person to please but breakfast should not take that long to make for the only four people in the restaurant.
