Text: I was a little let down because I had heard such good things about it but I also ordered my food to go and that always makes a difference plus I was around 15 minutes later than I thought I would be so it it been down for a good 15 minutes when I picked it up my potatoes the potatoes were missing out of my order my steak was not cooked medium it was more rare more on the rare side and my salad I ordered a house salad and I'm pretty sure I got a side salad. But all in all it was very delicious we did not get our potatoes because I wasn't going back out there but the state that I had was delicious the salad was good it just wasn't what I ordered and the fettuccine alfredo was amazing the bread was very good too with the honey butter it was a little disappointing because I was pretty excited about eating from there and we got two dinners for $43 so I kind of was expecting a little more maybe if we decide to go there again we will have a better experience. So this is not a bad review the place is cozy and nice the people are friendly and the food was good what we got we just didn't get it all.
