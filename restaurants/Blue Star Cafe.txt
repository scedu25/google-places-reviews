Text: While we were there. There were ants crawling on our table. I don't mean a couple, we had at least 20 ants crawling on the table. We couldn't get refills without asking someone. My daughter is a type 1 diabetic and must drink diet soda if she drinks pop. They could not figure out how to bring her diet soda.
