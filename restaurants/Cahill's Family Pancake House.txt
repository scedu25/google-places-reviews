Text: Used to be able to give this place 5 stars. It's honestly gone down hill. The food is decent but everything else is why I gave it 2 stars instead of the 5

Text: Love this place! Me and my daughter comes here at least once a week for breakfast. Everybody knows our names, and we are always greeted with a smile. Everyone treats you like family. We are the 3rd generation going here and would recommend it to anyone
