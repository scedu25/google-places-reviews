Text: Every time I come to Chicago I MUST get Girodano's pizza. This time I decided to stop at this location in Dekalb on our way from Phoenix.  The staff is super polite and very friendly, they make you feel like a real costumer. Only problem was that this location was a carry-out only. I was hoping to sit down and enjoy me a pizza pie after 34 hrs of driving but instead I had to take it to my hotel and eat it there. Nonetheless the pie was amazing like always and costumer service was commendable.

Text: I don't understand the hype.  Ordered twice.  Once the deep pie and once a thin crust.  Deep dish was bland.  Mostly crust and cheese.  Not enough sauce.  The thin pizza was actually inedible.  Pretty pricey but I'll pay for good food.  This wasn't good.
