Coco's Bistro

Text: A Dayton local establishment that is definitely wotth your time!  A touch on the more expensive side when compared to big national chains, but totally worth the price tag. I have never had a bad meal here. The atmosphere is good, the food is amazing, and it feels like authentic, sophisticated dining without a specific genre / nationality.  The seared tuna is the most tender fish you will ever eat, and their off-the-menu burger is a low-cost alternative for those with a less-adventurous palate.

Text: Our dinner at Coco's was really, really good. First off, the service was perfect, waiter was so nice and each course was timed perfectly. Fried Brie appetizer was delicious, cocktails delicious, salads (w/ honey vinaigrette) refreshing, and the main courses were great. My husband's scampi (cheese tortellini w/ shrimp) was a smidgens better than my red trout but both were fantastic. Highly recommend!

Text: Amazing place for a date night. The atmosphere is upscale. The price point is steep. The food is supreme. I have never had anything that wasn't amazing at Coco's. Another great thing about the place is that they are very accommodating. I asked for no dairy and low fat adjustments to my dish and they did it right every time.

Text: My husband and I ate here before going to the Shuster Center and we had excellent meals with great service. Prices are a little on the high side but if you are looking for atmosphere and service, Coco's is the place for you.

Text: Great food, nice ambience. Went there with a few friends and everyone loved their food. A bit pricey, but that's to be expected from a place like this.
