Text: Nice atmosphere, food was good.  Seafood bisque was fabulous.  We like the Sandusky Berardi's better.  Tables were a bit small.  Service was excellent.

Text: This was great, I had the country omelet and it was amazing. I am from Michigan and don't see a lot of nice family restaurants as nice as this one! Ten/Ten would recommend.?
