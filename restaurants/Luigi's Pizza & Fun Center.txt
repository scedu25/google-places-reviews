Text: The staff should pay attention of who is in the bathroom or still eating because me and my girlfriend were still eating and we were about to go to the arcade. But when we got inside, the staff members said that they already started to close because they didn’t see any people. Like obviously your not gonna see anything if your just standing there doing nothing! Go outside or look for your manager and ask! Look around ! But overall the pizza is delicious.

Text: I'm a big fan of the pan pizza here, the rest of the family likes thin, luckily enough the price is are so reasonable we just order two. 

Game selection in the arcade is fine for the kids. Most games are "X" amount of money for a certain number of tickets and the kids can collect some cheap trinkets at the end. No games past guitar hero and big buck hunter for the adults or "big kids".

Laser tag seems a bit overpriced for what you actually get but I believe that might be par for the course.

Text: Fun place for families to get together and celebrate a birthday or some other kind of celebration. The arcade keeps the younger ones busy but if you like me you will have fun playing the games as well. Maybe even competing against your young ones in a game of air hockey. The food is good. Service slacks a bit but the environment makes up for it

Text: Fun place, games are cheap with tickets and pizza isn't very good, but not bad.
