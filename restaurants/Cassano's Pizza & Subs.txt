Cassano's Pizza & Subs

Text: GREAT wings and great service (super nice delivery guy and young lady who took my order) but the ‘garden salad’, not so much. 

A small slice of hothouse tomato, two thin slices of cucumber, two black olives, the smallest pepperoncini peppers I’ve seen and literally three TINY slices of red onion. It should be called ‘iceberg lettuce salad’ because that’s really all you get. The little bag of dressing wasn’t enough cover all the lettuce.

Text: It is a beautiful Saturday so we wanted to enjoy patio dining. The pizza tasted good. Toppings were 1-2 inches from the edge. Sad face. Our outdoor lunch was ruined by the smokers who arrived half way through. We understood that smoking was banned on restaurant patios in Ohio. Yuck. Nasty. If you are able to eat while inhaling second hand smoke, you will enjoy the patio dining here.

Text: Grew up in Dayton and hadn't had Cassano's in a decade, so gave this location a try.  It wasn't as good as I remembered; it was better.

Pizza was amazing, sauce was sweet, toppings were fresh, cooked perfectly.

Text: I've been a customer for many years, tonight's pizza was worst I've ever had.  Pizza nothing like like we have gotten prior visits. Crust, pizza sauce, sausage all tasted different. So sad

Text: We won't be back.  We usually go to the Cassano's in Indian Lake and thought we'd give the Sidney location a try even tho they're not affiliated with each other.  The waitress brought the first pizza out wrong.  After we explained it slowly to her, she was still confused as to what we wanted and the manager comes over to ask. We explained it to him and it STILL came out wrong!!!  Also, they add the veggies after they cook the pizza????  Idk.  The green peppers were cut huge and bright green!!  I wouldn't eat a pizza like that from anywhere!
