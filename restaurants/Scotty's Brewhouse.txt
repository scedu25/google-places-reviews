Text: A very good experience at Scotty’s last night! ? I tried to order a customizes burger, substituting the beef to pork. They offered me a very delicious pulled pork burger with BBQ source. Not only the great food, but also they provide very nice service. It’s been a while for us of having dinner at Scotty’s till last night. We will definitely visit again!

Text: Really good food. We waited a bit longer for food than I would’ve liked to, but we did catch them during/after a rush, so I don’t blame them. But, good beer and good food.

Text: Pretty good food and decent beer selection. Typically a friendly staff with quick service. But it seems like there's always something about our experience that is irritating. One time it took over 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. On a different visit it took over an hour to get food. Last time we visited our server disappeared after we got our food and it took forever to get our check. Sometimes our food comes out differently than ordered. It's never more than one of these things on each trip, but always something.

Text: Good range of beers and some great quick bites as well. The crew is generally helpful and will suggest beer ideas (if you'd like them to). Good vibe!

Text: Interesting Place....  a bit hard to find due to road work, but worth the effort.  Menu was varied, and good.  Service was also good.  As advertised, had a selection of beers.

Bottom line:  I would return.
