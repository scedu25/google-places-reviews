St. Elmo Steak House
Rating: 4
Text: This place is a very old and traditional steak house. I only went the one time and I ordered a dry aged New York strip medium rare. I feel like it came out medium / medium well. It was a little done for my taste and dry.  I did like the seasoning and how they grilled it, it was just to well done for the order. That being said I did still eat it instead of sending it back because my friends got their food and I didn't want them to wait on it. We also had the famous shrimp cocktail which is an experience and not for faint of the heart. Service is excellent and the atmosphere was as well. Although they use fake candles which I find kind of tacky.

Text: St Elmo's came in on a must stop steakhouse review that was on the Food Network (2017)
and came in No. 7 in the US. The show stated you must get the 28oz Bone-in Porterhouse. Even though the cut is excessive in size, and not cheap, I had to try it. The place was built in the early 1900s and the feeling inside is very cool, relaxing, laid back. The bartender provided outstanding service. I did order that massive steak medium rare. They don't season the steak rather just cook it. I always season my steaks prior to cooking with salt & pepper so naked was different. It was extremely tender and mouth watering delicious. I ate every bite of that steak and can state, it has to be one of, if not the best steak in Indy. I recommend you go if you've never been. If you've been and haven't ordered the 28oz Bone-in Porterhouse, it's time to get it!

Text: Still a great place for a celebration dinner or if you just want good steak.  I am not sure it is as good as it used to be.  The chopped salad was very good, but the bacon pieces we a bit tough.  My steak had good flavor but did not come out as hot as I would have wanted.  Westbrook much sour cream on the baked potato, so much that it made it a bit cold.  Good service!  A fun atmosphere.

Text: Excellent service and exceptional food.  The Shrimp Cocktail has the special house blend cocktail sauce that is delicious but fire on your nose and sinuses.  It clears after a few seconds but is so delicious it's worth the torture.  The steak is the absolute best steak I've ever had.
