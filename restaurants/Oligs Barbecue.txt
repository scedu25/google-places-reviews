Oligs Barbecue

Text: Good food. Tastes homemade. It's tiny inside but the service is worth it, as well as the food. They also have a salad bar!!

Text: Best BBQ in the area. Be sure to slow down when you get close - it's on a curve and hidden behind trees, so it's easy to miss.

Text: When visiting Montauk for camping and fishing, you HAVE to eat at Oligs.  Food is fresh and homemade...everything from salad to dessert is amazing.  I have never had a bad dinner and the staff are wonderful.
