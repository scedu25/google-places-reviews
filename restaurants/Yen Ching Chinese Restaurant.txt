Text: I haven't been here all summer as I had a broken arm & couldn't drive myself here. They are like family! They remembered me & my husband's preference from the menu. They are always accommodating to put us away from traffic for our service dog Comet! Food is filling & perfect each time. They're the best?

Text: This is my favorite place to go for chinese food. Plenty of seating, fast and friendly service. Fresh and delicious food. During the week there are several chicken entrees too choose from and if you like seafood then the weekends would be the time for you to come. You will find several shrimp dishes, crab legs and they even have frog legs. I personally don't eat that stuff but my boyfriend piles the plates with it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Text: Friendly staff, good prices and a buffet that is tough to top. Extra attention is spent to ensure all the food on the buffet is fresh , hot and plentiful. A true dining gem in this part of Illinois.
