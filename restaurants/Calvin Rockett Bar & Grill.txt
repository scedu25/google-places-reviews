Text: Tried this place twice. Left the 1st time feeling like I needed to be a local. Left the 2nd time bc they had zero desire to serve an iowa state group of 7

Text: Fast, friendly service with great tasting food!  I highly recommend the grilled tenderloin and I must say, they have the best french fries in town!  I loved the classic rock music that played just loud enough to hear it but you could carry on a conversation without shouting at each other.
