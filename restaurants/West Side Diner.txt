Text: Have heard from multiple sources service in evening has gotten terrible. Tried to place an ice cream order (over phone) for pick up 20 minutes before closing. Was told they were closing and they wouldn't take my order. Guess I'll give my money to the chain restaurants instead. #toobad #takeyourmoneyelsewheretheydontwantit

Text: Super good food! Very reasonably priced, I was surprised for a little diner! I wasn't there to rate the waitress/waiter I was there to enjoy a nice meal with my husband, and that's definitely what we got! I had the chicken sandwich and wow the chicken just melted in my mouth it was excellent! My husband got the BLT it was superb too! The fry's were to die for, very tasty! We were there during a busy hour so we had to wait a little while to get our food, but it was worth it! Want to take my family to West Side Diner  and would definitely recommend it to a friend!
