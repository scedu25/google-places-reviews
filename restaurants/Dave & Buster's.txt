Text: A fun family experience. Games can be a little pricey. An example is, you get 100 chips on a power card for $20, but most games fall in the chip range of 5.8 - 9.9 chips to play. That means on average each game is around $1 or more. Now in saying that,  there are specials they run for extra chips. Each game also earns you tickets that you can trade in for merchandise. I would rate the food at 3/5 and at a fair price, being at a great price when purchased with a power card. They serve alcohol and run happy hour specials at various times. Worth experiencing.

Text: Great family environment. We were here early afternoon and had a good time. The service was quick when we decided to eat something. The only downside was the bathrooms. People are disgusting leaving used feminine products on the ground and leaving their vibrators on the ground. This was probably a one time event but it was part of my experience and was not enjoyed. I am thankful my husband was around to take my son to the men's bathroom.

Text: A bit expensive and the prizes are not worth it. Love the atmosphere. They have a good choice of games. Food is not worth the price. We bought the $5 appetizer, a game card with bonus with 125 chips and one platter to choose from 5 for $30, a child's platter, three soda's and still had to reload the game card with $10 twice and we where only there 2 hours. The cost was not worth it.

Text: The arcade is definitely their best feature, they also have a great sports bar, with massive screens. They offer party rooms for large celebrations, as well as regular restaurant dining for those who prefer not to have televisions. The food is at about a red robin standard, with great service.

Text: Fun games and plenty of them. Bring a friend for more fun. Take advantage of their food/game specials. Food is good but a bit pricey. Service is OK but staff at front counter near the entrance are rude especially to kids. I would always accompany my children to purchase game tickets no matter what..
