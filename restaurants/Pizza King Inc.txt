Pizza King Inc
Rating: 5
Text: Pizza King has been around for as long as I can remember and the last time I checked, they are still owned by the same family. I've really only had their pizza, which is one of my favorites. Cracker-like crust: kind of like Pizza Shoppe if that is helpful.

Text: Great place for banquet, large groups, or dinner for 2. Food is good, pizza is great, but the bread basket is the main reason I love going here. The family that owns it are the nicest people you could meet.

Text: The epitome of an established old-school steak house. Nestled in the east end of Council Bluffs, IA but very well-known. Food quality is always impressive & the old-school ambiance might just make you lose yourself in the experience. Highly recommend the Greek pizza & their prime rib will not leave you disappointed.

Text: This is the restaurant I compare all other restaurants to. I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s the best restaurant in the Omaha and Council Bluffs area. I recommend the prime rib, chicken parmigiana, or any of the pizza. And cheese sticks.

Text: Pizza was great.  Took family and friend to dinner so we could get together and talk.  Only get to see each other once or twice a year and need to know the place is going to have good food and a nice atmosphere.
