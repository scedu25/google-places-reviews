Text: Well for starters they call it  build your own but you can't because they have limits own how much you can order or eat. They basicly tell you what you can order at first they said yes then they called me back to tell me no. What a joke .I hope they learn some customer skills

Text: I've been coming here since I was a kid. They haven't changed their recipes (that I can tell). I'm picky about my pizza and would choose to come here over any other pizzaria in Frankfort. Prices are exceptional, especially for the amount. It's a great atmosphere, being downtown. This was my favorite place to eat as a kid and even now, when I'm in town it's the only pizza I'll eat.
