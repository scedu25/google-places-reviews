Hyde's Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: Hyde's is a Hamilton tradition.  The restaurant has been in the Hyde family for generations.  One of the few remaining independent owned restaurants that offers a full menu-everything from soups and salads to good old-fashioned comfort food.  And the pies?  Oh, the pies!  Parking can be a challenge, but there is an overflow lot across the street.  Steps in front but a ramp at the back entrance.  Good coffee!

Text: Clean, great food at this Mom and Pop Resturant. Prices are reasonable and food is Homemade goodness. Servings are plentiful.  You must try their Homemade pies. ?

Text: If you're looking for warm comfort food, I will always recommend Hyde's! From the omelettes in the morning to the homemade pies, we love eating at Hyde's for cozy diner food.

Text: We came into hydes to eat breakfast and we were  there for an hour and a half. The last 30 minutes we were there our waitress didn't even stop by. We had a 2 year old and I asked for the check for our coffee cause we needed to go. Ended up not having to pay for our coffee but another server said our food just came up and was bringing us our food. I was watching the window and the food had been played on a tray for at least 10 minutes. The place was busy and they had a lot of people working their asses off. They had one or two employees that weren't doing anything. Specifically a older women standing their with a scowl look on her face. I am going to guess that was the manager. We have family that goes here regularly and they love the place. Should of known better not to give Hamilton a chance. Thanks hydes for wasting our time today, we won't be coming back!
