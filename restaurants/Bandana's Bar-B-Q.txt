Bandana's Bar-B-Q
Rating: 1
Text: Worst experience I have ever had eating at Bandana's or eating out in general. The cooks, which you can see clearly behind the counter, wiped their noses while touching food. This happened several times. The cooks grabbed sausage links are started hitting each other with them, before serving the sausage. One of the cooks started eating food off of one of the plates waiting for the wait staff to pick it up. One of the waitress was talking to another waitress and laughing about  how a new waitress quit because she said someone was pretending to use sausage sexually and she was offended. We waited 45 minutes for our food while the wait staff stood around. I was so diagusted I couldn't eat it! Our waiter, Chris, was the only redeeming quality. We used to love this place, but we never be going back!!!!

Text: Frankly it's to bad the stars , don't go in the reverse . But we ate there in the middle of the day. The first thing I found odd was the fact that their  motto was Smell That Smoke , but we couldn't smell any smoke when we walked up to the front door or sat down. Service was great , and I don't blame the waitress . But my first question was . " Is the food smoked daily and is it fresh . ? "  " Oh Yes ! " was her reply. Not the case at all . food wasn't fresh nor was it prepared that day . And in fact lacked any real smoke flavor at all . We spoke  the manager and he did offer to comp the meal, which we declined , and as well offered to get us fresh food. My question was why didn't that happen when we ordered and how can it be fresh if your smokers aren't even going ? Wish I could've up loaded my pics..but we did drive around back and the smoker weren't going and they barely had any wood . If you smoke fresh daily and this was in the middle of the week why wouldn't you have a stack of wood , not to mention your words and claim..And that is " everything is smoked daily and cut to order right off the smokers ". So my recommendations are , like most chain places is the quality goes out the window , so don't waste your time or money , look for a different BBQ place to eat .

Text: We went here during NWMSU's parent's weekend, finding the place on a random 'google search', looking for barbeque.  We will definitely be back!!!!  The food was delicious and the service was exceptional.  The restaurant is a medium size and the tables were comfortably situated from one another that you could have a nice conversation without being distracted by surrounding noise.  I loved - LOVED that we didn't feel rushed through our meal to vacate a table quickly.  We decided that this must be a "hidden gem" in the area, because even at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night, we were seated and served immediately.  Husband had the beef platter, daughter and I had pork ribs, all of it was delicious.  Apparently made fresh every day, as our waitress did report that sometimes they run out of pork ribs, so if that's what you're wanting, maybe call ahead.  It was fantastic!
