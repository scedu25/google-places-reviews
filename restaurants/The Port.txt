Text: Nice place! Food is good and servers are very friendly. Summertime is the best, but it gets crowed quickly. Kinda gets a little "clubby" with employees always gathered at the bar and sometimes drinking later in the evening.

Text: Stayed here for a wedding---messed up the rehearsal dinner gave our spot of the restaurant to a family reunion then said we had no reservations...were supposed to have prime rib and ended up with the nightly buffet..food is good but staff is way under staffed all day everyday...we set up our own chairs own reception area..wedding coordinator was gone and unavailable up until the ceremony..view is gorgeous and wedding was beautiful but that's on little part of the staff...front desk is empty most of the day and girl up front sits on her phone constantly and no help when asked if anything. Great view...great photos...good food but needs more staff and more attentive staff during a wedding...day after the wedding we are unable to get back into bridal room to get our things due to door being locked and no one to answer a phone or can find in any part of the hotel. Not happy!

UPDATE: Now we even received an email from the wedding coordinator who also happens to be the general manager of the hotel asking us to remove our reviews of her establishment...if that doesn't tell you the character of the people there I don't know what will!!!
