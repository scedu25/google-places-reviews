Text: Visiting family in Geneva, we all went here for dinner the second night, had to push some tables together for the 12 of us. Great food, loved the Coca Cola decorations, bathroom was cool too. Had beer and a kahlua and Jack cocktail. Supreme sandwich was good too, though I wish the cheese had been melted more. Cheese sticks and fried pickles were great! Waitress was amazing, fast and accurate! Will def be back!!

Text: Atmosphere was wonderful, retro and clean. The Ruben was amazing the burgers was good, tasted homemade and plenty of meat. The Philadelphia cheese was underwhelming. Service was great. Prices were good. Have already been back, will do so again.

Text: OK, so it is one of these places you don't want everyone to know about because it is so good.  I would be so disappointed the next time I go, if there is a 1/2 hour wait for a table situation.  The prime rib I had (12 {burp!} ounces) was fork tender, and was proportionately perfect for the meat vs fat.  Enough fat to make it flavorful and tender,  but not so much that I felt like I was wasting my money on stuff my wife and doctor don't want me to eat.  The wait staff were friendly and on the spot when I wanted them, with out them hovering.  Definitely a place travelers on Hi-Way 81 should know about.
