Capri Restaurant & Pizza

Text: Great pizza with a unique crust. I like how you can look into the kitchen at any time to see them making it. Their goat cheese appetizer is amazing as well. Definately one (if not the) best in Rockford.

Text: I would have happily paid about half the price I did for my dinner last night. Our pizza crust tasted like a saltine cracker, and it seemed like they were hoping the 2lbs of cheese would have covered that up. The atmosphere and ingredients were very old fashioned, not was I expecting to find in the new downtown. Our waitress was very nice tho.

Text: Ordered the beef sandwich.  It is humongous and absolutely delicious!  I've been going here for years and have always been delighted with the food, service and price.  Pizza is the best in town.

Text: We had my daughter's 13th birthday at the Capri restaurant in June.   As always it was fabulous.   Great, great food, if you authentic Italian food.  The staff was awesome and kept up with our big crowd.
