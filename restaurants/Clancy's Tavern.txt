Text: Clancy's is my favorite hometown restaurant! I love the atmosphere and you can always get a table! The food never ever dissapoints! The quality of their chicken is so good! They also have the best beer selection for domestic drinkers and craft beer drinkers! The service makes you feel like family! We come here at least once a week!! I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant!
