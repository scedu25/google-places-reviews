Jay's Authentic Thai Cuisine
Rating: 3
Text: Thai is a food that really doesn't have a major chain that I'm aware of, so as a OTR driver I eat a lot of family owned Thai restaurants. Some are authentic a amazing, and some left wondering.

I got green chicken curry, not much chicken, the curry had a small amount of flavor but all in all, it wasn't what I had hoped for reading other reviews. I got a appetizer and a drink. As I went to pay the bill I know I had ordered $15 worth the food, but I was charged $20. Nothing itemized, just a number she threw out there. I paid, but no tip but this review. 

I've had worse curry, but I've had Far better, and since you're rolling the dice on how much you will be charged, I'd advise you to avoid this place.

Text: Words fail me in conveying this gastric glory! One of our favorite places to eat when we just gotta have "that" flavor that touches our souls.
