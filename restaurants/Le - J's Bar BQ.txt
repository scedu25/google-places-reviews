Text: Wish I could give it more stars, but I literally took one bite of brisket, and almost instantly threw up in my mouth. The meat tasted like a piece of bologna, that had been held under a hair dryer before serving. No moisture in the meat what so ever. The potatoe salad is a store bought, mustard base that can be purchased at Wal-Mart.  And the sauce was obviously 87% water.  Literally took one bite off a 9 dollar plate of food, and threw it away. Would not recommend.  Only gets 2 stars for perfect customer service, and suggested sales.

Text: Ribs are fall-off-the-bone-good with smoky flavor. The brisket is chopped and delicious. Big thumbs up for the baked beans. Jeffrey the owner does it all:  cooks, serves, and rings you up. He is friendly & makes sure your order is exactly what you want!  Prices are fair---$8.95 for 2 meats & 1 side, $9.95 for 3 meats & 2 sides. When you leave smelling like smoked BBQ, you know it's good!  Worth the drive from Wichita and other surrounding cities---we drive an hour and we will be back!

Text: The good is great. But I frequent this place mostly because the owner is like the nicest person in the area.
