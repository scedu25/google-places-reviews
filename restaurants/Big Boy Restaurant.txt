Text: We had lunch here. Their soup and salad bar was very nice with a wide range of items on it.  There were 4 soups offered and lots of delicious items to add to your salad.

Text: Awful service, awful food. I don't expect a lot from a chain family resturaunt but this was a terrible experience,  the staff seemed inexperienced and the food was nearly inedible. If you can't make hash browns, then clearly the culinary field is not in your wheelhouse.

Text: They only get a star cause of cleanliness. Perch was greasy & tasted like swamp water..sent it back. Country fried steak was thin & greasy. Mashed potatoes nasty with burnt bacon crumbs. Cinnamon apples just not right. Then when paying bill cashier charged us $10 over the ticket.. had to make her pull ticket out to prove it. Didn't trust her to credit it back so took the 10.

Text: The staff is very slow. It took a long time to be seated even though many tables were open. The folks bussing tables were slow & easily distracted. Took one person over 10 minutes to clear one table. Food on the breakfast bar was awful, except for the bacon. On a positive note, our waitress, Anna, was efficient. This is the only positive and I do not recommend this location to others.

Text: Food was as I rembered as a kid. Our server was over the top! Place was in middle of remodel. Probably looks great now.
