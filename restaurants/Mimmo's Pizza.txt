Text: Great place run by Sicilian Americans, they know there stuff.
Home made, no pre-packaged junk. Closed Saturday and Sunday  for Family time...Francisca and Her husband "nick" the Godfather will treat you good. Very reasonable prices especially for lunch.
Great pizza, pasta, and hot sandwiches. 
Made with TLC!
