Text: They use MSG!!! I cant even eat there or i get a splitting head ace from it. Buty boyfriend eats it anyways because its the only half way decent chinese place in town. The house special is good but everything else he has tried is bad. Anything that's breaded is super gristley, like the orange and sesame chicken. Also, they skeet you on veggies except on the house special that's the only reason I gave it two stars because they atlease offer one good dish.

Text: Not bad for small town Chinese. I don't care for the Brown sauce here, seams chicken sauce us super sweet.  Shrimp lo mein is pretty good. Got the market cornered in Sullivan.
