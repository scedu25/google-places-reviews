Text: Such a great amount of delicious food for a great price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Be wary of their Turkish coffee, it comes with a warning. Strong and not for everyone.

Text: FANTASTIC!  We picked this placed based upon a review.  The restaurant is attractive,very clean.  The food was authentic and delicious.  The portions we're crazy huge. I took a box of food home. My husband who has never not finished good food asked for a box.  Service was terrific and unobtrusive.

Text: I have never had a bad experience here. This time we asked for the banquet room and we were so well taken care of! The waiter actually said we were tipping too much! The food is authentic, the employees are fantastic!
