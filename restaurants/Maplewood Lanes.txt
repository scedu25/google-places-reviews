Maplewood Lanes

Text: speaking as a bowling fool, this place is great . The scoring screens were very easy to read with a bonus of animated spare - pickup Target for the novice bowler. Thirty-six lanes of bowling and the place was very clean. If I didn't hate the city of Omaha so much I would move there just for this bowling alley.

Text: So...lived here all my life and never been here....wow..what have I been missing out on!!  Was out on night ride on a Thursday... and  was hungry...the hubby suggested it...so glad!!!  Bowling leagues rocking....people having a great time..all ages eating and drinking.  We decided to order food and check out the bar.... Bartender was friendly and courteous...always a bonus ?. We like IPA's..and they have!!  He's made shots named after his kids...omg...cheap and bomb!  5 different flavors!  Had wings for appetizer...some of the best!  Sliders for dinner...very good!  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked good!  Checked out their new patio... beautiful!!!!!  Will definitely stop again !

Text: Awesome! Great family package, wonderfully surprised by the food (yum AND g/f!), excellent service. Only downside? 8 ppl couldn't get through two games in two hours. Needed about 10 more minutes. Oh well. Super fun, great price.
