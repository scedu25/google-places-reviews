Text: All I know about Mexican food is that I like tacos once in a while. As soon as I walked in I saw that they had tacos on sale for only 99 cents. I ordered two but they weren't as I expected. The meat was somehow made into extremely tiny pieces that were dry and with no flavor. There was no juicyness like you get with TACO JOHNS, or TACO BELL. There was something weird about the cheese, too, but I can't describe it. There was no lettuce, either. The Coke was ok. Nevertheless, I left a tip: but, as is the trend these days that I've been noticing, I didn't get a thank you for it.
