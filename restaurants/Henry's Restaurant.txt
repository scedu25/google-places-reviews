Text: It was good. The hamburger came on a bun that you would buy in the store, not one that would make it stand out, and the burger wasn't anything to write home about, but the service was friendly and the appetizers good. I was a bit surprised when the soup I ordered as a side to my main dish was brought out before the appetizers, so I had to eat in front of my husband and son, or let it go cold while we waited for the appetizers. It was also quiet, no loud music playing, which was appreciated. Some restaurants have a loud atmosphere, which makes conversation difficult. We will probably try it again, only next time zI will try another dish.

Text: We got here at 9:30 in the morning on a Sunday and luckily it seems like it's before the place really gets busy. They have an excellent and very well-stocked breakfast buffet with all the meats homemade biscuits and gravy (which are excellent) potatoes, potato casserole, scrambled eggs, waffles pretty much anything that you would need for breakfast (except fruit). It's great to have so many choices that's also at a real reasonable price. I'm glad we ended up stopping here this was the first time for us as we were coming through Kenton.
