Text: We come once every month or 2, always love coming, tonight we had reservation for 4 at 7pm, we were seated by 710, but then our drink order or dinner order wasn’t taken until 8!! There were 4 open tables seated after us 4 and the couple that sat with us..we got water and soup and salad  before drinks or orders were taken.. we watched 4 other tables seated after us get served and done before we got anything.. we don’t usually complain, but we spend a few dollars with you, and I have restaurant owners in my family.. there was something way off tonight and just want to share.. we only left a 12% tip as we usually do a 20%. We had a 125$ bill, but very unhappy with this visit?

Text: AMAZING, but make sure to bring you wallet $25 a plate. They have great food and good staff. You will be fighting over leftovers in your house.

Text: Ate here the other day with a group of 6  and was charge $19.00 dollars for my meal! Also everyone in my group was charged a $4 service fee and was not told. We all left an additional $3 tip not knowing they already charged us for one. When my mom and I called about the situation we were told they said they only charge the service fee for groups of 8 or more and that they couldn't do anything about it and the manager didn't even try to fix the problem. So if you ever eat here make sure to always check your checks and make sure everything is correct or they will most likely overcharge you!! I was very upset and will most likely never be returning to eat here!

Text: It was delicious option for sushi and hibachi. It was such a good buy. I had leftovers for three additional meals. They put together a free cake for the birthday guest.
