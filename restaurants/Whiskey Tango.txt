Text: Love this place... Its Huge.  Has a dance floor in middle... Riding bull.. Pool tables To the back..  Awesome Drink special... I Love the mixed drink bucket. For $15 to start then Refill it for $10... It Can get a bit crowded... But only if. There is an event going on... Other weekend nights r fine.. Has Three bars inside so gettin a drink is quick..  Typical bar food... Friendly staff.. Good place to go and have a good time.. But watch out for how much the bartenders charge at each bar.  Prices can vary.

Text: The bouncers are really nice and extremely responsive to emergency situations that arise due to overly excited patrons. The atmosphere is fun and the restaurant / bar is very hip and modern. Music was good, with a mix of all genres.

Text: Everytime time we went out to dance the wait staff would take our drinks.from our table.  When my girlfriend complained, instead of just replacing our drinks the security asked us to leave.  Terrible customer service

Text: Was a great time.  Just wish the DJ had played some slower 2 steps occasionally.  Otherwise the music was good. Could really tell when the 20 crowd was showing up, the choice of music became for pop country.
