Smokey's Bar-B-Que House

Text: I was massively disappointed in the brisket.  It was completely dried out, not terribly flavorful, and I don't believe it was smoked that day. In fact, I strongly suspicion it was microwaved.  We got there right when they opened for dinner, too - so I expected fresh out of the smoker.  Given the dryness and time we showed up, perhaps it was something they didn't sell from the night before?

Other diners in our party had similarly dry food:  the kid's chicken strips were over breaded and very dry,  the bbq chicken was very dry, and pork sandwich was somewhat dry (but less so than the other items).  The salmon was the only thing that seemed like it was cooked properly.  

Based on our experience there, we opted to eat offsite the rest of our stay.

Text: The Burnt Ends Appetizer was big enough for a meal very delicious, and the Ceasar Salad was too. Ordered Breakfast was great here too. The Server's were friendly, and accurate. Loved it!

Text: Tried 3 times to eat here. All 3 times had issues to the point we never ate  here. Everything from being closed for lunch or out of food. Please don't open your doors if you don't want any business!

Text: Waited over an hour for food. Saw our waitress once to take order. Gave up and served ourselves  coffee because no one bothered to come by. Checked on our order after hour and 15 min. Was told ours hadn't been started yet and we were next. Restaurant was by no means full. Finally served our food and was told our order of bacon would take even longer would we substitute something. Manager and wait staff were indifferent to all complaints. We were by no means alone in our experience. Just plain poorly run with marginal quality food at best.
