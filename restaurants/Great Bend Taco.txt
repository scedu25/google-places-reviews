Great Bend Taco

Text: Not very friendly when I walked in, but they did greet white customers.  

I ordered enchiladas and crunchy tacos.  The enchilada plate was very bland and appeared to be made by someone who'd never made enchiladas before. I did notice the "cook" was a young teenager. The beans were canned refried store bought.  The plate was topped with Tostitos chips which made no sense.  The crunchy tacos on the other hand were ok, very similar to Taco Bell.  

Not my kind of "Mexican food" when I'm craving.  I definitely won't return.

Text: Order the Cheese covered Sancho. Its delicious! A large tortilla filled with seasoned crumbled beef, lettuce and tomatoes. It's covered with cheese and has a side of chips. So simple and so good. The tacos are also delicious. Nice simple atmosphere and the staff are always friendly.
