Roma Cafe

Text: Great customer service, and romantic atmosphere. 4 stars because menu is very traditional and not very creative. But food is consistently good.

Text: I always recommend Roma to out of town visitors.  Since 1890 this Italian eatery has been feeding hungry Detroiters with class.  It now attracts those seeking traditional recipes served in a gracious, nostalgic style that is hard to find these days. Located on the edge of the historic Eastern Market, you should not miss a chance to dine here.  Trust me, you will not leave hungry!
