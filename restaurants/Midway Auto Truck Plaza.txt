Text: My wife and I had  a great experience there. Food was excellent. We had liver and onions. It is hard to fine a restaurant that gives you such large portions. The staff was all very nice and helpful. We will definitely come back.

Text: I enjoy this stop. Very friendly, food is good (portions are generous). This Mom and Pop is fighting to survive in this corporate world. Remodeled bathroom and a newer menu!

Text: It was a nice place for the money. I enjoyed my stay for the price. It is not a expensive place just a room and bed. Food was priced like a truck stop.

Text: The restrooms are clean, the food was amazing. I got what we call Scatterbrowns back home. I couldn’t even eat my biscuits and gravy because I was so full. The waitstaff and gas station employees were friendly. The wait staff (not only my waitress) kept checking up on me. My drink was never empty.

Text: Stopped in while the little boy was working the counter with bleached hair might have been girl not sure.  Him or she never acknowledged they had a customer setting behind the desk doing nothing I had to set at the front desk waiting.  After waiting and finally being acknowledged by the he/she they had no name tag after asking for name they refused and said it was a private property gas station whatever that means.  After going here for 20 years and the place rapidly going down hill  I won't be back because of this Very rude customer service.  Considered yourself one less customer because of your clerk
