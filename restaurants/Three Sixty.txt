Text: Awesome  bar!  Great views of the city and really good service.  Olivia, our server, was busy but still managed to provide good service.  The manager seemed very attentive to everyone as he was also walking around checking in on people.  

I was here for drinks and an appetizer.  The appetizer wasn't that great and seemed a little burned.

Text: The food, views and atmosphere were AMAZING! The only reason one 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. Bartender was standoffish and when we moved inside, a server never served us.

Text: Incredibly friendly staff. Unbelievable views. Even outside when 100 degrees, still a nice breeze and actually wasn't too hot. Great food/cocktails and surprisingly reasonable prices! I paid more for dinners in Town & Country part of the town with a lot worse views!

Text: The views are incredible. Looks like it would be an excellent place to watch a baseball game from. I had the salmon dinner and it was very very good. Went on a Sunday night (no game) and there was loss of slave to move around and enjoy the night and the views.

Text: Amazing view, although partially blocked by signage on nearby buildings. Good food, though small portions. Great drinks and the house made KitKat is awesome.
