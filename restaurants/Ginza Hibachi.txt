Text: Found this as I was headed back to hotel for night ..
Love the hibachi grill .. this was a good decision to stop here for dinner.
The table performance of the hibachi chef was entertaining, there was very generous portions too.  In fact, so generous I had enough for next full meal.
Prices are mid range, a bit more than the casual restaurants, but worth it overall.

Text: Went there for birthday, after having a previous poor experience before there. Sometimes places have an off night.  Service was slow, disjointed and missing at times.  

Second time I became ill.

Even if the stomach issues did not happen again, the service makes it a no go for me.  Will not go back.
