Text: Great hotel in downtown Dubuque Iowa. Beds are nicely done. Attached casino and restaurant makes it convenient so you can take care of all your needs while you're there. Close to downtown.

Text: So, the location is awesome, plenty of nearby entertainment and dining, there's even a Houlihan's attached to the hotel, that offers the option of posting charges to the room to simplify the transaction, The rooms are great and I look forward to returning after the remodel

Text: This would have been a four star review, save for the four small beetles I had to kill in my room. Two per night, so I'm knocking off two stars.
