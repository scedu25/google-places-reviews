Text: Don't go.  I think those five star reviews must be fake.  First, the good.  The place was clean and the service was good.  Prices are in line with other BBQ joints in town.  Now, the bad.  The ribs, I didn't know that you could get ribs with no meat on them.  I get it, it's a rib not a steak.  But could we get a little meat?  Seriously, I would be ashamed to call what we got a slab of ribs, put it on a plate and serve it if I owned the joint.  It's tough to review the product because we got so little.  But what was there was over done and tough.  Probably the worst ribs I've ever had at a restaurant.  Including places where "Rib" isn't in the name.  I give the ribs an F.  The brisket was over cooked, by a mile.  It was dry and tough with no hint of smoke and a huge portion of it was fat.  Brisket should have a fat cap, but not 30% of the portion.  I give the brisket an F.  The pulled pork.  As a sandwich it came with a decent amount of meat, but it was also overdone with little smoke flavor.  I give it a D.  Baked potatoes came with butter and sour cream on the side in packets.  Really?  Didn't have any dessert, no way.  I can name 8 other places where for the same money you would be happy and satisfied with your BBQ meal starting with Pappy's and Sugarfire.  Don't waste your money here.
