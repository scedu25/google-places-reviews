Text: Our server was great. She made our experience wonderful. The food lived up to expectations. It was tasty and the portions were generous. We were celebrating my friend's birthday and they gave her a small cheesecake. We were there after 8:30pm when their pasta dishes are half price. What a plus!

Text: I came here to meet family for a birthday dinner. We had a private space, which was great. Our server was really nice but didn't clear any dishes from the table, at any point, they just sat piled up even when the entrées came out. Drinks sat empty for a long time. Appetizers were good but eggplant parm portions were inconsistent. My chicken parm came out barely warm, a little tough, and very small. I didn't complain because we had a room full of people and I was hungry. Most people in our party mentioned that the salad was wilted (I paid $5 for a child's portion that went to waste..). Cheesecake, rolls, sangria, and iced tea were good. The biggest disappointment was that this place didn't serve pizza, one of my favorite things to eat at Pasta House! I think with a facelift, some additional training for staff, and a pizza oven ;)... this place could be a success.

Text: Tonight was great. Food was hot, baby rolls were soft and warm. Nancy stepped up and did a fantastic job. Will definitely be going back.
