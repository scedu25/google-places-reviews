Chapala Mexican Grill

Text: I have come here for years and ordered the same exact thing.  Now they tell me you cannot substitute anything on the menu. What you read is what you get even if you are willing to pay extra for it.  The server was very rude about explaining this like I had done something wrong.  She said it has been that way ever since they updated the menu. I have eaten here since they updated the menu and it was fine then.  What changed today?

Text: Food was good, main server was very rude. Walked away when I asked to replace a messed up order, no alcohol in a 9 dollar margarita, asked about that and they lied about it. Won't go back. Jetos
