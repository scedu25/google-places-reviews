Text: Terrible food quality and service! Basically spent 9.01 on fries and a drink because the first sandwich (crispy) and the second new one (charbroiled grilled) were both not fresh and the crispy undercooked! Fries the first time were way too salty I couldn't eat them and had new ones made! Will never eat here again!

Text: The manager was loudly shaming his employees in front of customers. Yelling that he left for 10 minutes and everything was a mess and asking why it couldn't be done right and blah blah blah.... Not ok to do in front of customers
