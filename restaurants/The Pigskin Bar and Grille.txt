The Pigskin Bar and Grille
Rating: 5
Text: The roomiest bar in Athens, it has plenty of space. It is the only bar with a ping pong table, but it also has a pool table. Various specialty drinks, which are all very good- black widows, james and the giant peach, and their own version of electric lemonade are all worth a try. There is great food options during restaurant hours and an outdoor patio in the back. Its a good bar for both students and alumni.

The Pigskin is the third bar in "the triangle" challenge, which is drinking a crystal ball from the Crystal, a blackout from Paw Purrs, then a black widow from Pig Skin in under an hour.

Text: I'm sick of the same old bar scenes, cramped space  and greasy food. The pig skin was such a welcome change.  Great open and friendly atmosphere. The food was really good, not like the typical bar offerings. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. I never heard of a black widow drink,  but now I am hooked!!! Honestly, it is the best bar in Athens.

Text: My husband and I eat at The Pigskin every time we are in Athens.  The staff members are super friendly.  The food is delicious--especially the fresh, homemade chicken tenders!  
Management and servers often greet customers by name. 

The Pigskin is clean and well organized!  Try their food the next time 
you are in town. You'll be glad you did.

Text: We eat here every chance we get. The staff are attentive & knowledgeable about the menu & Craft Beer selections.  The sweet potato fries have a spicy sauce and the Thai burger is crave worthy. They never disappoint. Great atmosphere to hang with friends.
