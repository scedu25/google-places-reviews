Pete's Garage
Rating: 1
Text: Here on a Sunday night. Service was poor. Manager did not have a clue. They lost our order and didn't have an answer for anything.  Party of six one person received their food, the other five went home hungry. We we never be back. Used to be one of our favorite places when up in the area. Need better waitoers and manager.

Text: Unique car booths.  We wanted to set in one but was up stairs, waitress cheerfully escorted us up.   She had to run up and down to serve us and we appreciated that.  The food is excellent.   I had the Nash hambler.

Text: Pete's garage has been a casual Gathering Place for years. The food has always been good. The four of us were well served from beginning to end with more food than we could eat. My son Peter remembered when he was a child and at Pete's having the same food with the same quality as he had today. Peter is 40 years old Pete's has become an institution.
