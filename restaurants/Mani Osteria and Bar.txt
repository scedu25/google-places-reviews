Mani Osteria and Bar
Rating: 5
Text: One of my favorite restaurants in Ann Arbor. Gourmet, Italian small plates and pizzas. I’ve always been here for a great lunch or dinner, and just tried their brunch. Fantastic for any meal. Try their unlimited mimosas for a great price - truly unlimited! Highly recommend the meatballs, arancini, and brussels sprouts.

Text: Excellent food all around. Service definitely a highlight. Every time I've been there I've gotten free stuff. Once a free side because they were busy and serving us slow, another time free coke while we waited for takeout pizza. Very friendly and generous staff plus exquisite food. No complaints.

Text: If you want (what I'm assuming is) very authentic Italian food, then this might be the place for you.

For everyone else, if you don't want to pay nearly triple the amount you'd pay at any other restaurant for less than half the food (both in portion and in taste,) eat elsewhere.

Waitstaff and atmosphere are nice though, so I give them that.

Mani is my go-to recommendation in Ann Arbor. Tapas style Italian. Some of the best Neapolitan style pizza you're going to find.The pickled tomatoes are a great appetizer, not to be overlooked, a sort of deconstructed bruschetta with whipped ricotta and tapenade. 

This place is classy, but not too fancy. Excellent food, and honestly one of the best values in town when you account for the quality of the product, service, and atmosphere. I have never left this place unhappy.
