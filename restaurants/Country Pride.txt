Text: This place must be the best kept secret in ogalala! We left the Hotel and were given a not so glowing picture of Country Pride. We decided to give the "truck stop" breakfast a try anyway. There was plenty of room, the wait staff was friendly and the food came out promptly and was good! What's not to like here! We will be back when in the area again!

Text: Chicken sandwich ok. Service fine. Onion rings absolutely horrible. Not sure what or how old the oil they were using was.

P.S. Only one reason why I visited it- Mexican restaurant was closed till 4p.m.
