Text: This was really the only place to eat in the area. It was very dirty. If my husband didn't make me stay I would probably have walked out. The food was good and my drink was good but I thought the place looked awful. The floor didn't look like it had been swept in months. They did have signs up about not having enough staff. But i do not think this place would pass inspection. I was just waiting for a cockroach to walk across the floor but to be clear- I did not see any. I'm only giving it 2 stars and not 1 because the food was actually good.
