The Pier Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: This is an upscale restaurant on the riverfront with amazing views of the river. The service is sometimes wonderful, sometimes not so great. Kind of a hit or miss. Same goes with their Sunday buffet. Sometimes it's great - they do several prime rib on it- and sometimes it's only ok. For a restaurant with so much potential, I sometimes find it disappointing. They need to upgrade their restrooms, and pay more attention to their cleanliness.

Text: Always a joy to go to the pier. The food is fantastic and this time the man cooking the Sunday brunch buffet was sweet and so helpful. He made silly faces at my daughter to keep her entertained, helped us find a bathroom, etc. I forgot his name but he had tunnels in his ears. 10/10!!

Text: Tasty food, good drinks and service plus the best view in town. Nicely upscale balanced against reasonable price points; sufficiently casual for all.

Text: Phenomenal!  We had the sweetest youmg lady as our Server, Brittany.  She was very personable and welcoming and made us feel right at home.  She told us upfront that she was new, but she was very gracious and enthusiastic about the restaurant and the offerings. Her charm and enthusiasm was very refreshing and welcomed for us as out of state visitors to the Pier.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere and view were amazing.  Brittany made our experience that much more inviting.
