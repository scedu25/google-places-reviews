Text: Came for the fish fry. You get more for your money to order the walleye, but the cod was just as good as the cod! All for a good price and huge pieces of fish

Text: Awesome burgers, friendly staff, and a good Friday night fish fry.  Not the fanciest place in town but it's one if our favorites.  Biker friendly.
