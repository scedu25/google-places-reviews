Text: In a nearly empty restaurant at 4 pm it took more than 10 minutes to seat us. More than another 10 to get a waiter to the table for our order. The beer was fine. The soup was good. However I would not recommend this place.

Text: I enjoyed the french onion soup and an oatmeal stout.  We came on a Wednesday evening and the beer prices were very reasonable (3.04 a pint!).  The beer nuggets (fried sauerkraut balls) were excellent.

Text: The staff was very friendly, and the food was good, but we waited quite awhile for things to arrive.  We tried the black cherry soda and the root beer - not bad.  Nice atmosphere in a cute little city, and kid-friendly.
