Text: I was brought here by some friends who live in Alma and Oh-my-gawsh...   so good. I started with a Bloody Mary and we shared a large order of onion rings. I see why people talk about there. I had the mushroom Swiss burger with tomatoes and extra onions, I like onions, with waffle fries with house made ranch. The burger was excellent but a little over cooked as I ordered it medium but the gravy on the mushrooms made up for that and it was excellent. We were there late Saturday night and it was quiet and dim, perfect for visiting with friends. Overall I had a great experience and will definitely be back. Oh and get the onion rings, you'll be sad if you don't.

Text: We ate here and the food was terrible.  To be fair they had a specialized menu for the eclipse so my review is limited to that.  The positive....the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  They always had a smile on their face and made sure all of our needs were met.  Now to the negative...the food was gross.  I had a jalapeno popper dip that was very greasey, so much that I could turn it upside down and it would pour out.  My daughter had the Fettucini Alfredo which basically was cold noodles sitting in milk.  My wife got a chicken dish that was burnt and tasted like char.  We do not plan on ever going back.  To bad too because they used to have amazing food and onion rings.  I guess all good things must come to an end.

Text: Just passing through and I like to support local businesses. Excellent service staff. I had the fish and chips, which was very mediocre. Fish was rubbery and not warm enough. Fries were good. I didn't care for the onion rings at all.
