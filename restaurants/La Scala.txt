Text: This was my first time at La Scala and it was wonderful.  We arrived at 5pm right as they were opening for dinner and seating was plentiful.  The place is beautiful, the seating very comfortable, and the menu extensive.  They bring fresh baked bread to the table with an oveo and basil dipping sauce. Each meal came with a choice of soup or salad. We had the appetizer with the smoked salmon in crepes with dill cream sauce which was mouth watering.  You get 4 large pieces. I had the Beef Romana (without mushrooms) and it's now in the top ten best meals I've had. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious.  I highly recommend.  Meals were between  $16-24 plus drinks, tax, and tip. Worth every penny.

Text: Way I understand all but 1 or 2  meals can be gluten free. They make their own GF dinner rolls and pastas.

Text: Great food, great service, outdoor seating allowed you to escape West Lafayette to enter a small restaurant in Italy for an hour or two.

Text: I love this farm-to-table restaurant. The food is fresh and varies often. I've enjoyed every meal I've had there. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. It's located in the heart of the historic downtown district. Highly recommend.
