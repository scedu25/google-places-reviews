Zeus' Coney Island
Rating: 5
Text: For a cheap and pleasant diner, this place is hard to beat.  Their gyros are tasty and inexpensive, and they serve some of the best fries I've ever had.  And the service there is cheerful and attentive.  I love this place.

Text: Like an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, my first visit back in two years was filled with a comforting familiarity - same bustling, efficient and friendly servers and a fantastic Greek omelette. Not only do I recommend Zeus to locals, any travellers needing delicious comfort food will be quite pleased. If you get Amanda, its a real bonus, she has this amazing sixth sense that detects when your coffee needs a refill! I'm not ever going to wait two years pass between visits again.

Text: Needed some comfort food this afternoon, and made a trip to Zeus'. Tried the chopped sirloin steak, with mashed potatoes, and rice pilaf. The waitress was great, getting the cook to change up how it was made a bit for me. This is not a 5 star restaurant, necessarily, but the service is always great, and the food is 5 star, for the type of food that it is...the average coney island / diner type food. Love that place!

Text: The food was OK, I got the Philly cheese steak and my husband and son got a burger. But my daughter got a skillet when it got to the table with green pepper and onion that I was not aware came in it automatically I was told they could remake it but I would have to pay for another one, and my youngest son hot dog was hard.  The managers solution was a 10% discount. We will not be going back.
