Dos Rios Mexican Grill

Text: Had to have a late, late lunch so everyone was starved.  This was the only place found open on a Sunday afternoon after visiting the Peck Ranch.  Didn't know what we were getting into, but gave it a try.  It is probably one of the best Mexican places I've ate at.  Don't let the size fool ya.  We all left satisfied, full and happy.  They are real reasonably priced to boot.  We were impressed with the amount of food on our plates as well.

Text: Was on a road trip Thursday 8-17-2017 stopped in to have a bite to eat and was i blown away by the kindness of our waitress she was so friendly  and she even stopped by to let us know she was going on break and who our new waitress would be . I wish we could have told her before we left how kind she was and made our dining experience very enjoyable !!
