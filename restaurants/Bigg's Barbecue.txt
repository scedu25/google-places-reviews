Bigg's Barbecue

Text: Seriously LOVED the rootbeer. The St. Louis ribs were extremely tender and had an AMAZING flavour. I am a sauce guy and I didn't need sauce. But they have sweet, regular, and spicy sauces. Sweet is super good! Probably my favorite. Broccoli salad is solid. The okra was over salted, just dust it off. Everything was great. HIGHLY recommend.

Text: Good meat, decent pricing, meh sides.  I had a combo platter with three meats, each additional meat was only $2 more.  I had chicken, pulled pork and brisket.  Brisket was very good, pork was tasty but a little tough for my taste, chicken was tender was a little sweeter than I like.  Also had burnt end mac and cheese:  burnt ends were good, pasta was a little overcooked and not enough cheese flavor for me.

Good service, food came quickly, server was very responsible.

Text: There were three people in our party on a Friday evening.  Our food was delicious and the young woman who waited on us was attentive without being intrusive. We had a great experience and will return again!

Text: We had dinner on Thursday night - brisket, okra and slaw for me, brisket, garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli for my husband.  It was all very good, and we had a very personable and friendly waitress, Audrey.  She made our meal that much more enjoyable.

Text: Best BBQ in Lawrence! I love bringing my friends and family here when they come to visit. It's clean and comfortable. The food is so good and fresh. I have hard time ordering anything but the burnt ends, they are my favorite. This is a very kid friendly place. They understand that little kids and toddlers get rambunctious when they are hungry and tired and the staff really interact with them to create a fun experience which makes it easier on us parents. 
If you're looking for good BBQ then this is your place to go!
