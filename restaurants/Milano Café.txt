Text: My wife and I enjoy this Cafe very much. Food always good. My wife has twiced order the steak that was on the weekend special. And has had a excellent steak.
The Italian sausage is outstanding. After eating here we have no desire to go to the national chain Garden.
About same price but a higher quality food.
