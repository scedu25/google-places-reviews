Text: The rating says it all but I'll share a little bit of why we hated it. We waited 45 minutes for the food to be delivered to our table and then it was so bad in so many ways there is not enough room here to say. Even the complimentary desert the waitress gave us to take with us to try and rectify the situation was so bad that it was thrown away. We will never be back and would not recommend to anyone, no matter how much I didn't like them.
