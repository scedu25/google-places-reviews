Text: Beautiful interior. Private rooms for meetings and parties. Looks like an old warehouse restored. Lots of Windows...elegant with an open kitchen. Didn't really get a chance to sample much of the food. A friend and I had lunch there for the first time and both ordered the turkey viniagrette wrap. She actually was served a taco wrap which looked pretty much like the turkey wrap but after eating several bites realized she didn't get what she ordered. We let the waitress know, she apologized but that was it. She politely argued that she read the order back but "apparently we didn't hear her".  We aren't assertive people and my friend told me she wasn't? hungry so we just left.

Text: Food was good. Beer was warm, always is. Lemonade was extremely watered down. Then was rushed out. Waitress came and took our ticket before we were even done. Won't be going back anytime soon.

Text: Didnt really enjoy the main part but that was my opinion. Not terrible. The Salmon was Ok! Maybe just a bad day.
