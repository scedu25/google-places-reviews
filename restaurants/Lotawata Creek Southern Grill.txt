Text: My guests and I always have the most delightful experience when we come here. It's always well worth the wait when there is one. Wait staff is always pleasant and accommodating. We have been waited on by Peter a couple times now, and he's just spectacular in his demeanor. As always, we will be back. 110% recommend to anyone considering dining here for the first time!

Text: Make sure you bring your appetite! The portions are HUGE! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and the food is delicious! The fresh baked bread and cinnamon butter brought before the meal is worth the trip alone. The restaurant is themed to hunting and fishing, so if killing animals offends you - stay away. My advice is to pick a sandwich that you and a friend can agree on and split it. You will each get your own plate of fries and half the sandwich is still almost more than you can eat. I would love to try the dessert menu but I am always way too full! I never make a trip to St. Louis without stopping at Lotawata Creek!

Text: Celebrated my husband's birthday with family. Called ahead and spoke with Rod! Our party of 15 were seated less than 10 mins after arriving. Our waitress was very fun, knowledgeable and made great suggestions! The experience was awesome and the food was fantastic! The Big Heart Attack Burger is to die for.... I'm just saying!!! We don't live close by, but it was definitely worth the drive! We WILL be back soon.
