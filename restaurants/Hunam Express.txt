Text: Great place to grab late night take-out after hitting up the bars!  They fill your box completely full and you won't be able to finish it in one setting, I dare you.

Text: The food was eaten with much overflow... i wasn't really all that taken aback, especially looking forward, so that was enjoyed. I can't believe they don't push the hot braise sause more, its so ultramega OK. Plan b: delivery
