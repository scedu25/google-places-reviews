Text: Good first impression. Was quickly seated and served. Liked that they brought out a small comp cheese dip with salsa & chips. Had a  margarita which was ok. Good selection of Mexican beers. Tried the beef enchilada. This was a test run after trying another local Mexican restaurant that was marginal (that's being generous). I'll be back again. Highly recommend this place.

Text: Great friendly service. Awesome authentic Mexican food. Best in Kirksville by far.

Text: QUICK SERVICE! We barely got half way through the chips and salsa and the food was out. Not the best Mexican food place I've ever been to, but for the service and speed its worth stopping in for a quick bite. And... There aren't many other options around so this is a good choice.

Text: Service was excellent and it had the best atmosphere out of the Kirksville Mexican places.  Food was standard Tex Mex, no complaints there.  Can't beat Wednesday 99 cent Margaritas either...

Text: They had really excellent food for great prices. I got the cowboy fajita which comes with steak, chicken, shrimp, mushrooms & cheese... with a side plate of rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream & 3 tortillas... all for $8. Additionally, sometimes there is a communication breakdown due to the language barrier, however, there's a waiter named Aaron who always makes sure we get taken care of!
