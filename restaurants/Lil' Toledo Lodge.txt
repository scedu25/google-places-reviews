Lil' Toledo Lodge
Rating: 4
Text: Lil' Toledo lodge was a wonderful place for my family to stay. We came there to attend a celebration of life for my uncle, and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Everything about their property was beautiful. You could tell that they worked very hard to preserve the land the way it is. The staff was very friendly and understanding for all of our accommodations and needs. I would highly recommend this lodge for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors the way it is. Unaltered, untouched, and left in its own beauty.

Text: Lil Toledo it doesn't get any better, the service, the quality, the property you can't find anything to complain about if you tried. First rate people all around. Manager John Rickner takes great pride ensuring his customers are well taken care of. Bar none the finest all around facility in Kansas!
