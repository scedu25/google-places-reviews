The Owlery Restaurant

Text: Great food and drink choices. The place offers a lot of vegan alternatives but honestly you don't even notice the food is vegan, it's that well done. Also a very relaxed atmosphere so that you feel comfortable just going to dinner with friends. Bonus points for the great aesthetic.

Text: First time eating there for breakfast. Had the vegan Benedict, my wife had the tofu scrambled eggs. Both were really good. All the staff were extremely nice. Really cool atmosphere and vibe.

Text: i absolutely love this place. i always have a great experience here, and i consistently go for the BLT with fries. ugh, so yum !! i have also had the "chicken" wrap which is also yum. i will say though, lately i just get carry out because i do find that the staff is rather indifferent when waiting people. that's just my experience, though. and because of the lack of attention, it normally takes a while to get in and out. that's why i give only 4 instead of 5 stars, but i do adore this place ! especially those vegan cupcakes, y'all !!!!'

Text: I am IN LOVE w/ this artisan EATERY! Wise selection my friends! Excellent hosts and servers! Vegetarian and Vegan options sure to satisfy EVERYONE! Bloomington is Blessed to have the Owlery. (If they ever hire a bicycle courier to deliver food I'll work for Dragonfly beer and Sweet Potato Fries!)

Text: Over the top! Amazing food and desserts. My mother and brother recently decided to take on the vegan diet. Having a place like this is really encouraging for them as they make a big lifestyle change.
