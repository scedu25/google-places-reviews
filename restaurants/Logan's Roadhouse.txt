Text: We were seated right away. But then sat there for 20 minutes waiting on the waitress to take our order or even ask what we wanted to drink. I had to find the hostess to get someone to wait on us. I ordered a medium steak and got a rare one.  We've had good service before but not today. Also want to point out the place wasn't busy at all.

Text: We had the best service all due to the hospitality & friendly attitude of our server Cion!!  She took the time out of her long day she had already worked to talk to us & make us feel welcome!!  We found out that her & her family had moved because of Hurricane Katrina from Louisiana! God bless Cion!! ?

Text: What a dive not impressed with this place at all. It once was a great place to eat but now it stinks. I had not eaten in  this place in a while I was in the mood for a nice salad so I ordered a steak salad. The salad smelled like old refrigerator and the lettuce was all wilted looked like it had been sitting awhile uncovered? The steak was not even cooked as I ordered? The server was in his own little world as some of the staff. He took my order and never returned except to bring my food and when I flagged him down asking for rolls (which should have come with my meal) and a refill on my tea. No service what so ever sadly only thing I kinda enjoyed was the yeast rolls expensive meal for rolls? I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy poor service and food. Diner Beware.
