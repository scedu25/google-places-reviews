Text: A great place for families and group outings.  Everything from arcade games, bowling, rope walks, to lazer tag.  They also have great snacks if you get hungry from having all that fun!!!

Text: Took my daughter bowling for the first time. Despite the mess from construction (understandable) the customer service in the dinner Completely sucked! The girls were rude That waited on us. I don't understand how you could scoff so many times during an order. Especially when I paid well over 30 $$$ for 2 adult meals and a kids meal. If you're going to charge so much for food. At least have friendly people serving the food! Sadly I don't know that we will be back again. At least not to eat.  However even though the prices are high. She had an awesome time bowling.

Text: Well. My card wasn't working, then machines were taking money and not letting me play. My gun didn't work at all during laser tag (and they didn't offer anothet game or a refund) then we played one of the two player games in the private room and mine didn't work at all... Again. So yea, waste of money.
