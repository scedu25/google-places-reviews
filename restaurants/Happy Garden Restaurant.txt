Text: SUPERB!! You can't beat the price here and the value of it. Nice and accommodating staff, any time I ask for something they deliver. As for the delivery times they do sometimes take long but it's not as long as the other people here say, at most it's only about an hour or so. The food is great and I cannot repeat that enough. Each bite is packed and bursting with flavor, and again at a good price. You'll be doing yourself a favor by coming to this restaurant. Also might I recommend the Szechuan Chicken. It's a must try and must go!!

Text: Called to order sweet and sour pork. Asked them to put the sauce on it and the lady said we dont do that here its on the side... very rude to. Like if someone wants it on the pork instead the side why cant you??? Needless to say I told her id go somewhere else and hung up. Will NEVER ORDER ANYTHING HERE AGAIN

Text: For take out this place is awesome!! Their food is amazing. I'd over look everything else people review poorly here just because their food is so awesome. If you stick to take out you won't be disappointed. Buffet and delivery aren't their strong suit.
