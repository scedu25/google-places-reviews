Text: I have gone to this establishment since I was little. Always great food. Yesterday was a different story. Our waitress was wonderful, quick, and easy going. On the otherhand, our food wasn't. I ordered cheesecurds for an appetizer and it came out cold. When the main entree finally arrived, our fries were cold and hard. That's the best part of this place, is the fries. Unfortunately, $40 for a meal was not for me and I probably won't be back.

Text: A quick stop for lunch.  My favorite mushroom Swiss burger removed from the menu!!!  However the kitchen happily made it for me.  Great burger.  Excellent service.  Will be back.

Text: Lots of TV'S with sports on as promised. Medium priced food with decent sized servings. Burgers, Steaks, Pasta, and seafood. Also craft beer. Nice atmosphere.

Text: Awesome place to eat. Great atmosphere for a sports fan. Manager and bartender went out of their way to find a Cardinals game to not only put on a smaller screen that I asked for to be polite but, they put it on the main screen in the bar. Highly recommend their food and customer service!
