Text: Sorry, tonight was NOT a good experience.  We've had great meals with you in the past, so we brought friends tonight to have a nice dinner.  Took forever to even order, then things  were incorrect,  wrong salads, wrong drinks,  way overdone steak and a pork chop very dry. Vegetable we ordered was "out" so something substituted without asking.  Weak excuses about being understaffed with a large crowd,  but should have been expected as it's State Fair week here.  Offered a free dessert,  which we didn't even want to try.  It will be hard to get us back.

Text: Everyone should treat themselves to a leisurely lunch at this delightful restaurant in the historic Bothwell hotel. The food is good and the ambiance is great. If you are ever lucky enough to be there on a day when cream of mushroom soup is on the menu, do yourself a favor and try a cup. It's the best I've ever had, bar none.

Text: This is one of the worst eating establishments I have ever been to!  We waited over 1.5 hours to get our food and it was wrong!  I got a steak that was undercooked and cold when it was served to me.  I would not recommend this to anyone!
