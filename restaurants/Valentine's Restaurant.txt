Text: A hidden gem downtown Freeburg serving up delicious steaks and more. Their blue cheese dressing is divine. The service is friendly and thorough. The atmosphere is cozy. Don't let the boring outside fool you. Step inside to a great steakhouse.

Text: First time visit to this family owned steakhouse. Nice service and nice quiet restaurant. 14 oz. Ribeye was excellent with choice of 2 sides. May be a bit pricey to some, but worth it for a delicious steak.

Text: This was a quirky local restaurant. My ribeye was really good. My wife's filet was awful. 
Their famous blue cheese dressing is worth the hype, but the salad it went on was not. Service was friendly and the guy at the bar sang along with some of what was supposed to be background music. Ultimately, quite pricey for the atmosphere and inconsistency.
