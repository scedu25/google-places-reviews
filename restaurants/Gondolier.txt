I've been back now several times - never disappointed - simply a great Italian restaurant.

Text: Excellent Italian food. We had Chicken Alfredo and spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs, with house salad.  Everything tasted so fresh! The housemade blue cheese dressing is amazing. But wait, save room for dessert. The best cheesecake ever and the suicide chocolate cake is delicious! Angela, our waitress, was great. She ranks at the top.  You will not be disappointed!

Text: Great service and homemade food. Desserts, especially homemade cheesecakes, that give any New York place a run for their money.
