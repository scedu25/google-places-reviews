Text: I wish I could have more than 2 stars.  I truly do.  Beautiful place with very nice food. I was very excited upon entering,  unfortunately service was...   .... Let's just say horrible and not even go to details. I can understand many things, but the amount of problems in a single visit?  Too much is too much....

Text: A great place for food that shows sophistication and creativity. They are committed to local sourcing and absolute freshness. In some cases the food you eat came out of the ground that same morning. 
In good weather the rooftop offers a spectacular addition to the dinner.

Text: Love this place... nice staff, service, food and ambiance.  Perfect for a special occasion.  We have even gone here just for dessert.  The marscapone cheesecake is to die for.

Text: Our server was really great at his job, five stars for him. Same with the space, it's a great place to sit outside. The food however is not impressive. I got the eggplant dish and it was very disappointing. It came with a salad that was just a few ingredients thrown together. The kind of salad you would expect from a chain, not an upscale rooftop venue. It's disappointing as a vegetarian when restaurants put little to no thought into their vegetarian options. Of the 3 options, two have goat cheese. The fries on the side were even soggy. I wouldn't recommend this place to eat at, might be better to eat before then just do drinks.

Text: Very Disappointed
Visited for a special event. The rooftop setting is lovely but the food was not good.  Sea Bass ($35) was a like a brick and fishy, sent it back.  Waiter suggested ravioli as a quick replacement.  The pasta was gummy, overcooked while the filling was cold.  Taste would have bee good if not ruined by prep.  Staff tried to make it right but the evening was ruined.
