Text: We ate here last night the beer dinner collaboration with Dayton Beer Company. The atmosphere is very inviting. The food was amazing and the beer pairings were spot on. The Chef and whole staff was great and did an awesome job of explaining each course  and how they came to the pairings.  I'm ready for the next one

Text: I really want to love this place.  They have a good beer and drink selection and the food menu looks good.  BUT, it is so bright it's like sitting on the face of the sun!  They really need to dim the lighting.  It feels incredibly sterile and not a comfortable atmosphere to relax.  They would keep people around if they dim the lighting - and probably save a boatload on their electric bill.  :-)

Text: Ate here today. I had what they try to pass as a fish taco. It was awful. Over cooked fish, soggy coleslaw or whatever it was. The only thing that had any decent flavor was the taco. Not once were we asked about our meal.
