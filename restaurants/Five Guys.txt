Text: Honestly, this location deserves less than one star. Me and my fiancé went to Five Guys on 1/5/16 at 1:30pm.  First time experience for us was utterly disappointing. We ordered a cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger, two regular drinks, a large fry, and little cajun fry. This costed us ~$30.  This wouldn't of been an issue as I dont mind paying a lot for a good burger and fries. This wasn't the case however, the fries are without question the worst we have ever experienced,  both regular and cajun. The burgers were decent but they don't even take the time to melt the cheese (still cold).  I never make reviews but I felt obligated to tell anyone about to waste their money here to just go to sonic next door.

Text: Fries were burned. Only three fries in the bag. What happen to filling the cup and the bag? Prices when up and amount went down. 

The guy at the register was smiling and friendly. He gave excellent service.

Text: Amazing Burger's with plenty of options to customize your way. Always Juicy unlike most fast food places. But their food is pricy.

Text: Oooooh Five Guys! Consistently awesome burgers and half of Idaho, sliced, fried and poured into my bag! When I have to eat fries for 10 minutes just to get down to my meal, it's a good day!

Friendly service, accurate order, and enough food to keep me gruntled all night. WELL DONE!
