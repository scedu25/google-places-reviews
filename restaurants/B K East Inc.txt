Text: I love this place because its in my hometown AND it food is great, the root beer is always cold and like I always remember it to be.  I go whenever I'm home and while the season permits.  I guess I always will.  Its a hometown place and supports jobs for young people.

Text: so I went to B&K east with my mom today 9/17/17 at 3:25 and we didn't get all our food first then when I told my mom we didn't have everything then the lady in the blue shirt   inside started making faces and mocking my mom and then the lady came out and we asked is she making fun of us and the lady said no she wasn't and said only that we needed her for our food and started giggling when we had asked. That's my review and I'm never going there again!
