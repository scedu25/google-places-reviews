Text: Totally fantastic. We ate outside and it was beautiful. Everything was delicious, service was excellent. Totally cool about customizing menu options for vegan and vegetarian friendly options. (Bruschetta no cheese, and a pizza with no cheese, all the veggies.) If you're considering pizza at the Pizza Hut a few doors down, do yourself a favor and just eat here instead for the real thing.

Text: This used to be my favorite restaurant, it's just not as good as it used to be. However, the service was great. It's a great place to go if you're ever in Dodge City!
