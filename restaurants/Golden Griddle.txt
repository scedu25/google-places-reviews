Text: Very disappointing visit here today. Waitress was clueless and does not have the personality or people skills to be a waitress.  Never checked on us. Had to flag her down for everything from silverware, more water, and finally the check. Bloody Mary was watery and probably a virgin. Breakfast buffet was also very disappointing and nothing like the picture shown here. It was more like a continental breakfast at a hotel. Food was dry and had been there for quite sometime. Rolls were so hard you could break teeth. I had high expectations for this place being a sister establishment to the Q. Sadly it didn't live up to said expectations.

Text: Scrambled eggs should be firm, but moist. Unfortunately, every brunch item with egg is cooked until it is overly dry. That includes about 3 or 4 items on the brunch bar. The rest of the brunch menu is okay. The self serve waffle is good. Could use a better setup though so the toppings look more attractive.
