Fireside Pizza

Text: So disappointing lately. I live nearby and go pretty frequently. It used to be such a warm, friendly atmosphere but lately, last few times I've been, the bartenders are rude and the  pizza always black on bottom. Oven obviously needs to be scraped out more.

Text: Fantastic pizza in a fun, laid-back atmosphere. Very reminiscent of neighborhood pizza bars from the 70s...pure Americana. They even have a couple arcade games. :-)

Text: Fireside Pizza is the best brick oven pizza I've had in Cincinnati. It is located in an old firehouse station and there are even murals and pictures on the walls from when it was a functioning firehouse. The pizza is delicious and there are various specialty pizzas as well as a seasonal pizza that is changed every month or so. They have a fairly wide choice of beers including a changing draft list as well as wine and liquor. It's great for kids and it even has 2 arcade machines!  The history and feel in the restaurant is amazing. I love the white pie with bacon and jalopenos, and basically all of their seasonal pizzas.  

Fireside just started Monday trivia night, and occasionally have small bands that play in the evenings - a cool touch.  The fact that they can deliver if you're down the street at a bar or close by is awesome. Fun and highly recommended!

Text: Very cool atmosphere. Like how the place is opened up to the outside. Pizza is really good, with a great crunchy crust. The seasonal pizzas are on point too ??
