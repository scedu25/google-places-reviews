Text: Broad menu choices that are done well. Thats rare! I like the Patty melt and the French dip. Their Chef salad is dinner plate sized and delicious. This eatery is very busy in summer months. They also are the only business outside of the Sherman Dairy company store that serves Sherman ice cream products as their desert offering.

Text: Wonderful little spot, great for visitors and locals. Had both a lunch meal and an ice cream. The "single" ice cream can have two flavors and is big enough to share (or not if you love your ice cream). Waffle cones are made fresh here. Whole meal for one was under $15.

Text: A staple in this community, Captain Nemos has never failed us.  Good food and the best ice cream from Sherman's, it will surely be a good stop while in town.  Beware of long lines at peak hours, this place is very popular.
