Text: The lane conditions were pretty good but the approach was very tacky... Very sticky. I have a pair of sst7 and changed to my slickiest slide and sole and still was sticking. Approached the. Person at counter they did not wipe it off. Also the help was decent and it took getting a manager to get anything done.

Text: Over priced. Two games for three people was $50.  Food was $35.  None of the arcade games worked.  The guy at the front desk was rude and mad at the world that night.  Had to ask him three times to put the bumpers up for the kids.  I'll go somewhere else from now on.

Text: Went with a group, was cool with special lighting. After closing we were chatting in the parking lot before leaving. Someone noticed they forgot their phone inside. The guys closing had found it and opened to doors to give it back. They laughed and were so funny. Thanks for helping a girl out guys.
