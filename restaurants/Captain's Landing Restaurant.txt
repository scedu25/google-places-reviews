Captain's Landing Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: All 5 in our family love eating at Captain's Landing when we are in the area. It's close to the lake without driving all the way into Centerville or somewhere else. Good food, delicious burgers, the pizza is good too. Friendly people own/run the place. It's always clean and bright, nice clean restrooms too which is always wonderful. You can eat inside or out, or pickup at the drive-thru window. We're usually too full for ice cream, but if you do get it, the 'small' is pretty big :) We like the nautical decor too, no trip to the lake is complete without stopping off here at least once...or twice...

Text: Food is s great, cozy atmosphere, people are friendly and kind. Reminds me of the old school days of small town ice cream/food places. Price is a lil higher than I'm used to, but not crazy. Four ppl ate for $45.
