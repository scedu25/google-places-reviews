Text: "Best Mexican food in the country" Such a bold claim. Wonder what country they were referring to. Maybe their experience with the country doesn't extend past the city limits of Great Bend.

Right away the salsa for the appetizer chips was Paste Picante type of salsa and it was cold. Not authentic at all. And what Mexican restaurant doesn't have Fajitas? The whole menu itself was plain. Not much to choose from. And when we finally ordered the food was terrible. both myself and my colleague could not finish.About the only good thing I will say is the staff was very friendly. 

If you want authentic Mexican food then avoid this place.  Find somewhere else. Even a Taco Bell would be more authentic than this place.

Text: The service is excellent. They offer daily specials, like Taco Thursday $1.35 corn tacos. The food is fresh & a good value.

Text: We lived in Great Bend back in the early 80's and used to eat here all the time. My mother still talks about how good the salsa and fried chile rellenos were. Hope to make it out there again one day.
