Text: The best in town!  You will need reservations.  Great steaks.  Good place for a romantic dinner.  You can't go wrong at the Cork.  Wonderful salad bar.  Be sure and go hunger.

Text: Great food, great service! The last two times I was there, I was seated at the same horrible table where you're sitting on the laps of the people next to you. The waitress was awesome though and told us the table number so hopefully I can avoid this spot next time.

Text: We came here with friends and it was the best experience I've had in a long time. Unexpected experience in Fort Wayne. 
We did have reservations which made it so easy to get in and enjoy a dinner. Bakers street is very clean and well kept up. Our server greeted us quickly and asked if we'd been there and explained the specials and the menu. She let me order off the kids menu because I cannot eat an adult meal without any issues. She brought bread to start and filled our glasses frequently. The meals were prepared in a timely fashion and when delivered they were excellent. Fresh and prepared very well. Perfect portions for a meal with some leftovers. Dessert was offered but we chose to skip because we were all full.

Text: The service was absolutely astounding. I don't think any other restaurant can compete with our server. I had the scallops which were delicious. As I couldn't have peanuts, they used a separate grill and made fresh noodles especially for me.

Text: This place is comparable to my favorite steakhouses in the bigger cities for a fraction of the cost.   The salad bar was fantastic.  Best place I've found in Fort Wayne so far.
