Text: They rave about how great and wonderful the food is. I thought it was alright. I wouldn't pay the $20.00 of my own money to eat here. I simply can't eat $20.00 worth of food to justify it. But hey, if you don't care about the price then go ahead. Or if you just ran an iron man and are starving for a million calories then go ahead. It really is pretty decent and they have a nice selection. Plus they have a dwarf to greet you every time at the door. Who doesn't want to have a dwarf greet you?!?

Text: Buffet was very nice. We got there right at 4:00 & everything was placed & ready to go for the customers. 
Approximately 7 types of meat. Sweet corn, green beans, baked beans, Mac& cheese. 
The deserts were just insane!
From banana pudding (so many bananas), coconut cream pie, black berry cobbler, pecan pie. And much more!

The wait staff was very nice and was there in a jiffy to get your empty plate & refill your drink.

Text: Average at best! Haven’t been here for several years! Remember the salad bar as being GREAT! But sadly not anymore! Very few choices & only iceberg lettuce. No chicken on buffet line. Ribs were pretty good but everything else bland. Too bad!

Text: We were in town for a football tournament and this place came highly recommended by several people. We decided to try it and I'm glad we did. Everything we ate we loved, and we ate a lot! Friendly service and great prices! We will definitely come back here if we're ever in Owensboro again!
