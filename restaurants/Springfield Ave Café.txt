Text: Chicken fried steak and broccoli soup  was excellent! Had a tossed salad it was good. It was kinda warm and you could tell the cheese had been sitting out. Serve wasn't bad but wasn't excellent either. She could use some improvement. All in all wonderful place. Would come back and recommend!

Text: Thought this place was a cafe, but I was wrong. It smelled musky and moldy. The food was horrible. Ordered a mushroom and Swiss burger and my kids ordered chicken nuggets. The burger was cold and the mushroom weren't even fresh. The Swiss cheese was a square piece and wasn't even melted. Kids nuggets were dinosaur shapes like you can buy from WalMart.  The staff wasn't nice and was rude. Even the soda drinks were flat. Place only had 8 customer so it wasn't busy. I would rather eat at Burger King then at this place.

Text: We went to Smith's first and experienced poor service and waited 45 mins for food that never arrived. We left and went to springfield ave cafe and got great service and our food came out in 15 mins. They will be our first choice from now on.
