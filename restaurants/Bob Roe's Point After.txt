Text: Great pizza, yummy wings, and a page full of delicious appetizers!! Don’t miss out on Monday nights when they have their pizza special and don’t miss Wing Wednesday! Best burgers in town too (especially for the price). You’ve  gotta try the Silver Dollar potatoes!! One of my favs. And sour cream dip with everything !! The waitstaff is awesome too.

Text: so I've tried this place multiple times now from in the restraint to carry out to delivery.  I can say always a disappointment but tonight takes the cake.  yea it was a Friday so I understand it's busy, but when the server Katie comes and asks for your drink order and forgets half of them it doesn't go well.  then asks if we are ready to order but never have had a menu, it's hard to.  well we ordered a jumbo and a small  pizza 20 wings asked for first and a combo platter.  while waiting for food watched employees drop stuff on the floor and pick it up and put it back on the plate.  police out of the picture and eat it, drop the wash cloth on the floor then use it on a table.  enough cross contamination to kill everyone.  so after 45 min.  the wings finally make it to the table.  had to beg for refills.  then watch Katie lean against the counter drinking her drink for 5 to 10 min at a time. she would then disappear for  awhile.  while she was gone watched our pizzas get dropped off at their warmer table that has customers leaning against it the whole time setting their drinks right next to our food.  it sat there for 10 min.  Katie finally comes back and gets them and drops them off to us without the combo platter 1hr 25 min after we ordered them.  as other tables that came in after us have eaten.  now as for the food.  the wings were hot and cooked perfectly ,but the sauce is far from good more grease than wing sauce.  the pizzas were warm and just a thought for the cooks.  the sauce is suppose to be all over the pie not just a thick mess on the outside 1 inches.  it's this way every time we order one.  and it's not a sauce it's a paste out of. a can. I have worked in the food industry for over 12 years from cooking to management, the amount of health code violations sickens me.  no hats on cooks no beard nets, the restrooms are scary, you are making money fix them and maybe try to clean them once And the other thing mentioned before should have this place closed.   well I've given you many chances but after this disgusting display you will never get a penny from our family again. you will end up killing  someone.
