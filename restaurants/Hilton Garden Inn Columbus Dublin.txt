Text: I came here for a conference. The hotel’s staff was very friendly and helpful. The manager, Amber, in particular helped me out very much with printing because it was currently not working. I mistakenly even left my phone charger at my house and she provided me with one. Aaron at the desk very helpful as well. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone in the Dublin area.

Text: They had very friendly service. The room was very clean. Only down side was they don't have many doors around the building so you do have to walk to get into the building.
