Text: Ivanhoe's food is outstanding, fresh and very tasty.  Always  a nice friendly atmosphere. Do not let the crowds scare you away, moves very quickly.  Employees always clean and friendly.  Great place.

Text: Busy place with excellent ice cream.   Opened at 2 pm on Sunday.   Arrived a bit early.   Waited for them to open and it was well worth it.   I got orange pineapple ice cream, which I'm unable to get in the West.   Others got sundaes and all were smooth, creamy and delicious.

Text: Might have to wait a bit for table/food. Well worth it. Great for ice cream as well, tons of options to choose from.. If in season, get the strawberry short cake!?

Text: The food and ice cream are always fresh, but pretty ordinary. On my latest visit the teen crew was extraordinarily slow on both our food order and our ice cream order. Our party of four ordered a fried chicken salad, meatless nachos, a chicken sandwich and a Coney dog. Thirty minutes seems too long to wait on so-called fast food.

Text: We were impressed by the menu selections!  Wow!  After finally making up our mind, though it took a few minutes it was worth the wait!  Now I understand why this place was so very busy!  You sure gotta stop in here and try it soon!
