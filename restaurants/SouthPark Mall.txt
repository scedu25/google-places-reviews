SouthPark Mall

Text: It's okay for an up and coming mall. I have been there every once in a while for the past 20 years, so I've known a lot of the work that has been there. It went downhill fast and they did a lot to bring it back. There are some great stores there, but the mall itself still feels a little bare, like it is missing something. 
Regardless I am sure in the next couple of years it will be great, and it still serves it's purpose now. I mean they have a bubble tea now!

Text: Would give more stars if I could. My family loves this place! I come here every time all my friends and I are back from college and can go out together! Owner is a very nice man. Polite waiting staff as well.

Text: My wife and daughter and her boyfriend went this mall to do shopping there and my daughter rode the mechanical bull that's for kids she weighs 80 lbs. and a security guard showed up and was completely rude to my family. We will never come back to this mall and spend money there again this pisses me off and employees are extremely rude and disrespectful

Text: The remake has feld. They should have followed my advise. Turned it into an open air center like Oak Brook!

Text: Good Ambience and a good mix of shopping and eateries. Though the eateries have reduced in number. Good place to visit with family.
