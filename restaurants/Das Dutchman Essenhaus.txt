Text: Great place to eat at. Go between 11am  and 3 pm for the buffet it's cheaper by a couple of dollars. I drive here which 40 miles away from my house.  I come back about 2 times or more a month just for the great food and atmosphere. Here again November 9th 2017

Text: Absolutely the best place to go for family style Amish dining. Their endless variety of pies have been famous for decades. In the early 70's, my Great Uncle would stop and get pies when visiting his hometown in northern Iowa from DC. Now that we live close by, Essenhaus pies are still able to find their way to the Thanksgiving table in Iowa.

Text: This is the best restaurant around. And ever since they got the buffet, I have loved it even more. The best meats are the fried chicken, fish, and roast beef. And the stuffing and mac&cheese are the best I've ever had.
I was very disappointed in the breakfast, but lunch and dinner are the best.

Text: Buffet is wonderful. Nice offering of salad fixings and the potato salad is especially good. Also good selection of hot foods. Don't miss the noodles and mashed potatoes!
