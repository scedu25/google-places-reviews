Text: A very nice family run and oriented restaurant.   They have a very nice breakfast buffet and nice salad bar.  And at night they have dinner bars.  Great home cooked food.  Good service.

Text: A great big 5 stars for our service at Jim Dandy. Our waitress Leanna was excellent. She shows amazing job performance, grace under pressure, fantastic work ethic, phenomenal organizational skills, and a great care for her patrons. She helped create the perfect dining atmosphere for myself and my children. If you are in Greenfield and are looking for a family atmosphere with a home cooked dining experience, then I invite you to join us at Jim Dandy and ask for Leanna.

Text: The breakfast Buffett was okay. Pancakes in the Buffett were definitely horrible. Server asked if we wanted refills after we were presented our bill. Maybe it was an off day for the cooks and servers. All and all I left full.

Text: The Broasted chicken was excellent. Not too greasy just right. Plenty of food for 2 for under $30 counting tip.
