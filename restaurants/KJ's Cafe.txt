Text: The food you get for the price you pay is a steal. Never have we had a bad meal here. The chicken fried steak is a very healthy dose of food. The French toast is wonderful. Coffee is a cafe brew for sure, pretty strong but not too strong for someone who doesn't drink it often. To sit down, eat, and leave you could be there for only 20 minutes or the waitresses are very good about not pressuring you out the door and you can stay an hour. I can't stress the value of the meal. You can also pick and choose to more or less build your perfect homemade breakfast. I would always suggest eating here.

Text: Every year I come here to eat breakfast and  enjoy the ladies company. Very friendly and always smiles. The cooks do an amazing job of bringing you hot and fresh home cooked meals that taste just like mom used to make. I am a customer for life. Always great service and lots of laughs. Thank you for a little slice of heaven  in the middle of nowhere Nebraska making it somewhere to go for sure.
