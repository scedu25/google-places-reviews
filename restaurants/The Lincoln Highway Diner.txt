Text: Great mom and pop diner. Friendly wait staff. Large portion sizes. Tasty, affordably priced food, and a very homey feel inside.

I had the breakfast burrito and it tasted great and was more than enough food. My girlfriend had the mushroom Swiss omelette which she really enjoyed as well.

Text: I can't decide which is better at the North side LHD, the food or the service. We always feel right at home there. The entire staff is friendly. The portion sizes are such that there's no reason anyone should leave hungry. It's good, down to Earth home style cooking. We recommend this location quite frequently.
