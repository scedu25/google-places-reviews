Fat Sandwich Company

Text: Great for what it is. Quick whole in the wall place. I went for lunch and the lunch combos were a decent price. The cheese steak was pretty good. Place looks a little shady, but my meal was good. I'd go back again to try a fat sandwich.

Text: Pricey food for drunk college students. Great for them . . . bad for anyone not wanting some sort of heart-burn. Ouch!

Text: Do not come here for food, come here for drunk food. Criminally unhealthy and eyebrow-raising names, but delicious greasy,  stacked sandwich combos. Expect up to 30min experience after the bars let out. But if your drunk self is willing to wait, it will thank you and your thighs will hate you. Also, barely any seating.

Text: You get what you expect from a place called Fat Sandwich. Of course it's greasy and unhealthy, that's basically in the description of each item on the menu - it's a sandwich made from fried foods... If that's shocking, this probably isn't the place for you. 

The Fat MILF is magic though - it's cheesesteak, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, bacon and fries on top with mayo and ketchup. Sounds gross but it tastes incredible. 10/10 - would eat all the time if I could

Text: Criminally unhealthy selection of menu items that can only appeal to the discerning college student unafraid of calories.  If there should be an academically accepted antonym of "gourmet restaurant", this is a strong contender.
