Text: A nice place to eat. The staff is friendly. The food is good. There are daily specials. The ice cream is great (and they can add plenty of goodies!). The fare leans toward a burger joint. Everything is cooked to order and brought to your table. You can dine in, or pick up food to go. There is even a pick up window. Nice decor and a clean, family friendly place to eat.

Text: Best gizzards ever!  The gizzards were mostly meat with a little breading,  which is exactly how they should be. Better yet,  the meat and the breading were both packed with so much flavor that I couldn't stop eating them. 

I saw the review mentioning lactose free icecream after I finished my banana split. I had to stop and ask about that on the way out,  since I haven't had ice cream that creamy anywhere west of the Mississipi before today. 

Excellent, excellent place. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in this part of Nebraska again.
