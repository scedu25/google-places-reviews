Text: Ive eaten the coconut curry here for years. I feel like it be cooked to order but now it's just done in a big pot. It's more expensive than it use to be and there's less chicken. Also, you have to request the side sauces now.. what's coconut curry chicken without the coconut? Just curry. The chicken has been chewy the last few times I've gotten it too.

Text: Coconut curry chicken use to be very good. Now you have to ask for the coconut, which it's coconut curry chicken so that doesn't make sense. Over the years they stopped giving as much chicken as before and its chewy. I used to love this place but the last two times that I've been it has been horrible and I will never return. It's a shame because this used to be an amazing restaurant. Also they only serve canned beverages as in pops and beers it is very expensive. $7 for one can of Jackie O's beer.

Text: Food was good. Salad dressing was fantastic. Service was just right. Slightly over priced for what you get in my opinion. However, I am from another state and I'm basing this on same type of cuisine in same type of restaurant back home.
