Harvest Kitchen and Bar

Text: Pretty good food, but way overpriced. Took the wife there for lunch on a work day. She got a salad, I got a chicken sandwich w/ fries a small side salad. Costed  $35 bucks w/ 15% tip.

The place was totally empty. I imagine a lot of that had to do w/ the prices.

Text: So at $40 a plate plus, no guest should really leave feeling like their food was mediocre, unappetizing or just plain yucky. Unfortunately two out of four in our group had that opinion. Service was kind of mediocre if not worse. And interestingly, almost nobody seems to be eating here. I wonder why.
