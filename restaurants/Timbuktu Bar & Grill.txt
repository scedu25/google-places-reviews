Text: This is the best cheeseburger I've had in a while. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Despite being very busy, the staff seemed to work like a well oiled machine. Our food was delivered to our table promptly and our drinks were always full. I highly recommend Timbuktu Bar & Grill. We will definitely be back!

Text: OMG the hamburger was awesome and I'm sure it's because of the meat they use from Yoder Meats! The onion rings were absolutely delicious as well!
