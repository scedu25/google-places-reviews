Text: First visit and delighted! The marinara is so light and fresh and the Alfredo sauce is to die for! If you stop in, ask for Jacob! Has a fantastic server! The little girl in the next booth didn't eat her food and he not only inquired if she didn't like it but offered to switch it out for something she might like better! Has terrific and the food was fantastic!

Text: We loved this place. Service was good, ambient decent, and food good. Priced fair, food was tasty and like fresh prepared. We were on vacation in the Osage Beach, and ended up going several times for lunch and dinner. Pizzas were tasty as well as the pasta. If you are looking for the Italian alike food I would recommend Li'l Rizzo's over Domenico's any time.

Text: The food was awesome and the gentleman that greeted me at the door and made my drink was very cool.. However, my waiter, I sat at the bar, I've definitely had better.. Believe her name was Jessica. I wish I got the gentleman's name.

Text: Great food! Usually extremely slow getting food. Kids like it and menu options but usually run out of patience waiting in their chairs.

Text: I like the Tuscan like feel, very cozy, warm and inviting. I had the Italian Wedding Soup which was very good. The main dish was also not too bad either. Lunch specials are great.
