Casa Sol

Text: The food was absolutely amazing, but the second shift waitress was horrible, it was the first time we had been in there in almost a year, and it was the same waitress as we had the last time we had been in there, being a waitress myself, I was very disappointed in the fact that she hadn't improved at all in a year.  I would have understood had they been busy, but there was us (my boyfriend & I) and one table of 3 that walked in after us. It took 15 mins just to get our drinks, and another 10 just to get chips and salsa. Like I said the food was phenomenal, they just either need to train her way better or find someone that actually knows what they are doing

Text: I have eaten at literally every Mexican restaurant in Farmington. Caza Sol is the worst. The salsa tastes like it comes from a can, and everything else is just the same menu items as everywhere else, just more bland  and uninspired. My order wasn't right, and that was after we had to seat ourselves. I would recommend just going to any other Mexican restaurant instead.
