Text: Went here for a family member's wedding and the venue was nicely set up it overlooked a small "lake" with indoor and outdoor setting. The food was also great nothing we ate was bad at all.

Text: Had our wedding here. Can't begin to compliment the management and staff. They make you feel as if they truly want this to be the best day you've had. I found out afterwards about a few extra little things they did when they didn't have to just to make sure it was what my wife and I wanted. NO ONE else in the industry would have cared to go the extra mile Mark, Ali, & Jennifer did to make it special. Wouldn't hesitate for a moment in booking with them again!
