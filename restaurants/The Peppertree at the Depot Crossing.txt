Text: I had the Iowa chop and it was the best pork chop I have ever had! So tender and juicy! The loaded baked potatoe was delicious as well. I would of gave 5 stars but my martini I had was so gross they didn't make it right so I had to order something else

Text: The food was amazing! The atmosphere is really neat! The hostess was very helpful! Even when I had to ask her for our waitress. That's where they lost two stars because we had horrible service.  After asking for the waitress, it still took about 5 minutes for the waitress to come to the table. And we after we waited for about 15 minutes after finishing our food, we had to ask a different server for our check. Horrible service, just horrible.
