Text: The waitress we had was good, as was the food. The only reason for four stars is that there was not enough parking available. We had to wait for someone to pull out to get a space.

Text: Terrible service. The pizza will be good one day then sub par the next. You can't count on consistency. It's a shame because on the days the pizza is good...its the best in town.

Text: Great food! Iconic dubuque place. Love how the restaurant has multiple options for dining. Only things i would change is the lighting and the leg room. Tables are close together, hard to walk thru the place.

Text: Kind of disappointed with a couple of things. 
1. Cannot get delivered unless you spend $15 or more.
2. My total was at $11 so I got a bowl of soup to make the difference. The soup was $4 and some change. My bill magically went to $20.14. Gratuity and delivery are not added to the bill. 
So. How. Did. My. Bill. Get. So. High!?! 
3. It took 55 minutes from call to delivery. Mind you I am only 5 blocks away. 

Saddened by situation. Now that it's finally here, let's see how it tastes...

Text: Staff was alright and appetizers were very lackluster. Soda machine needed a syrup change or a cleaner source of water. However the pizza is phenomenal and that's what someone should go there for. Pizza is 5 star worthy.
