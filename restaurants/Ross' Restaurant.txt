Text: Family in Iowa suggested this place when I came out to visit them. So we all went and I checked it out. Although, it is a local restaurant with local suppliers which I love so much, the food was pretty damn good... Service was right on point... I just wish they had more of selection in the dinner section. Overall solid 4 Stars

Text: A Quad Cities tradition... Although it's moved, it's kept its original charm. Good food, great service, wonderful atmosphere.  Since moving, they have expanded their menu to include more local, vegetarian and healthy options but still have customer favorites like their Magic Mountain and the Volcano. QC Casual dining and open all night.

Text: You almost got 5 stars. The food was superb, oversized portions, great prices.... But dropped the ball. My biggest pet peeve when eating out is waiting and waiting and waiting 5 minutes for a drink refill. Everything else was grand, but got to keep those cups filled. Will recommend this restraunt to other's though.

Text: Amazing place with a really kind staff. The breakfast is stellar, I have been going sense a kid and the food has never changed. It's has a nice environment with a classic taste that is perfect for a calm morning out. I would say if you're not from here, it's a good place to try out if you want a taste of the Midwest. I may be a bit bias but it's a great place

Text: Good greasy spoon. It's a classic that many celebrities have visited and, the new location is ok too.. kinda pricey but isn't everything now?
