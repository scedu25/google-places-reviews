Text: My son and I went in after attending a  High School Football Game at MSU, we sat there for an hour and watched as other people who came in after we ordered were served before us and finished eating before we even received our food, 

They brought out half of one order the rice and potatoes but without the steak I set a timer for 7 minutes to wait on  the  rest of the food, It went to 0, we got up and left.

I'd give then a -1 if Google would let you rate like that.

Text: We stopped in while on vacation. The waiter refused to answer any questions and was extremely impatient. He had no reason to be so rude. It took 45 minutes to get the food and it came out at different times for my family. We will not be back on our next trip. The food was ok and over priced. Save your family the annoyance and don't go. The bathrooms were nasty like a previous person said.
