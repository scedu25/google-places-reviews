Text: Stopped here for lunch. Had the fried chicken  with mashed potatoes and gravy and chunky apple sauce. Someone must have gone down south and stole our fried chicken recipe. This was outstanding southern style fried chicken.  The mashed potatoes were obviously home made because they were lumpy. Gravy was outstanding. All in all this could have passed for cooked in the south.

Text: Stopped in here during a road trip. The food was so good I stopped by on the way back too! I had the Reuben which was made like the ideal Reuben. On the way back I had the rib-eye with fries. The bread they served was wonderful and their apple sauce is a must try. I wish I had room for desert because it looked like they had some good ones.

Text: Stuffed! I had hand batter dipped chicken tenders that were very moist, and yes, tender with mashed potatoes and gravy. Hubs had beef brisket that was melt in your mouth good. We brought home enough food for two days. Great service, nice atmosphere.

Text: This is our new family favorite. The meals are homestyle, very tasty, and huge enough to have leftovers. The meal starts with 2 of 3 items (cottage cheese, warm/cold apple slices, coleslaw) with a basket of breads and butter (spice bread and dinner bread). Your water glass is a Mason jar and the water pitcher is left on your table. This is an awesome place for a family meal. We have yet to try any desert because we've been so full but plan to take desert home with us next time.

Text: The food was so good. Real home made goodness. The decor was so charming certainly showing Midwest life. Our server was courteous and attentive. Prices were affordable. There were families as well as seniors enjoying mid day meals. The menu was extensive and there was a salad bar as well. Excellent place for a big group.
