Text: In town for the week. Stopped here first night. Very good beers. More specifically their IPA. I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and soup of the day. It turned out very good. We also had the little shot glasses of their different brews. Plan to do a little walking around here as the local area is very nice at night.

Text: I really enjoyed our visit here. The food was fresh and tasted great, and it came out fast. I absolutely loved the coffee stout :) it was delicious. And everyone was super friendly and provided great service. If we're in the area again, we will definitely be going back.

Text: We had horrible service today. The server seemed annoyed to wait on us.
I had a chicken sandwich that I swear was 1/2 a breast. I didn't have it on a pretzel bun which likely would have hid the fact there was no meat on my sandwich. For the price, it was shameful. When I am paying for service, I expect it to be great. Our drinks took 20 minutes, food was a disappointment and the server slammed down our water when we asked for refills.

We won't be back. I can spend $100 elsewhere!

Text: We had an amazing time playing pool on the second floor and drinking quality craft brewed beer here. We drove up to Omaha off a wimb one Sunday and are so glad we did. We really enjoyed our time at this brewery and restaurant. The food was great too! The old building that it is located in just tops it all off and gives you a great feel like you never want to leave.

Text: Cute part if town.  Immediate seating for early dinner.  Crowd and waiting started by 7pm.  Wait staff was great to bring taste of beer before ordering.  Pretzel crusted cheese curds we're an absolute best choice.  Ribeye was good seasonal veggies could have been more chef inspired.  Medium cook  hamburger was also good but was expecting more flavor.  Seems like a safe choice for a safe substantial meal but lacked a bit on creative combinations
