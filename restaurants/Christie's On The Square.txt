Text: The food is very good....the only reason I'm giving three stars.  The service is very poor and slow.  You have to budget an extra hour for your meal time or you'll run late all day.

Text: Went on a saturday around noon. There were two tables there, and two other folks walked in after us. Two waitresses on duty for a total of 5 tables, (four couples and a table of four).  Waitress immediately got us menus and sat us, got us waters, and we asked for just a moment to look at the menu.  Heres were it went down hill.  Our waitress disappeared. I sent a snap chat and went back to check the time. It was roughly 17 minutes before she came back.  The other waitress finally came over and took our order for her, and apologized.  A table that had gotten there after us got their check while we waited for our food.  Our waitress disappeared yet again.  The other waitress came over and topped off our waters.  Our waitress came back with another tables food.  Oddly it was the food to a table that was there before us, which means these people waited 35 minutes or more to get served.  Another table gets their check and leaves.  Our food arrives.  We got the half panini with cup of soup, and the vegetable wrap with dill spread.  The food was ok. Fries were hot.  My wrap was good, but not great.  Her soup came out wrong, had to send a cup of soup back to be fixed.  We finished eating in about 15 minutes.  Waitress was gone again, then a big table of 6 people came in, she appeared and took their orders, and she never even made eye contact with us from that point on.  Waited for over ten minutes to get a check.  I finally flagged down the other waitress and asked if she could get it for us.  We gave her the tip.  Its amazing how the actions of one employee can shape my entire experience.
