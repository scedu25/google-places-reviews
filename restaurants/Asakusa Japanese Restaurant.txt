Asakusa Japanese Restaurant

Text: 1. Decor: 4/5

2. Service: 3/5 nice but not friendly 

3. Food: 1/5 I had the lunch special Maki ( tuna) roll with a Hot sake. Fish was not fresh at all and the rolls where poorly made. Sake was over priced a large hot sake was 9.95, the same amount as the lunch special. Soup and salad where okay however my salad had the  heart of the lettuce in it. 

4. Price: 1/5 Also they charged me a dollar for a spicy mayo condiment. 

I gave a star one because the most important part of a sushi restaurant is the freshness of the sushi. I have also been to Naked Tchopsticks and their sushi was better.

Text: The eponymous Asakusa Roll is not to be missed. I would say this restaurant would be a great place to bring a sushi newbie. They have a fantastic selection of Maki rolls to go along with traditional sushi selections.
