Text: Drove about 2 hours from Chicago to eat here and it was totally worth it! Got the Fat Boy and it was perfect! Service was amazing and out waitress was super nice and helpful about our questions.  Food came out quick and the bill was a lot less than expected. Would recommend and will come back.

Text: Haven't been there in years. Actually since I was a teenager.  Had the mushrooms and chicken.  Mushrooms we're very good and a great selection of beers on tap.  Wasn't impressed with the chicken...crust was very thick and hard (not my style). I guess not everything is as great as it was when you were younger.  Had a great time with my family. Clean,  casual atmosphere.  I went on  Sunday afternoon and could have been an off day for mixing the batter.  Maybe I'll try again.....

Text: It's the best to deep fried chicken around it's really good don't forget to ask for a thing of Krispies while you're waiting for your chicken they are fabulous. And they're really good choice of the selections behind the bar. They're a very friendly staff and prices are really good. Sometimes on weekends you may have to wait a little bit of a line but that's half the fun sitting there talking and drinking with the other customers.

Text: Hole in the wall? Yes!
Best fried chicken ever? Yes!
Fried fish on Fridays? Yes!
And don't forget the fried crispies to dip your pickle slices in--perfect combination!
It's places like this that give Hole In the Wall a GOOD name!
