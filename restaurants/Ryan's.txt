Ryan's
Rating: 4
Text: For a buffet we were pleasantly surprised. They do a good job of making sure there is food for everyone. Everything from tacos and pizza to mashed potatoes and chicken. The salad bar was fresh and extensive. Desert bar if you choose to finish your meal with something sweet. Service was very good. Our waitress kept our water glasses full and brought rolls to the table. Cleanliness seems to be an issue at buffets, this was not a problem. I'm giving Ryan's a 4? rating because there is always room for improvement.  $17.99 party of 2 at lunch

Text: The employees were kind and excellent service except the food. Steak very chewy meatloaf not very tasteful. But their mashed potatoes were the best I had and their salad bar was excellent.

Text: A little on the getting-rundown side, but most of the food was decent and the staff was friendly. Oddly, the desserts were probably the weakest link in the meal. The salad was fresh and the hot sides were good. Most of the meats were good, but the ends of the pork roast were super dry and shouldn't have been served.

Text: Disappointed in the food selection and quality compared to other Ryan's buffets I've been to. Price is average, buffet layout is inconvenient and clumsy, selection is small and quality bordered on poor.
