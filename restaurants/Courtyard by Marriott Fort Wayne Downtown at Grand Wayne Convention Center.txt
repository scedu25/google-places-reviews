Text: The hotel is great, happy they had a good place to eat. The house keeping was good, and very polite.  The staff was always smiling and helpful  with any questions we had. Enjoyed our time there. There are a lot of kids for spot events so keep that in mind. The hotel connects to the theatre place which was helpful when we stayed there.

Text: Ckd in for 3 nights and the morning after night 1 the Front Desk Manager told me I could not stay they were overbooked!  He was very proud to tell me he was the manager but could not offer any customer service at all!  Worst experience I have ever had!  Be careful if you think you have a room here.  They will just take your money and then take your room!

Text: $200 for a room in the only hotel in downtown Fort Wayne, nice lil bougie monopoly you guys got there. The outlets barely hold any plugs. The worst part was finding my door didn't close all the way when I came back. At least the staff and views were awesome.
