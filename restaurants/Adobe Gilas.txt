Text: Fire your Thursday night dj. He's an ass hole. He's old af. He plays an average of 2 good song out of 100. It's Chicago, hire someone with a slight more taste. I will spend way more time at your bar if it had better music.

Text: THE FOOD IS AWFUL...  Staff very nice, but omg, Mexican Food ?????. I Love MB Financial Park, but that is probably the last time I go to Adobe Gilas. Thankfully we had a 50% off coupon.

Text: Eh really great margaritas. The nachos were ok. The food is just ok. The wait staff was nice but not like amazing. They were really making a good effort though. I've been to better restaurants in that quad.

Text: The waitstaff was inattentive and slow and my food was terrible. I have never felt the need to provide a review before but this was just so bad all around that I needed to share.
