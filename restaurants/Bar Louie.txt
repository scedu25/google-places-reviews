Text: We like to live on the wild side, and took our child with developmental delays for our first ever outing in eatery. The wait staff was AWESOME! Very friendly, patient, and complimented my child on well behavior!  Food was on point, best burger I've had in a while! Definitely going back in the future!  Amazing establishment!

Text: The service was horrid. We walked in and every table we passed had dirty plates and glasses. Maybe the busser was asleep? So dirty looking. This was in the afternoon on a Saturday. Probably had 5 tables in total. Food was pretty good but is very expensive for the quality. Not sure there is more than 3 meals less than 10 and they were all appetizers. Draft beer selection was also garbage. This will probably be my last visit.

Text: Hamburger was so good. Our server Courtney done an excellent job always was prompted. Her smile says it all ?

Text: Worst experience EVER!! Waited for our food for over an hour almost took 2 hours. Then once our food arrived one of the food orders didn't even come out cause they were out of fish! Didn't tell us until all the other food was out on the table. Horrible place to eat, go to hangout etc I hate giving it a 1 star!!
