Text: We had a great experience.  Our waiter, Otto, was wonderful, knowledgeable and helped us pair our food choices perfectly.  The food was wonderful and very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere was great and all the employees were friendly.

Text: Our favorite bar. Whiskey Wednesday, where one category of whiskey is half price, is a great way to sample whiskeys that would otherwise be too expensive. The knowledgeable bartenders greatly enhance the experience. Excellent food, too: sliders make for great small meals. The Seven Saints Salad is yummy, big and low-carb.

Text: Food was great. The menu can be described as a gourmet hamburger restaurant. They had very tasty and unique hamburger choices, which also includes chicken, salmon, etc as well. Portions are small with the intent of being able to order 2-3 different burgers for a meal. Food was served quickly and accurately, especially considering we ordered 6-7 different burgers.They also had a nice drink selection but we were driving and didn't have a chance to try - but will next time.

Text: The cheese curds are really good. Had a vegetarian Chicago style hot dog slider. My friend got the same with a chicken patty. Very tasty!
