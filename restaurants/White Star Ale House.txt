Text: Tasteless chicken.  I ate almost nothing, still hungry.  Lobster bisque was tasty but not a meal.  My husband nearly vomited the salmon.  My god please go anywhere but here to eat in Cedar Rapids.

Text: The pistachio chicken is one of the best dishes I have ever had! Mango salsa, with a little spice. Everything you get here is well done.

Text: We had an amazing meal there Saturday evening! Started with some sangria which was wonderful.  For the appetizer we got the sampler with Wisconsin Cheese Wontons, huge hand breaded chicken strips & egg rolls that came with a whole little tray of dipping sauces. I ordered the New York Strip topped with blue cheese that was a daily special with a cheesy hash brown casserole; my husband got the fried catfish, also a special with eggplant parmesan. Went home with lots of leftovers and a slice of Godiva cheesecake. Very spendy but oh-so-good! We enjoyed watching parties come in Halloween costumes that were dining before going to the big fundraising thing they were having at the US Cellular center. The service was good and there is a nice atmosphere there. Definitely a good place to go for a special occasion.

Text: Outstanding staff and service.   Food was ok.   

I had the pistachio chicken.   It was over-breaded and lacked salt.  Combined effect was a dry piece of chicken.  

My wife's entree was described as the prime rib leftovers from the night before covered in sauteed onions & cheese.  She said that she wasn't expecting perfection because this was a second day meal but there was a taste from the meat that made her think this was more than one night since the prime rib was originally cooked.   

Because our other food was good and the staff was fantastic,  maybe we caught them on an off night.
