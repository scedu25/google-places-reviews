Bella Pizzeria - Noblesville

Text: The two stars that I am giving are because the menu was easily accessible and ordering online and tracking my delivery was also very easy and the food came on time, as promised. Now if only the pizza we received was any good. We paid $46.00(!!) for two, large, "NY style" thin crust pizzas (including delivery charge, tip and tax). The pizzas that arrived looked more like medium-sized, were lukewarm and had soggy crusts the consistency of a wet paper towel. The flavor wasn't much better - we've eaten $5 dollar Red Baron frozen pizzas of better quality than what was delivered. Next time we want delivery, Dominoes will get our $46.00 and we'll eat for days on what that buys us there.

Text: I love Bella's Pizzeria!  Not only is the food incredible but every time we order delivery I am always blown away with the professionalism and kindness of the staff members .  It's hard to find good customer service these days and they always have it.

Text: Closest to my favorite Brooklyn pizza place Ninna's order their Sicilian (square pie) and tell them to cook it a little longer than they typically do.

Text: Horrible. Pizza dough was still raw. And the cheesey sticks no flavor. Pizza sauce was only thing good. Not worth the price. Glad to have gotten refund. Won't be back

Text: Chewy undercooked pizza. Should have read the reviews which say the same more often than I'd like to see.
