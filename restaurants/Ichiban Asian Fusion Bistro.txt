Text: Came here for a lunch date, our server, Hakeem (sorry if I misspelled it) was awesome. He was helpful with questions we had, he checked on us multiple times and he had a great attitude. Some menu items are pricey, but everything I've tried has been good. We got sushi, pictured below. The lunch 2 roll special was a great deal, and my special roll was super fresh. It was a great experience all around.

Text: The food that i had was either too salty, sweet or no flavor at all. I ordered a smoothie and they brought me a ready-made, sealed drink that separated constantly, and that i could not get the seal off of so i have to poke a hole in the top and stick my straw into the plastic glass. The smoothie tasted like having jumex juice mixed with heavy cream. The vegetable tempura was flavorless, teriyaki beef too salty, smoothie to sweet and a price way too high for what i was able to eat. Never will eat hear again!!!!!

Text: The food was fresh, the service was okay, and the prices are reasonable. The inside is very clean, very modern, and very relaxing. The menu selection varies; lots of options for non-sushi lovers too. Highly recommend.

Text: Great food, great sushi... I was never a fan of sushi but this place has me hooked on those spicy yellowtail rolls! Chicken is great too and they will make it as spicy as you want it, prefect portion sizes!

Text: The food is cooked to order. Large portions when dining here. Take-out is smaller. Very tasty.
