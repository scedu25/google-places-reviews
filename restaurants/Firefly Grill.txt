Text: What a classy restaurant!  We were traveling from Arizona to Ohio, and we stopped at a lot of restaurants along the way.  This was the best, by far.  The ambiance is notable, and the menu choices are impressive.  I had the crab cakes. They were delicious.  The butternut squash soup was wonderful.  The service was perfect.  We have saved this place as one our all time favorites.  We will be back.

Text: I've been coming here for years every time I travel to Southern Illinois.  The food is always delicious.  The staff is professional and friendly.   The view of the pond and trees is so tranquil and relaxing; the perfect backdrop for any meal.  If it's warm try to get a seat on the deck.  In the spring, summer, and fall you can even feed the fish.

Text: Discovered this gem on our way through a road trip.  "Farm to Table" was what attracted us on the highway ad and it did not dissappoint.  Very inviting atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent service.  An herb garden and Monarch butterflies greeted us at the front!  The food tasted and looked delicious.  We had the freshest "farm salad", flush fried calamari - the softest most delicious we've ever had, loved it!  Portions are perfect and priced reasonably.  Sat at the patio overlooking the pond, what a view!  We'll definitely visit again.

Text: What a wonderful "find".  Quite honestly, one of the best restaurants in which we have eaten.  I have celiac disease (can't have ANY gluten and extremely sensitive) and had choices.  The food flavors were awesome.  My husband said the Butternut Squash Soup was the best soup he ever had.  I had the scallop risotto. YUM! We now have a reason to stop in Effingham, IL.
