Text: You people are bizarre. This is buffet style food with more veggies then you can find anywhere else. Due to it being buffet the quality depends a lot on when you eat - if its been sitting for awhile...you know the drill. 

You get A TON of food & dessert - I walk out with takeout including 3 heaping dishes &  a generous slice of pie for less than $7.5 w/tax. Expensive? I don't think so.

The place smells fine, it smells exactly like the food. Period. Well it may smell like the patrons in the sitting area,I mean there is fine line between water conservation and hygiene people...

The couple that runs the place are very nice, and honestly don't charge enough for what they deliver.
