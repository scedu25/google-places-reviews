Text: BEST. STAFF. EVER!! We had the most enjoyable time at J. Patrick's. We planned to just stop in for 1 drink and then go on our way..we ended up staying for several more because we fell in Love with Greg! He has one of the biggest personalities I've ever seen in the most wonderful way. The hostess and kitchen staff were so wonderful also! We had to go back the 2nd night for more! Then we met Lori and Kaleena and they are amazing too! We didn't eat here, only drank, but I definitely recommend stopping in!

Text: Wow, supposed to be open at 3. We got here with our party at 3 and were told they were opening a "little late". At 4pm they opened the door at our prompting. Ordered the salad bar, at 4:20 they put out salad. Ughhh. So much for relaxed casual dining. Way to turn a nice easy Sunday dinner into a 2 hour starving affair of waiting and waiting and waiting.

Text: it's nice that they accommodate our very large family, every year for our annual luncheon. However the only thing that I would recommend is the Sunday Brunch Buffet -not that it's exceptionally good,  just the only thing that I would reccomend
