Text: I have not lived in the state or that area for almost 5 years now and still crave this joint! The owner is super nice and welcoming. And the key word here is consistency, no matter what, any time you go there your experience will be as great as the first time. 
I live in the state of Oregon now and with the medical/recreational industry booming we Oregonians would enjoy a Don Seafood and Chicken! Peace love and hair grease ?
