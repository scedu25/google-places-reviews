Text: Always great service and very kind servers. I've never had a bad meal here. They're quick and reasonably priced. Make the best strawberry daiquiri, too! Sometimes it's crowded but only because they're one of the only places in town to eat, and the only place that serves alcohol.

Text: Delicious and authentic Mexican food in the middle of the Illinois prairie!  As good as any place in Chicagoland.
