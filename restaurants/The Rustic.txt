The Rustic

Text: Went for dinner and was hugely disappointed. I got wings, mom got fried chicken, and dad got meatloaf. We had been told how good this place was and unfortunately it missed the mark....at least what we had. The "homemade sides" looked like mac and cheese(kraft) and mashed potatoes out of the box. Went back the next morning for breakfast...had the chicken fried steak, my buddy had the pork chops. WE were blown away! Breakfast was awesome! I feel bad leaving three stars but dinner was not good so I wouldn't recommend them for that but breakfast, this place is go to for breakfast.

Text: I have been meaning to try The Rustic for a while as I've heard good things about it. I ate here earlier in the week and have already visited a second time. Great home style food, decent prices and menu, very nice staff. I will become a regular here
