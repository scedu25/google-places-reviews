Text: It's a 5 star for me and my girlfriend.  I live between Kansas City and Lawrence and my GF west of Nevada.  Would I drive from KC just to eat at Gobbler's Roost?  Yes I would.  It's worth even driving long distance to get there.  All the food is delicious and comes out to the table hot.  Food coming out hot to my table is very important to me and shows the owners care.  My girlfriend and I eat there for special occasions and we always love the food.  This past weekend we had ham, steak, corn on the cobb, black bean soup and an amazing light lemon cheesecake with raspberry sause.  All very very good.  For two of us; Appetizer,  then salad, then soup, then dinner + cocktails + bottle of wine - and desert  plus generous tip - $177.  It's worth it trust me.  If I could I might knock off a quarter point for the hard chairs but no way would that keep me from returning again and again.  Service is always very good too.  Close to the best steak I have ever eaten.  The wine list is good and the cocktails are very good too.  Do it.  You'll not be sorry.

Text: Absolutely one of the best hidden secrets in the giant steaks world. Protein hangover? Oh, yeah. Make reservations and ask for directions. Maps may fail you, but keep going..  it's worth the drive!

Text: Mouth-watering beef filet! Crusty blackened goodness on the outside and a tender juicy flavor-burst on the inside. Delightful ambiance! An upscale dining experience where they make you feel right at home.  Superior service, thank you Diane and Brenda. Pricey ($43-$50 a person) so you may want to save it for that extra special occasion. But far from leaving hungry, we had to try an not overstuff ourselves with our five course meal.  My husband and I made 3 or 4 meals out of our scrumptious leftovers. The carrot cake was superb and rich. A few bites went a long way.  They even brought mine out with a pink candle in honor of my birthday, which made me grin from ear to ear. :D The owner/manager occasionally goes from table to table checking on his guests with a cheery greeting. Be sure to make reservations! Once you do, your table is yours for the evening. We read a marriage devotional and talked til almost closing with no pressure to vacate our table due to other waiting customers. A one-of-a-kind experience!
