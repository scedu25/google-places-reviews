On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina

Text: Pretty satisfied every time! Wait for a table isn't long. Wait for your food isn't long. Food has always been hot and delicious. Decent prices for what you get. Attentive wait staff. A couple of times I felt their music was too loud for the environment, but we still enjoy the upbeat genre they play.  Keep up the good work!

Text: Here on a business trip, close to hotel so walked over. Best decision I made for dinner, staff was happy and seated me quickly even with a full house, Chloe my server immediately had me water, chip and salsa, she asked if i wanted the spicier version of their salsa which is good. I asked recommendations on several dishes and settled on the steak fajitas. They were done quickly, served with a huge portion of rice and beans on separate plates. The tortillas were hot and the fajitas were the best i have eaten. I will definitely come back again.

Text: Great food. Rude service in the Pick up to go area. for that reason won't go back. It doesn't matter if I am picking up my food or dining in, the workers should still be polite to you. Not throw your receipt on the counter and say here is your receipt and your order and walk away. It wasn't busy yet. I usually give a tip but not this time. He was rude.

Text: I used to eat here about once a week but they've really just gone down hill, food & service wise. I probably will never eat here again after tonight's experience. If you want real Mexican food & good service, then visit Margaritas!
