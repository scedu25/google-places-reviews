Text: Food quality seems to have declined. At our last visit the baked potatoes were undercooked and sweet potato puffs had cold centers. Meat dishes were heavily peppered. Rolls are smaller and are no longer free unless you get a salad. Waitress added 2 soft drinks to the bill of a party that only drank water, so check your bills for accuracy!

Text: Drinks and appetitizer came out quickly but then waiting for food for half hour and waitress comes out and ask if we wanted dessert.... Uh, how about our meal, which was a fish sandwich and southwestern chop chop salad.... She came back out and said.... Waiting on the chicken for the salad..... Don't think we will be back... Onion rings were not the greatest... Disappointing

Text: Food and service are mediocre at best.  I had a burger and it was a literal salt bomb. No one else I was with liked their meal either. My sister got the meat loaf and it was literally as hard as a rock. You also have to pay for rolls now. I probably will not be going back.

Text: The service was decent but the the food was not. The meatloaf I had was greasey and over cooked. My wife got a steak and it was overcooked also. The steak was sliced thinner than usual. The baked potato and peas were fine.
