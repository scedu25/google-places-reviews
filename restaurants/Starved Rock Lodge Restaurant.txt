Text: The food is AMAZING! Atmosphere is killer and the staff is...so so. Can't complain about the staff but can't rave about them either. Full bar. Beautiful drive in and out. Great for a date night or date lunch.

Text: Service was ok, most of the food was bland and overpriced, mixed drinks were filled with ice and overpriced. Bathrooms had a urine smell and no hot water. This visit was on a Saturday evening at 6pm

Text: Service was friendly but pretty terrible. The first server was super sweaty, like wiping sweat off his brow from his wet hair and sweat through his shirt, so we changed tables.  Then they took over an hour to serve our food. We begged them to serve our four 10 and under kids who were more starving than the rock we hiked around. The food was great, but unfortunately, the hour wait time spoiled our plans for the rest of the evening. Giving them two because they were nice at least and the fare was decent. Would not go again.
