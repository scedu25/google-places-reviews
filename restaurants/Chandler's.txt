Text: So disappointing!  Went there because rated no 1 on trip advisor. Had Reuben and steak sandwiches in which bread was so greasy. Corned beef on Reuben was tough and not much and not much sauerkraut. Mostly cheese and a huge hunk of cheese slid off sandwich to side of plate. Steak sandwich wasn't anything special and not worth the money. Homemade chips were saturated in oil, didn't seem fresh and had no flavor. Inside dining was dark and dingy so opted for patio. Only one table was in shade and was occupied so only one table had umbrella and we had to squeeze together to try to escape the sun on a hot late afternoon. Chairs are NOT for dining as you had to sit on edge with no cushioning. Staff was super friendly but that is only good thing.
