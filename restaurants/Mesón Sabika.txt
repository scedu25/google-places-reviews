Text: Excellent tapas style restaurant.  We've been several times and always tasty. The bacon wrapped figs are perfectly prepared.  We always find ourselves ordering more of those. Reasonably priced dinner spot in a historic location

Text: Delightful gracious setting. Attentive staff and delicious authentic Spanish tapas. We enjoyed the outdoor seating and succulent food. Obviously popular. I suggest making reservations.

Text: Amazing food, drinks and service. We had a table of four with reservations for 5 pm on a Sunday evening. We were seated promptly on the outdoor patio. The hostess was polite and our waiter was very personable. He took the time to walk us through the menu and wonderful pairing recommendations. The food was phenomenal. Four a party of four, eight plates was the perfect amount. It was a cooler evening and the staff did light several outdoor heating lamps. These were a great addition to the space. Stylish and functional. I will definitely be returning.

Text: Amazing experience. The whole place is beautiful. The reason why I gave 4-stars instead of 5 was the hostess. We were waiting 21 minutes for a table outside, and the brown-haired server (who did not check us in for our reservation), seated the couple who came AFTER US that she checked in. Really frustrating. However, Lorin, our server, was amazing, and made up for that experience. Great food and beautiful location.

Text: One of the best tapas restaurants I've been to. A little pricey but the great service and amazing food justifies the price.
