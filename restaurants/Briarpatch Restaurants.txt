Text: I've only bin once and they were not busy cuz we were a bit late...but they were great. Wonderful staff and the salad bar was enough alone for my four stars...but when they brought our food out I thought it looked kinda small for the price....but after salad and bread and drinks...the meal balanced perfect. And the place itself was pretty. Old vintage and homey kinda feel. Loved it. Def going back soon.

Text: Best salad bar around. Sometimes takes a while to get seated even though there are empty tables. Probably because they don't want to overload their servers. Don't blame them for that. Great bread served with your meal too. Never had a bad meal there in the 6 years I've worked in the Owensboro area.

Text: One of the best places to eat locally. Service is always friendly and inviting. My family and I have loved this restaurant for special nights out since I was a kid.

Text: I like the place. It is an institution in Owensboro. I've been going there for forty years, as has most of there customers. The loyalty that they realize from their customers has maybe caused them to become a little complacent about refreshing the interior and allowing the steak quality to slide through the years.  I think that the thing that people count on is the very great salad bar that hasn't slipped through the years.
