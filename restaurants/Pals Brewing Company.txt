Text: We questioned this place due to low reviews and being so far out of town. When we got here the place was packed. Even with being so busy the service was amazing and the beer was just as amazing! The food options were something different than normal pizza menus and very delicious! They have a huge outdoor area for yard games and kids to run! Beautiful location and building!

Text: Great place to kick back and enjoy a wide variety of local brewed craft beers made on location.   Great pizza and appetizers also.

Text: I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Incredible selection of brews from porter & stout to IPA & Red....all delicious! And best pizza in town....homemade sauces & fire grilled! Atmosphere is rustic brewery with a sports bar feel! And once it's warm outside there's a ton of outdoor seating with a countryside view for yard games & live music! Gotta try it!
