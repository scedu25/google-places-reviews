Text: Ordered hamburger and waffle fries. 

Was served regular fries and the waitress noticed right away.  They brought waffle fries at no charge and promptly. 

Burger on pretzel bun was absolutely delicious and the regular shoe string fries and waffle fries were both very crisp and good.

Thumbs up.
