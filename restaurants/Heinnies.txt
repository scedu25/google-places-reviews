Text: Traveling from St. Louis and and wanted to watch the St. Louis Blues game....called Heinnies and asked if they would have the game on, he said sure......I arrived ten minutes later and they already tv on the game. Had dinner there and the food and service were very good. Thanks for your hospitality!

Text: I stopped by for lunch for my very first time. Bartender Troy provided me with great service. The buffalo burger I had was absolutely delicious. Fries if I put it honestly tasted like burnt plastic (yes I've tasted it). Tends to attract a more middle aged crowd. Another slight caveat is that it seemed like I'm the first minority to have ever stopped by ??(probably not) but it sure felt like it. Overall this is nice place and a very appropriate place for lunch.

Text: I was very surprised...it's been along time since I'd been there and never tried their prime rim....but it was very good indeed. The price was about as expected, not out of the norm...great salad, very attentive wait staff.

Text: Great food! Always packed around dinner time, so expect a wait that will be well worth it.
