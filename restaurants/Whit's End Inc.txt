Text: If you Google this business and select "call", you are answered by a recording and told that they are no longer processing orders by phone and they send you a text that directs you to their app to place the order. After placing the order, I received an email confirming my order and it said that it would be ready in 30-40 mins. After driving there and waiting in the parking lot till the order should have been ready, I walked in and was told they didn't get the order but they knew the amount of the order, somehow. I was told that the app doesn't work and that I should have called the business directly. I thought that pushing "call" on the Google search would send me directly to that business. Nope. I'm not saying don't go there, I am saying don't call the Google number or use the app. I chose to leave rather than sit in a parking lot for another 30-40 mins or sit in a bar with my 4 year old. Until corporate gets it self together or this place disassociates itself from that corporation, I won't go back.

Text: The service was friendly. I was brought the wrong thing and asked for it to be changed. The meatloaf came out "okay". However, I got violently sick about an hour and a half later. I was throwing up and had diarrhea for over 5 hours and still trying to keep liquids down. I hope this keeps others from getting sick.
