Text: First time in this place...
I ordered the "Big Breakfast" 
Came with 2-eggs 2-"meats 2-pancakes (or waffels)
Hashbrowns(?) Toast and coffee...
Pancakes were.....ehhh.....ok (had to wait for the)
Eggs were...(i ordered them OVER MEDIUM) they were cooked all the way!
The "Hashbrowns"were shoe string fries
The "meats" I ordered Sausage(4)
(I took a pic of them) they were so...blackened I couldn't even eat them...
All of this.....unsatisfactory food was $11.00 +tax
Nope! Would NOT Recommend
Sorry...
