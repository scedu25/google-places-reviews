Ox Yoke Inn

Text: If you plan on spending the night on Thanksgiving or just hate to see waste, don't plan on eating at the Ox Yoke. They offer a large array of food  (Not cheap but decent) but if you can't manage to eat it all, don't plan on taking it with you. It gets thrown out. You know, the food you PAID for. You can't even give them more money for it. So here you are on Thanksgiving without a grocery store (and who wants to cook if you pay to go out?) and no leftovers. We love spending our money at the shops, and spend it we do. A shame the Ox Yoke doesn't extend better hospitality. And if you talk to the manager, Melissa, plan on more nastiness.

Text: Awesome! Can you say buffet right at your table? Order the family style and dig in! We ordered the refillable chicken, ham, and beef roast plus sides and we couldn't have been happier. Even the kids were impressed! Great, attentive service, too. Of course, we got some corn cob syrup and fresh strawberry preserves to go. Can't wait until next time!

Text: German and American fare. Meals are served plated, or order family style to get more sides and refills. Lovely assortment of delicious desserts. The staff is friendly and attentive. Highly recommended to anyone in the area!

Text: Ordered 2 meals with my wife family style.  We did not have seconds on anything including our waters.  We did not eat everything and asked for to go containers.  The waitress told us that we were only allow 2 small containers.  We had more food than would fit in these containers we asked for a third, she said it was policy that we could only get two.  I asked to speak with the manager and she wanted to argue with us. She made us buy a third container for $.50.  Remember we bought the food, didn't have seconds on anything. and then she was very rude.  I am posting this post everywhere, I hope it stops people from eating here.  There are other good places to eat in this town.

Text: The Ox Yoke is always on our list when we drive through Amana.  It is a wonderful experience.  The family style breakfast is amazing, and I was glad that each component was refillable.  My party of 4 was able to get just the right amount for us.  The food was delicious, and our server was helpful and able to answer my questions about vegetarian options.  I'm glad we visited again.
