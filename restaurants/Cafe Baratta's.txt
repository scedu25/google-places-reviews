Text: Outstanding food at reasonable prices, even more affordable during their blue plate specials in January.  Great views of downtown Des Moines and the capitol.  Kinda hard to find the entrance inside the Iowa Historical Museum.  Here's a tip:  Come in on the north side (backside) of the building on Grand Avenue. Take the elevator to the top.  Their lasagna is delicious.

Text: Generally nice, good food. We had the Reuben brochette and the salmon plate. Both very good. This place is at the top of the historical museum downtown.

Text: We recently hosted a rehearsal dinner at Cafe Baratta's in The State Historical Museum in Des Moines. It was just what the couple wanted and the staff at Baratta's couldn't have been better to work with! They were gracious with every question we had and treated everyone with such respect it was an absolute pleasure to work with them. The food was excellent and we would highly recommend Baratta's!
