Text: Food is okay. Service is very slow. Not a huge deal but they do not serve beer. I kinda like a beer with my mexican food... restrooms are clean

Again the service is very slow, even when the place is pretty empty. 

Both times I have been here, on a weekend, it was nearly empty, so I wonder how popular this place is. 

I will probably go somewhere else next time..

Text: This food is authentic and delicious. Reasonably priced with a huge menu. I'd recommend it over the other spot a few blocks south of here.

Text: We waited 30 minutes to order, then an hour later the food showed up, out of a table of four, two did not receive any food at all, one of the others two order was completely wrong.  When we questioned the two missing meals, we were looked at with blank stares and said they were working on it.  What a shit hole at its finest.  No alcohol, no ac, no food, no service.  Do yourself a favor, go South a block to tequilas.  They serve real authentic Mexican food and cold beer.

Text: A surprising find in a East CO small town!  The service staff went out of their way to ensure our food was correct and prompt, the food was actually really good,  and the restaurant was clean.  While it wasn't fast food it was definitely good food fast.
