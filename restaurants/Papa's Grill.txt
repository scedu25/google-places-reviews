Text: Great food.  Had the best buffalo chicken sandwich I ever had.There were 2 full-size chicken breasts on it, had to take on off and being home.  The fries were awesome too.  Good service from our server, always had a fresh drink when needed.

Text: Service was good. Food came out quickly and was hot, but I wasn't super impressed. I thought it was too expensive for not high enough quality. The cheesy tomato soup seemed just a step above Campbell's. Fried cheese bites were just mushy cheese.
