Text: First time at the restaurant, and it was good as advertised.  Sampler plate was a good variety, and fried perfectly golden brown.  I requested a well done burger to see if they could cook it correctly, and they did. It was well done, but not dried out.  The pizza was good as well as the buffalo chicken sandwich.  All of the portions were more than enough, and the service was very good.  Only thing I didn't like was the table was a little sticky and the bartender touched the top of the straws with bare hands.

Text: Some of the best service I've had in a while. Our server Kim was sincerely nice and very attentive. The bar is great for watching the game but not overwhelming if you're just there for a casual dinner or drinks. I recommend the pizza but haven't tried much else as I've only been there a couple times. I definitely plan on visiting more often :)

Text: Alex and I had a wonderful lunch consisting of Pork tenderloin, cheeseburger and corn nuggets. Our server did an excellent job. My main concern was if it would be so loud that we would not be able to relax and talk however this time the music was at a reasonable level . Very happy and relaxed when we left.

Text: Best bartenders in town- hands down. Great pizza. The rest of the food is also awesome. Never had a bad experience here. 10/10. Would recommend.
