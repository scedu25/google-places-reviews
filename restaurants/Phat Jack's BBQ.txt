Phat Jack's BBQ
Rating: 5
Text: I grew up 45 minutes outside of Kansas City, where good BBQ was easy to find. My wife and I moved to Colorado last year, and we're having a very difficult time finding any KC-style BBQ restaurant, not to mention a good one. I've been in Lincoln this week visiting family and saw that Phat Jack's was the highest rated BBQ restaurant in town and it was also KC style, so I decided to give it a try for lunch today. This restaurant is amazing! Every member of the staff that I interacted with was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to help me. I ordered the burnt ends, and they were perfect. They were so good that I placed a to-go order before I left and had them again for dinner! The next time I'm in Lincoln, you can bet I'll be back.

Text: Best BBQ joint in town. I normally don't like pulled pork but I love Phat Jack's pulled pork and always get the loaded baked potato. Their macaroni salad is the best and I'm definitely buying a quart to take home next time I visit!

Text: This was our first time trying Phat Jack's and it will be our last! I can't believe how disappointed we were will the quality of the food...things they are suppose to be known for.... BBQ pork and ribs..... corn bread etc.  The ribs were old...dry and almost not edible. The pork was ok once you pulled the chunks of fat or dry burnt pieces out...and heated it up. The corn bread was dry and over cooked....nothing more than a crappy jiffy box mix. And the worst was the Mac n Cheese. Maybe the recipe is good when fresh....but what we were served was more than a day old, mushy and flavourless.  You can't serve that stuff and expect people to come back...and not give a bad report! There is absolutely nothing I would return for. I ordered cheesy potatoes...but was told you currently don't have any??? Seriously...those might have been decent...may have been one thing with a positive review...but I will never know.

Text: Went there for lunch and if I may add this is my first time eating here. Let me say I'm from the south and I have family in Texas, so I know a thing or two about good BBQ. The pulled pork is delicious and there baked beans are phenomenal. I first requested okra, but they don't carry that. I'm not surprised, but I sure wish they did and others from the south know exactly what I'm talking about. There baked beans for me made up for that though and the customer service is fantastic, so I let the okra slide on this one.

Text: I drove from KC for Husker Football but came extra early just to stop at Phat Jack's. While I did give a 5 I almost only gave a 4. I was warned ribs and burnt end go quick. It was a 2:30 kick off time. I arrived about 11:35 (opens at 11) they were already out of ribs due to something about the mayor bought  them out. So I was super disappointed because I was going to eat a meal plus get some ribs and burnt end to take home. I did get some burnt ends. To explain how good the food was, I am Husker born and raised but have lived in KC for 30+ years - we have Joe's and Jack Stack amount a few other excellent places. Phat Jack's is even better. I wish the mayor would have let them know so they could be better prepared for game day to have ribs for people who did come early. So I didn't take the 5th star because mayor took all the ribs, but I am disappointed since I left KC extra early specifically for ribs and burnt ends.
