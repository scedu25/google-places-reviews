Text: I have no idea what their food is like. I can only comment on their customer service. I walked in and was asked how many.. not ever a good morning or any form of a proper greeting. She tried to seat me at a dirty table when there were several clean ones around me. I asked to go to a 2 person clean table right next to the dirty one and she said it was okay. I then waited for 12 minutes and no one approached my table. I watched 4 other parties get sat after me and 3 of them received water and a greeting within 2 minutes of sitting. I eventually got tired of waiting and walked up to the register, set down my menu and left. I guess that's what I get for trying to support a local business in a small town. No structure or standard of service whatsoever

Text: I've lived in Charleston for about a half of a year and have never been here. My husband and I decided to go out for breakfast. My husband got the panther breakfast with ham and I got the blueberry pancakes with bacon and hash browns. I throughly enjoyed the meal and so did my husband. He even made the comment "I think this is the best ham I've ever had." The environment was very home like and made you feel like you have lived in the town forever. Very small town like and the staff were incredibly nice. As we went to pay, our waitresses even gave us a sample of their famous strawberry bread, which is AMAZING. We will definitely be back!! Thank you guys for the great experience.
