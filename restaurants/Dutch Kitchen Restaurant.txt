Text: If you love old people food, this place is for you. Not a lot of flavor, not a lot of flash, but they do okay. The staff was very friendly on our visit. The salad bar is very basic, as is the food. But dear god, do not get the lasagna here. It looked like it sat in the oven baking all day (which being the special, it probably did). Zero cheese, a slight bit of cottage cheese, and MUSHROOMS! What kind of MONSTER puts MUSHROOMS INTO A LASAGNA?! THESE PEOPLE! THAT'S WHO! The waitress was observant enough to see the stack of mushrooms on my plate and took our salad bar trips off the bill. I won't be making the trip out here again.

Text: At the request of my mother for her 85th birthday, we drove an extra 90 miles to your restaurant this past Saturday.  Upon entering, we were not greeted--the two employees who were at the counter were too busy cleaning menus.  When we were finally seated, we were waited on by a young lady that was not very experienced and was "put out" when we requested pie "to go".  The meal came in a timely manner but was average, at best.  Finally as we were attempting to pay,  the cashier requested my mothers ID and found that her birthday really was on the following day, Sunday.  So even though your restaurant isn't open on Sunday, her birthday meal was not honored.  We are always interested in trying new, small town restaurants but you can believe that we will not refer your restaurant to anyone else.
