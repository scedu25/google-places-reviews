Text: When this place first opened I was not a big fan. I visit more often now and have to say the food is awesome and staff are SO MUCH better. The staff are actually great! One boy in particular is always smiling and greeting every single person! He needs a raise :) The atmosphere is great and I love a little place that honors first responders!

Text: the food is delicious, however you can donate any patch for first responders and military. Don't donate, they lost 2 of ours in a week and didn't care it took 8 hour drive to get them.

Text: The food was very nice, very tasty! However, it was very hot in the store, and they did have an air conditioning system, so I was confused why it hadn’t come on.
