Text: Absolutely nothing remotely negative to say about my meal, the environment or the help. This is a top notch Thai restaurant. I will be returning very soon and very often. Excellent, excellent food and service. The hype and ratings are legitimate.

Text: I have been to this place a while back and I recalled it was pretty good. This time around, it is no exception. It may not be the most authentic for people who are picky about that, but I think it tastes decently good. Service is okay. Hope you like it too.

Text: Their "moneybags" are the most amazing crab Rangoon! Crispy, sweet, and you can really taste the crab meat!!

I have very specific dietary restrictions (I can't have vitamin K) and they enthusiastically helped me build an amazing pad Thai with peanut sauce dish without any greens on it. Just amazing service from very considerate professionals!!!

Text: Fresh, delicious Thai food. Panang curry is the best I have eaten anywhere in the US. Pad Thai is good for a first visit if you've never tried Thai before. The Sweet Tuptim and the Sweet Chili Noodle are delicious as well. Ask for mild spiciness unless you like your food spicy. Staff are friendly. Have ate at this restaurant since 2002.
