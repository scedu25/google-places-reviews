Text: Had a good time here the other night. Good beer, fair prices.  Menu looks great these days, they have improved everything from selection to service. Great vibe from all the diners around me. Burgers are the star here. Wings were cooked perfectly.

Text: The burger was really good and not to big so I felt stuffed after.  Unfortunately, while the server was nice, she didn't check the orders to make sure they were correct.  My grandson was supposed to have only American cheese on his grilled cheese and got three different kinds and I didn't get the tomato and lettuce after she asked if I wanted it.  Then she bought me the wrong bill.  My fault as I should have checked but still....  Otherwise, I'll try it again and she.  This time I'll have her read the order back to me.

Text: The food is great!  Really really great.  The best part about this place though is the staff.  They are the perfect compliment to the great food.  Everyone is really cool.  I look forward to this place when Im in town.  Dont miss out, eat at Honest Abe's.
