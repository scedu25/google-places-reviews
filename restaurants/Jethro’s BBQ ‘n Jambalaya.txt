Jethro’s BBQ ‘n Jambalaya

Text: Love the food here.  Was a bit disappointed that they will no longer be doing the buy one get one wings on Tuesdays.  That has always been my favorite thing about this place.  Normally I would give them 5 stars, but this recent change affected my rating.

Text: My husband loved the red beans and rice, while  I had the Gumbo. Both were very good! Great service by our waitress.

Text: Won't recommend the new Wednesday Wings 8.95/lb special and probably would reject Jethro's as a whole for this practice. Wings were all unacceptably small and disgusting and they were undoubtedly Grade C products compared to previous half price wings. I feel ill from thinking about those tiny wings in my head.

Text: Second visit to Jethro's. First visit was good, second visit was fair. 
I personally feel this BBQ restaurant is over rated. I say that because the BBQ is alright. 

Our server had no clue about anything gluten free for those with Celiac Disease. My father wanted a beer and server was clueless. My father had to ask the bartender for a GF menu and about beer selections. Our server came back way to many times to ask us if we wanted to order and wasn't that great.

Our meal came out and was barely warm. When I get BBQ, I expect it to be hot. I did not feel that the BBQ had incredible taste, Jethro's is nothing like a Cooper's that you see in Texas. You get all the bread you want, baked beans, corn on the cob, etc. Jethro's does not even offer corn on the cob. What BBQ place doesn't serve corn on the cob?

With all the awards, articles and publicity for this location, I was not impressed. I won't be back for a third time nor will I recommend Jethro's.

Text: Awesome brisket! Very tender and flavorful.  Didn't need sauce. But enjoyed the sauces just the same.
