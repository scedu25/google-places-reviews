Text: It was our first visit to the Uptown Grill. And, it was wonderful! The chicken Parma and green beans was unforgettable. Service was friendly and welcoming. The ambiance is classy.  It has a beautiful lounge too!

Text: Everyone loves the whitefish Parmesan. It was good. My sister is in love with the fish tacos and can't resist ordering them every time she goes. The cheese purse pasta was amazing! Only one thing could make that better and that would be lobster! Crab Rangoon and mushrooms are always good. The Gorgonzola chips just okay. The escargot is full of oil and you can barely taste anything but oil.

Text: We were absolutely blown away by this restaurant! We were on our way to a high school football playoff game and needed to grab lunch. We were expecting it to be OK but were sorely mistaken because it was AMAZEBALLS! To start... Their homemade breads... Oh my... So delicious. I had the parmesan whitefish.... The best fish I've ever had out in a restaurant. My husband had the peanut Thai chicken and loved it as well. The green beans as a side... For sure a must! Homemade mashed potatoes were out of this world. To top it off we got the raspberry white chocolate chip cookies... To. Die. For. We live an hour and a half away from this restaurant but will definitely make the drive to come back. Better than any restaurant I've been to in the big city... Super clean, outstanding service and mouthwatering food. Wow.

Text: Wonderful atmosphere,  fun digital menu with photos of each item.  Delicious, amazing food.  I had fish tacos with strawberry/mango salsa which reminded me of Key West.  Hubby had tenderloin for lunch.  Appetizer was gorgonzola over homemade chips.

Text: Rehearsal dinner for my best friends wedding took place here. I had the pesto pasta and my girlfriend had the 20oz steak. Some of the best food I have ever eaten in my entire life. Well done.
