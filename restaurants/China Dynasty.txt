China Dynasty
Rating: 4
Text: We discovered China Dynasty online & decided to go because it had great reviews. We were not disappointed! The service was great! The food was delicious! The selection of dishes was incredible. One of the Chefs came around to assure we were enjoying our meals! 3 people ate appetizers & entrees for $50 & we were stuffed. I'd suggest making this your regular Chinese, Sushi or Thai place! I know most people eat Chinese at home & if you live in Centerville I saw delivery menus. My daughter & I are going to go back for just sushi soon.

Text: I would definitely recommend China Dynasty for anyone looking for fresh and delicious Chinese, Thai or Japanese cuisine. We sat in to eat for  a quick meal and were pleasantly surprised at the whole experience! The food was flavorful and made to order. It was delivered to our table in no time at all and our server, Steven, was more than friendly and pleasant! Will definitely be back in the near future!
