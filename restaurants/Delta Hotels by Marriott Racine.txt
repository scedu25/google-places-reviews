Delta Hotels by Marriott Racine

Text: Delta Hotels by Marriott Racine, was a very nice hotel. Clean rooms, comfortable beds and a friendly staff, all the things you expect from any Marriott hotel. Restaurant/Bar was nice did not eat in the restaurant we had our food catered in a separate meeting room. Food was delicious and plentiful. My only complaint is the same one I have for any and all of the higher end Marriott hotels, no complimentary breakfast.

Text: Staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. Rooms were great and comfortable although would have welcomed a mini fridge.  Great venue for a large gathering.  Will definitely stay here again if ever in the area.

Text: Absolutely a wonderful place! Service was outstanding! The restaurant was a little overpriced but that would be my only complaint.
