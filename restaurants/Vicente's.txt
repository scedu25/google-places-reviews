Text: I was excited to  try it, love Cuban food. It was ok. It's a production, they move people through! The pork dish was dry and nothing special at all. The Duck was good, but again not special. The soups were standard, the Black Bean soup not anything special. My ex-wife makes a much better black bean soup! I really wanted to like ti more. The service was pretty good, but they brought the main course within minutes of bringing the soup and appetizer. The mussels we very good! They were the redeeming part of the meal. Bottom line, it's fine but I had several  better meals when I visited Detroit.  I would not go back unless maybe I lived in the city and was running out of options.

Text: The food and staff was amazing. Sadly they market the food as Cuban and it is focused on Spanish cuisine. All and all a very good experience. The 50/50 sangria is amazing. Salmon is to die for.

Text: Great lunch experience. They make a mean cappuccino. Surprisingly decent vegetarian options there as well.

Dinner heats up with spicy music and salsa dancing.  Try the paella... Yum. Traditional Cuban.
