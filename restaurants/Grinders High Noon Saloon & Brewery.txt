Grinders High Noon Saloon & Brewery

Text: Pulled pork sandwich was only ok. After presenting food I was informed they no longer make the slaw that makes up at least 1/3 of the sandwich.... homemade chips were pretty good, but unseasoned. Beer was cold and decent variety.

Text: Great beer and drink selection. The pizza was very mediocre and lacking a good flavor. The Porter was great ??

Text: Soooo..... I will start with the good, the beer selection and pricing is amazing in this place. Do not order the Chicken Parm!! Burnt, tasteless, and not good. Bartender was all over the place and literally ate a burnt end and licked her fingers in front of us!!!! Maybe we'll stick to drinks on a friday night from now on

Text: Hadn’t eat there since Grinders came in. Food has improved over High Noon’s standard fare.
