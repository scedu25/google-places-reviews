Text: Great place for sushi and more importantly to me the only place in Bloomington to get anything close to real Korean food. Has been here for a very long time and there is good reason for that.

Text: so I got food poising today and was able to nail down the source due to only eating one thing today. I called the establishment to warn them of what made me sick so that no others suffer the same fate and first the guy said it was because I was not use to eating raw fish and when I told him that I not only frequently eat sushi but that I have eaten it from his restaurant before he then said it was my fault for ordering it. I reiterated that I was just calling to make him aware so that they can address the issue with that item and he said again it was my fault and that I am not sick.

Text: We usually go in for the lunch specials which are a good value and price. The wonton soup and Hot N Sour soup are great. The crab rangoons or wontons are fabulous. I usually get the green pepper and beef and my wife gets the box they call it. The kids get shrimp with noodles which they love. Could be a little faster on refilling drinks but the food is fabulous.
