Text: Probably some of the best food I've had in a restaurant. Their ramen and portabella burger were fantastic and the pork mac n' cheese was out of this world. Staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive. The place has a warm 'saloon' sort of feel to it and the outdoor seating area is very nice.

Text: First time visiting the Tap House.  We had shrimp cocktail from the raw bar,  Delicious!!,  The Sausage pizza was also delicious..we also had to try the Bavarian pretzel with beer cheese,  which was very good but does not come close to the ones at Santan brewery in Gilbert AZ.  The young man that was our server was very attentive. We will be back.

Text: I'm sure there are other good dinner places in Kzoo, but I wouldn't really know as I chose the Tap House all 4 nights of my stay! The food is fantastic, loved the burger, the truffle fries, the fish and chips, the Sriracha wings were especially amazing. A special shout-out to Darcie, who is an absolute delight, and who took fantastic care of our group as we celebrated my birthday.. Can't wait to go back next year!
