Text: Best Chicago-style hot dogs in the Illinois Valley!  Plus, they bring their italian sausage and polish right from the city... So, you get a Maxwell Street Polish... just like Maxwell street... and the pizzas... wow.  Real cheese... none of that imposter stuff... and the crust is thick... not that cracker style garbage... just the best.  On top of the hot dogs, sausage and polish... I recommend you try the Gyro pizza... it's amazing.

Text: I love the food. But I just called and asked for a delivery, the lady who answered rudely told me they didn't start delivering until 4 and hung up. Don't expect good business with an attitude like that.
