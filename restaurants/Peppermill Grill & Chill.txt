Peppermill Grill & Chill

Text: This place could easily be shut down if the code enforcement came through the door unexpectedly. Things, equipment, and the such that should be cleaned daily is cleaned weekly or monthly. They don't use any gloves to handle the uncooked or cooked food except to batter chicken. The grease is not replaced regularly as stated by code and regulations. They don't keep frozen foods in freezers, instead all their frozen foods are mostly kept in a wooden shed and kept inside coke can coolers you would take to a picnic or sports game. However the food still tastes great ans the workers are mostly great. 

They lack enough staff to be properly staffed and management there don't know how to run about 90% of things there. I don't see how they even stay open.

I just wish they would get up to code!

Text: Nice little place to stop for something fried and delicious. I got the chicken filet (which is a chicken sandwich with mayo and lettuce) with fries, and my wife got the two-cheeseburgers-for-$3 deal, along with an order of mac & cheese fries. The food was very fresh tasting, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The mac & cheese bites were very good as well, but you only get 5 of them for $2.50, so it didn't exactly feel like a great value for those.

The vibe is pretty chill (as the name might suggest). Country music playing over the speakers. Very odd decor. But I would come back again if I were ever in the area. Give it a try (and specifically, you've gotta try those fries; they're great)!
