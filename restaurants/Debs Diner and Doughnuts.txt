Text: Stopped for some breakfast on our long journey and what a find. Great spot for homemade breakfast! Get the sausage and homemade bread. They also have a wall of people who have visited from all over the world. And there's a grandma who makes homemade pot holders for all out of town visitors. Amazing.
