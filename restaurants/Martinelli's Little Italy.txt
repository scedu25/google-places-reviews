Text: The food here is delicious!  The food portions are quite large. Even though they were really busy we got our food quickly. We enjoy eating there. They have family style options that are fantastic-so much food! Making a reservation is a good idea.

Text: We were driving through Salina and had 3 hungry teenage girls, we didn't know where to go but they all agreed on a Italian restaurant - so I looked on my trusty Google maps and found this wonderful little place. Everything was delicious even the girls loved it and we all know how hard it is to please hungry teenagers! Everyone working here was super friendly and attentive to all, I will recommend this great little Italian restaurant to everyone. Thanks so much for the yummy food!

Text: A gem. The multigrain bread was fabulous. The salads were simple but very well put together. My husband had a steak and raved about it. I had the chicken pesto and was delighted. They offer adult small, regular and family style large on everything. My only regret...I'm too full for dessert.

Text: Delicious food! Portions were huge! Took my boyfriend here for his birthday, they gave him his dessert free of charge and threw a cute little sparkler on top for him too
