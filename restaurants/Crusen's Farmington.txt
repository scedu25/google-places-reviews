Text: Unless you're looking to hang out eith a lot of immature college kids do not go here. The food is terrible as well. The only plus is that the owner is a nice guy.

Text: Service awful.  Long wait for waitress.  From entry to restaurant to receiving food was an hour.  One of our party asked for a rare hamburger.  Received chicken.  Declined change in food because we needed to get to play.  No credit given for error.  We had to call wait staff to table to ask for drink refills.  No one checked on us.  Didn't even come back to get check payment.  After trying to get their attention we just left money on table.  We were late to the play.  We had allowed 1 1/2 hrs

Text: Great food, environment and fun! 

Crusens has the best tenderloin in Peoria. They have good specials on both food and drinks daily. Good place for the entire family during the day and entertainment in the evenings. If you are looking to see a great show or going out dancing, they have something for everyone. 

The patio is comfortable, with a great bar and an outdoor fireplace.

Came across this place just by accident. I am from out of town in for the basketball state tournament and stopped at the gas station across the street and one of the managers invited me over. This place has very friendly managers and great food. Entertainment is excellent too.
