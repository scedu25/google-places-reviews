Text: I've been here several times and as far as I can remember always enjoyed it. However, this was the first time I've tried the Spinach and Artichoke dip and I'm so sad I didn't try it sooner! It's awesome! Especially with the fried tortilla chips it comes with! The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was also really good and decently priced. However, the 4 instead of 5 stars comes from the super dry wheat bread. It used to be so good but either they were having an off day or it's just not as good as it used to be.

Text: After driving 1,000 miles from south Texas I stopped off at this gem.   Delicious food, great wait staff.  Cold beer and a great environment.  I'm here for 4 days and I'll eat here at least once each day.
