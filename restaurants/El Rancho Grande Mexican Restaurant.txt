Text: It only get a 1 star because it won't give me a negative one.. those assholes were too worried about getting out of the at 830 during the week to give me the right order .. I got home and I absolutely hate grilled onions and peppers... I ordered something totally different! And I normally would make it work.. but not with grilled onions and peppers.. way way way disappointed.. I ate the few chips and salsa.. then a bowl of ceral.. wth

Text: Great food! Great lunch specials including higher end dinner entrees at a low price. Staff is very nice and quietly attentive. It's a nice little oasis to dine in.

Text: The first time I went in there it smelt like a backed up sewer but the food was OK and I gave it a chance. I went in there again two weeks later and it smelt like a backed up sewer again I just walk right out of the place it was absolutely disgusting.

Text: The food was good and they have a nice selection of dishes. Service was ok, they were a little behind on getting the tables bussed but the overall appearance of he place is good.  A good place to bring kids, but a little noisy because of it.
