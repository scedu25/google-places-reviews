Text: Good cheap pizza. Better than store bought yet not as good as specialty pizza places. Phone service is sometimes off putting but the pizza is worth any wait. The King size pizza are a great value and a few of them can feed an army of kids. If the place had better ingredients, it would be better but more expensive.
