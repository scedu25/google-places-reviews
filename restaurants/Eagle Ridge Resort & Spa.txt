Eagle Ridge Resort & Spa

Text: Our new favorite getaway.  Beautiful does not do it justice.  Great food, great service, clean, comfortable rooms.  Litteraly miles and miles of trails, so be sure to get the numbered trail map from the front desk and bring a pack if you are out hiking in late October as the weather can change quickly and this place is HUGE!  I was delighted and can't wait to come back!

Text: The staff was very pleasant at check in and all interactions, the room was clean and very nice. The property is beautiful! There are a number of restaurants on the property. We are at both Woodstone and the restaurant that offers breakfast at the main resort building. Both were above average though nothing spectacular. We did not utilize the spa but enjoyed the pool, playground and 2 hour boat rental that is included in your room fee. There is also a quaint little general store with from grocery items, gifts, alcohol and gas which was very handy.

Text: The entire experience at Eagle Ridge was absolutely phenomenal for our wedding. We made several visits to Eagle Ridge during the planning phase and they were all phenomenal. We worked with three different wedding planners at Eagle Ridge, all of which were phenomenal, especially Maggie Truppa. We had our wedding downtown in Grant Park and our reception in the main ballroom back at Eagle Ridge. The customer service at Eagle Ridge is first class. We rented their signature home #604 for the welcome party and that was wonderful. The bellman repeatedly came out to deliver ice and fresh towels and pick up any garbage. The reception couldn't have gone any better. Maggie coordinated everything perfectly with all of our vendors and the night flowed perfectly. I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone!

Text: Purchased a Groupon for a  2 bedroom villa. We were sent to a Room of a building that was under construction. As soon as we got in the Room I opened the shades and there's a man looking at me on a Crane. I went back to the office where they relocated us to a better place after I had to complain.   No one should have been sent to that building. Then we go to the fancy restaurant and the premises and I asked to sit by window to enjoy the view.  I observed open tables and the lady sits us right next to the kitchen. I was not impressed with this resort at all. I've never felt discriminated against in my life because of race. This was a first.

Text: Attended a wedding. From the wedding coordinators to the general staff at the Inn, 5 stars across the board. Friendliness, follow up and prompt service. I have visited many times in the past, both for work and pleasure. I most definitely have a critical eye for service and detail. Their staff truly impressed me, which is not easy to do. Front desk staff as well as some of the folks I interacted with behind the scenes truly were knowledgeable caring people. I will recommend and return.
