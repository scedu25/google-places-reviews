New Harmony Inn Resort & Conference Center

Text: The inn building and grounds are lovely, especially the lake with swans in it. We are dinner at the Red Geranium, which is the restaurant adjacent to the inn. The food was delicious, very flavorful and well presented. The service was also excellent. It was a romantic place for an anniversary dinner, and would also be an excellent location for a wedding.

Text: We stayed in the Orchard House. It was furnished in antique period furniture and art work. Still, it was very comfortable. The entire town is like a museum and is considered a "golf cart city" with everything in walking (or cart) distance.

Text: This more of an arts and craft region of southern Indiana.  The inn is walking distance to any sightseeing event.  The food was equal to a 5 star restaurant.   A continental breakfast average and an omelet maker (real person) was there if you wanted more variety.

Text: My room was decent. The mattresses were hard and uncomfortable. The shower was dirty. We ate at  Red Geranium. I ordered fried green tomatoes for my appetizer. I wanted a more traditional take on the recipe so I wasn't able to enjoy what they served. For my dinner I ordered the ribeye. It came cooked to order but had no seasoning of any kind. 
The breakfast offered definitely did not match the price of the room. The offerings were muffins, 3 kinds of bagles, toasted and cereal. And the omelet bar for a fee. All in all, not worth the time or $
