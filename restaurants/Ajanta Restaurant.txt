Text: Best Indian food! It was my first time and I enjoyed the wonderful flavor and the portions were great for the price. I had Lamb and shrimp it was delicious. I could have been happy with just naan and their yogurt dip. The staff was amazing, they were all so kind. I will definitely be back!!!

Text: I like the food and atmosphere..
You'll definitely be sweating your but off from all the spices.. very flavorful.. believe me , you'll be full the rest of the day..The only complaint is it feels like the staff is staring at you wanting you to hurry up..or it could just be me..
All n all a great place to experience some real Indian food.

Text: Just pure, absolute heaven! I always enjoy the buffet but my true favorite Ajanta is the dining experience here at night. Made completely from scratch, each dish has a unique flavor that makes me come back night after night. Come check it out!

Text: If you're looking for a superb Indian restaurant, Ajanta Restaurant near Kettering is amazing! We always go for the buffet. The chicken tikka masala is my favorite with saag paneer as a close runner up and rice pudding for dessert. They also bring fresh plates of naan to your table with free refills. Delicious!

Text: I have been here on one of my friend's suggestion..Food was good there is no regret in that. Ambience was awesome..!! Maintenance was clean and tidy. If there is one reason that stops me from coming back here it is the observant and rude staff. They don't treat customers in a polite way despite of that they keep watching us and literally they are ready to pull your plate from you in case you take a small pause from eating, assuming that you are done with eating. That made me and my friends to pack all the food we ordered and got it home to have. That would be better if you make improvisation in greeting people.
