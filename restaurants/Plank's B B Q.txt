Text: Great food, great service! We stopped here after visiting the zoo. The food was delicious. The waitress and staff were so helpful, patient and kind. We will definitely be dining here again when we visit Garden City. They were super nice to my daughter. The food was a bargain, great food for a great price!

Text: Had lunch buffet with pulled pork, fajitas, baked beans, savory potato salad and blackberry cobbler.  The food and service were both great.  The spicy barbeque sauce is some of the best I've ever had... Definitely recommend.

Text: TERRIBLE dine in experience. Waitress was babysitting her toddler while working. Her kid screamed, ran around, and slammed doors and she did not stop him. She talked on the restaurant phone the entire time and ended up ignoring us for the rest of our meal. And made me get up to ask a question. Food tasted old. I give it 2 stars because the time I have had a take out platter it has been decent.
