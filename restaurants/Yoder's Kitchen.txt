Text: Great meatloaf and party potatoes! Had to add salt and pepper,  but that is to be expected as a lot of people have different tastes.  Didn't care for the tator tot casserole, but I will go back just for the meatloaf!!

Text: Prime Rib Buffet was incredible, prime rib was cut with a fork, and the broasted chicken is tender and juicy, puts mine to shame. We all are leaving miserable because we acted like we've never eaten before! If you love good food do yourself a favor and come here!

Text: Our waitress was very kind. All the drinks at our table were kept full. Many trips were made by Louise our waitress to keep the table clean and to be sure we didn't need anything. The food was excellent. The buffet was kept fresh and well stocked. Thank you to all the staff that work hard to keep this very busy restaurant going

Text: I visited Yoders Kitchen for the first time while on a road trip. The food and service were outstanding. I will visit asap. I am from St. Louis but it is worth the drive.
