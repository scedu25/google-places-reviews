Text: We came here tonight with high hopes. Neither my fiancee nor I had been here for several years. We were extremely disappointed with our experience. Our food was NOT good! My dish was very bland, the sides were heavily salted. My fiancee's spaghetti was so garlic heavy as to be almost inedible and the meatballs were dry and burnt tasting. I am not trying to dump on this place, just stating that we paid good money for a very sub-par meal. I hope that the owners read this and take it as a challenge to step up their game to get back to where they once were.

Text: It has a local pub feel with great family-style food. There are some excellent choices on the menu including pasta, tenderloin and steak. There is a room for a group of 20...we take some of our board members and volunteers there at different times throughout the year. It's an old place that is not much to look at, but the food is worth it. They only serve dinner.
