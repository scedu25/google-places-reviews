Text: Always excellent food!  We have eaten here about twice a month for the last eight teen months and have never had a bad meal.  Prime rib, steaks, pork chops - all excellent!  The baked potatoes are fluffy and the vegetables are fresh, not canned.  Can't wait for Brussels sprouts to return!  We've not had the desserts (there's never room), but I bet they're delicious, too!  The servers are well-trained - always knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.

Text: Dinner rolls were hard and cold.  The steak had no flavor and had so much gristle.  I should have known when the menu said let us flavor your steak for $2.99.  I love steak but that was by far the worst steak I have ever had.  My husband who is not hard to please agreed.  I dont mind paying good money for a good steak but this was truly a waste of $40.00. Should have went to the Taco Bell right next to it. Food would have been better and less expensive.  Waste of money and totally flavorless food.  Would never recommend this place

Text: It's a Motel6, so definitely budget motel. But it was very clean, had good beds, and no extra charge for our dog. Limited outlets and no hair dryer (but they would bring one if you needed). Microwave and refrig but no coffee pot. Right next to McDonalds tho.

Text: The place could use a good cleaning  (heavy dust in windows, dirty glass, .. BUT...whoever grilled the T-bone to tonight would probably get two thumbs up from Gordon Ramsey as well as me! Sydney was my server and a real delight. Nice casual ambiance, bar, dining on 3 levels. Mattoon needs a place like this!

Text: As always a great dining experience, from the drinks, to the food to the service, all 5 star! Steaks, prime rib all excellent. I enjoy the bull bites and hen pecks as well.
