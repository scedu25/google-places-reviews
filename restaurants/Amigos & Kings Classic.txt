Text: My coworker drove to amigos to get us and another coworker some lunch. When she returned, we realized they forgot a taco so she called Amigos. They brought the taco to our work! and they threw in some free crispos! Ive never heard of a fast food place with such great customer service. Great job guys!

Text: I love Amigos. I eat here at least 2 times a week if not more. The service is great might be slow in drive through once in a while but at least you know your food is being prepped and ready to go fresh. My orders are about 99% done correctly everytime no one is prefect but this place for a fastfood place is pretty damn close to perfect. Lindsy is my favorite she knows my orders and knows exactly the way I like my food since I am there so often so when I forget something she just says oh threw that in your bag for you because you forgot to order it. That is customer service right there.
