Text: Service was great! Server was new, but offered attentive service with smile & friendly personality. Menu offered various selections (with prices far reasonable than finer steakhouses)-- but chose porterhouse. Steak was superb--cooked exactly to preferences (on first try)!! Tender, juicy, flavorful, &  melt in your mouth goodness! No need for sauce. Sides were tasty--recommend white cheddar Mac & cheese; baked potato casserole, and baked beans. Lively atmosphere! Expect to possibly walk on few discarded peanut shells. Their bar and outside deck was crowded with folks enjoying themselves. Will definitely be returning for future meals when visiting this area!

Text: Good food and attentive wait staff. Atmosphere is family so expect screaming unruly parents now and then. Don't like the peanuts on the floor, but that's one of their trademarks. Sad and it makes it a lower class eating establishment to me.
