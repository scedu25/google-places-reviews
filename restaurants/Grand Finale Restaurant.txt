Grand Finale Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Great Sunday Brunch. Takes reservations. Reasonable (about $18 per person) - but taxes and coffee are á la Carter so you could be surprised that your final tab has is closer to $22-23 per person without a Bloody Mary or Mimosa.  Food and service were outstanding.  Worth every penny.

Text: This restaurant has very nice decor and an interesting menu for this area. I went here the other night with a business partner and we both ordered strip steaks. The quality of the meat was superb, but there was no seasoning at all. I have never had such a bland piece of steak in my life. Not even a hint of salt or pepper. Nothing. The crepes were good, but that's about all I can say.

Text: You can never go wrong with a Grand Finale brunch. The eggs and the hash browns are always good and the cinnamon rolls are fantastic. I always love going to Grand Finale. My favorite place for brunch.
