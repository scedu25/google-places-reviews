Text: Great restaurant! Everything was really good, but I really loved the spinach artichoke ravioli and the Irish crisps. Our waitress was  very helpful and kept it drinks full. Really loved the atmosphere. Hope to go back soon! ????

Text: Great atmosphere. Good people. Didn't get a chance to eat this time but they have a gluten free menu so will probably go up to 5 when we do.

Text: Go when there's live music and not too many people. Unless you like crowds. In that case, go on Saturday night. Not sure why they had police kicking people out at closing time. Maybe there isn't enough real crime in St. Louis. No, wait. That's not it.

Text: My first visit was just over three years ago when I was meeting an online date, who had a strong Irish background and felt protected enough by the other patrons that she called friends to meet her online date for the very first time.
Since then I have returned many times for the music, the festivals, the food and brew, and to celebrate each anniversary with that same girl.
Each time we visit, we have a great time, with good food and drink. Our service has always been top notch, and the atmosphere is electric.
If you are trying to connect to your Irish roots, McGurk's is a great place to be!

Text: Helpful and infomed staff. Great eats with very nice draft beer selections. Live music was very good as well but I  don't know how often that occurs.
