Showtime Pizza And Tanning
Rating: 1
Text: We walked out because we couldn't get served.  We sat at our table for 15 minutes while the waitress took care of everyone around us, and then started wiping down tables and organizing the dirty dishes.  She wouldn't even LOOK at us, and she passed out table at least a half dozen times.  We felt invisible and unwanted.  Maybe she would have spoken to us if we had been locals and she recognized us, but it's hard to know.  I'd have to recommend that out-of-towners go elsewhere.

Text: Steak and a tan! Yes you can.  Good food, friendly staff, parking is a little tight. Try the Baked Spaghetti, or get the huge Chicken strips with some better than average curly fries. The Carrot cake is also awesome, best ice cream in town.
