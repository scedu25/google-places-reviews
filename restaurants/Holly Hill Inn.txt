Text: Excellent food, seasonal menus. Definitely recommend reservations. Prepare for a relaxing, leisurely meal made with flavorful local cuisine. Heavy southern influence, but when has that ever been a bad thing?

Upscale southern comfort food in a beautiful setting. If you eat outside, you may want to pack a jacket or sweater - the porch is fairly shady.

Text: The food and staff are amazing !! Always so kind. Donna the manager is very sweet and the host/little bit of everything (forgive me I forgot her name ) but she has brown hair and was smiling and genuinely  friendly.. And she knew so much about the restaurant and history of the business!! Will definitely be back !!
