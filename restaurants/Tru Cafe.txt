Text: The service was fast, staff awesome and atmosphere welcoming and warm. The walls were covered in local art and the iced mocha I got was amazing. I will keep coming here and I will love every second of it.

Text: Perfect spot to stop in for coffee and food when I am in town for work or pleasure. Wifi, local art, organic quality ingredients, unique atmosphere, great background music, friendly fun staff and owners.

Text: The first time I went, it was nice, but every piece of food seemed like it was filled with garlic. Staff has always been less than friendly and not very attentive. They open at 7 or so, but don't serve their menu until 10:30, which is absurd. Just so fickle.
