Text: Wonderful place , Friendly and will even whip up whatever combination you want on the buffet ....... unlike pizza hut where we were told quote " oh the BBQ pepperoni isn't on our menu so we can't alter the ingredients for you " end of quote........
But Classic pizza, didn't have any complaints when I asked for garlic butter sauce with pepperoni......in fact He said ....." I'll have that in about 8 minutes for ya " 
Would definitely recommend Classic pizza & pasta !!!!
