Text: The food is always super tasty and their specials are always so hard to choose from... they always all sound good! I don't drink, but whenever we go for dinner there I get 1 beer from whatever micro brew they have on tap. Always different and always good. Their service is great and staff all friendly. Their fries are some of the best I've ever had. We always go to Jack's every time we have a chance to get out. We've yet to have a bad meal or experience.

Text: Wow, great food, great service! Decent variety on the menu and our server made some excellent recommendations. We also enjoyed a couple of beer flights to try three of the local brews (oatmeal stout rules!)

We sat on the covered porch on a cold night and were perfectly warm through dinner.

Would definitely return if I find myself in Kingsville again for a meal!

Text: We went to Jack's Gastropub for lunch. The food was excellent that was all made from scratch. The service was attentive and friendly. I had the Plain Jane burger and it was freshly made, while my wife have the Irish Nachos (made with home made kettle chips). Both were delicious. I would also recommend trying the craft beer available here.

Text: Reuben turkey burger with montreal smoked meat and homemade (?) Mustard -good. 
Jack beef burger w back bacon and onion jam - amazing. French onion soup -over the top. Staff super friendly. Great beer selection- their own and other craft. Coffee wonderful. Peach and berry crumble has a secret ingredient in the background server would not tell us what it was.   We'll just have to keep coming back until we figure it out.

Text: Jack's is in the heart of Kingsville, right off the main street, yet feeling far removed from the hustle. My husband and I came in from the city for dinner for our anniversary. We had visited a couple years ago and just loved it. It's in an old home, so you can just imagine the happenings in its day as you walk through. Both my husband and I got the weekly specials on the waitress's suggestion. The waitstaff is fantastic and the food is amazing. I recommend even just their restaurant to everyone I know. Love this restaurant and love Kingsville.
