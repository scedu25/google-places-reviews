Text: Either the lady was having a bad day or she is a little Racist. However, poor service means no money exchange, I ask for my money back after she rolled her eyes at me for asking a question. If I could give it a no star I would have. :(

Text: Haha. If I could give it zero stars I would. Anyways. 3 group of people including myself just went and wait for service. The lady inside never said a word to anybody. We all waited for a minute or so but it was clear she didn't want anybody money. So me and and and two others just bailed. Maybe making money is an offense or something. Lol

Text: The pan fried dumpling are delicious here! Crab Rangoon are great as well. The Honey chicken is breaded like sweet and sour chicken that you normally see at Asian restaurants and then fried in a deliciously sweet sauce.  I do not like dark meat chicken dishes so it is my favorite.
