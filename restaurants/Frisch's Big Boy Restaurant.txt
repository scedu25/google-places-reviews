Frisch's Big Boy Restaurant

Text: I have eaten here many times, so I'm not going to deduct a star just because my last experience wasn't top notch. I usually get the breakfast buffet which they also offer on Tuesday evenings. Last Tuesday night the food on the buffet wasn't quite as hot as it should have been. It's always been hot when offered in the morning, though. On that particular visit the service wasn't as attentive as usual, but it's usually fine. Frisch's has the world's best tartar sauce. I'd recommend this Frisch's to anyone.
