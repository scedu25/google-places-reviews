Woody's Family Restaurant

Text: I walked into what seemed like a rather small-town restaurant--it seemed like many people knew each other. I was surprised and pleased to see: 1) They had a gyro on the menu! 2) It was quite good! I really like how they prepare the fries--they are crispy on the outside.

I waited what seemed like a very long time to get the check (I was on my way home and wanted to keep going), and trust that was a one-off.

Text: Excellent food. Don't let the small buffet fool you. No cheap carb loaded cheap filler foods. Fresh foods, home cooking, and everything is good. From fresh soups, salads, homemade pies, and on to the hot stuff! Fresh hand battered fish, pot roast, fried chicken, seafood, and other meat offerings. Real mashed taters with fresh gravy... Not from a can or an envelope. So many yummy things. And every item on the buffet is very good.  Great staff. You're treated like family. The restaurant owner will refill glasses and take away plates. He's very personable.

Text: Called and ordered ahead. I am allergic to tomatoes.  Order was not only correct, but for a hamburger,  fries and cup of soup it was $7.12 tax included. Food was good. I hate hamburgers from years of fast food, but this one wasn't like that. It was tasty and made mw want another lol. I will stop here again and won't be afraid to grab another hamburger; )
