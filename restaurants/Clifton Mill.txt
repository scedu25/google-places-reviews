Text: I've visited this place 3 times since I first discovered it a few months ago. It is an authentic gem hidden in Ohio, with amazing food and especially the massive pancakes. Though known for there Christmas, this is a true beauty throughout the entire year. Great personal customer service as well!

Text: One of the best breakfast meals I’ve had in a long time. I had the pancakes. .They are huge and the best I’ve ever eaten. Service was fast and very friendly.

Text: The atmosphere of the entire compound is wonderful, like stepping back in time. The food is always very good. We have about an hours travel time, so we can only make the trip a few times a year, but well worth the effort. Never dissappointed.

Text: I could of got better food @ McDonald's.  Place is a dump. Drove 2+ hrs from home to eat on a Sunday. They really know market the place. It was dirty & food was ridiculous. Got a chicken wrap (mostly lettuce) for $9.00 & I think they counted out 12 chip's on the plate. Fries were almost 2.00 extra. WON'T BE BACK!! UNLESS NEW MANAGEMENT. Been to way nicer places with excellent food & pricing about the same

Text: Similar experience to the other reviewers. Beautiful outdoor space, waterfall, covered bridge, etc. Food was very disappointing.
 
My wife ordered a BLT, which had a total of 2 pieces of bacon on it. My son'a meal was $4.25 for a kids French toast meal, which only included 1 piece of French toast. He was still hungry.

My hamburger was definitely a frozen patty. Tasted okay. Thought it was audacious to list that condiments were extra, like onions, cheese, and even tomatoes. Pickles and lettuce were the only thing included. The burger was already $8-9. 

Such a bummer. Wanted to like this place, but it just seemed incredibly disorganized, and understaffed.
