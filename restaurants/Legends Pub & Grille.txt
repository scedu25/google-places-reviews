Text: I enjoyed the atmosphere it's also a sports bar, although I went during lunch and early afternoon with my daughter and 4 yr and 2 yr old grandsons. They have high chairs and booster seats. Family friendly.  Wide variety of appetizers and meal choices. Priced moderate to high. I will be going back again.

Text: We ordered to go on our way through town as an alternative to greasy, chain fast food restaurants. Everything we ordered was hot and ready to go when we arrived. It was very affordable and every dish was delicious. The catfish changed my husbands life. Service was great as the waitress even helped me carry our to go drinks to the car. Highly recommend this quality find.

Text: Best restaurant in Pratt. Their steak is so tender, it almost melts in your mouth. Our server continually checked on our drinks and made sure we were satisfied.

Text: The food was great! The atmosphere was very laid back. Loved it. It did take a while for your waitot to take our order. Bit I'm going to chalk it up to her having a busy section. But other than that it was great!
