Shawnee Bluff Winery
Rating: 5
Text: What a darling find! Located on a bluff above the lake with cottage style rooms with balcony and lake views. Go inside for a wine tasting then carry a bottle over to outdoor patio's to take in the lake at sunset, order dinner,  a cheese and meat plate or just relax to the weekends live music.  Make this place a regular spot. You'll be glad you did!

Text: Nice atmosphere but sat for 20 minutes waiting for someone to serve us as they came to tables next to us many times. Disappointed in the staff's lack of awareness of their customers, especially the sorry excuse for a sommelier ( pony tailed guy), who told us if we went outside we would be served and walked past us many times. Unless you want to wait all night for stuck up staff to not serve you, don't waste your time.

Text: Stayed for our 10th anniversary.  Buildings were built in 1931.  Outside was nostalgic and cute.  Inside was new and comfortable.  Still being updated but the view, relaxing patio, and location made up for the small older bathroom.  We are already trying to figure when we will stay here again.
