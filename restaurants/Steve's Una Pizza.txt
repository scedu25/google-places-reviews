Text: Smells delicious.   Looks like how strombollies are too look.   Lots of meat and sauce.  Cheese melted just right.  Taste is great.  Actually best tasting strom ever!

Text: Been going here for years... after a change in ownership anbd new employees, it's going down in customer service and pizza quality.  

Got a pizza pie 10/16/17... cheese barely done toppings flavorless.  Manager said, well that's how they do their house pizza.  Back to my old spot.
