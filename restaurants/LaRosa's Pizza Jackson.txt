LaRosa's Pizza Jackson
Rating: 1
Text: The gluten free pizza that was recommended for those with dairy and egg allergies is awful! The pizza came out before the appetizer. Had to stand to look for my waitress numerous times. Didn't give enough sauce for appetizers for 3 people. Barely enough for 1 person. Soda all over the sides of the to-go cups. Didn't get plates or napkins with the cinnamon dippers (which are vegan luckily; those were good at least) after we had to find our waitress to even order dessert. Women's bathroom was an absolute mess. Just terrible all around. My family and I will never be back here.

Text: This restaurant was so good and convenient to our hotel.  The waitress was excellent and told us that the portions were big, so my husband and I split a lasagna dinner and added an extra soup.  It was delicious and had plenty of food for the two of us.
