Text: This place is wonderful.  It is locally owned by an extremely nice man.  He will strike conversations with you about anything.  He is obviously extremely passionate about his place.  I love going to here because they have a deal everyday.  My favorite deal is the Thursday deal; you get a free taco with a quesadilla.  By the way, their quesadillas are wonderful!  I always get one everytime I visit.
I recommend this place to anyone looking for something new to try.

Text: Last time I was there I ordered their honey chicken tacos to go, but when I sat down at home and opened the bag of tacos they all smelled like they were rancid. The smell was so bad that i had to throw them all away.

Text: Great food, but the owner was really mean to his employees when they were trying to help. I came in and waited 10-15 minutes and there was no one else in front of me and my friend and I were just standing there waiting to get helped. An employee finally comes over (they were making burritos in the back) to help us, and while he helps us the owner comes over and yells at him for leaving the burrito making in the back to come help us. Apparently there was an order for 30-50 burritos and the owner felt the need to make other customers wait longer than we had. My only regret is not standing up for the employee while I was there.
