Text: Excellent tasting food, top quality. Glad we stop. It was slightly higher priced than most barbecue places, but I think it's because the quality was hard. It was worth it, definitely would go back.  Good people working there were very friendly. We felt welcome.

Text: Awesome food! I had burnt ends and my brother had pulled pork and they were both delicious. This coming from Kansas Citians (aka BBQ snobs). The meat was tender with just enough fat to keep it flavorful and juicy, but not too much to where it's off-putting. The fries were amazing as well. And we were quite surprised how affordable it was. We will definitely be stopping there in the future when we are driving past that area

Text: The food is amazing. Best ribs around. If you have sweet tooth their pies are really good. The people are extremely nice.

Text: Managed to miss the lunch crowd somehow (although it looks like they showed up right after me!) We had a great burnt end  sandwich...no sauce. (You can add the sweet bbq sauce if you like) but I just dipped). The  homemade fries were fresh, crisp - not greasy, and plentisome. The beef  was smoked well - excellent taste, tender and not overly smoky. We also ordered the ham sandwich. ..the ham was thin sliced... great taste but maybe sliced a tad too thin because it made it a little dry to try to eat without any sauce or condiments. Would we go back. Absolutely. Quick, easy order at the counter.. not too  pricey and clean tables to eat at. Glad we stopped there.
