Text: Food was terrible. I should have sent it back. My tenderloin was burnt, and I ordered fries and got a salad. Everyone's food was just not good, and was very pricey. Our waitress was mad because she was ask if anyone was going to help us, so therefore she was not helpful. I wanted to know what kind of fish was on the menu and she told me she had no idea, it was frozen. Not a good experience, definitely will not go back.

Text: This place is terrible.  We've been here for 40 minutes.  There are only 3 tables with people sitting at them.  Wait staff keeps walking
by ignoring us.  We've had to flag them down several times amd still no food.  On top of it, the prices are OUTRAGEOUS.  This is way too expensive of a restaurant to treat people so badly.  Watch - the good will probably suck, too.

Text: This is perhaps the most disorganized restaurant I've ever been too. There are no adults & the kids are clueless here. Waited 20 minutes for server. Never got the complete order. The ribs are horrible! And it's expensive. Don't waste your money.

Text: Holy heck is this place slow. Maybe the longest I've ever had to wait for a lunch. Wait staff is kind and food is pretty decent. Just really really slow

Text: We came and waited at the bar first for four simple drinks for about forty minutes. The bartender complained the whole time about other customers. Then we decided to try the restaurant. We continued to wait over an hour for sub par cold  EXPENSIVE food. They really need to work on their service in the restaurant.
