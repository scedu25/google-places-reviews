Text: One of the girlfriend's and I's new favorite places to eat. Service has been amazing even during busy times on Saturday. Would recommend calling ahead of time on them days.. beer and food are delicious. Definitely recommend wings and cheese fries and ribs

Text: Good food but didn't really wow me. Prices were just a little higher than I like but, I imagine they're in the ballpark of similar restaurants in that style.

Text: It's ok, have been a couple times, only cause a family members wanted to meet there.  Fettuccine is horrible. So I get the chicken fried chicken this time, chicken was dry sadly, no flavors, just takes a little salt and pepper.  But others seem to like it on here...
Service was fine, just haven't found anything good to eat there.
