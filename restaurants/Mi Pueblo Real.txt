Mi Pueblo Real

Text: With the low ratings and the fact that's It's in the middle of a small town in Iowa, I wasn't expecting too much. It's not the worst Mexican I've had. So for what it is, it's ok. The people behind us had an issue with getting the wrong order and they charged us over $11 for a kids meal?? They later fixed the price. Keep your expectations low and you will be fine.

Text: Best Mexican food in Iowa.  Are there with my wife (who is Mexican), and she was very impressed!  All the dishes we tried were authentic and flavorful.  Only complaint of ours were the margaritas.  They were not prepared well and had very little alcohol.

Text: Food and service was horrible! .asked to speak to a manger and none was available...they refused to take anything off of our bill and gave us a phone # to call...we called and left a message and never received a call back! Don't waste your time!
