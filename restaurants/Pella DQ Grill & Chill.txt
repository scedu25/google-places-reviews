Text: It's Dairy Queen.  I love a good blazzard.  The lady helping us was much nicer than you'd usually get at a fast food place, hence the 5 stars.

Text: Worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. There was no one in line but took 35 minutes for my damn, simple and easy chicken tenders to get to me. The workers were completely rude to me, and the other customers in the building. 10/10 would not recommend. Also have a feeling the cashier w the short hair spit in my food, not to mention I found a hair in my food. F that place.

Text: Food was fine. Service sucked. Especially with the blizzards. When blizzard is upside down not supposed to drip out? plus dirty tables with seats and pop machine. Had water in frony of it. Doors open when its hot out. Don't want to go back

Text: I had been there multiple times and was given pretty crappy service. Waited for 20+ minutes for just a burger and fries on two occasions and one of those times, the food was cold and wasn't made right.
Would not recommend for a place to eat.
