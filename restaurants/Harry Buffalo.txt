Text: Affordable place to eat some bar food and grab a couple drinks. 

Service: it was busy when we showed up, fried chicken and a sandwich was ordered and it took just over 1 hour to receive the food. There was a single bartender and 4 servers on shift, we sat directly in front of the draft beers and it took maybe 15 minutes to get noticed or to get another beer. Service was very slow, but the staff was polite and professional

There are two identical bars and eating areas, separated by a door. Cool design and I wish more places adopted that.

A bill for two guys to get a dinner and a couple drinks was only $55

One of the most affordable places to eat by far, I will be back.

Text: I enjoyed the Barbecue Bacon Bison Burger... was nice & juicy, and pleasingly well-dressed. Waitress was super-nice. Restaraunt clean, and atmosphere quite nice. Considerably recommendable.

Text: I did not dislike thus place.  In fact I enjoyed my burger very much.  It was ALL open air and I would have preferred something air conditioned.  Also the ladies room was not handicapped friendly.  The toilet was very low.  There were no bars.  I had to go, but I ended up not using the facilities because of the lack of accessibility.

Text: Great place to go before or after a game. Tons of seating so you'll usually be able to find a spot. Food is decent but there's better in the area. Service is usually good.
