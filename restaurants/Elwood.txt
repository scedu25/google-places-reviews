Text: Only had a few beers before the Tigers game. It was very busy but was served quickly. Fun atmosphere. Lot's of outdoor seating.

Text: Had dinner here before Lions preseason game. Service was incredibly slow (they were busy, but not insanely so). Kid's meals came out 20 minutes before our sandwiches, my chicken BLT was missing the avocado. Limp, mostly tasteless fries. Kids did like their grilled cheese, but for the sides, the pickle spear was laid over the watermelon slice and so the watermelon tasted like pickle lol. No refills offered on our drinks til we asked for the check, which was $55 for 2 kids meals and 2 sandwiches. Smaller glasses and everyone was out pretty early in the meal. Don't know if they were short-staffed at that time or just a mediocre restaurant, but we won't be back. Cannot beat the location right across from Ford Field, so go there if that is your most important criteria, and you don't mind lackluster food.

Text: Terrible service came here in a field trip and Rita was very rude.  A lot of kids didnt get the correct change back. And after, all the food made our stomach hurt.

Text: This place is more for convenience of grabbing a beer and something to eat than looking for a good meal and trying craft beers. I think it has perfect location for I simple hang out before or after a game.

Text: Terrible place. Went here twice for Lions games. Service was awful. Food choices stunk. They kick all patrons out at halftime. The folks inside were overly drunk, obnoxious, and aggressive. It's too bad because it's a classic art deco dinner that was rescued from the wrecking ball and moved to what you would think is a sweet location. I'd really like to give them my business but I just can't risk another horrendous experience like the last two. Extremely disappointing!
