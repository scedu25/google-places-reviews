Anna's Pizza & Pasta
Rating: 5
Text: Wonderful small town Italian restaurant. They have great pizza and their Friday night fish fry is a must go. Small dining area, but great for take out or delivery. If you go in you might have to wait briefly for a table. The owner does a lot for the community as well. They are a great business to have in Winnebago.

Text: I love Anna's Pizza. We pick up our pizza and then we go and eat as a family at Severson Dells Nature Preserve. It is awesome having great food and a beautiful view of nature.

Text: We love Anna's Pizza in Winnebago.  It's got a great small town America pizza joint  feel to it and the food is spectacular.  I love the flat bread pizzas and the tortellini spinach/carbonara.  It's truly a gem of a pizza place for Winnebago.
