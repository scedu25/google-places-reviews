Text: The food was pretty good. We went on seafood buffet night. The staff was very friendly. I don't feel that the food was great enough to warrant nearly $18 a person. The cups had a funny smell that gave the soda a weird aftertaste. It said on their flyer that they would have creme brulee. There was none. I was disappointed about that. It was good, just not great.
