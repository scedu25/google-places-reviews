Junction Cafe

Text: Really great experience at this cafe. We were traveling with a toddler on our way down to Missouri and Bedford made for a perfect stop. The young woman who served up was so helpful and professional. We were there just a few hours before the big eclipse and the restaurant was unusually busy. In spite of this, we never had to wait long for anything. Breakfast was delicious! Omelettes, bacon and toast. Pancakes for the kid. It was beautiful just to sit for a while and watch the clouds roll past. We'll definitely be back next time we're in southern Iowa.

A+ Service. Food was delicious. Bathrooms were top-notch.

Text: A nice, clean cafe with good solid food for breakfast served by very pleasant and competent young women.  Also, on the main road, so it's a great meeting place for locals and the rest of us.
