Text: Ate about11:30. The soup was good and also the only hot food. All the other food was cold. Tasted ok but not great. 
Staff asked if we wanted water refills and picked up dishes but never asked how the food was.

Text: Nice owners the food is only good if you go when it's fresh right when they start buffet. Do not go late or you will b disappointed. Place is nice and clean just need to work on keeping fresh food always on the buffet that's the only thing that needs improvement we eat here often

Text: Hard and nasty food. Food looks like it's sat here all day, food is also cold.

Text: Very mediocre selections of food. Everything is dried up as if they are sitting on the hot plate for too long. None of the food options has any flavor including the Walmart bought ice cream.

Text: I don't like Chinese food but I was tired of ordering pizza. The food was amazing. Delivery speed was amazing. I ordered too much food and paid $40 but I will definitely order here again!
