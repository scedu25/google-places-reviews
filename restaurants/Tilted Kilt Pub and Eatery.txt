Text: Very nice cod on bed of rice.  Fish done just right, flaky and still firm. Food was served with good temperatures.  Place a touch loud, but to be expected for a bar....

Text: Horrible service, the waitresses need a self esteem boost and a higher attention span. Very degrading to women,  but not my main concern. Food was cold, there was rap music playing for some reason, and a bunch of creeps sitting in corners getting drunk, looking for attention from servers. Creepy and trashy vibes. Terrible food. Didn't even eat my meal, left it there, so did my girlfriend.

Text: The food is normally good here, we enjoy visiting from time to time. My food was cold this time, but it happens, I suppose. Our waitress was very friendly when she stopped by.

Text: Good food, good atmosphere, fun place, friendly employees update 8/22/2017. Been here since 8:48 PM. It's 9:29 and I'm still waiting to be served. I'm not sure what's happened to a place I really like a lot!
