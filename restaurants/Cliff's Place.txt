Text: Attended a wedding rehearsal dinner here. The staff was awesome and very accommodating. It was a special occasion and many chose to have steak and prime rib. We were not disappointed. The salad bar was a great treat as well. Great place for a small town. We had a large party and were well taken care of. I would highly recommend.

Text: Poor service, poor food taste, old weathered and what appeared to be dirty tables.  They have limited selection because they run out of food quickly.  If they were in an area with more competition, they would probably struggle to stay in business.
