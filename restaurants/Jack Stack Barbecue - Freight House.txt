Jack Stack Barbecue - Freight House
Rating: 5
Text: Delicious BBQ and a decent beer selection! It had a much fancier aesthetic than I thought it would. Also, lamb ribs??? What??? I had them and they were very tender and tasty. It's in this old freight house, so initially when I pulled up I thought there was no parking because you see the back of the building when you approach off of the street, but I thought it was the front. I walked up to the building and finally realized my error! There is plenty of parking! My bar maid was incredible and attentive and even helped me make my choice since it never been there before. It was very busy, so obviously a popular place.

Text: I was there just after 6 on a Monday. It was very busy, but as I was dinning by myself I managed to snag a place at the bar within 10 minutes. Megan was very attentive. I ended up with the grilled salmon salad after much pondering. It was salty, sweet, and one of the best salads I have ever eaten! thanks

Text: I was told by many people that have been here that when I went to Kansas City I had to try Jack Stack Barbecue.  This place did not disappoint!  Great service and knowledgeable of the menu, recommended some very good choices for us try on our first visit.  The food was some of the best barbecue you get around!  Will definitely go back next time in Kansas City!

Text: This place was amazing! The food was spectacular. Many drink options. The only complaint was that the lights were extremely dim. Otherwise, it was an awesome experience. I got the choose two with fries and potato salad.  It was excellent. I didn’t care for the beer I got. That’s my fault though. I’m picky.

Text: The food was delicious.  The service quick and efficient.  It was a wonderful old building with so much history! The place was beautiful.  I had the BBQ chicken, and burnt ends. They were tender, juicy, and made perfectly.
