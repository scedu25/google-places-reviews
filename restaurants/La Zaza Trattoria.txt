Text: Good quality food but not very flavorful and the menu is made up of just favorite italian dishes, nothing exciting or unique. The last time we went there we arrived before their busy time and we honestly felt rushed with how quickly they got our food out to us. It was maybe ten minutes from when we ordered which made us question how fresh and made to order their food really is. We went for a romantic dinner but it ended up feeling like we had stopped by a fast food place. Set a better atmosphere, please!

Text: Food is amazing & they give you enough to feed a village! I would like the menu to be a little bit more diverse and bigger, but I will definitely return! :)

Text: Went to La Za Za's in St Charles last night. Food was just ok, truly had better. Went to celebrate a friends birthday. Unfortunately a glass of water got spilled. A man sitting at the bar remarks." Women you can't take them anywhere". We of course heard it and replied it was rude. He in turn said " I am the owner , go back and drink your martini". I wanted to walk out at that minute. However, more respectful, we stayed for the friends birthday. The owner ( a portly man wearing flip flops and a pink t-shirt and shorts so professional and classy) moved to the other side of the bar where he continues to drink. We said something to our waitress she said " Oh, he is trying to be funny". Sorry that is not funny it was very rude!!! Boycott this place !!!! Owned by a male chauvinistic pig...
