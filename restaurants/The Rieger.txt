The Rieger

Text: They have a great KC strip topped with bone marrow sauce. The drinks are fantastic and there is a speak easy in the basement. I would give 5 stars, but they served us a terrible braised rabbit once.

Update- went back and had the walleye, roasted root vegetables, and pork soup. They were all great. 5 star rating.

Text: Set in the historic Rieger Hotel building, this charming restaurant allows chef and co-owner Howard Hanna to showcase his award-winning talents for those who are lucky enough to get a table.  Not to be outdone, co-owner Ryan Maybee complements the food with an equally exquisite and creative drink menu. A premiere Kansas City eating experience that never disappoints.

Text: Heavy pork accented menu. I called four weeks in advance to reserve and advise them it was a "special birthday" dinner. Neither the seating staff, nor the server acknowledged it. Service was serviceable. They did text to ask about allergies a few days before. Unfortunately with this information they didn't make any effort to inform us they had modified or were prepared to modify dishes with that advance information. Good idea, poor execution.

Text: One of my all time favorites in KC. Always great service and the food is amazing. The use top quality meats and change the menu seasonally. It's a must try for anyone looking for fine dining in KC.

Text: My sister and I dined here last week and it was outstanding.  Everything about the place was great. The staff was phenomenal and the food out of this world.   I would recommend The Rieger to anyone visiting the KC area.
