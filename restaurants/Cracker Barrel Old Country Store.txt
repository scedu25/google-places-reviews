Cracker Barrel Old Country Store

Text: Great breakfast and friendly servers.  Great place for kids.  Nicknacks and pattywacks aplenty in the store front.  We love our rockers.  Clean restaurant and restrooms.  Food comes out hot.  Get there early so you can get the hash brown casserole before it runs out.

Text: Very clean atmosphere.  The service was prompt and friendly, my iced tea glass was never less than half full.  I had the Rainbow Trout and it was delicious, cooked perfectly. The country store was filled with delightful autumn wares.  I could not leave without buying a Woodwick candle, they smell great, burn well, and make soothing crackling sounds.

Text: We were traveling through Missouri and stopped at the Sullivan location.  The food was fresh and fast at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. Very nice experience. A great place to stop while traveling for a good meal, a good cup of coffee and to rest up before hitting the road again.

Text: The food was very consistent and tasty.  The service was very poor.  Our order was not correct after two trips. The waitress made excuses, but it was her fault and no one else's.  She was disinterested with the table and preferred to talk to the other servers about her family problems.
