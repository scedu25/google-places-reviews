Text: If I don't have a Mary's burrito at least once in a two week time period I get the shakes. They are soooo good! Their picosa Verde is out of this world as well as any one if their burritos or tacos.

Text: I love Mary's. I come in everyday during my lunch period and the service is quick and friendly, so I can get back to school on time and in a good mood.

Text: Great Burritos!  It is very small place so take away may be best.  Not a real sit down spot.  We always stop when we are driving through Great Bend.
