Milano Take Out Pizza of Niles
Rating: 5
Text: Carry out style dining with a wide menu.  Menu includes pizza, garlic bread, wings, salads, and more.

All freshly prepared and kept hot until you pick them up.  Pricing here is pretty good, somewhat less than major chains and for better quality food .

Text: Best homade sauces anywhere! So the Pizza, spaghetti, Stromboli's beef or sausage. The best garlic bread with cheese I've ever had, u have to get it and try it you'll love it I promise and get a cup or two of meat sauce to dip it in Awesome. Also the Italian beef with Au Jus is a fav.

Text: Horrible. 
First of all, when I called, the guy kept interrupting me on the phone when I was trying to tell him what I wanted. I ordered a chicken wet burrito, onion rings, lasagna, and cheesy garlic bread. BAD DECISION. If they can't make anything other than pizza and subs taste somewhat appetizing, they shouldn't even have it on their menu. It took them 20 minutes longer to get here than they said, and the food was cold anyway. Then, apparently they charged me extra for a tip that I never authorized at all. It was only $2.50 extra, but it irritated me because the delivery man said the guy who took my order said I told him to put that as a tip. I gave the delivery man $3 extra anyway of course because he was nice and had nothing to do with it, and I wanted to tip him $5. THEN I ate a tiny part of the wet burrito and it was so disgusting that I just threw it away. And I hoped that the rest would be better. NOPE. The onion rings almost made me throw up. Like, I literally gagged. The lasagna wouldn't have been that bad if the noodles weren't soggy. Obviously the cheesy garlic bread wasn't bad because it's cheesy garlic bread. Not complicated to make at all. I will never order from this Milano's again. EVER. The one is Buchanan is soooo much better and at least I know that their food won't give me diarrhea.

Text: Very good food. And a fair variety. Not just pizza.
