Text: I typically get jerseys before or during work, I get the same sandwich every time, Giant 43 no onion light pepper... and every time, THEY GET IT WRONG.. now im at work stuck with a sandwhich i cant even enjoy because they can't follow simple instructions, I know they're under staffed, but they need a completely new staff. Rant over.

Text: Employees are Great!  They listen carefully and make your sub just how you like it!  Reminds of the East Coast!  The subs are HUGE! Resembles a New York style sub which I haven't found anywhere else in NKY.
