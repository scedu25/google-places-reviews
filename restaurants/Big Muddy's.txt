Text: Food was good, but priced a little high. $16 for catfish fillet is a little too much. Loved the hot knockers. Waitress was very nice. Definitely worth trying
Last night the waitress highly recommend we try the brunch buffet, so we went back today and tried it. Was not impressed, salad was good

Text: We had a group of 21 for lunch and our waitress did a great job of taking care of everyone and making no mistakes. She earned her tips. Loved the tenderloin sandwich and homemade chips. Will go back next time I'm in Burlington.

Text: Life the atmosphere of this old freight house. Food is good, prices are reasonable, but don't be in a hurry.
