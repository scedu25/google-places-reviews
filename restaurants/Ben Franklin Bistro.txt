Text: Hometown favorite!  Great little place to meet up for lunch with a friend.  Friendly service and excellent sandwiches, salads, quiche, and more.

Text: Cute atmosphere and friendly staff. Their menu offers a unique variety of sandwiches and salads. Really good parmesan Marble rye. 
I don't recommend the coffee though. We didn't finish our lattes cause they tasted like regular coffee mixed with equal parts milk.

Text: From out of town. I was overly satisfied with the breakfast. It was suprisingly ordinary, but was a perfect meal for the start of the day. It was well balanced and excellent in taste. For a small time restaraunt, it is very good.

The only criticism I can make is the organization of the staff. They were nice and very pleasant, but is obvious they are not like a chain of restaraunts. To each his own, but this place was overall very good
