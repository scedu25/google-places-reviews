Text: Stopped for an early dinner @4pm. Lovely old building, excellent service.
We had chopped steak, chicken livers & a hamburger with beets, green beans and mashed potatoes. All of the food was good, homestyle cooking.
The star was dessert. Best chess pie (ever!) and a delicious biscuit pudding with a wonderfully boozy bourbon sauce.
