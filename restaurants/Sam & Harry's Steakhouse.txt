Text: (3.5 stars). Bottom line is this place is fine. Nothing special, just a nice looking restaurant in a hotel with an open layout that can be loud. Sam and Harry's used to be an upscale steakhouse. It now feels like the upper end of the chain steakhouse that it is. Service was fine and the food was fine. Portions were small for the price. Dessert was uninspiring. Chicago Prime (around the corner) has better quality, larger portions and is more like a classic upscale steakhouse with more attentive service.

Text: Consistently excellent steak. Of particular interest is the local ribeye. A few reasonable choices by the glass on the wine list as well

Text: I ordered a Mac n cheese and I waited for 2 hours and they come to me and say we don't have anymore pasta would you like to have a peanut butter sandwich. So I waited 2 hours for a Mac N Cheese then apparently they ran out of pasta and they offer me peanut for a couple buck. How would it even take them 2 hours to find out you ran out of pasta to make Mac N Cheese.

Text: Engaged and attentive staff, bone marrow was done well, calamari was fresh and light. Wine selection was above average and had some great selections no matter your price point.
Would come back.
