Text: I love this place! Always my first choice. Great portions, great prices, great people. Restaurant could use an upgrade on a few things, but that's not what I come here for. I come for the food and they don't disappoint.

Text: The cashew chicken is awesome.  I'd recommend paying the little extra for white meat.  Like most Chinese restaurants, they give you a lot of food for the money.  My wife and I get full on less that $15 worth of food from them.

Text: Good service and fast sweet and sour chicken was hot but a rice was bland no vegetables or egg just rice in slightly brown rice.  General Tson children was same type of chicken as sweet and sour sauce just the right of spice and heat.
