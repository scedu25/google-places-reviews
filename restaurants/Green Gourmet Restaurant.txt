Text: There's really good food! I most enjoyed the goat dishes, which are seldom prepared but worth the wait. I understand the place is closing soon, so get it while you can!

Text: Some of the best food I have ever tasted! I especially loved the Thai curry chicken, stew chicken, and homemade Mac n Cheese. I only wish their hours of opertation were longer. 2 and 3:30pm are very early times to close a restaurant.

Text: I love the Green Gourmet. The food there is always DELICIOUS! The prices are good. It reminds me of good home cooking, plus everything is organic and nutritious. There are also lots of vegetarian and gluten free selections to choose from here. This is easily my favorite restaurant in Fairfield.
