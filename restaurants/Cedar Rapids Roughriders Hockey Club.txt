Text: Fun place for the hole family.  It does get quite loud so be prepared for that.  Lots of events for kids.  Not really a bad seat in the place.

Text: Stopped into their pro shop while in town on business.  I ended up getting a hockey jersey, sweat shirt and a can coozie.  Great place, awesome jersey  and super nice staff.  Visit this place if you have an opportunity.

Text: Great place to see hockey games, have a great time everytime. A lot of the constant advertising is embarrassing to witness though. "EVERYONE IN THE CROWD PLAY WITH THIS FAKE SOMBRERO SUPERIMPOSED ON THE BIG TV FOR A GIFT CERTIFICATE TO CARLOS O KELLYS" or "MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF FOR A $5 COUPON AT SUPERCUTS". And TV timeouts too. And I'd rather listen to silence between periods than hear about little Grayston's fifth birthday. At least we aren't asked to si... Wait are they gonna sing happy bir... Oh here we go...
