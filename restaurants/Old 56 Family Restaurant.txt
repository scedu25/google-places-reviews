Text: Nice breakfast stop. Prices are reasonable and the amount of food is about right.  The server I had was attentive and friendly.  If you want something other than a chain I would recommend stopping here.

Text: We showed up 20 minutes before close. They had someone at the doors who told us they were closing and wouldn’t allow us in. Not happy as I have grown up in Ottawa and have enjoyed plenty of meals there. Very disappointed. Expected better
