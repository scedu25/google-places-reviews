Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers
Rating: 4
Text: Place appeared recently opened and service was very good.  We liked the quality of the burger and hot dogs.  The frozen custard was really good.  I can't wait to see one of these closer to my home in SF...

Text: Our fries were only warm and we had one order of a double Patty melt, one of the Patty's was about the size of a sliver dollar. Another order was supposed to have ketchup on it, but didn't have anything. Sure disappointed in this Freddie's as we have really enjoyed dinning at Freddy's in the past.

Text: I asked for NO mustard and they put mustard on it. Baaaaaaaaad. Manager stopped in his tracks when he asked me if everything was good and I said NO. They gave me a small come for their goof up. But they also gave me a new burger with NO mustard. Thanks for making it right!
