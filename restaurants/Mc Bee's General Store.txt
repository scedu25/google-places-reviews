Text: The bratwurst here is so good that you do not need any sauce. So much more flavor than I have ever had.

Text: I'm Leslie McBee's granddaughter and I think that our brats are the best in the world! I really think it is worth the drive! My dad and my uncle Ross are the best at making brats! PLEASE come down and give it a try! Hope I see you there!
