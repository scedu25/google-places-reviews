Text: I love this place!  We eat out as often as possible and this is my favorite place to go.  The menu selection is really top notch and the food is beautifully prepared.   I especially like to stop by for a lighter meal and enjoy one of their wonderfully fresh salads.   It is really hard to find a good fresh salad anymore with tasty 'home-made' dressing.   But, the best of the best is their sangria wines!   When my family comes to town, they always want to come to this winery and stock up on wines.   Love the owners too!  They always come out and make us feel special.  Can't say enough good things about this place!

Text: Best pizza I've had in a long time! Don't bother with Pizza Hut if you are in the mood for pizza. This is a better value for your money and tastes much better. Other food selections are good also. (Maybe slightly salty.)  Wine was delicious! Very pretty place!

Text: First time at the Restaurant. No pork on the menu and only 2 beef dishes.  I ordered the Delmonico med. salad and fries.  The steak was well done Fail!!  The salad was flat rubbery and not anything I would eat.  Was charged the full price and will never go back

Text: Wandered in after seeing sign on the hwy. Met and spoke with both owners. Service was spectacular and the wine is amazing. Answered all of our questions about their wine. Visited with us as long as we wanted to stay. Full service restaurant and full bar experience too. Highly recommend. Thank you!
