Text: Pizza was light and fluffy, a unique style all their own. I enjoyed the pepperoni and green olives. Prompt service no wait for me.

Text: Disappointing, not crowded but one server doing the bar and tables is ridiculous....
Waited almost 30 minutes for the salad.
Surprising the kitchen did not over fry items but had no concept  of spice AT ALL, overdone.
Ceaser salad was just bag lettuce with one PACK of dressing.
All the food came at once, 45 minutes, and there was no room for the pizza, it sat a table away, got cold before we even got to it....Can sauce and biscuit crust.
Was not worth $70...
I hope I can bear the over done garlic wing sauce...oh my lord.
