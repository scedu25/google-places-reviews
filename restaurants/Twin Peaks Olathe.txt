Text: The food is better than average bar and grill. It would be nice if they expanded their craft beer selection

Text: Well I've always had a great experience at Twin Peaks in Olathe but the other day a buddy and I stopped in to get a beer and 12 boneless wings   we both took a bite and looked at each other and went is yours cold in the middle? Our waitress went and got the manager he came out and told us he personally saw them toss them which means put the sauce on but that doesn't necessarily mean they were completely cooked before they put the sauce on. The manager came back 2 other times before finally taking them and instead of giving us fresh they just finished cooking the 10 that we had left and then my buddy even paid for them which I thought they should have been on the house after the manager argued with us three times stating he saw them toss them finally when my buddy said here take a bite because I kept my first piece on the end of my Fork but this rating is not anything against Twin Peaks it's just against that daytime manager that did not handle things the way he should have the customer is always first and if he doubted us he should have taken a bite of one of our other boneless wings and then decided for himself what he should do.  This would be a 5-star rating if it weren't for the daytime manager that day and I wish I would have got his name.
