Text: After watching the people cook the food and smokes cigarettes at the same time, when we got our food we were so grossed out we just got up and left. 
 Friends of ours also had a bad experience there. 
 How can you smoke cigarettes and then make somebody a sandwich without washing your hands, that's pretty disgusting.

Text: It's MUCH cuter than the picture shows, which may need to be updated.  This was the highlight of our excursion around Creighton, NE  There's quick, close parking.  There's carry out.  There's  burgers, malts, coffee--anything for which you go to a 50's burger joint.  SUPER CLEAN and sweetly decorated.  SUPER FRIENDLY staff.  We could chat a little or a lot.  Both meals were good, as was the ice cream.
