El Ranchero Mexican Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: Friendly and speedy service, casual but nice atmosphere. The chips and salsa were incredibly fresh and the guacamole was to die for! So fresh as well! Our food was served to us within 10 or so minutes of ordering (very quick if you ask me!). I did leave off one star as the bathroom was in pretty bad shape, most of the doors to the stalls wouldn't close or lock and the toilets could have used a bit of scrubbing. But it wasn't grotesque or covered in filth. Just a bit inconvenient more than anything.

Text: I have eaten at El Ranchero Mexican Restaurant many times, so this is a collective experience review. The food is always good. But the service is usually just... ok (there have been some visits when the service is better than others). So, I'd give it "4 stars" for the food and "2 stars" for the service. Which brings me to "3 stars" for the average experience.

Text: West side Ranchero is great Mexican home style cooking. Hottest hot sauce is only 8 of 10.
