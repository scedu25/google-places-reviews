Text: I am extremely disappointed with the laziness of a certain employee and or their manager. They closed 15 minutes earlier than their posted time and their inadequate excuse to not serving us was the fact that she had already put the lids on the ice cream and that she also didn't want to have to stay later to mop the floors. If you do not wish to stay open untill 9 than the advertisement posted should relate to that fact. It is unfair, untruthful, and down right unacceptable to say otherwise than go back on your word. I am not planning on going back. I would suggest others to do the same. I hope this employee understands the reason to this post and betters herself for the future or she'll have a hard time finding a real job later on. Good luck.

Text: A found treasure. Didn't expect much to be open on Sun afternoon & found this gem. Nice curb appeal, clean inside & out, great menu, beer selection & prices (although I didn't drink any)  courtious,  efficient staff & best of all VERY GOOD STRAMBOLI!  (not too much dough,  thank you). Great experience.
