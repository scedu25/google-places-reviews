Text: Lively weekends and big events.  Food is good with a varied menu.  

There is a huge rotating beer selection with not only good local and craft choices but a handful of good English beers like Smithwicks, Boddingtons, and of course Guinness.  

Only downside is that in the little neighborhood if Kamms Corner this is one of only a handful of late night places so it is packed to the gills on weekends when there is live music.  

If this is the case, patience and a little hovering will net a seat soon as the crowds flow in and out.
