Text: 5 others and I were waiting at door @11:25am on a Friday. They promptly opened the doors on time and food was hot and ready on buffet. Plenty of options, desserts. Plenty of staff and it filled up with customers fast. Very satisfied. The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions about what stuff is (new to Indian cuisine) thank you New Krishna!

Text: Fantastic northern Indian cuisine. It's not really in my way home, but I'll go out of my way to get carry out from here because it's by far the best Indian food on that side of town. The staff is always friendly and they have good variety on the buffet.
