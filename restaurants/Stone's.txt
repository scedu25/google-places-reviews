Text: Staff was very friendly, but not irritatingly so. We had the Wednesday buffet, and the fried chicken was definitely the star. There is also a menu available if the buffet isn’t your style. Finished the night with a slice of homemade pie each, Dutch apple, Dutch peach and peanut butter. All got a thumbs up. It isn’t cheap, but prices are very reasonable.
