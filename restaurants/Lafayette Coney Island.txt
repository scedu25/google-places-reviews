Text: Lots of memories here. Just a great place to get Coney dogs and fries, that's about it. These guys move quick so know what you want when you walk in. FYI if it's super busy and people are standing waiting for a seat, don't be that group that wants to sit and chat for an hour after eating. Get in, eat then Charlie Mike.

Text: I come here every time I'm in Detroit! It is one of the best restaurants in the city! The food is delicious, prices are parallel to the quality, and the employees are pleasant and attentive!

Text: EVERYONE knows about this place. It's simply the hot dog legend of Detroit. Always good food. I wish it was a little bit bigger and quieter inside but that's what also makes the atmosphere unique.

Text: When you're in Detroit you get a Coney Dog. That's basically one of the only things I was told when visiting. I was not let down.

Text: I'm sad to give this place a 3 star. All my previous visits were unique and memorable. My party was served some of the wrong items and after they were on the table the server disappeared. I hope it was a fluke but as it stands right now very disappointed.
