Text: I got the chicken gyro and it costs me an arm and a leg considering it sucked. Extremely dry meat and horrible flavor. while my friend had good meat that was moust and tasted amazing... I would steer clear of this one. The green beans tasted like they were bathed in spaghetti sauce. The rice was simply buttered and that's it. They give you complimentary bread that smells like vomit

Text: Great place! Food is great and flavorful and cooked just right. I had the Tilapia dinner. We shared the hummus and each had a salad. Wonderful meal and the service was great!
