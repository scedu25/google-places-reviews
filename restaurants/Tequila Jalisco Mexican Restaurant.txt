Text: My most absolute favorite place to eat, everything is always great. They make just about everything and will customize it for you. Service is always fast even when super packed and the food comes hot in really big portions.

Text: Food was awesome and our server was great. Food was ready in five minutes even when the store was PACKED. Was seated almost instantly despite it being a full restaurant. Not far off the highway. Great stop for a through and through visit on the way back to kc.

Text: Service was good as always but the last 3 times I have been here my order hasn't been right. This time I ordered on onions and peppers. Found onions and pepper pieces and the taste was there. U can't cook with them and pick them out at the end and it not have the nasty flavor. Will be awhile before I return.

Text: Extremely rushed service. Waiter never checked to see if we needed more chips, salsa, drinks. We had to yell out to him. The place is dirty. Taco Bell is better and I don't recommend either place.
