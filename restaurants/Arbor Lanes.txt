Text: One of the owners, Scotty Kilpatrick Jr, is extremely racist. Not a company that I would ever spend my money on.

Text: This bowling alley has been brought back from the grave over the last couple of years.  They have made renovations to the equipment and eliminated the mechanical issues that plaqued the place with the previous owners.  They have also eliminated many of the aesthetic issues that were present after the lanes were sold by the owners of the V-Lanes.  They have a decent liquor and beer selection but they lack choices like IPA and microbrewery beers.  The food is good and the pricing is average.  This is a nice place to spend an afternoon or evening.

Text: I had a birthday party back in April for my son and he absolutely loved it. I like all the remodeling and management. The birthday package I purchased was really adorable and came with free drinks. Awesome experience!
