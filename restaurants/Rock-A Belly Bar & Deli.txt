Text: Great service, atmosphere, and food! Chili is top notch! Gives you a little heat with tons of flavor! A true “belly-warmer!”

Text: A bit disappointed after my latest visit. I hadn't been there for years, and was happy to see it was still charming! Our sandwiches we're pretty good, just not as good as they once were.

Text: Still as good as it was in 1991.  Loved it then, love it now.  The Belly Buster is particularly tasty.
