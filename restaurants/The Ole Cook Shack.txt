Text: Prices are high, food is good. Could offer more hot vegetable choices. Service is counter and buffet style self-serve unless special ordered.

Text: The pulled pork sandwich was very good. There is a good selection of meats, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, ribs and sides. I recommend this restaurant. They were only open on Sunday when I stopped in.
