Text: Nice place to eat. Good selection. Had the combo appetizer...was mostly onion rings which were very good but would like to have had more cheese balls and zucchini...only 2 or 3 of each of those. We had breaded loin. I'd probably not order that again as it was very dry.

Text: The food is subpar and the service is terrible. The only reason it is in business is the lack of competition.
