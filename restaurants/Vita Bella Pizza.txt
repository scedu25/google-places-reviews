Text: Took my wife and 3 kids for pizza last Tuesday night.  My kids are STILL talking about how they got to make their OWN pizzas!  My wife and I had lasagna and the Chopped Salad and half a bottle of wine between the two of us.  Love, love, LOVE Vita Bella.  We will be back soon

Text: Great wings!!!  I would put them above just about any other wing place in the area!!  Pizza is great as well, but we are here pretty much weekly to order wings.  The online ordering is so quick and easy as well.  You let them know online when you will be there to pick up your food.  Cool and convenient.

Text: The crust is too sweet for my liking, but I'm glad they have a gluten free option.

Text: Got a coupon in the mail so thought I would try it.  I ordered a cesar salad and a pizza with ground beef.  They placed the bag with the salad on top of the pizza box so I didn't notice the receipt stapled to the box.  Got home to find it was the wrong pizza (sausage and green pepper), it was burnt and cold.  I looked at the receipt on the pizza box and this was part of a large order that was picked up 3 hours earlier.  Don't know if it was cold from sitting so long or if it was burnt because they tried to re-heat it.  In any event, I won't be going back.  Too many other good options in the area, suggest you try those before going to this place.
