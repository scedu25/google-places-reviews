Text: Been here multiple weeks.  School glad we found this park! Right off I-80 for easy access to many places! Campground staff have been AMAZING! The price is very good for what the campground offers, shower, restrooms, laundry as well as fuel, and AMAZING grill,and ice cream! Great place, with GREAT people, both staff and fellow campers from all over! We recommend this campground 200%.
