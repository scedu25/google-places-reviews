Text: Food was okay, the tossed salad was somewhat old and the beefsteak look like it was a hamburger. But we got it with onions and gravy which was okay.  But I wasn't impressed with this placed. So if it is late, then it's a okay place to eat.

Text: Salad bar is about the most edible thing you find here. Hot beef sandwich was cold soggy unseasoned mush...best to skip this stop

Text: Food is very greasy. They cook everything from chicken to steak on the same grill as well as the eggs the same place as the corned beef etc. If you have an allergy do NOT eat there as they will not protect u from the allergen. Service is usually terrible. Most servers are related to the manager so bad complaint cards will not get submit in to the file. If its cooked in a grease fryer. they cook fish, shrimp, fries and all in the same fryer. I do not reccomend this restaurant. Wait till this time Next year and there will be a LOVES at the Shelby exit which will be much better than this place.
