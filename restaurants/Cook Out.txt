Text: I've only ate their burgers & fries so I can't b sure that their food is worth 5?. Their burgers are much better then any fast food type restaurant for example McDonald's or Wendy's because they actually taste like real thick hamburger. The main reason I go there is I absolutely love their Cajun seasoning on top of their fries!
