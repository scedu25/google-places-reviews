Text: Good sized portions good flavor. You aren't going to get fresh made guacamole here but the pre-made isn't bad.  Great service.  Only suggestion would be to do a deep cleaning. Building smells unpleasant.

Text: Very nice service. Food was pretty good. Prices seemed a little high for a small town Mexican restaurant though.
