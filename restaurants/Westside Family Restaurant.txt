Text: Great customer service. The food is awesome. We always come here for breakfast, when we make it back to Grinnell.

Text: What's for breakfast? Typical greeting from the friendly server who took our order. I had my usual breakfast order: dippy eggs (eggs over medium), hash browns, toast and sausage patties. You could get sausage links if you prefer. Coffee is just so-so, like most of the coffee served in Grinnell. Hash browns seemed like they were from a bag-so just average. Eggs and sausage were tasty.

Text: The waitress was very kind and attentive. The food was not good. Bacon was over cooked and the hot beef meat was flavorless and tough. The pie was dry.
