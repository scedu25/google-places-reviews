Text: Love the place, go several times a week, good food and beverages are always great.  As of late they seem to have had service issues.  Sitting at the bar, I would expect more contact.  Always seem to have drama which takes precedence over service.  Will still go, cuz they are great.  Hope they refocus on the customers in front of them.  Otherwise they would be five stars!

Text: This place is ran like a mofia. I would tell every good person to never go there for morality purposes. You can get cheap gordans food anywhere. I served my country for you to choose but my family will never go there if I can help it.
