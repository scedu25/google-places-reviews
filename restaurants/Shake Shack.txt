Shake Shack
Rating: 5
Text: I give it 5 stars in the category of burger/ice cream shops.  Burgers are flavorful and just the right size.  Fried pickles and other sides are prepared just right.  The shack's staff is prompt and friendly and there is a convenient drive-up.  Great place for a quick bite, lunch, an after work meal, or a place to take the family.

Text: Lots of flavors of ice cream, a surprisingly extensive food selection, and a great value for the money! 

Definitely worth the trip here for ice cream (can't speak for the food, but would be willing to give it a try!)
