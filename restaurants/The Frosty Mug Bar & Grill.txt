The Frosty Mug Bar & Grill

Text: Local, local, local. Didn't get a frosty mug, but the beer was cold. Beer selection and all prices were great! Good basic wings, steaks, mex, and American pub fare. Very popular and busy. Nice waitress that had four or five tables and got it all right!

Text: Awesome brisket sandwich. Best sweet creamy cole slaw that I have had in ages. We stopped in for the home made PORK RINDS! Fabulous!

Text: We enjoyed our food today. Service was great and food came out quick!  The only downside is that the place didn't have a high chair....we have a one year old so maybe we will come back when he is out of the high chair stage?!?

Text: Fun place. Good service. Cold beer.  And most important it is a St Louis Cardinals bar.
