Text: I have never had bad service or less than a great meal! We've been going here as a couple, since we started dating 35 years ago, and before that I went with my parents as a girl. It's known by locals as a nice date place as you have TJs upstairs for a nicer meal and atmosphere, or head to the basement for CWs, which is casual and more of a sports bar. Of course you could choose the lovely patio, which feels fun and hip. Either way they've never disappointed.
