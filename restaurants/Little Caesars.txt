Text: Service is usually pretty decent.  The pizza quality is okay, it just depends on timing with regard to the hot and ready pizzas.

Text: this is by far a horrible fast food place, negative customer service, they dont smile or even have a positive outlook on being there. Are not big at correcting there mistakes! Seems to be a hang out spot for the employees friends more then customers. as for managers they are not managers they avoid conflicts by pushing people out the door. i would NOT recommend this place to anyone until they have new management!!

Text: Called in my order a head of time got there had to wait for about 30 minutes or so finally someone came to the counter then they couldn't find my order then turn around and had to wait for them to refix it.  The staff act like they were lost in space or something. Other than that the grandkids had fun waiting while playing that game they have in there store, I did too. Lol I stayed cool?. And this rating that I'm giving is for the visit that i experience tonight with the kind of service I received. Hopefully the next time I go it will be better and I can give a higher rating.
