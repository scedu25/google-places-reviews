Text: Delicious breakfast! I got the 2 x 2 x 2. Two eggs, ham and two pancakes. The pancakes are absolutely huge. LOL coffee is good and the waitress, Liz, is very attentive. For $6.99 who can ask for more?!

Text: Mediocre food and mediocre service. It's certainly not the worst I've ever had and I continue to support them because they are an independent truck stop, but it would sure be a lot easier to do if they would get some quality food in there and some waitresses who act like they actually enjoy their job. Other than that it's a decent place to park for the night and they also have a cat scale on site.

Text: Didn't have the cod sandwich after waiting for the waitress for 15 min.  7 min after we ordered she tells us that they didn't have for.  Would I like something else.  Look at the menu and call her back over and order the catfish.  Sir that will take 1/2 hour to cook.  Guess they had to catch and clean it first.  Told her I didn't want to order anything.  Wife ordered a chicken salad.  Only three people in the place and one was doing the salad bar.  25 min on her salad.  Won't go there again, wound up eating at McDonald's which I only eat 2 or 3 times a year.  Still have heart burn.
