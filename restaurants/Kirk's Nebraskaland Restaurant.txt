Text: Good place,  with friendly service. I had a salad (lettuce was very fresh) and my husband had the t-bone special (also good). Important to note: coffee was good diner style coffee, definitely enjoyable. Great place to stop on a long drive.

Text: Ate dinner and breakfast here. The food is REALLY good for a reasonable price!! Worst thing was, I ordered fruit dish with both meals... Both were canned fruit (not the bad part)... The fruit cocktail this morning was ready to turn bad. But, I've seen this a lot of places. The servers are TERRIFIC and just nice people, the prime rib sandwich was excellent!! Loved it!! Will definitely come back when I come through this way again!!

Text: Server was attentive and quick. Portions seemed a little small, but I also only $7.99 for the chicken sandwich and some fries. Not bad, in my opinion. Chicken sandwich was good, lightly breaded and juicy. Overall, a pretty nice experience. It's right next to the hotel I was staying at, so I didn't have to travel far for a decent meal.

Text: Who's reviewing this place?  Family and employees? 
I should have know better when there was only two cats in the lot.  One other customer in the whole place yet the first 4 booths were still filled with crumbs.  Sat down and has to spend my time smacking flies.  The prices were high but if the foods good then I don't mind.  The food guilty and portions are horrible.  Tasteless and small portions.  One of the worst experiences I've had in quite awhile and $14.00  later and I am still hungry
