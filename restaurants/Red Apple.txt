Text: Service is fabulous but the menu, prices and portion sizes not so much. Probably won't be returning.

Text: Will never, ever go back here to eat. I could get better food from a dumpster. Menu alone was so over stuffed with items I wouldn't be surprised if they serve close to spoiled food from time to time. We're talking 3 or 4 pages, from top to bottom of food items. No restaurant needs that big of a menu in this area.

Text: Food is absolutely disgusting and baked potatoes are cooked the day before then thrown on the grill and so is the bacon and sausage. Everything is frozen nothing is fresh. Save your money and the risk of getting sick. Not to mention ants crawling all over the tables and can't eat and listening to a waitress scream at another employee it's sad it wasn't even the other employees fault!
