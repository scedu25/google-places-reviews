Ramen Wasabi

Text: Great place! Can't wait to go back. I tried one of their spicy bowls and it was spicy but tolerable. The pork belly buns were so delicious! They offered dessert on the house since the pork belly took so long to come out. We had to decline because we were so stuffed. That was a first! Overall good experience.

Text: Amazing food! Got the spicy garlic ramen. Drinks were awesome too. Sat at the bar and the bartenders are super friendly. Definitely will go back.

Text: New location is great and less claustrophobic.  Ramen is always great and the rice bowls are pretty good too.

The consistency here has been more hit and miss though.

Text: Sat and Sun open for Lunch? Google said it open and Wsabi website said so. But it's closed. Can't you just fix your web for the business hour so that some people who lives far away are able to plan to come. Thanks.

Text: Went to Ramen, but the wait was more than 1/2 hour on a Wed around 8:30pm so we went next door to Wasabi.  At Wasabi there were only about 10 people eating there at 4 tables, and the menu seemed great.  

Sad to say the food was mediocre at best -- tried a couple of sushi rolls, soba, pork belly spring rolls, dumplings.  And the service was worse -- incredibly long prep times (more then 30 minutes for simple menu items like dumplings; appetizers were served after mains were eaten, etc), and the waitstaff was past the point of casual to sort of slipshod.

Will not even consider spending my time or money here again.
