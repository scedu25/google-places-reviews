Melt Bar and Grilled
Rating: 3
Text: I love that vegetarian and vegan options are clearly labeled, and how to acquire gluten-free food is clearly explained on the menu. The tofu "wings" were really nice — the one person at the table who had a meaty dish, decided after the meal that future Melt meals would entirely be the tofu wings. Service was pretty solid, although there was an order mistake that I'm fairly certain was due to the incredible loud din of the place. The food was decent. Not a terrible option for "comfort food", but a challenging place to eat even a marginally healthy meal.

Text: One of the best places to eat in Cleveland area. This location has a great vibe to it. Much different than there Independence location, a lot smaller. Great beer selection. Probably some of the best food I've ever had.

Text: Between the loudness of the surrounding patrons and the televisions going it's difficult to hear much of anything while inside. Not to mention the prices for simple grilled cheese are beyond any reasonable price. In addition, upon receiving my food it was salted beyond the point of being edible. Upon mentioning it, it was promptly forgotten and I had to finish up to not overextend the visit (as there were friends with me). All in all, a reaffirming trip to an overblown restaurant chain that I won't revisit soon.
