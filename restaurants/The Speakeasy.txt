The Speakeasy
Rating: 5
Text: Wow! We heard this is a steak destination and we were very impressed. Perfectly cooked medium rare New York strip for myself and ribeye for my date. The waitress Beth was friendly and helpful with information about The Speakeasy and the menu. Everything we saw go by looked delicious. Definitely worth the trip. We'll be back with friends and family.

Text: We received a gift certificate for this restaurant as a Christmas gift.  We went out on a Friday night and didn't realize that you should make reservations. We went the next week and had a wonderful time. The food was delicious, the staff was amazing, friendly and all did an excellent job. We could not have been happier with our visit and  highly recommend it. We had steak, prime rib and chicken.

Text: Had a great meal of prime rib and smoked chicken.  The food is 5 star -great steaks.  The wait staff means well but could be better.  Cocktails are very old school- which we love!  No blenders- Cocktails are shaken and/or stirred.  Found my favorite red wine here.  Highly recommend reservations especially Friday and Saturday nights.  Although this place appears to be in the middle of nowhere it is worth the hour drive we make to eat here!

Text: Decent food overpriced. They don't cook prime rib or bread on game nights, which is stupid. Not worth the money or time to drive out there.
