Text: Food and service were awesome! I came in nearly an hour before they opened unaware of their hours, but was told they would accommodate me.  I ordered the fried green tomato BLT and hands down, the best sandwich I've ever had with the freshest watermelon.

Text: Cool spot near downtown.  Great beer selection and the wings were very good as well.  Looking forward to our next visit to try more flavors.  1/2 price wine on Wednesdays is also very attractive.  Can't beat an arrogant bastard with spicy wings.

Text: Good beer selection and great ambience - while the burger was really great, the newly added fish tacos looked amazing! Great reviews from our table! Excellent place to wind down at the end of the day...

Text: Best beer selection in town. In addition to the regular menu, there are limited time only selections.
