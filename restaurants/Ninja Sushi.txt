Ninja Sushi

Text: This place it's Awesome! For a sushi restaurant in Pratt KS it far exceeded my expectations. There are plenty of other seafood options in the Ninja rolls (shrimp, crab, lobster) for those of you who aren't into raw fish. The service was excellent the preparation on point. (Even made me a cucumber squid for garnish.) At this point I've eaten there so much I barely have to lift a finger and they know what I want.

Text: I went in to order my food to go. It was very quick..about 15 minutes total... and there were dine in orders before mine. I got the lobster rangoon and 2 sushi rolls and they are all very good and the price is very affordable for this type of food. I am very pleasantly surprised as i have to admit to being a bit skeptical.
