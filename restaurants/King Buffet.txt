Text: Food was okay but the entire dining area was filthy and needed cleaned ceiling tiles were sagging, vents needed to be cleaned walls needed to be cleaned glass needed to be cleaned fish tank needed to be cleaned, chairs needed to be redone. Pretty much the entire interior needs redone.

Text: Tasty seafood and sushi, plus good soup. Kings is my go to spot for a quick tasty lunch where I still get to eat on a plate with silverware. I have to watch my self control to avoid eating too much, because it is all tasty
