Text: Excellent service, great food for a good price. The portions are very generous. This is by far our favorite place to go for breakfast. My husband likes the eggs benedict, I usually get their eggs with bacon but you can't really go wrong regardless of what you pick.

Text: Easily one of the tastiest breakfast I've had. The pancakes and bacon are great. The service is exceptional. One critism is the venue with nothing to absorb the busy chatter its a little loud.  Very pleased  and looking forward to returning.
