Text: Deserts here are the best! Blackberry cobbler and pumpkin cheesecake. Nice little place, I appreciate that they have an upscale dining experience in a small community. Good atmosphere. Strangest thing i noticed was that the small lamps at each table still had plastic on the shades. But I'll be back!

Text: The food was great but more importantly is that extra effort. I had family come to town for a holiday and forgot to make reservations. The first person I spoke to said they were booked solid. I then spoke to a manager to help me and  she was able to squeeze me in to save the day. Great experience!

Text: Nice place to visit.  Had the eggs Benedict, but eggs were super runny, and no hollandaise sauce. Waitress never even asked how I wanted them. Waited 10min for waitress to come to table. Then 30 minutes for two basic breakfast entrees.

Text: I love the atmosphere & food at Sybils! It's such a beautiful setting. The food is always amazing. If you haven't had the bacon wrapped scallops you are missing out! The service is always outstanding. I recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends.
