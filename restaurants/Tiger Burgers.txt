Text: Food was surprisingly good and I LOVE the whole 1940's vibe. It's a refreshing retro style. Sliders were great, as well as the shrimp and fries. Would absolutely come here again. Totally dig it.

Text: Had the growler combo, good sliders, though I didn't realize they were sliders when I ordered them (grolwer sounds like a singular burger name to me).  The fries have cinnamon on them,  which actually tastes pretty good, just be prepared for that. A little pricy for how big the portions were but it all tasted good.
