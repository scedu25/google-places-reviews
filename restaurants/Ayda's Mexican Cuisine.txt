Text: Pretty good food. Ordered a steak burrito with extra steak. Seemed kinda skimpy with steak, but was very filling. Good staff. Restaurant was big and clean. I'll be back to try the fajitas.

Text: No hot salsa.. Food was ok, chimichangas come with white sauce, chili rellenos have nothing on them. Took about 25 min to get food and they weren't busy... asked for hot sauce several times before receiving it, waitress asked if we wanted refills we said yes and never got one.
