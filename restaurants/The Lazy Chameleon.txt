Text: I visited this place twice.
PROs: great location, easy to access; dynamic atmosphere; food was served in an acceptable fashion.
CONs: if you are a beer snob or really know hard liquors and cocktails, their beer and drinks collection is an absolute disappointment, the sound system for the live bands is near to awful.

Text: Came here with a large group of friends to see a favorite band of theirs. Music was good and dancing was fun, but the bartenders refused to serve a glass of water, wanting to charge for bottles.  Also, if you hope to find any form of accessible bathroom, good luck. They are not up to speed with current accessibility guidelines.
