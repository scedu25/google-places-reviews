Text: My wife has wanted to stop here for awhile, even though I don't know how it was voted best pizza in Iowa. We stopped on a Sunday with some friends, ordered several pizzas. I enjoy a thick crust pizza so I chose a deep crust "23". All the others came out but mine, eventually the owners wife came and told us it was given to somebody else did still want it. I begrudgingly said yes but to go. Now it gets bad the owner comes out and starts to berate me and challenges me to run the kitchen if I can do any better, I was shocked that he was behaving this way standing over me and pushing a chair towards me. He offered the pizza free with cinnamon sticks but his behavior and the pizza with a complete lack of flavor has left a bad taste in my mouth. I should have known when I noticed a sign for frozen pizza to go this place was just a HACK. I have had several different pizzas from the Des Moines area and it's way better here folks!

Text: Been wanting to try Zipps Pizza for awhile now. We were greeted by Barb when we arrived, and she couldn't have been more pleasant. She was very helpful with the questions we asked.  The whole staff seemed to be in good spirits, which was nice to see.  The Jesse James, and Taco pizza we ordered were very good.  The cheese bread was also very tasty. The overall experience at Zipps in Adair was amazing. I just wish it wasn't a 45 minute drive for us to return.

Text:  We have driven over an hour each way to eat here 7 times in past few months... usually taking friends with us so they can check it out too. 
Their pizza, cheese bread, dessert pizza and root beer are the best around! 
Always crowded but the wait is never long and the staff is always friendly.

Text: Excellent food and service. Strawberry Margarita was very good also. Owner's wife is very personable. We drove 2-1/4 hours to get here. We will be back.
