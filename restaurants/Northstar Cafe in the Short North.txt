Text: This place is amazing! If I am ever back in Columbus area again I will definitely come here! I got the cowboy breakfast and the breakfast potatoes. The breakfast potatoes were there highlight of the meal! I also got the apple cider and it was amazing. I wanted to order another apple cider to go but want going to wait in the giant line.

Text: I love Northstar Cafe. My favorite is brunch with the Ricotta Pancakes, bacon, and coffee. I can't get enough of them. 

It's fantastic here. Their burger and fries are great for dinner. 

And, for a late night outing, coffee and a cookie! Love it here!

Text: I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked 5he place compared to some of the other reviews I read. Very clean and tidy place. Had a burger and a salad, both were delicious and I was Impressed with the freshness of the salad ingredients.
The wait staff is exceedingly friendly and courteous. It is a tad expensive, but comes with the territory in organic food.

Text: It's a little expensive but the food is great. It's a quiet laid back place kind of like a coffee house. The crew is attentive and takes good care of their customers.

Text: Absolutely amazing. Best fish I had in a long time and the Thai wrap that my wife got was delectable. Even the coleslaw and sweet potato fries were fantastic. Too bad we don't have these out west.
