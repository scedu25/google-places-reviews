Text: Excellent lanes.  Synthetic surface.  House shot plays best WAY outside.  Those with limited hand will want to play up the boards around 5.  Those with modest hand will play in the same vicinity, but with a mid-grade or weak ball.  High rev players can open up the lane a bit, but still need to get their ball pretty far outside at the break point.  The shot holds up pretty well.
