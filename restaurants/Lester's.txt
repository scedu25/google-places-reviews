Lester's
Rating: 4
Text: My wife and I stayed in St. Louis for a weekend last year.  We walked down Maryland Ave and found Lester's across from the Chess Museum.  That location has since closed I'm told.  But here's how good this place is: we went there Friday night for dinner, went back Saturday for lunch, considered Saturday night dinner and Sunday Lunch but thought we should branch out.  It was a hard decision, the food is THAT good.  Try the brisket.  Four stars because I haven't been to their new location.

Text: Excellent atmosphere for lunch meeting.  Had the chopped salad, it was different in a very good way.  I enjoyed very much.  Recommend this for lunch and dinner.

Text: Awesome place to come too! Great for family and friends.
I got this salad to go and it's seriously the best salad I've ever had! 
It's the BBQ salad with beef brisket on it, it's to die for! 
I can't wait until I'm back in town to order this again! So satisfying for a salad!
