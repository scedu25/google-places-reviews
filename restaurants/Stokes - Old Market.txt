Stokes - Old Market
Rating: 4
Text: Good option for dining in the old market.  A lot of variety in the menu - with a lot of southwest fare.  Clean and comfortable seating that can accommodate a variety of group sizes.  We've been there many times and service has varied, but has never been bad.

Text: The hostess was incredibly rude when we came in and put our name down for a table. We asked about waiting at the bar for our table (40 minute wait) and she aggressively told us it was full. She took our number down (and I watched her enter the correct number) to text us when our table was ready, and we never got a text. Will never go back.

Text: Decor and building were worth the visit. Love old buildings brought back to life with such class. Service was spectacular, food was ghood.
