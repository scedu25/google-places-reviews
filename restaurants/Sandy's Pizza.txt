Text: After having issues management contacted us ask us to try them again and we did on Sunday. Food was hot fresh and great. Had it again today and was delicious. Keep up the great food we are back for sure. It nice to see you care about your customers and listen.

Text: The Lunch buffet didn't have anything added the 30 minutes I was there. Looked like leftover party Pizza, still in the box (Really!) and it was cold, stroms were burnt crisp. Salad was brown. Been going almost every Friday for many years. Worst meal I've ever had. Restaurant is going downhill, don't plan to go back. Waste of time and money.

Text: Have ate here several times and it is always a clean fun environment. Love all the nostalgia hanging all over the place and of course the pizza pies and other food are the best around. Keep up the great food!!
