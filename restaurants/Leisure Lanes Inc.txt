Text: I can only speak to my slow weeknight experience having a burger at the bar. The atmosphere was just as it should be .. a local, nay, a community gathering point with dark wood, bright lanes, rockin' music (not too loud) and a friendly face behind the bar.

My Cowboy Burger was good (contest entry burger). Good beef with pepperjack cheese (choice), bacon, bbq sauce, onion rings and lettuce. The patty itself help elevate pretty standard fare. Nothing farm-to-table here, but, it is money well spent!

Really enjoyed the service from the bartender too. She is one who just makes it look easy back there. I'll be back and hope for more of the same!
