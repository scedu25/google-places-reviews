Italian Village Pizza

Text: I use to work here 16 years ago when the previous owner still ran this establishment.  Was always great food then. And still amazing to this day. No longer live in the area but eat here almost every trip down.

Text: Loved it!! Seemed to forget that Italian Village existed until the other day. Typically would carryout from a handful of other pizza joints around town including a few new ones as of last year or two which are...ok. But this Italian Village visit is the first in many, many years and they're still just as delicious as I remembered back in the day!

Text: I used to be in love with the food hwrw. It seems to have gone downhill recently, though. The sandwiches were bland and the service was slow.
