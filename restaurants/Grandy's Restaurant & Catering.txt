Text: On 8-4-17 I went to grandys to get 3 meals to take to work..I notice they were almost out of chicken I asked if they had any chicken down they told me yes about 15 minutes.   So I place my order....  45 minutes later I finally leaving the restaurant.. they said they were training new person and that what took that long...I would have left sooner but I was getting meals for other worker.  I got there almost every Friday to pick up meals for work (3 to 8) meals weekly....I will be taking my business somewhere else ...manager keep on asking me if I wanted some liver...if I wanted liver I would have order it.  I informed couple worker that table was dirty they gave me pop for waiting but couldn't set it on table because there were no clean table on the side where I was sitting...they were not busy I see why for Friday ...

Text: Grandy's in Oakland City is awful. It takes SO long to just order one's food. If you want fast service, then go elsewhere.

Text: Food is alright. The thing I am the most displeased about is the rude elderly workers. Unfortunately I will have to come back to this establishment because it is one of two restaurants in Oakland City. Yikes.
