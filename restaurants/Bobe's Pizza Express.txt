Bobe's Pizza Express

Text: We have our pizza and bread sticks delivered. The food always tastes good and is usually hot or at least warm, but last weekend we ordered and, when it finally showed up, the delivery boy sat in front of my house for 5 minutes on his phone until he saw me standing at the door! The pizza and bread sticks were both cold. I mean no heat at all, not even warm. I don't mind paying the extra charge for delivery, but they need to inform their delivery driver to talk on his phone on his own time. It was even in the bag to keep them warm. Very disappointed.

Text: Bobe's Pizza in Washington, Indiana, is one GREAT pizza place.  There are several Bobe's Pizza Restaurants across Southwest Indiana.  I have been eating their pizza since childhood, supposedly the original recipe came from Italy.  This restaurant is large with a lot of seating.  They have all the usual types of Italian food.  On the weekends, they have fried chicken, and Steaks through the week are thought to be the best around here.  If you want great pizza, stop by Bobe's in Washington!
