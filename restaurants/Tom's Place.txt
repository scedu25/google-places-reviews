Tom's Place

Text: While traveling we decided we wanted a nice meal. After reviewing the establishment we chose Tom's.  After walking in the door we were immediately told they only had a $69 five course meal and were told they were not able to accommodate us. Not sure if it was the size of the group or they fact they assumed we couldn't afford the meal but we never had the opportunity to try the food. My suggestion is to hire a new manager since she let quite a bit of money walk out of the door.

Text: I came here for the first time for my anniversary and loved it. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere especially if you aren't a local, but it is so worth the drive. Food, service, and drinks were on point. The server was very attentive, friendly, and knowledable. For an appetizer we had the prawns with a New Orleans cajun sauce--delicious. I had the duck and my boyfriend had the filet, which was one of the best steaks we had had in a while. Dessert is definitely a must too. 

This place is a fine dining establishment so expect a large bill. I have heard this place used to be a speakeasy in the 1920's, which is a neat piece of history. The ambience of Tom's definitely has an old fashioned vibe. I loved the jazzy Sinatra music as well.

Text: Really impressed with the quality of food for this area. The filet mingion was incredible. I have had this many times, but never as high quality as it was served here.  They also cooked it how I requested. It was not over done at all. The waiter, Ryan, was very attentive and made the dining experience smooth and enjoyable.

Text: Wonderful meal. Great service. You can't miss the colorful cow out front but don't think it is representative of the cuisine. Best place to dine in the region.

Text: To be honest, I'm the current sous chef. But even if I wasn't a chef, I'd still rate Toms Place with 5/5 because the food is fantastic and the service you get is top of the line. There is always enough servers to make sure every table is treated as if they are a VIP. For more Toms Place food follow our Instagram lassechef66 or my personal Instagram b.s.chef
