A Tavola Bar + Trattoria
Rating: 4
Text: Food was amazing! Really good pizza and hard ciders. Waitress was nice but kitchen staff can learn to smile a bit. Looked like they were all upset at having to be there.

Text: This is my second review tonight involving pizza, I need to find a treadmill I think. Tavola is legit Italian though. We had the goat cheese appetizer, loved it. And then we had some of their stone fired pizza, llllloved it. Will be going back

Text: I throughly enjoyed this place we had the arancini and my girlfriend and her best friend got one of their pizzas and I got some pesto pasta which definitely could have used something more to it idk but something. Overall I think the pizza would have been great and probably a better choice.

Text: This is definitely a place I would suggest going. All of the pastas were cooked perfectly, and the staff was friendly, even though it was busy. The only downside is that for the semi-casual atmosphere that it has in OTR, it's a bit pricy.

Text: A group of us sat at the bar and had some drinks then decided to stay for dinner. The drinks were good,the pizza was we had was better (gorgonzola with a pesto basil substitute sauce). The atmosphere was relaxed and wasn't too loud. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
