Text: Very nice place.  Wonderful staff!  I didn't get the $5 credit towards the restaurant I was supposed to get but that was due to a very long power outage, I assume.  Breakfast was very nice, but exactly the same every morning.  Great location near the beach and downtown.  I would stay here again!

Text: Very nice hotel. Service was great and rooms were very clean and modern. Close to the beach and downtown area. Both within walking distance. Hotel restaurant was very good. Only downside for me was the room was very large but not well setup for a business guest. There was not a very large desk or space to get work done. Since I was visiting for business this was a bit of an issue. For those visiting for pleasure this should be no issue. Despite this I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Food was good but poration of chicken was tiny. Haystack of root veggies was average. Service was excellent and better than my dinner. Others seemed to be better than my. Chicken.

Text: This is a wonderful hotel right in the center of the action, within a couple of blocks of the beach and the downtown shopping district. It's true that you'll get a cheaper room elsewhere, but you get what you pay for in the quality of the hotel and the convenience of the location.
