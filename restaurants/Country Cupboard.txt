Text: This is definitely the restaurant yo go to if you like good home cooking. I especially am a fan of the Rueben and mushrooms. My daughter and husband love the hot beef. Big portions and friendly great service!

Text: Our favorite restaurant in Jamesport!  Reasonably priced food and great service!  When you look around in any restaurant and find the locals eating there...you can bet it is a good place to eat!  Home-cooked taste!  Pleasant employees.  A busy place at lunch time.  Haven't been there in the evening.
