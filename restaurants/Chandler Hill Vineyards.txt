Text: Nice place, but they have absolutely no respect or regard for their surroundings or Neighbors.. we've lived in the area for almost 30 years and this place shoots fireworks, has loud bands... it is extremely annoying and dangerous to have fireworks with forests (what's left of the area that's wooded, for now.) they send out a weekly email to apprise residents of the upcoming annoyances, the hospitable people they are. They're under new ownership and it's gotten even noisier. I often wonder how the partners that own this place would feel if we shot off fireworks by their homes throughout the year, had screaming bands, and made noise every Friday and Saturday after 11 pm. I doubt they'd approve. They. Have joe Brazil, a north county transplant (formerly a democrat too) in their back,pocket. I'm hoping nearby residents are given more respect in the future. Serene this place is not.. nor respectful.

Text: Beautiful view and lively atmosphere. We reserved for a group of 25+ ahead of time. The service was horrible. The wine was fine. The BLT + P was its redeeming quality for me.

Text: A group of 12 met here to celebrate my sister's birthday. We missed the buffet, but ordered from the menu. Great food, wine, and live entertainment. We relaxed and danced!

Text: Visited here while i was on vacation with my girlfriend. I love the size of the winery and the woodwork on the ceiling was stunning. Their prices for wine samples are excellent, and they are incredibly knowledgeable of their products and many others. If you like a bit more oaky flavor in your wine, I personally recommend the One Eyed Jack. Thank you, Chandler Hill, for making this trip very enjoyable!
