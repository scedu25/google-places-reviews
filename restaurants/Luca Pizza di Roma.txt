Text: Horrible employees & management. We went there tonight was told the breadsticks would be 10 minutes, so we decided to come back. When we came back the manager said we would have to wait another 10 minutes, as we had to pay first before they would make them. Really this is not a fancy restaurant it's a pizza place in the mall! The manager is rude, plus after the employees & managers were ringing up customers not one of them washed their hands before touching the food! Wouldn't even give them a star, maybe a negative star.

Text: While the pizza is great the manager is not very friendly. Also seems like the manager stands around while the employee does all the work. Also was told by a pervious employee that the manager keeps all the tips in the tip jar not very far for someone who stands around and makes more. Would have gave 5 stars if management was up to par.

Text: Seriously?! I've seen teenagers run ice cream stands better than the profoundly rude management that runs this place. Unreal!

Text: My favorite pizza in town but the manager is so rude i havent been there lately and wont go back. I thought maybe he was having a bad day but the next time I went in..same rudeness,very irrogent and cocky..as if he was doing me a favor..shaking my head. So the one star I gave is for his promptness. That is all.
