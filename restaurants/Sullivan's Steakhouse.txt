Text: Service was great. Friendly staff and very quick about our meals. The food was excellent. By far best tasting place I have been to. Not much selection. But letâ€™s talk about pricing. Between my boyfriend and myself our ticket was $99. My plate alone with no sides or salad or soup was $34. So if you go here make sure you bring lots of $$$$$

Text: We walked in with a party of ten and they did a great job getting us into two five-top tables pretty quickly. The food was good, and servers knowledgeable and friendly. The service was a bit slow, and they were slammed that night. A couple of my table-mates did get food prepared to their specifications, however it's on us for not having told staff so that they could make it right.

The filet was delicious.
