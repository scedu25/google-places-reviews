Text: A nice little gem tucked just off the highway.  
First visit.  The service is top-notch.  The owner came by and asked us how we were enjoying the food.  That is a very nice touch.  
We had the Prime Rib.  It was phenomenal!  The creamy horseradish was very good, and I particularly liked the regular horseradish.  
We are very much looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.  
We just moved to Ottawa and this is our new favorite place to eat.  
Stop by, you will be glad you did.
