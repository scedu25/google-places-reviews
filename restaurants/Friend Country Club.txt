Text: The course was in great condition. Tough course from the tips, but very fair. Lots of reward for good shots. Punishment for bad shots. Everybody was very kind, and I will be back. Great quality at a great price!

Text: It is a hit and miss on whether they will be open. It is also a hit and miss on whether your food will be good depending on who's the cook for the night. One time ordered a chicken fried steak and it was absolutely delicious. The next time we ordered it was burnt.

Text: One of the best kept secrets in the golf world!  Beautifully groomed course, challenging variety of holes, and plenty of trees to get stuck behind.  Not a golfer?  Bring the family out for a great meal at the clubhouse.  Friendly staff and classic small town atmosphere.  Restaurant and course is open to the public!
