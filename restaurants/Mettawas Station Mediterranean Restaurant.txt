Text: In spite of serving a record number of customers since their opening 9 years ago, a truly amazing evening! GREAT service, wonderful ambiance, appropriately paced food service - timing is everything! From the seafood to steak to rack of lamb - all delicious! Needs some improvement in the calamari; but that's being picky. We can't wait to come back and dine on the patio!

Text: Absolutely amazing. So much flavour and quality. Very friendly staff. Shoutout to Sheila, our server- so helpful and genuine. Am looking forward to going again. PS will make vegan dishes upon request and they are not bland at all!! I'm vegan and the vegan food I had here was better than at many vegan restaurants I've been to. They're also apparently adding more vegan items to the menu in the next few weeks. So so good.

Text: Honestly, I have had rack of lamb at many, many restaurants, and I can honestly say that their rack of lamb is the best I've ever had.   The chef at Mettawas is passionate about food because you can taste it in the food.   Keep up the great work Mettawas staff!

Text: Absolutely one of the best meals we have had. Our server Katie was a rockstar as well. Wish we could try everything on the menu. By far the best lasagna I had and my wife although full could not stop eating her stuffed sole. Will be recommending this place to everyone we know. Thank you for a great experience.
