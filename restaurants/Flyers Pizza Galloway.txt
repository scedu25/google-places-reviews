Text: This place is horrible. I order my nephew a sub and a drink and they said it would take 45 minuses to arrive. It took an hour and half for the food to get here and it was cold. I called after the 45 minutes and was told that the food had already left and should be there soon. It didn't show. I had to call back and they kept me on hold. Finally the sub got here but it was cold and when I called to say something I was told that a Manger wasn't available and I would have to call back tomorrow. This place has horrible customer service and is extremely slow! Do not order from them if you expect your food to arrive hot.

Text: This is probably the best pizza I've had in America. The prices are a bit higher, but the reason shows in their ingredients. I've never gotten a pizza I was unhappy with from here.

Text: Best salads in town and awesome pizza.  Delivery is fast, they even deliver to Darbydale. The only draw back is they are super expensive. They have a drive up window for pick up and nice inside and even accepts checks.

Text: Best pizza around in my opinion wish it was cheaper in price but worth the money if you can afford it
