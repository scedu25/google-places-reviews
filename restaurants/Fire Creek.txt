Text: Delicious food and great atmosphere. A bit pricey, and drinks were a bit disappointing, but overall quite good.

Text: It had a nice atmosphere, and the waiter was polite and attentive. That is the only reason I'm giving it two stars. I tried two of their wines, neither was very good. Definitely not worth the hefty price tag. My food wasn't very good. I took a few bites, but that's about all I could make myself eat. I got a salad, and it was totally saturated in a super sweet dressing. It might have been better if I'd ordered it on the side. Their fries just tasted like frozen french fries. Not very good at all. I tried a bite of their burger as well. It was o.k. not really good, but not bad either. I paid a large bill, and still left hungry because I disliked the food that much. I really don't recommend eating at Firecreek.

Text: Very good neighborhood restaurant. A little overpriced but won't be disappointed. Fairly standard grill menu with expected choices. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food, though, and found meats and fish to be cooked well. I would say it's solid, rather than exceptional. Would have been 5 stars if priced accordingly.

Text: Food is always great here.  Atmosphere is amazingly nice for a strip center.  Good place for a business lunch.

Text: Worst customer service and worst tasting steaks ever! It took almost an hour for my steak to arrive, a Cajun peppered Ribeye. The one side of my steak was burnt and medium rare, the other side was burnt and well done. I didn't taste any Cajun or pepper seasoning. My wife's asparagus was burnt. Her steak was also burnt. The only good thing about our meal was half off martinis. This is the first and last time we will be visiting this establishment. If I could have given zero stars, I would have.
