Text: Great service. One of the few places that has Rocky Mountain Oysters on the menu.  The hamburgers are excellent and the menu has a great selection beyond hamburgers. I really like the atmosphere of Creekside Tavern. It is clean with a warm country decor. They have a very nice on tap beer selection. Modest salad bar with just the right selections.

Text: Great service! They bent over backwards to meet our paleo needs. Our steaks were not on the lunch menu and they made them special for us - everything came out perfect.
