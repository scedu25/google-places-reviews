Hickory Hut BBQ

Text: Really good pulled pork and ribs. LOVED the fries! Really nice staff. Not fancy but not expensive either. We were driving cross country and found this place on Google. It's a couple of miles off I70 but was well worth the short detour.

Text: This place was amazing. Stopped in on a road trip and the place was packed. Ordered food for 6 people and had it all in less than 5 minutes. Everything was tasty and the staff was very friendly. We left extremely satisfied.

Text: Hickory Hut is not what it used to be. Both our meals were undercooked, near raw in one rib. Tough, chewy, So much fat that our dog was very happy. I have hope it was a temporary thing or I would have given it one star

Text: Best 2.5 mile detour off of I-70 that we made driving from CO to MO (avoiding the same old fast food junk).  The brisket sandwich is the best i've had in a number of years.  Huge bun with lots of chopped and sliced brisket with just a little BBQ sauce was awesome.  Wife and kids had the chicken and ribs-looked good.  Thanks for the delicious food.
