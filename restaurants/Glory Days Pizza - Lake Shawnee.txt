Glory Days Pizza - Lake Shawnee

Text: Pizza is okay and kind of expensive. Store doesn't open until 11 which is kind of late on a Saturday morning. It is nice to have a sit down restaurant close to the ball field.

Text: I was hoping for a great experience and was very let down, starting with low grade ingredients and a very long delivery time. Who puts canned mushrooms on a pizza?! Come on! pizza should be made with fresh ingredients. Skip this place and find a good pizza else where!
