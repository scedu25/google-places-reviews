Text: OMG I thought I was gonna be ordering some half decent dinner/bar food based on the price. And I am gladly mistaken! This food is by far some of the best I've had.... And I ordered delivery I wish I would have gone in! 
I ordered country fried steak and it's the bomb!
Wife ordered pork tenderloin sammich and she agrees it's the best she's had in years, will order from here again!
