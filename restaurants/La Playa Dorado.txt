Text: This place was delicious. Everything was very fresh. There shrimp cocktail is amazing but isn't your traditional shrimp cocktail. Whatever sauce it's made with is amazing I could drink a gallon of it.

Text: Food was good, I ordered the ground beef enchiladas.  They have a unique taste from other local Mexican food restaurants in Garden City.  Some or the dishes our party order were extremely spicy and other dishes were large portions.
