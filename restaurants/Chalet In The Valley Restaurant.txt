Chalet In The Valley Restaurant

Text: Genuine & Rewarding! Many prior satisfying visits but Father's Day 2017 was special. The staff was put to the test with the crush of hungry/hot/impatient diners. They could not have performed any more admirably. The wonderful variety  (& extensive) buffet offering was the best ever. Soup/salad bar was fresh and delicious. But the most impressive offering of the day (not on the menu) was the how the host/servers handled us, the public. HATS OFF TO YOU!

Text: Visited the area for our anniversary, if I could go back we would have eaten here each day. Best in the area. Diverse and tasty menu. Nice staff. Clean and delicious place.

Text: We just left here and we were very disappointed. It took them 2 hours to serve us. The host and waiter never greeted us introduced themselves or smiled. I  got the salon which was 3 ounces at best and got 3 pieces of asparagus for an extra charge. It was more than we pay in Columbus. Go somewhere else for the money and get better service.

Text: A must-eat-at type of place. Food is phenomenal with good service. Their Weiner Schnitzel is one of the best I've had, even topping some of what I've had in Germany. You get pretzel bread sticks to share for the table and the salad bar is good. I will be back!

Text: Delicious German/Swiss style entrees. Sandwiches are sized "big" or "bigger".  A "big" sandwich is plenty unless you haven't eaten in a month! The cheese served in this restaurant is made just across the road. The cheese is a product of Amish dairy cows. Very fresh.
