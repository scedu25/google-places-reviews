Local House 20

Text: We had a small group, which they sested us promptly, even though all of our party hadn't made it.  Service was s l o w, and the food was cold.  When we commented on thr cold food the waitrrss dtated it was 'hot' off the grill.  Not true.  They did give us a small discount for the cold food.  Not a lot of places to eat in a small town.

Text: Cooks do not know how to cook a sirloin medium. It first came rare so I sent it back, then it came charcoal. Waitstaff was slow and less than sympathetic. The rest of the food was decent, but if this is what passes as local, I'll drive an hour to McDonalds.
