The Keeping Room

Text: We went on a Sunday. Things are a bit different on Sundays. The only entre on Sundays is a chicken salad croissant, but it was very good and just fine with us. Don't be in a hurry; it's not that kind of place. Have some tea and leisurely converse, and just be glad they're open from 1pm - 4pm on Sundays. It's a gift shop too, so browse a bit.

Text: It's a fun boutique at which to eat and shop. They have good coffee and cinnamon rolls, though I haven't had a chance to try them for lunch yet. They have lots of home decor, a few furniture pieces, jewelry, and other miscellaneous items.
