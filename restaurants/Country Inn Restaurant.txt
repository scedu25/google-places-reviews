Text: Small but VERY fresh salad bar. Wonderful friendly service. Good country food. Great place for families that have those who want breakfast at the same time as those who don't!  Our kind of place. :)

Text: Always look forward to eating here but this visit wasn't so great! We waited about 10 minutes to get coffee after 2 waitresses asked what we wanted. when we finally got our food that wasn't brought out by our waitresses the one that finally brought our coffee and took our order it wasn't very hot and I had asked for onion in my hash browns, wasn't there and we was almost finished eating by the time she came to check on us and was totally done by the time we got a refill !

Text: We tried this place for the first time. The food was delicious though portion sizes seemed to be a bit small. Especially the steak fries. They are good but I expected a bit more for $1.99. The salad bar was adequate though it could have a few more things. It was good.  Overall, we liked it. We'll probably be back sometime but we weren't overjoyed with it. I would say we get a better deal at Frisch's.

Text: Service is usually average to good.  Food quality is low.  For example I got bacon for breakfast and the three pieces I got could maybe be put together and form one typical piece of bacon from Bob Evans.  It's close to home but I'll gladly drove further for better quality.
