Text: Such a good place to grab some quick lunch if you live on the East Side. Their lunch specials for under $5 seriously can't be beat! I usually call ahead for take out and it's so quick- always ready within 10 min! The lady who is always there, whom I assume is the owner, is always nice and deserves a tip every time- it always puts a smile on her face

Text: I have never seen a place wreck such a basic dish as General Tso's Chicken so irrevocably.  The over-steamed broccoli, the mushy breading? Fine.  Both are common casualties of the careless chef. But the unconscionably mis-flavored sauce? No excuse. Is that green pepper, I taste? And corn syrup? What is this?
