Text: They have decent food if you don't mind waiting a hour even when there are less than 5 people eating. Terrible service. Have went multiple occasions always left disappointed will never return.

Text: People there are very rude. Very slow, you have to take your glass up to the bar to get refills while your waitress stands in the corner and chit chats. Have tried several times, food is good if you don't mind rudeness served on the side. Will not be back.
