Text: This was by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had. How hard is it to make sweet and sour chicken? Obviously too hard. The chicken was severely over cooked and all deep fried breading. I ordered fried rice, even paid an extra $1 for it but still got white rice. Does any place in Bloomington, Indiana know how to cook Chinese food? I have tried 5 so far all are terrible. I guess I will just wait to go back home to Michigan to get real Chinese food.
