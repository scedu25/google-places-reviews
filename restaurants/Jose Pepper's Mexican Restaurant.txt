Text: The staff is very nice. My husband likes the hot sauce that Jason makes. The major issue I have is, they are not consistent. A couple of months ago,  I loved their food. About a month ago, ordered spinach and mushroom enchiladas, they were completely cold in the middle, plates are always scalding hot though. The manager gave us a ticket for a free meal, didn't want it, but he insisted. Today, went for lunch. I asked the waitress to make sure the seafood enchiladas I ordered were hot in the middle. They were, and they were good.  But.....
the black beans were cold.  Food lately has been hit or miss. I didn't say anything, didn't want another free meal. My employer is closer to Carlos O Kelly's,  so for Mexican, that is where we will go.

Text: The special was good. The service was very good. The prices are a little high. The patio,(where we ate) was very nice. It was the perfect day to eat out on the patio. Dalton, (our server) was attentive,w/a very positive attitude. Even the flies took a liking to the food. LOL.

Text: Was in for lunch .Waited approx 10 min for waitress to come to get our order . wife and I had already eaten a whole basket of chips and salsa.  It took another 30 minutes to get our food by this point we needed to leave . We asked waitress to please put it in a to go box. The manager showed up at the table with an attitude and just gave excuses as to why there service was bad. Fyi wait staff was very good.
