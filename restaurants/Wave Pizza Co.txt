Text: Great food but extremely poor service. Waited 10 minutes at our table just to be brought menus. The girl who brought us our menus informed us our server would be right with us. Another 10 minutes passes as we wait for our server; meanwhile the only other worker present continues to clean tables and ignore us. Finally the girl cleaning tables comes over and says "well, I guess I'll be taking care of you." We ordered a simple, large cheese pizza and waited over an hour for our food. Mind you, this was a Sunday night with three other small groups present. We had to ask the server for our check and a box because she was too busy checking her phone behind the bar to actually wait on us. If it wasn't for the quality of the food, I would be giving no stars. However, I definitely won't be back unless I want to spend almost two hours waiting for dinner.

Text: Best pizza I've ever had, and I worked at a pizza pub for seven years. Stop there almost every time I'm in GI. Always get the longboard so I can take some home. Literally the best, no place here in Lincoln touches it

Text: DELICIOUS food! We got a sandwich and pizza. The sandwich had THICK "lunch meat" and was loaded with flavor. The pizza also was thick, cheesy, and had hearty chunks of meat. Highly recommend it!

Text: Came here for what we thought would be a quick bite around 8pm on a Sunday night. Ordered one small order of bread sticks and a large cheese pizza. Took ten minutes just to order our drinks and another 10 after that to put in our food order. Bread sticks came reasonably quickly but the pizza didn't come until being there for at least an hour. There were only three other tables of people along with the two of us.

Waitress was very unnatentive and had no awareness for how unreasonably long the whole process was taking. Never heard a single sorry or any sort of comment about it taking us more than an hour and a half from start to finish. Food was solid, but man, the service made the experience very unpleasant.
