Great Northern Mall
Rating: 4
Text: Well kept, middle of America style mall. The food court has plenty of options, while the mall has a new modern appearance. There are also plenty of good shopping options like Lids, H&M, Forever 21, Disney Store, and others. There is also an adjoining strip mall with Brown Bag Burger, Pier 1, World Market, and others.

Text: This is a nice, clean mall.  Most of the other customers are well behaved and not annoying.  The stores are clean and kept up.  The restroom are well maintained.  They have expanded and moved the food court since the last time I was here which was many years ago.  Rhis is a safe place to go without much worry about punks and thugs running around.

Text: Established Shopping Mall with easy access from all points thanks to adjacent I-480 highway.   Majority of mall spaces are populated with recognized retailers, although many of the higher-end stores are now located at Crocker Park, which is just a few miles north of this location.  All anchor spaces are filled, with several big box retailers surrounding the property.  Property was clean and well-maintained with nice amenities (Check out the Family Restrooms!)  There is a large chess set for use in the wing nearest the Sears main entrance.

Text: This is my favorite Mall around this area because it’s very well balanced. It definitely leans more towards an upscale mall, but it’s not full of arrogant employees who act like they’re better than everyone. It kind of has a home-like feel, and there are a lot of genuinely nice employees through the wide variety of stores to choose from.
