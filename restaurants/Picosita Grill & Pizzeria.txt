Text: Food was okay... kinda... service wasn't the best. Waited a looooong time for food to come out and waiter wasn't very personable. He didn't refil drinks and took forever for someone to take payment.  Someone from the kitchen came out instead.  I won't be back and won't recommend this place to anyone.

Text: I was skeptical at first that they would have good Mexican food, but it really was pretty great. The margaritas were really good also. We went there twice now and the first time our service was amazing, the second time it wasn't so great. That was really the only drawback.
