Text: Great pizza, great atmosphere and great people! My first visit and definitely not my last! This place has a real wood fired pizza oven right in the dinning room and it hits your table hot and fresh, this was a good experience and nap time is gonna be even better!

Text: Being a non white person, rarely even if the  restaurant is top notched,does one get full respect as a customer. Here is an exception  this place is simple, clean and full of good people. Greeted by the sweet smilIng young lady, took my order and would actually come back and see if all is good. 
She didn't look at me in anyway strange to make me feel out of place or if I was any different. That's how all humans should be treated. Thank you very much for that. 
Just ordered a hamburger and it came out nice and hot like a humburger should be. I enjoyed every bite till the end.

Text: This place sucked from the minute we pulled in the parking lot. Not enough parking to accommodate the guests that will eat there. We got seated outside when someone finally figured out what was going on. We sat and waited 15 minutes just to put in a drink/food order. People that came after us- seated all around us was getting their food. Multiple people already having their meal and leaving while we still waited with still no food. The waitress was clueless and kept saying that she was sorry that they were just so busy. I call BS. We ordered 1 pizza and 2 burgers while others around us got steaks and baked potatoes.  After waiting another 1hour and 10 minutes we still had no food. So we walked out and left. Will NEVER go back.  Horrible experience. I don't NOT recommend.
