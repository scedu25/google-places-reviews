Text: The staff were very helpful and got us seated promptly. They were very good about accommodating our toddler, too. 
Dinner was delicious! I highly recommend both the curried butternut squash and the macaroni and cheese.

Text: First time here. My son and his wife  love it and have been here several times so we tagged along last night. Very busy but we made reservations and were seated right on time. Service was good and the food was outstanding. Its a 45 minute drive for us but we WILL be back often.

Text: Had a great dinner, food was delicious. Service was excellent . Only thing was ; why have an online reservation service if you're not going to be able to reserve a table. Reservations should be seated first ( downstairs ) and walk ins be seated upstairs.
