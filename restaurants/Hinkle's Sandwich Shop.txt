Text: LOVE Hinkle's...would give five stars, but my only issue is that it's crowded and sometimes hard to get a stool on diner side, or table on restaurant side..Whitefish is awesome, burgers are great, homefries are wonderful etc..

Text: Good burgers and friendly staff. Just an fyi, this place is very small with limited seating and the burgers are very small. You might want to order 2 burgers if you like bigger burgers. Very simple menu but very good.

Text: Hinkle's has very good shakes - they have a nice thickness to them and so many flavors. The burgers are great too, slider style with onions and pickles. Fast service, quite cheap, all around great burger joint.
