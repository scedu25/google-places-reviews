Marcella's

Text: Enjoyed a rainy night from the comfort of Marcella's cozy bar. We got in right at 5, before the full rush of the happy hour crowd. Drinks and food took a little while but the ambience was so nice we didn't mind taking our time. The four cheese pizza doesn't sound particularly exciting but the ricotta adds a richness that made my husband and I wonder why all pizzas don't have four cheeses. We were just stopping in for a quick bite but we will be back for more pizza and Tuscan Limonatas.

Text: Wow, Italian cuisine at it's finest....the food was outstanding! Never have I had a fettuccine Alfredo with a huge meatball on top smothered in marinara....that's right, Alfredo sauce AND Marinara......it was incredible! That meatball was divine. I would definitely travel the 70 miles back there.

Text: Love this restaurant and this location is even better than the Polaris location.  Happy hour is amazeballs here with half off some drinks and all apps and more.  Great service and the food is top quality. Get the meatballs!

Text: Wife's birthday. Waited about 45 minutes but it was enjoyable. Table up front overlooking sidewalk. Weather was perfect. Spaghetti & meatball & penne was very good. Server, Amanda, was wonderful.
