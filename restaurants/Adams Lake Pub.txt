Text: First time there, I had heard good things.  The food was pretty good but it took 2 hrs to get it after we ordered.  The service was terrible but I think it was just our waitress.  Our drinks were always empty and she rarely came by our table.  Everyone else seemed to be getting good service.  May try it again someday but i was very dissapointed.

Text: Always has great food and friendly staff. We've had annoying seating both times we've been there but I'm just chalking that up to luck of the draw. Definitely make a reservation! Eating at the bar is next to impossible with the lip on the bar.
