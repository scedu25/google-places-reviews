Text: When you go there get the family style meal you may think it's a little pricey but trust me it's the best deal. What you don't eat you can bring home and it includes a dessert. Also it's all you can eat for $16.00 a person.  If you order just a plate it's $10.99 a person plus $2.29  for a drink and $4.00 for pie. We drove over a hundred  miles just to eat and turn around and go back home. But most of the people were riding motorcycles.

Text: This place offers all you can eat served family style at your table. Price includes your choice of pie for dessert. If you are too full for dessert they will pack it to go for you or give you 10% off your meal.  Serves drinks in mason jars. They dress in old fashion Pioneer dress. They also have outdoor seating.

Text: This place is amazing! My Dad and I drove down here to get some pictures of the eclipse and found this place by accident. Food was great, and the "sawdust" pie was amazing! Our beautiful waitress, Shaela, was impeccable!  I would drive 3 hours to eat here,.......again! Highly recommend checking this place pit for lunch or dinner!

Text: Love the rustic look and feel.  The strawberry butter and salad are worth going back! $16 a plate a tad pricey.  But comes with drink and dessert. Also, didn't seem as kid friendly as it used to be.  But a nice trip anyway

Text: The "family style" method of food delivery is unique and a nice touch. The food is okay and the price isn't too bad. Don't order the cheesecake, it was more like pudding filling.
