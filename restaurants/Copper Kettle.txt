Text: We really loved their Biscuit and Gravy, Homemade Cinnamon Rolls, eggs, Bacon, and sausage links. They had country potatoes but I'm a hash browns kind of person. It was very good. We took my dad for brunch and we noticed a picture on the way behind my dad that said "old geezers corner", it made us all laugh really hard! The waitress was Great, she even interacted with our 2yr old son
