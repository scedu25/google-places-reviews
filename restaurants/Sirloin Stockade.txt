Sirloin Stockade

Text: This place is by far the worst place I've ever been!! If I could give it 0 stars I would!! I ordered the 7oz ribeye medium and it came to the table well done and on top of it, it was paper thin and dry as a bone!! The food on the buffet was horrible and almost non-edible! The place was filthy and atmosphere was dark!! Even the bathroom was dirty and smelled like urine bad!! I was passing through on my way back to Indiana and totally wish I would of went somewhere else to eat!! I mean even the dessert was bad!! It was a waste of $35 I spent for 2 people!! I didn't waste my time trying to talk to the manager about this because I didn't see one the whole time I was there! Even the waitress was bad, she spent more time talking to her friend's that were there eating with their children!! The place honestly should be shut down!! I will NEVER visit a sirloin stampede EVER again and I definitely advise people to choose somewhere else to eat!!

Text: Great place for dinner. Didn't order any extras the buffet was enough!  Closed kind of early for a Friday night though?! My kids loved it too. My son actually ate fried catfish here! Husband's only complaint was the meatloaf; was not cook all the way through.

Text: Salad bar was not very good. The products tasted old. And the fried chicken was not thoroughly cooked. It turned my stomach. Waitress was friendly but i could have used a refill on my beverage and it was not offered. I made sure manager and waitress and cashier knew about the chicken. I doubt anything was done about it. I won't go back.

Text: Great variety of food. Go there hungry and if you leave hungry, you're to blame. They have the best bread pudding I have had at any restaurant. I recommend this restaurant as a regular go to place for the whole family.

Text: First time visitor. They let us know where we could find a table to sit our large family. Waitress was attentive, quickly clearing dirty plates and bringing clean ones. Selection/variety of food and desserts was very good. Overall, my family was satisfied.
