Silver Spring House Restaurant

Text: I figured it would be good when I arrived mid-week to a crazy full parking lot. An hour wait got squashed to about 10min which is always a bonus. Chicken was amazing. Server and bar tenders were excellent.  I would recommend this to anybody. My party all had chicken but they cater to red meat lovers too. Can't say enough good things about this place. Give it a go. Worth the wait if there is one.

Text: There is something about Silver Spring House that makes you feel like you are on vacation.  There are actually many things.  The staff always makes you feel welcome and will try their best to make you comfortable even with the large volume of guests. The open air seating is always cooled by a breeze created by dozens of fans...or you can sit inside the old restaurant.   Keno and sport fill the many screens to keep you drinking and eating from their expansive menu.  Everyone leaves with a smile  and a full belly.

Text: We have actually been disappointed the last couple of times that we've been here. The broccoli & mashed potatoes were served cold. The salmon was hot & very good. The server replaced the cold items, but then the broccoli tasted a bit of chlorine bleach. Disappointing for a $22.00 meal.

Text: Service was very attentive but not intrusive. Beer choices were excellent as was the food. I had the signature half-chicken. Very tasty and the price hasn't gone up in years.

Text: I've had a lot of chicken in my life of 51 years. The marination and grilling method used at Spring House is second to none! Their signature dish, 1/4 or 1/2 chicken is absolutely amazing!  I always add Chipotle Coleslaw and the Black Bean Salad as my sides.  I believe the combination of flavors makes an amazing meal. The Black Bean Salad has a vinegar dressing the complements both the spicy Chipotle from the coleslaw and the zesty marinade from the chicken. Absolutely amazing!
