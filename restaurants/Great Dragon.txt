Text: Excellent weekday lunch buffet. The food is always hot, tasty, and ample. Best to go on a Thursday or Friday during the lunch hour. Be aware there is limited seating. Friendly and efficient staff. Recommended.

Text: This was dissapointing. Firstly, was expensive ($50). Secondly, some of it was not good. We got chicken on a stick, and it was barely edible. We threw most of it away because it was so burnt, but I don't think it would have tasted good even if it wasn't burnt. The dumplings were very gross with a super thick wrapper and didn't taste right, and the dumpling sauce (normally my favorite Chineese sauce) was straight up disgusting. The spare ribs weren't edible because they were so grissly and tough, and the sauce on them tasted way too sweet and kind of coconut like. They went right into the garbage. The entrees ($10.25 each) were good. We got chicken and broccoli and pork and mushroom. The crab rangoons were delicious, but expensive. I would order the two entrees and crab rangoons again, but everything else was a waste of money.

Text: I've always been a General Tsos guy. Then, in an effort to cut back on carbs, we tried the Mongolian Beef. It is, by far, the best I have ever had. I order it extra spicy and they nail it every time!
