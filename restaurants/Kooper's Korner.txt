Text: John is a sweet heart, the regulars are sweet as well, but the normal farm crowd. Won't find many hipster kids here! Such a cool place too. So much history.

Text: Most likely the cleanest little Bar & Grill on the planet.  A very simple menu but everything they do they do RIGHT!

Changes the fryer oil constantly, you'll never have french fries that taste like anything other than french fries here.  Another great thing is the beer is always cold and the prices are reasonable.

The entire establishment is littered with memorabilia, one of a kinds, funnies and do-dads.  You're sure to find something there that'll bring back memories, spark a conversation or just make you laugh out loud.

If you're touring thru South-Central Nebraska Kooper's is a great place to stop, get a bite to eat and wash it down before moving on to your final destination.
