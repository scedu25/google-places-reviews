Text: Oh my gosh, this was the best lunch (tenderloin) that I've had in a while! One of the top 5 at least. The decor is so comfortable and inviting. Service was great. Think we'll be back tomorrow ?

Text: Used to be a fantastic family resteraunt. Tonight's dinner was dangerous. The fried chicken was not cooked properly. It was pink under the crust. The side of spaghetti and tortellini was spoiled tasting. They were out of several of the dinner specials early in the dinner service. One staff member was yelling at another in the kitchen loud enough to be heard in the dining area.  Very uncomfortable situation. Not sure what happened, but will be crossing this off our  resteraunt rotation!
