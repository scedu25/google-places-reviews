Text: Food is okay, if it had not been for the friendliness of the wait staff, I'd have give the place 2 stars. The decore needs work as the cardboard (wall art) advertisements are childish and not reminicent of a professiinal restaurant.

Text: Food is decent enough, but get take out.  This place is so noisy the employees can't even hear you on their phone when you call to place an order.  The sushi is ok, but it seems they never make the same thing twice.

Text: For a rural town in Missouri, Shogun's sushi doesn't disappoint. They have a surprising variety of classic rolls and creative combinations. The quality is always high, and we have never been disappointed with our visit. Occasionally, the service is slow, but the wait staff is usually friendly and the complimentary dumplings while you wait help to ease the time. We have never tried the tableside Hibachi, but it sounds and looks entertaining. They enjoy celebrating birthdays here, so if you want to embarrass someone, this is the place.
