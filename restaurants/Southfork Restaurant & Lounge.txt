Southfork Restaurant & Lounge
Rating: 5
Text: This is a gem of a restaurant. Menu is varied and portions are generous. The onion rings are unique and one order will serve the entire table. Every Friday  and Saturday night, Southfork puts out the best prime rib in southeast Iowa! Service is attentive and staff very accommodating. This is a come-as-you-are place, especially if you are looking for an  outstanding meal in a casual setting.

Text: We drove 40 miles anticipating a delicious Sunday morning breakfast, as we have experienced in the past. Your Google listing said you were open until 2p, but when we arrived you were closed! Huge disappointment! Please keep your Google information current or don't do it at all!

Text: Great home style cooking, hefty portions, friendly service. Busy lunch and dinner crowd so it can be a bit noisy.
