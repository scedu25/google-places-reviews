Griffin Grill & Pub

Text: We went on a Friday night during dinner rush. We had a friendly waiter who knew the menu and it was easy to get any answers to questions we had. We started with the Blarney Bread which was really good. My husband ordered the Bangers and Mash, which I took a bite of and it was very good. I ordered the Blackberry Chicken and that was also very good. Overall, good and and good service means we will be coming back.

Text: I love the steak bits. The staff is always nice. Sometimes when it gets really busy service can get a little behind but that should be expected. Great food and cold Guinness on tap. I love this place.

Text: I love the Griffin.  The staff is great, the food is generally pretty good, and they have a small but great beer selection.  

We went for breakfast a few days ago.  I got "The Griffin Breakfast Combo", basically it's corned beef has with eggs and cheese.  It was pretty good, overall I was happy with the food.  However, I was sort of surprised that they don't make their own corned beef hash.  They have a pretty good Reuben, I'd like to see the same corned beef on their breakfast menu.  Seems sort of weird that their serving the canned stuff.

Text: I go here quite often, almost every Tuesday or Thursday, with my Grandma. We have always had great service until today (06/08/17). Sometimes it's a little slow and we get it but we were barely even waited on by our server. When we finally got our food after 45 minutes we were given excuses instead of an apology. Food was still good, but I don't believe we will be going here as often if at all. We totally understand that sometimes there are complications, but this is the first time we've considered cancelling our order and walking out. It was kind of ridiculous. The only other time we have had bad service was from the same server, the service was very similar to what I have already described, except we had to wait 10 minutes just to put in our drink order (Mid June, Not sure of exact date). 

I'm upset I couldn't give the 5 stars I know the Griffin deserves. I genuinely hope if we go back our service is much better because we love the food and atmosphere.

Text: Another reason to love Battle Creek! I was nervous to walk in on my first visit, but I don't think I've ever had better service! I'm excited to return and try something other than the fantastic fish tacos.
