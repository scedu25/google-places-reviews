Text: MINUS 5 STARS. Horrible. Catering was 45 minutes late and the order was wrong. Salad was requested without bacon. They put bacon in the salad and provided no salad dressing. They did manage to get right the request for a vegetarian mac & cheese, but placed that in the bottom of the box they delivered the food in and meat drippings dripped into the "vegetarian" mac & cheese. No Kalamata olives or feta cheese was delivered for the Mediterranean chicken. Completely unacceptable experience. Eat here at your own risk.

Text: I wanted to like this place but they served me a raw chicken sandwich. Kitchen staff clearly not using a thermometer. The manager did come right away and took care of the entire bill, not just my portion.  I would try again because of the managers quick response, but it will be a while and I will not order chicken.

Text: Spacious, quiet, except for the occasional child chuckling or laughing. Even the kids are well behaved! Food is great! The satay sampler is wonderful. You can eat vegetarian at Blackstone's (the power salad and other salads). Service is excellent, even when several servers serve you. I usually tip 20% unless a martini is forgotten (15%).
