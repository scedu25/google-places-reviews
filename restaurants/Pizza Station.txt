Text: This location right off the highway is CLOSED!! Not in operation as of 9/10/17.   We were going to stop and get pizza but that was a no-go.

Text: Probably one of the best (and only) places you can eat on this drive through I-40. It's a local restaurant with delicious pizzas. Just make sure you bring cash!
