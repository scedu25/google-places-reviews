Text: I have always loved coming to Belle Fonte for years. I was pleasantly surprised to find their construction was finally finished and their new dining area. It's nice that they now have a casual dining area and a more classy one. The food is still spectacular, the staff as friendly as ever, and prices fair.

Text: It's a good place to eat, you just got order the right things lol. Most of their stuff is good the service is decent but they're are some items you want to stay away from cause their Mexican menu is new and they haven't got the hang of it and some food is too greasy. But their fettuccine chicken and shrimp Alfredo is good and the Hawaiian loco is good. As well as they're pizza and most pastas.

Text: Beautiful atmosphere and kind polite servers.  The portions are generous. I had the bed lasagna. Tasted like a grandmother had labored for hours to melt the flavors.
Delicous!
