Text: Main courses home run...smoked pork chop w . Polenta is a large and very tasty dish. My wife loved sea scallops.My niece loved the halibut and her parent their sirloin...all good portions and quality. I like my app...fig and prosciutto was good but would have preferred prosciutto freshly shaved and not like bacon. A wee bit heavy on dressing. I did not have desert but the others enjoyed their desert. Service was attentive and polite. A very nice room. Excellent wine list from top end to bottom. Would go back in a heartbeat !

Text: We were lucky to get a table here on Friday night - a last minute reservation. It was absolutely worth it. My rib eye steak was cooked to order perfectly. I also enjoyed their squash soup (a special that night) as well as their Lola fries. Delicious. Mike enjoyed Dover sole, filleted table-side. He raved about the side dish of potatoes and onions. Our server, Dominick, was great!

Text: Best meal I've ever had! The service was so friendly and really made you feel like a priority. My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner here for my birthday and it was honestly the best meal we've ever had. The food was amazing, there's nothing like it.

Text: We came to Lola's for the first time to celebrate our anniversary.  We had the most amazing experience thanks to our waiter Dominic.  Other than our main course, we let him decide on our appetizers, desserts and wine. Thank you Rachel for the very memorable experience!

Text: Excellent cuisine in a great location.  Everything thing was well done and perfectly paired. The cocktails were also perfect for the atmosphere. Protein heavy menu and there is nothing wrong with that.
