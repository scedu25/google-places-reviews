Text: Great steak, great soup, bread and butter were very nice.  Good bar drinks, classy albeit dark atmosphere.  One of our party of 6 had their steak underdone.  The waitress asked her if "she was sure it was not done enough?  Sometimes the dark lights in here...".  She had actually had a bite of it and was in fact "sure" it was not medium.  She took it back, and it was cooked it up nicely to her satisfaction.  

Do not bother with those Au Gratin potatoes...way too tart and weird tasting.  Everyone in our party agreed.  Service was friendly and informative but a bit slow...especially considering how few people were in the restaurant.  Pricey, so yeah...

Text: I had the worst prime rib. About half was grissel & couldn't chew it. Also I ordered it so that there was no blood to it. Guess how i got it? You got it. Bloody!! I didn't say anything. Just didn't want to appear snobbish. This was my 1st & last visit here.

Text: Always a great steak & prime rib. We are always happy with our meal. A little on the high side for prices but worth it.
