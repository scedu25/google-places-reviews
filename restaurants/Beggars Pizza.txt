Beggars Pizza
Rating: 2
Text: This was our first visit to beggars. At first we weren't sure we were at the right place given how abandoned the front entrance looks. It's an old Theatre. That needs a lot of work. When we got there other people in our group were complaining about very slow service. It was pretty slow. We completely ran out of water at the table a couple times and had to ask for more. Service was our biggest issue, and it wasn't even crowded... My aunt didn't understand why it took so long to get a salad. I'm guessing more than 20 minutes, she definitely complained about that loudly...

Text: Very expensive for such low-quality pizza. I ordered 2 medium size pizzas with only two toppings and I paid $40.00. They took 30 minutes to prepare them. Once I picked them up they over cooked. The day before I had ordered the same at different pizza place and I paid less than $20 with a better product and service.

Text: One of my favorite pizza spots in Lansing. The only issue I have is, the veggie pizza isn't as good as the sausage pizza. I don't eat pork anymore so I ordered a veggie pizza and I was very disappointed. I know you can't compare veggies and meat but it was a huge difference. I'll rate their sausage pizza a 10 but the other pizza doesn't taste that good. This restaurant have great employees with great customer service skills.

Text: Great pizza..service was very good for our group of 12..were not set up for us even with reservations..but did put us in a small room because of noise and very busy..I would still recommend it on less busy days.
