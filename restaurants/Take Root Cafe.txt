Text: This place has the friendliest staff. The food is amazing, and they are vegetarian/vegan friendly. They have a suggested price system where you can help provide meals for people that cannot afford it. We need more places like this on the planet!

Text: What a beautiful place, inside and out! The staff were friendly, and the food was delicious. The wine braised chicken with roasted vegetables and brown rice was tender, flavorful and filling. The lavender crème brûlée was divine! You should definitely splurge on dessert. The building is lovely, with the cutest play area for kids.

Text: Great experience and they'll explain everything if it's your first time. We enjoyed the Cuban pork sandwich, and hummus & vegetables. Then we had to have a slice of the zucchini bread which was delicious!
