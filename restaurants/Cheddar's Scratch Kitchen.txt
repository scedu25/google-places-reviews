Text: 5 stars easy! Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta is all you need to know. If that doesn't make you want to go right now, the burgers will. Portions are more than you may be accustom to. Wait staff are always on their game. Drinks early dip below half before they get to you. And....now I want Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta.  ?

Text: Always great food & service . Would have given a 5 star but I asked for a jack & coke ..it was not jack . I ask the server & he said the bar tender had run out of jack. She went back & got the jack Daniels.  Made me mad that she sub another brand . The server made things right

Text: 9/26/17-I ordered potato wedges, they were burnt. I tasted them, they were horrible. I sent them back,  the waitress Leela returned and informed me the chef said, the wedges were not burnt, the skin was just dark. My stepfather's plate was portioned for a child.  I asked for the chef's name but Leela wouldn't say. I'm disappointed to say the least. On a previous outing to this place,  the wait "estimate" was off by half an hour. Our waitress was thorough but slow. The food was good once we got it but my order was incomplete because they were out and I  was not informed until the food was ready to come out. They did give me a substitute for free but it didn't come until i was ready to leave and then they kept getting the check wrong. I usually come in large parties, I won't suggest this place again.

Text: Especially enjoyed our last visit there as we got to eat outside on the new patio, which was much quieter than the inside. Large portions, fair prices, good food.

Text: I understand restaurants get busy. I went with a friend and noticed people that came in after me were getting seated. I went up and asked the 4 ladies what's going on. They had skipped us because they had two papers and to many working as a host. I guess I'll have to drive all the way to Westport rd.
