A&W And Long John Silver's
Rating: 3
Text: I've had other people tell me how much better A&W is than other fast food restaurants.  To each their own, but for my part, it was just like other fast food restaurants.  It's fine if that's what you want, but don't expect anything special.

Text: Average service. Wait time was moderate, but we ordered a good amount of food and from both sides of the restaurant, so that probably made their jobs a little bit more difficult. Solid burger, good fried fish.

Text: Yummy burgers! Baked fish was also very good. And of course, the best root beer.
