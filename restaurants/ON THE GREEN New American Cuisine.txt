Text: Clean, relaxing atmosphere. Friendly, efficient service. We had the hot spinach dip foran appetizer and it was very good. Could have used a few more chips. Then we had a pizza. Loved it! Great crust and just the right amount of toppings and cheese. We'll be back.

Text: It was the worst meal ever. The poor waitress thought I was going to spit it out. We had a party of 5 and if you didn't order pizza ...your food sucked.
