El Dos De Oros Mexican Restaurant

Text: This place is usually great. They have good food, the queso, specifically, is delicious. I would go just for chips and queso. One of the servers is very blunt and bland attitude wise, which is easy to interpret as rudeness. Most of the staff is very friendly though. A little cramped as far as seating goes. Salsa and chips are all-you-can-eat. I'd give this 3.5 stars leaning towards four just because the experience isn't consistent.

Text: Good, friendly service. Food on the overly greasy side, not quite quality and water tasted funny. Still, decent place worth a try.

Text: Good was great and the portions were HUGE.  Had the shrimp combination fajitas and it was literally more than I could eat.

Text: Good food must have great cooks. Except for service could do better, repeat orders and requests. Could be 5 stars
