Red Fox Store & Marina

Text: One of our favorite lake bars. They have quality burgers and chicken sandwiches. It's a small place and I'd suggest going before it gets busy on weekend nights because they don't always have enough staff. But the staff they have are very friendly and welcoming. Check it out!

Text: Normally this place would get 5 stars from me but whatever they did to the cheese sticks has ruined this appetizer for me. Would also help if there was no smoking inside. Besides that, this is a great place!

Text: Incredible hamburgers - if you like jalapenos, you have to get the Jalapeno Cheeseburger and add bacon!
