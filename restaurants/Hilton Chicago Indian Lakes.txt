Hilton Chicago Indian Lakes

Text: A very unique property that you will either love or hate. Rooms are not typical rectangular in shape so there are some interesting angles that make the space seem small in spots yet larger in others. The decor is a bit dated. Lobby carpet NEEDS replacing. There is a large atrium with a waterfall and bar plus plenty of room to relax all over the property. One south tower elevator was not in service and the hallways are narrow. Still a neat place to check out.

Text: This place was amazing!! It definitely had a 70's vibe but the lobby was the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen. They have fountains and real plants everywhere and it was my favorite part. My husband and I loved our room, everything was clean and in place! Room service was amazing also and we will definitely be coming back here.

Text: We spend our 6 year wedding anniversary  here. This was a pleasant stay. Clean and quiet the, building architecture is awesome. I love the octagon  shape, very different. Customer  service was want i would expect. For the resort to be as nice and elegant  as it is, i did see where some interior  improvement  could be enhanced. But over all i will recommend and come back again

Text: I stayed here for one night in a business trip and it was a nice hotel. The architecture and room layout were kind of weird but the rooms were big and I also liked the indoor pool and hot tub. I had the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was pretty good, nothing amazing but still good.

Text: Old dated room but you can get one very cheap on Hotwire. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. If you check it late, there is a bite one a walk to the overflow parking lot so keep that in mind. Rooms were very big with high ceilings and large bathrooms so it comfortable for multiple people to stay. There was also a desk and easy Chari with footrest in the space with plenty of room to spare.
