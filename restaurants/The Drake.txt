Text: For being on the upscale side. My salad dressing (Ranch) had what looked like a flipping public hair. The waitress asked me if I wanted an exchange, hmm yeah! Then waited over an hour for our food. No discount off the ticket for the pubic hair in my dressing. First time at the restaurant, and guaranteed last!!

Text: Great outdoor seating, live music, service and of course the food! Wide variety of drinks on draft. Meals that will fill anyone up.  Flavorful tender ribeye had a good seasoning.  Food ranges from pasta, to steak, and sandwiches.

Text: Food ordered was the special of the night. It wasn't real special. Asked for a medium rare prime rib and got very medium prime rib. Also meat was a bit tough. Not sure when I'll go back again.
