J. Alexander's Redlands Grill

Text: Almost no vegetarian options. I know this is the middle of nowhere in the suburbs, but it's 2017, come on. They actually get a lot of clientele from all the offices close by and should be catering to more diverse needs.

Text: Food was very delicious but it is more expensive then expected. Beer menu was a little lite, but if you love wine they had a great selection. Staff was courteous and service was prompt. I had a hard time choosing what to get with many options. Atmosphere is calm and relaxed, great for business meetings. Can't say on what they offer for families with kids but want to impress a client with good food this is the place.
