Joker's Wild Sporting Clays and Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: Have shot sporting clays here over a dozen times and the target combos get changed up about once a month. It's the cheapest in the area at $30 for 100 targets. The restaurant is also very satisfying. If it's a little out of your way and are trying to convince your lady friend to come with, there is now a winery 5 minutes away ;)
