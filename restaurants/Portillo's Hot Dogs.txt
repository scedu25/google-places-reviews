Portillo's Hot Dogs

Text: Combo sandwich was great! But onion rings smelled like old grease, kind of reminiscent of Long John Silvers. The tamale was just gross. The interior of it was like pureed dog food. The chocolate cake tasted like a Little Debbie cake. The frosting was yummy though. We were given free samples of a "meatball salad", which was a small container that held a small lettuce salad and one meatball. The meatball was great! The salad was really wet though and the dressing was not so good. And it was kind of weird eating them together out of the same bowl. So I don't know if a "meatball salad" is actually a real thing or if the staff in back was just trying to get rid of some stuff. ?

Text: Of Portillo's in have been to many of their locations. However at this particular location the girl at the register must not have wanted to work that day. Very rude rolling of the eyes. Food was great as usual! However Portillo's management should probably find a new phone girl to deal with the public. came in on a Monday afternoon at 2:05 p.m. not busy at all.
Not sure if I'll come back to this particular location

Text: Great atmosphere and look on both the inside and outside. I had the big beef sandwich with spicy peppers and it was delicious. Service was also really quick. Would love to go back and try more.

Text: Chocolate shake tastes like straight chocolate syrup. Cheese fries are average. Italian beef is alright.
