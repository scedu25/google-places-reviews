Stella's Kentucky Deli

Text: A cute spot with pretty good table service. They have a nice little covered patio for good weather. Their food is very hit and miss; sometimes it's really good and sometimes, well, it's a miss. Definitely not the place to go for poached eggs on an eggs benedict (ours came out basically soft boiled). But a nice spot for a quick meal if it's not too busy.

Text: A nice hidden gem in Lexington. They have a good menu and a friendly and cozy atmosphere. I got club sandwich and it was very tasty. Great place to go if  you are looking to try something new. It gets pretty busy around lunch time and they don't have a lot of seating so be prepared for a bit of a wait if the outside seating isn't open.

Text: All three of us were very satisfied with the taste and quality of the food we ordered; all burgers. The meat was done as requested and the cheese was fresh. The veggies were bright and delicious. Kind of pricey for the smaller portions but the food was excellent. The buns for the burgers could be a little larger in diameter just to fit everything in better! Overall, great experience! Will be back.

Text: Great local deli, sweet atmosphere, prompt service, and good food. Menu had a lot to choose from. I had the tomato bisque and lox bagel, my husband had the burger. A must visit on Jefferson Street! As a restaurant owner we think they do a great job!
