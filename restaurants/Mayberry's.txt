Text: Since the treasure-hunting car show we're going on they had a limited menu biscuits and a pulled pork sandwich plate wasn't much help there was short of waitresses we saw people walk out when they didn't get waited on and we saw a people leave when they only had choice of two of things food was good

Text: The food was great but sadly the service was terrible...waitress took forever to complete simple tasks such as grabbing sugar or fetching the bill. Ended up waiting for 20 minutes on a bill.
