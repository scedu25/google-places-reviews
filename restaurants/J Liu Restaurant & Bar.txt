Text: The staff here are so friendly!  The food quality is good, but, if you order to go, be prepared not to get the same dining-in experience! At $14.00 ($18.00 including tip) the "Jason's spicy chicken and broccoli"   should include more than 4 sprigs of Broccoli and a half cup of white rice!  Next time I will order to eat-in and take leftovers home!

Text: This is touted as an "upscale" eatery. I disagree. Granted, I didn't pick it myself, but attended a gathering. All in all it was okay. The buffet had a small variety? of foods, but it wasn't great quality. Service was substandard for an Applebee's and there was frustrating confusion from the wait staff regarding my check, culminating in the $108 check for my family to eat brunch. Same group at Logan's or Buca, eats better for less. Thinking I'll skip Liu's next time around.

Text: Very nice restaurant with an interesting menu. However, their rice dish was overpriced. It's a little too much to pay $12 for rice only
