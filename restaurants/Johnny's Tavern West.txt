Johnny's Tavern West

Text: I have been here multiple times, it’s very consistent and rarely disappoints. They have TVs everywhere showing multiple games which make it a great place to grab a bite to eat and watch a game. The food is good as well, I personally have gotten many of the different burgers on the menu and have enjoyed all of them. I also like the Street Tacos which are surprisingly good. Service is also great as I haven’t run into any problems with it. Overall a great place to watch games and enjoy some food.

Text: I always have good food and decent service at this location. Wednesday there is an amazing chicken plate special. You get an insane amount of food for 6 or 7 dollars.

Text: Service was terrible! Good came out cold.  It took 1 1/2 hours to get our food.  To refill our water we had to go to the bar.  When we were done eating I had to wave wildly to get our waitresses attention who was visiting with a co-worker.   There were only a handful of tables occupied.

Text: Always enjoy going here for bar and restaurant lunch or dinner with friends. Very good simple or full meal options; very good hamburgers.
