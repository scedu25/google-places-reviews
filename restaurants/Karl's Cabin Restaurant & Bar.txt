Karl's Cabin Restaurant & Bar

Text: We held our wedding reception for about 80 people in the banquet room at Karl's Cabin three weeks ago, and we have received so many compliments on the evening due to the wonderful service.  Phyllis and her staff did an outstanding job taking care of us for the evening.  She stored our decorations the day before which made setting up for the event so much easier and she was very accommodating during the setup.  The food was delicious and the waitstaff was very attentive but unobtrusive.  I hardly noticed they were there, but never lacked for anything, which I believe is the hallmark of great service.  I was concerned the location might be too small with a dance floor in the center, but in the end, we had plenty of space.  If the dance floor was tight, it didn't seem to stop anyone from having a good time!  I would say this is an ideal location for a small group such as ours.  It was very intimate and cozy location.  We couldn't be happier with the outcome.  Our many thanks, Phyllis!

Text: We had a group of 15 people at 12:30 for lunch. The staff was very accommodating and didn't mind individual checks. Gratuity was not automatically added to our checks. Our wait was a little long but they were busy and we had a large group that they wanted to serve all at once. I had the whitefish with asparagus. It was delicious. The person next to me had the planked salmon and she said it was perfect. Everyone remarked that their food was good, and they would be happy to come here again.

Text: We went to the place hoping to be seated outside. Was a perfect late summer evening and Labor day weekend. They have a great outdoor seating area but unfortunately there was no one seated there and the outdoor service was closed. What a shame?!?!?
Service was prompt and courteous. Food was good. Fresh warm bread was very nice. There was a wedding party (Saturday night) in a separate area by us with music. So it was rather loud and hard to maintain a conversation. I had the Lamb burger with Tzaziki sauce in it (mediocre) and fries (good)

Text: Great comfort food. One of the better rack of ribs in Ann Arbor. Frequently crowded but very helpful and polite wait staff. Haven't had any issues yet.

Text: Great place!  Nice atmosphere. I have been here 3 times now, and consistantly have had a wonderful experience. Food has been great--I've had the beef wellington, pan seared perch, shrimp and scallop angelina. But the service is the best part.  Ask for Gene, he's top notch. He even remembered my name upon my second visit! Warm,  friendly,  he had great suggestions, and was on the ball. I'm looking forward to my next dinner at Karl's Cabin!
