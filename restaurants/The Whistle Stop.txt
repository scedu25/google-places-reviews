Text: Went for Glendale Days so the wait to get in was long but the food came out quick and hot. It was delicious probably the best French Onion soup I ever had. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. We will be back at Christmas time if not before.

Text: I left my glasses on the table by mistake. When I called later that day, they had the missing item, dropped them in the mail right away and I had the glasses when I returned home to IL. The food is worth the wait and don't forget the pie!

Text: Food was delicious, but they were out of a few items we wanted. Slow service but worth the wait!
