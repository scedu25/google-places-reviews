Vintage Steak House

Text: Stuffed Catfish with Sweet Potato fries (including marshmallow dip) was tastefully presented and melted the taste buds. If you live close or just passing through, this restaurant is worth the stop. Our waitress Tiffany always checked on us and had a wonderful attitude toward her customers.

Text: This lunch visit, when I inquired about the waitress' personal preference, she recommended the Chicken Alfredo pasta. I took her word for it and was not disappointed in the slightest. The dish was well prepared and satisfying without bogging me down for the remainder of my day. During previous stops I have enjoyed the Cajun Shrimp pasta, Chicken and Sausage pasta, steak tacos, lobster bisque, ribeye steak, and the unparalleled TKO Burger  (with fries!). I have never had a meal that was not first rate. The service  (depending on time of day and personnel) has ranged from above average to outstanding. Definitely my first choice of the available local establishments.

Text: Unique dining experience, easy missed in a small town. I would put in my top 10 for the city of Independence. Excellent Family Restaurant, good prices wonderful food. I particularly like the sweet potato fries. They are a wonderful side to any  main dish.
