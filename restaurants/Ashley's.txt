Text: Phenomenal beer selection and good food to go with it. They also have pub quizzes on Thursday nights. I come here with friends, but I also like to hide out in their small booths to get some work done. One of my favorite spots in Ann Arbor.

Text: Amazing beer selection, and that's the main reason I will be returning. Food was decent too! But the beer selection is special. Also like the ambiance. Good spot to catch a game.

Text: Really good food, but they did not seem very welcoming of a few college students coming in. It's understandable because it's a bar but we had no intents of purchasing alcohol, we just came in for a quick bite. Our waiter seemed put-off and we just seemed really out of place, which seemed strange since Ann Arbor is a college town. Regardless, the service was fast and the food was good.

Text: One of the best selections of beers in town and they also have a great food and ample seating. Good for groups. They also have trivia.

Text: The beer selection here is outstanding and it rotates often... Though some of the craft beers can be a bit over priced compared to other establishments. We come here every year for the lobster feast... The price for the event is very reasonable and the lobster is fresh and delicious... I wish I cod say the same for the rest of the menu. The menu here is normal bar food at best with a much higher price. The fish and chips are nothing special and is a fairly average portion with overly greasy batter. The place is good for a drink or three, but not much else beyond special events
