Text: Not that there are many choices in this town but the burgers are all 1/2 pound and are seasoned to perfection! If I happened to be in the area again I would definitely go out of my way to stop here.

Text: We were in town to see the World's Largest Ball of Twine & asked where to eat.  Without hesitation, we were told to go to the Corner Bar & Grill.  We arrived with another family from another state that was doing the same as we were.  They had just closed for the afternoon break, but the did not hesitate to let both of our families in & served us with smiles & great conversation.  The food was great!  They even gave us postcards before we left.  

While we were eating, 4 little boys came in to get something to drink.  They teasingly referred to them as "Cawker City's version of Hell's Angels", as they were all on their bicycles.  They were very polite little boys, had their money out and ready to pay.  One of them told them he had no money & they gave him a drink anyway, told him to bring it when he had it. (I don't know if they were family or not.)

It was a very good experience & it's great to know that there are still places you can take your family & be given the best service & atmosphere in small town America.

When you go, be sure to check out the ceiling over the bar area & ask about it.  You get a good lesson!
