Text: My sushi roll was decent, not great.  My wife's tasted like the fish was aged and not in a good way.  At one point we were the only diners in the restaurant, never a good sign on a Saturday night.  We will not be back.

Text: Saturday family dinner night.  It took over close to 23 mins for my mix drinks.  My order was Pho, wanted to try their Thai version of Pho.  No good and way over price at 10.95 compared to House of Noodle in Schaumburg.   My sister in law got the wrong order.  She was nice by saying it was okay.  Server ask they need to take it back.  My sister in law are you really going to serve this order?  The server ask are we going to pay for it?   Really?   We was nice and offer to pay for it since she tasted it.   Not a good customer experience when we all was surprise by the server.
