Text: We were looking for a place to eat, and came across Maid-Rite. It wasn't what it was hyped up to be. I found that the Maid-Rite sandwich was not at all made right, it was just some bland, loose meat between two pieces of soggy bread. I couldn't even eat the whole thing and left there still hungry. On top of that, they don't even give free refills, or any kind of discount refills for that matter... you have to buy a whole new drink. Yet I must say, the gum wall was pretty cool.

Text: The gum wall is a must see if you're in the area or are looking for something unique to see. Their loose meat sandwiches are different compared to the classic hamburger but still very delicious. The lines can get long on the weekends but the wait typically isn't to hateful. Even on the busy days it's worth the wait.
