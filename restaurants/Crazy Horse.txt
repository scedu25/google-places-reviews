Text: This is a pretty good place to eat. The food was good but it didn't overly impress me. The service was good. Definitely worth trying but I can't see this being anyone's go-to.

Text: Really great food. Would recommend cheese stix or n.y. strip steak! Teriyaki dinner special was delicious if available

Text: Good food, but poor service, and they added at least one extra drink onto my bill. I wouldn't go again... numerous better spots in Bloomington.

Text: Grest staff and the food is pretty good. Nice selection. Of beers on tap and a full bar.
