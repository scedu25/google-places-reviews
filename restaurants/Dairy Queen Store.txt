Text: Decent service, nice folks.  Gets busier at odd hours, and things get forgotten.  They always do right for it, though.

Text: I gave them a $20 bill. She insisted I gave her a 10. Could not prove it. So I got overcharged by $10. Then they do not have to participate in the blizzard promotion where they to turn it over. So they do not have to abides by Dairy Queen rules. Poor service. Will not ever go here again. Ruined me on Dairy Queen.

Text: Terrible. Just plain terrible. First, my dilly bar was crushed, which is on par with some of the worst human tragedies in recorded history. Second, I was told to order, ignored as the workers argued amongst each other, and then ignored for another 5 minutes as they hurriedly did everything else other than serve me. No big, though. Then, I ordered, and they quickly rushed me through my order so as to not deal with me. I ORDERED TWO DILLY BARS. HOW IS THAT AN INCONVENIENCE? Also, the girls were dirty, and looked like they had been through WW3. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST WORKERS SUFFERING WITH PTSD? Did I mention how mean they were to each other? It is one thing to ignore me; I am used to that, but while you work, your fellow employees are all you have. I swear, one girl hid behind the ice cream machines like she had seen unspeakable atrocities. Long story short: My dilly bar was crushed, and this store is terrible.

Text: Specified 2 different times I wanted a bacon cheeseburger and still got just a cheeseburger, seemed like staff didn't care. Also heard a lady griping because drive thru was packing in, she was cussing and really shouldn't be working in fast food...
