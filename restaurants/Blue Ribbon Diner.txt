Blue Ribbon Diner

Text: The service was friendly & personal. Presentation was very good, everything looked great. It all had its own flavor, not that cookie-cutter blah one often gets at a "truck-stop" location. And do not let it location deceive, which is a very convenient easy-in easy-out locale. That is just a bonus. All was excellent. From the homemade soups, par excel lance, to the desserts which are to die for, do not overlook this "diner".  The Blue Ribbon is worlds apart from any of the previous ownerships attempts. Although a small, local restaurant, the hands-on ownership is both highly-experienced and knowledgeable. Not to be missed.

Text: Taylor was just great. To be young she had old school waitress qualities.
I asked what was good she said everything. I ended up getting the special. Ribs and Shrimp. With corn mash potatoes a real Greek salad and garlic bread. Tea was fresh and food was Excellent. I got the coconut  cake for dessert. Delicious. Thanks to Taylor's great service and the EXCELLENT food. I recommend and will be back.

Text: We weren't expecting much from the name and location other than typical diner food.  This place truly earned the name Blue Ribbon Diner!  All six of us left wishing it were closer to our home so we could go again.  Homemade soup, real hand breaded mushrooms, a chicken sandwich that still has my mouth watering to name a few.  We didn't get a chance to try the desserts but they looked delicious as well.

Text: We were traveling on the Ohio turnpike and was looking for a place to eat not too far off the route. This was our choice and we were not disappointed. The cute diner was clean, everyone was friendly and welcoming. The food was hot, plenty of it and wasn't pricey. We will definitely make this a stop when we are traveling to Chicago from Fremont and back.
