The Harem

Text: I thought the place was fantastic.  There were a lot of girls there and they had a wide range from young tiny spinners to older bbw and everything in between.  There was something for everyone.  The only negative I have is that the lap dance area isn't the best.  The expensive rooms looked great though but if I wanted to drop that much cash, it wouldn't be at a strip club.

Text: I have been to lots of clubs all over the country and Harem is one of my favorites. The atmosphere is laid back, the girls are awesome, and the new management has been really improving the place. Totally recommend a visit!

Text: Went to this establishment TWICE, to work. I and my beautiful friend were turned away from the club because we were black, though that didn't seem to be an issue as far the club patrons. There were plenty of customers interested in us, black and white, but the manager didn't even have the good grace to come speak with us. We later found out, after being hired at another, MUCH NICER establishment, that the management is definitely racist as hell, they don't care about the entertainers, and there's some apparent shadiness between them and the city, since they have been investigated for human trafficking. If you're looking for a respectful environment to enjoy classy entertainment, this isn't the place. The only nice person was the door girl, sadly.
