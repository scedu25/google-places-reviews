Text: Came here to grab dinner on my son's birthday. The new environment is lovely and staff is fantastic. It can take some time to get the food to the table but the wait is so worth it!

Text: This is hands down the best Indian food in town! The owners are super friendly and very welcoming. The food is authentic and spiced by preference. Also the most vegetarian friendly restaurant in town with many vegan options.

Text: Worst restaurant in Ames. Never had worse Indian food ever. Tasted more like bad Chinese food. Tandoori chicken was sour and spicy in gravy! White rice was not even cooked right. Biriyani was a rice mixed in chicken curry. Bad service. Would have given 0 star if possible.

Text: I liked the renovation and their service was very friendly. I tried the tandoori chicken and the chicken vindaloo. The tandoori chicken was very different from the tandoori you get in India, it tasted more like plain grilled chicken. The chicken was well cooked but did not have the aroma of a tandoor nor the taste of tandoori masala. It was served with jeera rice which I felt is unusual because the chicken had no gravy. . The chicken vindaloo tasted fine but had a few tiny pieces of chicken floating in the gravy. The price to quantity ratio is high (according to me).
