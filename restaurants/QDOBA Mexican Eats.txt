Text: I love mexacin food! If you have a child under 13 you can get a very cheap kids meal. Not to mention how all the staff I have met are helpful and seem like they enjoy there job.

Text: It's five star because it's like McSaddness. It's the same, you know what you're walking in, and you know like Taco Hell - you'll eventually be in the bathroom preying your butthole away!

Text: Usually had good experiences here until today (5-3-17 about 645pm)when a coworker grabbed a steak burrito to go. The meat was RAW...not undercooked....RAW with some kind of white sour cream smelling slime. Two bites and pitched it.  I would take it back up there but it closes before my shift ends.

Thanks for the memories Q...it's been fun. I'll take my chances with Chipotle from now on.
