Text: Amazing food. Amazing drinks. Really the only draw back for me which can be good for you, but they are very fancy. The waiters just do their job and the portions on some food is small but hey if you're into that have at it, it's amazing

Text: If you want the above normal steak and atmosphere this is the place. Great for special occasions. Good wine list but expensive. Everything is pricey. Servers are very pleasant and will help with questions. Sides are ok. You have to order separately. Steaks are large. I go once a year for my husband's birthday.

Text: Amazing! The best steak I've ever had. They brought out the cuts of meat and explained which preparation goes best with each. Also had the seafood tower- the best crab legs!! I've had crab straight out of the ocean and this was somehow better! They had the biggest shrimp I've ever seen and they were amazing. Tried oysters and loved the different sauces they have to put on them. The filet mignon with their special seasoned butter was so tender and delicious and the portabella mushrooms were the best I'd ever had! We ended the evening with creme brulee which was indescribably good! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and foresaw our needs. This is a very nice restaurant and is very costly, but worth it. Overall, the best experience! Loved it!!

Text: The steaks are amazing but the other food is just ok.  Some sides are larger and worth the money while some of them are not. You really have to watch what you're getting versus what you're paying in order to see a real benefit. I think this is one of the restaurants that I will frequent sparingly.
