Text: AN  AMAZING FIND  when traveling through the area. The WILD MUSHROOM entree with GLUTEN FREE  pasta was SUPERB. The flavors of the sauce was exceptional. It was enough for two meals. They also served GRASS FED  beef, WILD SALMON, and ORGANIC butter. Great chief and very attentive wait staff. LOVED THIS PLACE. Had dinner at 3pm with lunch prices until 4pm. Pricey but we'll worth it for QUALITY food.

Text: Husband picked this place for a date night. Despite not have a reservation we were stilled seated. Very cozy relaxing atmosphere. Everyone was so kind and attentive, the hostest turned on a heater because I was so cold. A+ in my book... Dinner was the best I've had in a while. Our server explained all the special entrees precise and perfect. Everything sound so good, I dont think you can go wrong with anything. The portions are large enough to take some home. Dessert was the best. We both love this place and plan on returning the next time we visit Battle Creek.

Text: WAY over rated not to mention over priced.  Went there on weekday afternoon for lunch. We wanted to order from the lunch special board but were told we had missed that. We ended up ordering off the menu. We each ordered a noodle dish, which left a bad aftertaste. The bread tasted like some resemblance of a pumpkin flavor. We each ordered water. Our bill for this was around $50 not including a tip.  Needless to say I have no appetite left for this place. I only gave it 2 states becsuse our server was really nice.
