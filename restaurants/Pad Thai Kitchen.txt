Pad Thai Kitchen
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best actual restaurants in Farmington, which seems to have established itself as the exit with all the chain and fast food restaurants.  Located in an old house, Pad Thai is extremely understated. The decor is minimally Thai-themed.  Most pictures are of entrees that you can order, presumably.  It's a quiet place, great for eating and conversation.  The food is authentic.  Portion sizes are filling, but not large like many other places and the prices are reasonable-to-more expensive than other Thai restaurants I've been to regionally.  I never have to take home food. Used to have lunch menu with different prices, although I couldn't tell any difference in portion size, but I believe they've done away with that and have only full entrees now.  I regularly order the spring rolls and Pad Thai. The spring rolls could use a side of jalapenos. Have also ordered their curries ( mild and delicious), dumplings (yum), and a few noodle dishes. Their garlic chili sauce is exceptional.  You can order according to your preference of heat on a scale of 1-10, but even requesting "Thai hot" will get you a dish that would only rank about a 4 in Chicago. I always have to dose it in chili sauce!  The staff is very nice and service is always quick and friendly and accurate.  I'd say I eat here on average once to three times a month and given that it's pricier than most other options in town, that's high praise. Highly recommend.

Text: I have eaten here four or five times, and the food has always been tasty and hot. The staff is pleasant and accommodating for picky requests from children. The only drawback is finding a place to park if they are busy.

Text: The picture to the right is their Shu Mai. My all time favorite appetizer. This is the best Thai I've had, and I've had Plenty across the US as an OTR Truck Driver.
