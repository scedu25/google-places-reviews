Long John Silver's A & W

Text: My husband & myself stopped by on 8/3/17 at 2:20 PM in the afternoon. We ordered our food. It took 30 minutes to get our food. The flies were terrible from the time we set our foot in the door until we left. There were several people that ordered after us and had to wait about 10 minutes for their food. There was no ketchup (not even in packets). I went to the manager on duty and brought it to her attention we had been waiting for at least 20 minutes for our food. The employees were standing around on their cell phones. Just a horrible experience. We will not be going back there ever! HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, AWFUL service from the beginning to the end. I said to my husband we are never coming back here. We will drive else to find one.

Text: No ice in the soda machine, and when staff was told we were ignored.  Couldn't get anyone attention at the counter to get to go boxes and you had to be very careful walking as the floor was so slick.

Text: We weren't even aware an A&W was around here so were extremely excited. They were out of ice cream for floats. Not even an apology. Stayed because we had already ordered food, which was ridiculously expensive by the way, but we didn't want to be rude. Food was absolutely awful. I'm disgusted. Will never be returning.
