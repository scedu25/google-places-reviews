Text:  I went for a financial awareness presentation. I have been to other presentations and the food was barely edible. The service was passable, the presentation was long and boring.  However, the presenter spent the right amount of time on the presentation. The service was excellent! The food was extremely Good! I have never been to Larkspur Bistro & Bar before. However, I will be going back to try more of the menu.?

Text: Just raves. Great food. Great service. Atmosphere is very nice but not stuffy. Prices are pretty good in my opinion, given the quality of food and menu options.
