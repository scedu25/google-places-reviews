Text: Poor service. Took to long to get order and they were not busy. Party of 4 and each one ordered appetizers so it wasn't like it was a complicated order. Wings were very dry. Crab Rangoon was only thing that was good. Dipping sauce for onion rings was good too.

Text: Mediocre food and on the night we went had terrible service. Waiter forgot to enter in one of the orders and didn't arrive at the table until an hour & 40 minutes after we arrived. Another entree was supposed to come with cottage cheese, they ran out and said they'd substitute fries and they never brought them. None of the food was worth going back for except the Signature Bread Loaf which was great. I would go back as a place just to drink beer. It was ice cold and served quickly.

Text: I went by myself passing thru town. I was greeted by friendly staff and helped immediately. I ordered a drink on draft and an 8oz filet with salad and baked potato. The filet was seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The salad bowls are odd but the salad was good. I enjoyed my dinner and will try to pass thru again.
