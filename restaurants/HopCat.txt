Text: Insane selection of beer! Over 100 on  tap.  It takes longer to decide what your going to drink than what your eating.  Easy parking with parking garage right around the corner.  Fun and happy atmosphere with many T.V.s for watching games.  Beer is always on a seasonal rotation featuring mostly all Michigan breweries.  Everything on the menu is really good especially the crack fries.  Once you start you can't stop!

Text: Very good collection of beers! The staff is also knowledgeable. They also have many rotating taps to keep things interesting.  The food is awesome! My favorites are crack fries (plain or loaded) and burgers! But most things on the menu are good. The restaurant architecture and decore are decent.

Text: The food's pretty good! Can't comment on the alcohol, as I don't drink, but friends say they have a good selection. The art is kind of... weird... but the overall atmosphere is great. It's a fun place. Noisy, but fun.

Also, they have a dish called Vladimir Poutine. How could it get better??

Text: The service was outstanding the beer menu was off the charts if you're looking for a great Tap House you found it. The food was a little bit better than okay everything was good except for the amount of salt they put in their Foods. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but I'm not disappointed that I stopped.

Text: We were told that there was a 20 to 30 minute wait.  There were empty tables inside and outside. We waited for 10 minutes, no one was seated at any of the empty tables.  We left and went to another  restaurant nearby
   We were seated instantly and had a lovely time.
