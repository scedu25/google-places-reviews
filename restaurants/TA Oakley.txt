Text: If you're getting an advance or any extras on your fuel ticket, don't fuel here. Cashier's will give out your money to other drivers cause they do not verify truck number. So if another driver tells them your pump number kiss your money goodbye.

Text: Crowded on this Sunday afternoon. Had to wait a few minutes to get to a gas pump with my truck and fifth wheel. Large lot. Good food.

Text: Bought 450 dollars of diesel and they made me pay for my pop. Every other truck stop gives you a pop when you buy fuel but not these guys and they are rude. Also avoid the cafe inside.
