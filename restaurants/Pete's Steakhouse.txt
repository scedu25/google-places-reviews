Text: Beautiful staff! Amazing family! The menu has something for everyone as well as some great Greek dishes! I personally recommend the Lasagna or My Big Fat Greek Burger!! The seating is great for a date or a large family get together; they also serve a DELICIOUS home cooked buffet! ??????

Text: Good food, Good service, fresh iced tea in a clean friendly space can't ask for more!
Interesting might even say eclectic range of food choices, Greek pastas/salads, Stakes, standard American dinner grub, and pizza. The staff were all very friendly. The food was good home style at a good price. The place was very clean and the free WiFi was useful.
