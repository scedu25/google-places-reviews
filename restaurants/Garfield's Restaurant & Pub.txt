Text: Even though they don't have every little thing that you might want, the service is amazing, the waitresses that work here are so helpful and give you anything you ask for if they have it! If you have certain allergies or dietary requirements, they will help you find something you can eat here. Plus there's like 10 flat-screen tv's with a different channel on each of them, and majority of tables are booths or spaced far enough to be comfortable.

Text: The cook must have called off, the food was bad. The burger was boiled meat, no dear or seasoning. Salad old. Mashed potatoes, mix and water only.

Text: Just ok..reasonably priced basic selections...beer was very  cold. Barstaff was occupied and not world class but not rude or ignorant either. Menu could use some work and it .looks like their trying with the addition of slot machines ..strawberry fried cheesecake dessert was very good. I was passing thru and don't see myself making a special point to visit again..
