Text: Good BBQ is back in Pratt! After a few weeks of waiting for this restaurant to open that day has finally arrived! Very neat looking place with a down south western feel! The staff was very friendly and Scott came introduce himself to everyone and asked if we were enjoying our meals. The portions could've been a little more but you definitely would leave satisfied and not stuffed! The ribs are a must try! I recommend others to try this BBQ joint out!
