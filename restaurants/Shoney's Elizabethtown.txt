Text: I absolutely love eating here the staff is great especially Mo. She will definitely take care of you. Been eating here every week for over a year . Always a great selection on the bar and an ever rotating menu to keep it fresh. All food is fresh hot and delicious. If your looking for a restaurant to eat at skip the rest and go for the best. And remember to ask for Mo.

Text: Service was excellent! Our server was very attentive and our drinks were never empty. A very important quality in my book. My wife and I both had the breakfast bar. It was well stocked and relatively fresh though the bacon was like crisp cardboard. A little over done. Restrooms were spotless, and staff was actively cleaning. Hostess was cleaning each horizontal window blind by hand. All in all all a great place to eat

Text: Very under staffed.  Our waitress was young and inexperienced. We sat for 15 minutes before she even came to our table for the first time. She appeared over whelmed even though she only had a couple tables.  
There were 3 of us and we all got a Classic Shoneys burger for the special anniversary price of .70 cents each (fries and onion rings were regular price)  They did have a full buffet that appeared to have many choices and was well attended to. 
The food was good but if you are in a hurry, go else where.

Text: Excellent service, up-to-date and very clean. Great selection on the all-you-can-eat buffett. I wish this restaurant was still in business in central Indiana.  It's much better than Golden Corral.

Text: Always good food and great service! 
Stephen Peters, owner of Peters Electric Inc, takes his employees there for breakfast from time to time, so I have many opportunities to find problems and still have yet to identify any.
Thank you Shoney's!!!
