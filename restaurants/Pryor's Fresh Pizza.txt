Pryor's Fresh Pizza
Rating: 2
Text: I enjoyed the thin crispy-crusted pizza and that was the only thing pleasant about dining here. They brought the hot pizza pan to the table with no serving spatula; sodas are in cans, there are no fountain drinks; the area where they make the pizza is cluttered and looks like someone's home; the 2 people working didn't seem interested in being there or helping us.  Maybe this is a place for regulars because I don't understand the draw. We won't be back unless we're ordering a pizza to go.

Text: I have been going to Pryors for so many years...., I've lost count.  Doyle was a family friend and we love Martha.  As always the pizza is great. This is one of those places you find when you ask the "locals". ?
