Maximus Restaurant & Sports Bar

Text: Nice selection of pool tables, and a lot of t.v.s to watch different sports.  Good bar food and good service. Waitresses are friendly and check up often enough. I like the leather couches by the pool tables. Lot of tables to pick from for you and your crew to chill.

Text: Service is horrible. If you can get a server to come out from behind the bar to your table you better order everything you want for your entire duration right away, you may not get another chance unless you walk up to the bar and interrupt them. Food is decent. Owners are great people and are the only reason we go back.
