Text: The buffet is the best way to go. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The location is convenient and they have plenty of parking. The prices are great and the dining room is large. It has an old country kitchen vibe. The foods like a southern grandma's kitchen with everything from pie to anything you could want.

Text: What a fantastic place to eat with your family. We were traveling back to Michigan and our motel suggested it. The food was great and our waitress was so kind. On our trip back to Ga for Christmas this will be our stop. Thank you Olde Dutch for a delicious buffet meal - Angela & Steve

Text: The workers are friendly. The food isn't bad but nothing I'd want to try again. The greenbeans are straight from a can. The grilled chicken moist but no flavor. The rolls though was the best item I had. I could eat them all day. The salad bar has whole pies sitting out for anyone to touch. To me that was a disgusting. Not knowing if they washed their hands after going to the bathroom. This would cause cross contamination and make the next person very sick.

Text: We've been through the area quite a few times but didn't stopped here until the latest.  What a pleasant surprise!  The buffet is excellent, lots of variety and tasty. Be sure to reserve room for dessert. These ARE your grandma's homemade pies! Yum!
