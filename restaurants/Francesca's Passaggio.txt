Francesca's Passaggio

Text: The food was ok, the service not so good.
They brought us the main course 2 minutes right the soup, which, of course we were still eating. The pasta sat there for 5 whole minutes and it was cold by the time we start eating it.
And of course, the soup bowls were still there when we had dessert. Nobody clean the table.
Everything will be acceptable if we are at a dinner, but since they charge as a fine dinning restaurant, I expect fine dinning service.

Text: Marvelous selection of breakfast items. Servings are plentiful & sumptuous! They also have a bar that puts out a large Bloody Mary. Each food item is unique and some even have a story; like the forever fries.
