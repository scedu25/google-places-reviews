Text: What a menu! Fantastc food, clean dinning room, large portions. Superb selections for the "meat and potatoes" folks as well as those who want something a bit unique. Authentic and fun. We really were surprised. Recommended.

Text: Not good...waiter messed up entire order and was super slow and it wasn't busy at all. Food was sent back and bread for burger was hard as rock. Iced tea was sent back as it was not tea and tasted nothign like it. NOt a good experience at all and food wasn't good. Will not be returning.
