Text: Delicious! Don't judge a book by its cover. Hole-in-the-wall sushi joint in a remodeled fast food drive-thru building. Reasonably priced rolls with a HUGE menu and well-taken pictures in the menu.

About after returning to this resturaunt. This is a very accommodating restaurant,  the staff if amazing a kind. They have gone above and beyond to show us kindness and respect.

Text: A delight. Reasonable lunch specials that are filling and delicious. My one small request may be just a smidge more wasabi  and ginger.
