Text: A friend took me here. Its a great place. Has a nice sports bar atmosphere. The girls Ares dressed cute, but not slutt lime some if the places. So, you could take your family if you wanted. 
They have a appetizer called pepperoni bread sticks, which is amazing, but has probably caused a few heart attacks. 
I had the Brisket Dip, which was amazing. Make sure to get the tots. They will give you a pile no man or woman should eat.

Text: This bar is a staple in downtown. Mostly a college crowd but still fun.  It's huge, has a ton of tv's, and one of the best shot and long Island menus I've seen. Get the breadsticks! So good. And I love that they are open late and so is the kitchen. This is an anomaly in Indianapolis.

Text: Nice place. Food was tasty. Wait staff was young. Plenty of different types of seating for groups, high tables, booths. A lot of big screen TV’s to watch your favorite sports.

Text: Went in just to watch a football game.  Order a top shelf drink for a friend.  Then asked if I they wanted another, I said yes.  Bartender (guy with glasses) thought I wasn't looking, and saw he poured well.  He then corrected, guy next to me said "I will take that" and bartender gave his mistake to another guest.  hmmmm
so, of course, I was charged the premium for both my friends drinks.  I asked about that, and he said he did it right the first time.  Friend said definite  taste difference.
Also, not busy, staff stands around with arms crossed talking in back with each other.  Took several attempts to get bartenders attention to order food.  
Lot more sports bars in dt Indianapolis to choose from
