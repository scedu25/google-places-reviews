Julianna's Restaurant

Text: My daughter and I stopped in for a brunch on our day off last week from work. What a lovely place to get some good home cooking. I had breakfast and was glad to hear I could get a smaller portion. My daughter had lunch and her roast beef sandwich was really good.  Definitely recommend.

Text: Good food, great prices, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  Breakfast special (2 eggs, toast and coffee for $2.25) may be the best deal in Kalamazoo.  Don't forget to tip the wait staff, they're awesome!

Text: 1. I was impressed when my grilled sandwich arrived quickly and was crispy on both sides.  In my experience many restaurants place grilled sandwiches a cold plate causing condensation that makes the sandwich soggy on one side.   Way to go Julianna's you cracked the code!
2. THE COKE IS SO FIZZY!!
3.  I highly recommend the Julianns's breakfast casserole.  You won't be sorry.
