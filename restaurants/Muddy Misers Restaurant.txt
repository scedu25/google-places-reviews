Text: Very neat place overlooking the river and decor. Fish and chips were wonderful.  Ribs were tender melt in your mouth and smokey. Bbq sauce was very good, tangy not spicy and over powering.

Text: Great location, friendly and fast service, EXCEPTIONAL food! Unexpected food choices for a small town. Grilled walleye on a really fresh bed of mixed greens - $17. A burger with pulled pork (fabulous sauce - and I don't like BBQ) with bacon - AMAZING!  Yum

Text: Great atmosphere and amazing food. I expected higher prices with the description of the food on the menu... and that was before I saw the servings (huge!).  The food was incredible, the service was very good and we will definitely be back!  Highly recommended!
