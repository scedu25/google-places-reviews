Text: Me and my family used to eat there all the time years back, and it was great food! People were always kind and very friendly. Now all of a sudden we go in and the woman at the front scoffs at us. What the heck?!?! Then we get our food. I ordered the orange chicken, and the chicken was undercooked. I had stomach issues for the next few hours. I also found a hair in my rice and the inside of the establishment was very messy.
