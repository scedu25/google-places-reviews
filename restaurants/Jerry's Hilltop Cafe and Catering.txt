Text: not very clean. brought me silverware, when I un-rolled the napkin to get knife out, it had food on it ; and not just a little , but a lot. Even though my steak was cooked MED-RARE, it was very tough and chewy. Staff was friendly and nice. won't be eating there again. Its worth the extra 20 mins SOUTH on 81 to go to NORFOLK to eat.
