Text: don't be surprised if you get a stupid look for ordering a jamison and ginger ale.   They will actually put bitters in it because they think you wanted a Manhattan.   Then they will say they have homemade ginger ale that is responsible for the odd taste.   Sometimes I wish i was as ignorant as one of the young females working.   Life would be so much easier.

Text: Service was fairly prompt and very courteous. I had the bison burger which was very good although the lettuce that came with it was wilted. My friend had a pizza which looked very good and smelled terrific!

Text: Good neighborhood burgers & more place. Lots more choices on the lunch and dinner menu than burgers. Their pizza is very good here too, and there's a fried chicken dinner that's really good.
