Avenue Subs
Rating: 5
Text: Ordered the big Avenue- it's an open-face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes within the sub. Mashed potatoes and gravy at a sub shop?!? Genius! It probably weighed 4 pounds! Devoured half at lunch and about to heat up the rest for dinner now. Nom, nom, nom!

Text: COKE products people!  Pepsi, really??  Next time I stop by I will upgrade and get double meat maybe, thought the portions were light for my standards.  But I'm sure they are very, VERY fair.  Seemed like a popular place.  It was recommended to me and I'll go back.  Huge menu, lots of options.  Staff inside restaurant was not allowed to accept tips and that bothered me actually.  They deserved it!  I like it a lot.   Subway sucks, and Jimmy John's here in Muscatine doesn't please me either, so this is my sandwich shop!!
