Text: I visited Maki of Japan inside Castleton Square Mall, on April 12, 2017, at 3:54pm. The food is awesome, but check your receipt before leaving! The tax says .7%, but the amount doesn't add up! I was charged more! Also, a customer in front of me purchased 12 Chicken Teriyaki Dinner's, with extra meat. The total was $95. I purchased one of the exact same thing, and was charged more for my single dinner item! I guess my purchase wasn't large enough!!! :(

Text: The food is good. My husband and I like it. However, there's a woman with a thick accent that can get rude if you don't understand what she says. She needs to improve her attitude. Otherwise, we're not coming back.

Text: Good enough for mall food. Nothing great but can be a good choice for something different while at the mall.
