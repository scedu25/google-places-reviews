Text: Discovered this gem while visiting the Flea Market and other shops around town. Been back 4 times. Only draw back they put onions on my liver and bacon. All other entrees delicious. Service good even though busy.

Text: I'm only giving 4 stars because my son dropped his tablet behind one of the booths and despite me and my husband's efforts to get in contact with someone about getting it back they failed to help us at all. The food is great and the service is awesome, that's why we keep coming back.

Text: Excellent food.  I love the Portabella mushroom grilled chicken salad.  Good service as well.
