Bluegrass Pizza & Pub

Text: Came early on a weekday, so it wasn't terribly busy.  Service was fast and friendly.  Pizza was very good, but perhaps a little light on the sauce and toppings.  Nice atmosphere. Loved the Bob Marley playing in the background while I was there.  Prices seem reasonable and there are daily specials.

Text: This was my first here. Got seated and it took 15 minutes to get our drink order. The waiter come and asked if we were ready. We chose to create our own pizza. After a 20 minute wait, the waiter come back and stated that they didnt have one of the ingredients. 
I asked for the check and left. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Text: Not bad, great food, service could use some smiles and better attitudes.  But overall great place to go hang out and eat great food.  Hats off to the owners.

Text: A hit with the locals. College-vibe fast food. Craft beers. It's a mom & pop escape from the chains, but food was nothing special.
