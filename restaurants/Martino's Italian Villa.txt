Martino's Italian Villa

Text: Truck stop quality restaurant with stained walls and cracked vinyl seats.  You can tell they used to be good at one time and now the positive reviews are from people with starry eyed memories.  The pasta and sauce is still homemade and fresh so stick with spaghetti but avoid everything else on the menu.  Sandwiches, salads, appetizers are really just bad.  I didn't try the pizza so that maybe a good alternative for an expensive carryout.  Prices are really steep given the quality.   Figure on $15 to $20 for a dinner with drinks served in red plastic cups.

These are homemade recipes from a true Italian family. This is a family owned and run business. Friendly staff. 
We like to support local businesses

Text: The food here is authentically homemade and amazing! It is great to come with family or just as a couple. Also it is ok to eat here alone. Family owned right here in town. Great place for kids. The staff is always very friendly and if you become a regular don't be surprised to be called by name!!

Text: Grew up eating this pizza.  Growing up was a good time.  Nicest family operated Italian restaurant you'll ever find.

Text: The best food I have found in the whole state of Indiana! Been eating there for over 30 years and will continue to do so. I've never had a bad experience there and I visit several times a year and order carry out even more than that. Keep up the great job, I love you guys.
