Summit

Text: Went here for drinks and the bartenders put other people's drinks on my tab; and they knew I was just drinking beer. I had 2 total drinks for the night. If I could give a negative score, I would. Also, it's an underage nightmare. Summit? More like scummit.

Text: The food took forever and it wasn't that great. My food was practically cold. We had a decent waitress though. We only stopped in because we bought a Groupon for the place, but I don't think I will do that again. Plus that have a ridiculous dress code for a sports bar that seems pretty targeting to a certain demographic of people.

Text: Customer service failure, multiplied! First, we were first-time customers trying to use a promotion (the place is usually completely dead, so I can see why they want new customers). The restaurant basically is open for lunch and happy hour, and that's it. But, they've started being open later this week, so viola! We knew we were going to be driving 25 miles and arriving near the end of when you could order food, so I even called ahead to make sure what the ordering deadline was and told the manager we were driving a long ways to get there. We got there when I said we would, only to have the same manager tell me that they were "out of everything," and we couldn't order anymore. Do you think they offered anything for their screwup and our 50 mile round-trip for nothing? Nope. I even had to cajole them to extend the promotion we didn't get. They failed to own up for the manager's mistake when I called, specifically to make sure we're be able to order. I guess it is no secret why the place is always empty. The customer service ethos is completely lacking from the top down and I'm sure that extends to the service and food.

Text: The most undergraduate of undergraduate bars.  Seems to have a more Chicago-heavy clientele.  Purports to be a Blackhawks bar, but will turn off the game sound in favor of bad club music at the first inkling of a weekend dance crowd.  When upstairs is open it's an above average venue for dancing, but I have yet to figure out when or why they decide to open this area up.

Text: Extremely disrespectful staff, especially the owner Brad. Brad is a small man on a power trip. He feels the need to belittle women and ended up placing his hands on me. He pushed and shoved me out of the bar when I was already willingly walking out. I was poorly mistreated all because of their mistake of their disorganization behind the bar. I was told they did not have my card when I went to go close my tab. I became frustrated and verbally expressed how upset I was that they lost my card. They proceeded to kick me out, that is when Brad placed his hands on me. The next day I called to double check on my card and what do you know.. They had it the whole time! Instead of just giving my card back when I went to pick it up, Brad continued to humiliate me and raise his voice. Beware if you ever go into summit, as they cannot be trusted. Prime example: Brad.
