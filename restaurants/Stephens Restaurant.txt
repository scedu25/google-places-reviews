Text: We had chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak, both were good and the service was welcoming.  Mashed potatoes (real, not boxed) and baked potato were good, corn was the only thing holding it back, straight from the can.  Definitely a good meal in the middle of a desolate are.

Text: Chili was great and server was great, that's all. Buddy and I ordered ribeyes. 10 minutes after order they said they only had one for the day. I switched to NY steak. Both were over cooked and burnt on one side. Neither of us could finish them. Neither bake potato was warm enough to melt the butter. I guess we should have stuck with simple food such as burger and fries.

Text: This restaurant had the distinction of being exactly half way between my son in Colorado Springs and me in Russell Kansas. We met there for lunch. The people were friendly and the food was good. Not usually a "destination" restaurant, but I've got no complaints.

Text: Cook does NOT understand rare for meat. Chili and baked potatoes were good.
