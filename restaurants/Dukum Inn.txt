Text: Stopped for appetizers and a beer in lieu of lunch, is a sports bar in old downtown building. Lots of draft beer choices and good food. Combo platter included wings and onion rings. Wings had a dry rub and the rings were big sweet onions with light batter, both delicious. Popular spot that afternoon and not sure they had full staff but the bartender/server was on the hustle and took care of us promptly.

Text: The food here was great! I had a double helping of the fried mushrooms, and the fry bread taco. Everything, and everyone, was fantastic. All of the bartenders stopped by to talk to me as well, not just the one that got my drink and took my food order.
