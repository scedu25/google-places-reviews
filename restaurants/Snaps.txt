Text: Excellent service.  Food was good and portions were big.  The beer cheese and pretzels were excellent.  Would definitely return if we are ever this way again.  Dining area was clean and the food was a good value for the money.

Text: Snaps is an amazing local restaurant.  They have an excellent ambience, and selection of craft beers. I have been multiple times with a large family group.  We came at 4 ish both times, and they accommodated us perfectly with a large side room.  The appetizers are all delicious esp the fried pickles and beer cheese. This restaurant is perfect for couples as well as large groups, and they have a full bar.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  The Flight is a perfect way to sample their large selection of beers, with six smallish glasses of beer per flight.  Snaps is always a must for us when we are in this area, and our extended family goes regularly.  A total treat in the historic downtown of Jasper.  The offerings include a variety of sandwiches as well as Fish, Beef, Pork, and Chicken dinners, and also Gator.  I have personally tries the Reuben and the Parmesan Chicken. The sides are delicious and the children's meals are generously portioned and reasonably priced. They have been in business for over 100 years for very good reasons.
