Trattoria Giuseppe
Rating: 5
Text: Best kept secret in Italian food in all of St Louis area.  Anything on the menu is a good choice.  Pastas are cooked to perfection. Ownership and staff are friendly and service has been great every time we've dined here. This restaurant easily rivals or surpasses any on The Hill in the city.  And to think they setup shop in Otto, MO.  It's worth the trip south a couple miles out of town to eat here.  It's a pretty drive down to the restaurant.

Text: Family owned restaurant. Authentic Italian cuisine. Very good food, but a bit peppery for my taste. I usually have them hold the pepper. The Godfather Pizza is awesome!

Text: The food was everything and more. Giuseppe came around himself twice and introduced himself and thanked us for coming. The ladies room according to my wife and daughter in law was disguisting. At least they had read that in reviews so were not surprised. Just a shame he doesn't do a little to take away that complaint. All six of us loved our meals and had a great time once we got past the outside and decor which needs to be updated.
