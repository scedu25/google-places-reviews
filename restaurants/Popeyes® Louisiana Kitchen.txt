Text: The portions here seem much smaller than at the other Popeyes I've been to and the employees seem to be very unprofessional but it's still Popeyes so I don't care

Text: Love Popeye's Fried Chicken!  I am so happy that they now have our very own restaurant in Garden City, Ks!  Yesterday was it's very first day to be open.  LONG lines at Noon on the drive through.  Chicken was outstanding.  Hat's off to the crew and Popeye's for a great job and cooking the best fried chicken ever!
