The Swedish Crown Restaurant

Text: The food was amazing. I had never tried Swedish Food before so i asked the bartender/waiter for recommendations and he was spot on. I ate a lot more than I usually do but it was so worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant. Every one is friendly and the atmosphere is awesome right down to the piano player in the corner.

Text: I've ate here 3 times and it's always excellent.  Their chicken fried steak is worthy enough to be in Texas.  Hand battered and fried. Delicious.  I went to waffle fest and had Swedish waffles here with a special fruit topping. I can't remember the name but they were very good waffles. Light and fluffy

Text: Food was great and, of course, refreshingly different from what we normally have the opportunity to eat. (We ordered the Swedish Nachos, the Swedish Dinner, and Orange-Almond Shanty. All were delicious!) The only weakness was the speed and attentiveness of service. Very friendly, however.

Text: We stopped in for a quick dinner on a Friday night at 6pm, and there was no wait!  The food smelled delicious, and we were not disappointed. The hummus plate was fantastic with warm pita bread and veggies for dipping. Very garlicky, so if you don't enjoy garlic, you may not like this hummus...but we ate every bite. The pasta of the day (Faraflle with grilled chicken, heirloom tomatoes, motzerella in white wine and olive oil) was amazing. Great portions, enough to take some home for a small lunch tomorrow.  :) Overall, great food, good service, and a nice change from the everyday fast food or chain restaurant.
