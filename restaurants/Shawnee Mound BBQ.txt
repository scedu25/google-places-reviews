Text: This is a great little place,! The BBQ is outstanding to say the least.  There brisket is the best I have ever had.  The service is friendly and fast. And to top it off they have a great selection of beer and local meats. We will definitely be coming back!

Text: Best barbecue in the Clinton area. I got the ribs and my wife got the brisket. Both were fresh, perfectly cooked, full of great smoke flavor. The service was also very friendly and down to earth. I was also blown away by how great of a deal it was. The portions were big and the meat you could tell was high quality but the price was cheaper than what barbecue restaurants in the KC area normally charge. Next time we pass through Clinton, I'm definitely coming back for more!

Text: Pulled pork sandwiches were so tender and delicious.   Baked beans and slaw were so good!  Very satisfying.  Definitely worth a stop.

Text: One of only a few places in town. Pulled pork is great, as is the brisket. The fries are hit and miss on crispyness, but they accommodate.
