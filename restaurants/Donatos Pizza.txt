Text: Absolutely terrible, food all over the floor. Rags on floor soaking up leaks at the drink station. Paper towels all over mens restroom. No soap in the bathroom. What do yoi think that means about the employees washing their hands.... so the food we ordered showed up 45 minutes after we ordered. At least half of it. The other half was missing?!?!?!?! What pizza i did have was cold when we got it. Asking for your money back is apparently a ridiculous demand and they try to give you stuff then want to give you a partial refund. Never eat here whatever you do. You will be disappointed.

Text: Called to see if they would deliver to my address. After being HUNG UP ON THREE TIMES someone finally answered the phone and had enough customer service guts to say, "I'm sorry sir, we don't deliver to your area".  What is so hard about that?
Really makes me wonder about the quality of staff that WOULD HAVE been cooking my meal.......Had that pepperoni been on the floor?

Next time I'm in town I'm bypassing these wankers.

Text: Ordered online, said order would be ready at 12:50pm. Got there and pizzas wasn't even started yet. I was there 10 minutes before anyone asked me if I've been helped.
