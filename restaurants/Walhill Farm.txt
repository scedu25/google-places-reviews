Text: We arrived a bit late at night, and were welcomed at the entrance. We loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, the decor and lighting were warm and comforting. The food is so great! We ordered steak, salmon and chicken dishes, and could not be happier about the taste! I highlight recommend the bread pudding desert! If you are interested in locally sourced food, this is a must-go-to spot! It is a unique place in mid/southern Indiana!
