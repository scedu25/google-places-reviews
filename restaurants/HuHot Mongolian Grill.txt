Text: This place is a fun Buffet of Asian flavors that you get to combine before they go on the grill. I would recommend the place, but be sure to stay on top of the cooks. They may not cook your food exactly the way you like it, especially if they are busy. I often ask them to cook a little longer. Also, the building is not as clean and well kept up as I would expect. It can feel dirty sometimes. The food generally tastes good, but it isn't of the highest quality. The prices recently went up which makes this place harder to recommend as well. I would say it's definitely worth a try if you haven't been to a Mongolian style grill before.

Text: Love the way u self serve food but after watching the handling of food I will probably not return or say anything good about u to others. I watched a young gal just replace food items on your line in 5 different containers by just dumping fresh on top of what was there already & even worse ur cooks were picking up dirty spatulas that had been laying in the grease catch  (handle and all) and using them to cook food without rinsing  or washing them off. Someone will get sick someday! !!!
