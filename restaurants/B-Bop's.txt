Text: Good burgers. What else do you want me to say? Is B-Bop's hijack memories Szechuan Sauce good? No. But if you went down the street to McDonald's or Wendy's for a burger I would ask what the hell's your problem.

Text: Monotone gal taking order. Could barely understand what she was saying as she cut off her mike before she was finished. 
Sloppy Joe was ordinary loosemeat with a mixture of ketchup & mustard. Not very much meat & a smashed bun. Had to ask for my drink & debit card. 
Horrible customer service. Would not recommend & will not return. Save your money.
