Milanos Italian Cuisine
Rating: 2
Text: We had been going to Milanos for years, but it seems like something had changed. Complete new wait staff and I have to say our waitress did not impress me. The bus boy worked harder. The only thing our waitress did was take our food order and bring our check. Bus boy even took our drink and desert orders. As for the food, we both had veal and it was not good. Over cooked, tough and not very hot. I will have to decide if we give it another chance or go down the street to Angelos.

Text: Went for the first time.  We had not idea if we sat down or walked up to the cashier.  We had to ask a customer.  The food was so greasy.
