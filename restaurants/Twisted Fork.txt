Text: 6 for 6. That's our experience with Twisted Fork. They deliver not only a great experience it's also consistent which is nice because some restaurants can be really hit-or-miss.

We've never been blown away by the happy hour or other specials price-wise but the quality is always there. 

Lastly, the decor is... interesting? Unique? I'm not sure how to place it but it's certainly their own.

Text: Enjoyed  a nut brown ale and street tacos from the happy hour menu and a summer salad from the regular menu. All outstanding!! Exemplary service. The beer selection was modest but is a well-thought and satisfying range of local brews. I will be back.

Text: The atmosphere and location can't be beat!  The service was professional, but the kitchen was a little slow on the night we visited.  The restaurant was about a third full, so not too busy.  I had the meatloaf and mac 'n cheese.  It was very good - especially the mac 'n cheese!  I had the molten lava cake with ice cream for desert.  The cake was room temperature.  I expected it to be hot.  It was good, nonetheless.  I would visit again for sure!

Text: Food is always amazing but the service can be hit or miss. When it's not busy, it can be hard to find a waiter as they tend to be in the back, which can mean you have to wait a while for your check. Other than that, a great place to eat.
