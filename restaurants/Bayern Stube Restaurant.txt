Text: Bayern Stube is the best. I wouldn't have a better place to host my birthday party. Always great service. Authentic German food at a fair price. Can't recommend this place enough.

Text: Be sure you come hungry, because you are going to want to eat as much as possible of this solid, delicious German food! Last I heard the owners are trying to sell the family restaurant so they can retire. Don't wait, you've got to try it to believe the mouth-watering hype!
