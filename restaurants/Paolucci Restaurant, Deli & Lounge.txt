Text: Love going there with my family to eat the awesome breakfast. The pancakes and omelets are the best. Plus the coffee is great and my cup always stays full. I have to say for working in the food business and retail many years this place has great service and great cooks. Keep it up everyone. God Bless.?

Text: My wife and I both ordered the lasagna, my wife got the the side salad and I got the lobster bisque. The bisque was fine, but nothing standout, and my wife said the salad dressing had too much vinegar. We both took one bite of our lasagna and stopped eating. When the lasagna came out it smelled bad and tasted worse. I've never quite had an experience like that, but something tasted very wrong.

Text: The food is tasty. I had some lovely pasta chicken alfredo. Good to have some hot food on a chilly day!

Text: Food is tasteless got the broasted chicken it had no flavor the waitress said they only put flour on it. If you hate seasoning come here. Oh waitress was bland and when asked for extra napkins for a table of 5 she brings 2. And to top it off it was close to closing time so we were drinking sweet tea in the lady added water to the tea and then put more sugar in it and infill all her glasses up and I was almost clear if you like but we made a new batch but clearly it was sugar water. What a dive. Wish I could leave -5 stars
