The LuBar and Bistro

Text: Pizza was good but only warm even though we were the only customers when we ordered and it seemed to take a long time to get to the table.  Atmosphere was nice.  Prices were appropriate.

Text: Really disappointed in this place. The wife and I came from out of town and looked on line to see what  restaurants were in Carlyle. We decided to try the Lubar and Bistro on Friday, October 7, 2016. The web page said they were open at 11 AM. We arrived at 11:10 AM and the place was closed and all lights were off inside. We sat and waited on the bench outside until 11:20 or so and then returned to our vehicle where we waited another 5 to 10 minutes. The place never opened. We had chosen to ignore the reviews about how the place was run and the lack of caring that some folks had perceived. We never got in to try the food or see the service but the lack of responsibility exhibited by not opening on time would lead me to believe that I would have agreed with some of the others. Fortunately the day was not lost and we enjoyed a wonderful lunch and great service at the Fish House at Dam East. Maybe we will try again some time but with me, I doubt it.
