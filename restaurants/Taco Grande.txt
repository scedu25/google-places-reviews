Taco Grande
Rating: 2
Text: I love their food when prepared correctly. Unfortunately they have a lot of employee turn over so there isn't much consistency in their food preparation. Just had a nacho grande with very little nacho cheese or meat. The two before this one were very good. Will probably be a while before we try it again.

Text: Just a real quick tip. Next time you're 2 delivery drivers down during lunch hours?, DON'T MAKE THE FOOD A HALF HOUR BEFORE IT GETS DELIVERED!!! Really enjoyed my stone cold food. And maybe hire people that are competent enough to not just throw the food around. Didn't remember ordering a deconstructed taco burger, but that's what I got.

Text: I'm really hurts me to write this review. To start off the food tasted good. I tried a couple options and I was happy with that. On the down side, I asked for hot sauce and what I got had no heat what so ever! Now maybe I didn't get what I asked for but if I did, it was bad. The menu is not clear AT ALL. I asked what a super(fill in the blank) is. I was told its like the combo(blank) but with more meat. So I said okay? what is the combo(blank). No solid answer was given so I ordered something else. The service was slow and lack knowledge of their product.

Text: If you are from anywhere that has good Mexican food don't go here.  It was by far the worst meal I've ever had, especially for the prices.  I've accidentally eaten a two day old burrito left in my car and this food tasted about the same, absolutely rancid.  At least most of the staff was friendly, but the kid who took our order just stared at us, no greeting or anything.
