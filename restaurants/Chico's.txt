Text: A year or more ago I would have given them all of the stars I possibly could. However things have started to go down hill. Hours are restricted and the food isn’t nearly as good as it used to be

Text: The sanchos are so good! American Mexican food with a drive through, and they make most of their food from fresh ingredients. Great pricing, but take cash unless you spend more than $20 - they can only do ATM transactions with cards.

Text: Go for a Taco Salad Supreme, a Sancho with sour cream, a large Ski and some Apple Strips with cheese.

Text: Chico is Mexican-American this is not a typical Mexican sit down restaurant.  It is more like a taco stand but Americanized.  The service is fast.  The eating area is small, but they also have some outside tables you can use during the warmer months. There is also a drive thru, but it has no menu so you know this place is truly a local favorite. The have mild, medium and hot sauce.  Hard and soft tacos, burritos, sanchos, hot dogs, chili, pretzels, great taco salads and much much more including great baked potatoes.
