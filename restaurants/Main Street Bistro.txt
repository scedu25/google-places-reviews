Text: The staff was all over the place. My order was not correct and others were brought to our table a couple of times that were looking for another party. The ambiance was very appealing however

Text: I consider main street bistro to be a "casual fine dining experience." Very clean and modern interior. Prices are fair for the quality and amount of food! Wide variety of plates. Good for a first date in case you don't know what she likes to eat. Will definitely go back this summer and dine on the patio.

Text: I'm part of a business marketing group that meets in the 1st source building each week. The Bistro provides the food, and I look forward to this lunch every week. They have a great variety and it is all really good. I've had many of their meals, and I haven't eaten anything I don't enjoy. The staff is really good as well.

Text: Extensive cocktail list and bigger menu than I expected. We ordered the Walleye and Tuna with Portobello Fries as an appetizer. The food was phenomenal, and we will be returning in the future.
