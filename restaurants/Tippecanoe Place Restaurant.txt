Text: What a completely wonderful place to come for breakfast! 

Period poised the historic inner decor coupled with traditional service sets a perfect match which compliments this structure's outer appeal.

A fantastic variety of options finely presented in a buffet poised in the round.

Coffee..? Oh my goodness 'yes' they very much understand what it takes to make a good cup of coffee, which was most appreciated during our morning visit.

We were so pleased to have spent some of our travel time visiting family and discovering this place. Already looking forwards to our next breakfast here. 

Thank you Tippecanoe, this Chief is impressed!
