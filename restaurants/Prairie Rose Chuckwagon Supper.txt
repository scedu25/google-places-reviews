Text: For having paid $75 for two dinner tickets I was hoping to enjoy some of the 'unlimited' BBQ with my 7months pregnant wife. About 40 minutes after my wife was served a single piece of thin beef, the wait staff came by to collect our dishes. Ten minutes later another gentleman came by with seconds on the brisket and grumbled audibly when my very pregnant wife asked for more food.

We got more & better food from a truck stop BBQ place in Kansas City for less than $20. Absolutely not worth the drive, or the money.
