Text: This is ok for the very little ones, we had some fun. The staff on the other hand look like they would rather be else where. We will not return.

Text: Excellent establishment. We ate at the Thirsty Pony and our food was amazing.  I highly recommend the Rice balls.  Our kids had fun bowling and playing laser tag and then we stayed the night in the Quality Inn hotel.  Bill, the night manager was so nice and accommodating.  He was able to find us extra blankets even though he thought the hotel was out.  He also recommended a nice pizzeria (Marco's) for delivery after the restaurant on site was closed.

Text: The water slides where amazing and I liked the USA flag in the blue tube slide but I heard the hotel has bed bugs and I could not breathe in there and NON-STOP I was coughing super bad. NO!
