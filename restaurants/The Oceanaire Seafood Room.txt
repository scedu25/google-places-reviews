Text: Went for a nice dinner out and we had amazing service, the Waitress was very knowledgeable about the whole Menu and was able to suggest different items based on what we wanted.  The food came out fast and was so delicious.  The Scallops were the best I have ever had and with an added sauce to them even made them better! Dessert was also very delicious and reasonably priced. Overall the whole experience was great and would recommend to family and friends!!

Text: I had one of the worst experiences in this restaurant. My friend and I had to wait long just to get a salad, we had to return a plate and were told we'll get a different one but we never did. Two waiters were aware of the matter but they never asked us if we even need anything else for over 40 minutes. We asked for the check, paid and left though in our way out the manager realized were weren't happy and asked if she can adjust the check we declined. That was the first and last time I'd go to this restaurant...
