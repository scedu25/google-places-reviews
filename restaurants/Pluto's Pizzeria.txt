Pluto's Pizzeria
Rating: 3
Text: Plutos has decent New York style kind of pizza . Not the greatest , not the worst . Prices are too high for the pizza though : and cup of soda was 4 bucks!! On top of the already ridiculous price for a soda they have the nerve to charge 1.64 for a refill for a 16oz fountain drink. So best bet would be to get a pizza to go and screw their over priced drinks

Text: So the lady getting our drinks got them wrong told her what we ordered and she kinda argued with me. Rolled her eyes and shook her head the rest of time getting our drinks. Talked to the guy who brought our food he said he would tell his manager. But manager hasn't spoke to me. Got a salad and lettuce was brown and some of the cucumbers were dry. Pizza was not what I excepted. Very little sauce and way to much cheese I am not impressed. Four dollars for a drink and I can't get refills! Spent 72 dollars to feed 5 ppl. Was worst pizza I have ever eaten.

Text: $4.00 for a soda with $1.50 refill. Outrageous! Calzones don't get rewarmed all the way through.
