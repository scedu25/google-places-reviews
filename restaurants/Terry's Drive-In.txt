Text: We pass by Osceola many times each year, especially in the summer to get a cone or shake.  Love the treat but can't understand why they ignore us.  Our family of 5 stands at the counter for many minutes each time.  The employees stand feet away but act like we're not there.  Not even a "Be with you in a moment."  They purely ignore us... we nearly walked out today.
