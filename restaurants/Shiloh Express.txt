Shiloh Express

Text: Not quite sure why I kept going back, other than it's closer than the actual Shiloh's. But after today, I won't be going back. I ordered the beef tip salad and I think there may have been five extremely small pieces of beef crumbs. I honestly didn't think there was anything in the small foil package that they put it in, it was so light. The salad was all lettuce. Hardly ANYTHING else at all. Plus, no roll. They have always in the past included a roll. So, I'm done with Shiloh Express. I'll just start driving to the other side of town, at least there... You actually get what you've paid for.

Text: Terrible service. Steaks were well done ( almost burnt) but we ordered medium rare. Missing several other items and were double charged. We had to go back up there to have it sorted out and waited for the general manager to get there. He assured us that because we were having so much trouble he would take off the charges for our meal. That we didn't even get to enjoy after all this mess. Turns out we were still charged and after talking to him a couple days later he refused to take the charges off. I am very disappointed with all levels of service at this restaurant.

Text: A $10 salad will get you a head of lettuce topped with some leather or rubber strips of chicken. Good luck if you have false teeth! Used to be a good place to get food.

Text: The food is average and prices above average, it's only saving grace is lack of competition in the area.
