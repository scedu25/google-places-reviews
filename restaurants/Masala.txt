Text: This was supposedly the best Indian cuisine around chicago suburbs but disappointed with the recent visit. Appetizers as usual was great but non veg curries with lot of spices which spoiled the taste.... Not a single curry (chicken or mutton) were good. I may rate them below average.

Note - they charge buffet for kids too which was surprising for me. I never saw any restaurant so far who charge kids... they may need to rethink about this.

I may not recommend with the recent visit...

Text: We ordered veg noodles which were too spicy. Unfortunately, this was togo order so we didn't realize until returned home. I would not recommend this place unless you like overwhelming amount of red chilly and black pepper in your food.

Text: As the name says the food is rich with masala if you like spicy food you should visit this place. The reason my rating is low is chicken biriyani was not up to what I expected
