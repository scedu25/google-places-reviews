Text: This an excellent place to eat. The food is not gourmet but it is all very good. I loved their wings on pizza buffet night. Very nice, quick, helpful, friendly service. Nice atmosphere of quiet neighborliness.

Text: Delicious food every visit!  The grilled shrimp dinner is a must have if you like seafood.  It's 11 grilled shrimp perfectly seasoned and tender, served on a bed of rice pilaf.  It's a great light dinner option for those of us watching calories.  
It's our regular meeting place/restaurant to meet my parents half way!  :-)

Text: Food is good. Salad bar always looks fresh. The place and parking lot are small so you usually wait on weekends. They give you plenty of food so i am usually too full for desert.
