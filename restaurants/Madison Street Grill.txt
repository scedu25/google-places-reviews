Text: Very nice atmosphere and staff always very friendly! Good selection of drinks and food! Price is a little more than I think the food is worth. The past two trips my steak was over cooked and looked very bland. My wife's steak came out as ordered and was delicious! I guess I just have bad luck but when you spend that much on a plate you tend to expect a little more.

Text: We had dinner at Madison Street Grill tonight. Olivia was awesome! There were a couple of glitches, but she handled them satisfactorily. The food was very good. At Olivia's recommendation I had the 6 oz. Filet, Oscar style, yum!  I will go back if we are ever in the area.
