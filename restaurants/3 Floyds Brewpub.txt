Text: Arrived at Three Floyds with low expectations due to some of the recent reviews. However, my party and I had a decent evening with quick friendly service. Our food was delicious and our server was happy to bring us samples of the many beers we wanted to try.

Text: Music is loud so be aware
 Food menu is great.
Only issue was wait we arrived on a rainy day were asked to wait outside "in the rain".

Appeared to have open tables
Was told  45 min wait turned into 10.
????
Almost seemed that they wanted us to go elsewhere 

NOT

Hung around and had an enjoyable experience

Text: Love this place.  Service has always been excellent with passionate waiters and waitresses.  Food is really good,  if the menu is small.  Take home some jerky!

Text: Tucked away in an industrial park, three floyds is probably the best/most interesting food in the area.  Food gets high marks for creativity but execution is sometimes lacking, but that doesn't matter because you're in northwest Indiana.  Obviously the beers are great and they have many offerings from other microbreweries as well.  For some reason I don't want you to bring your kids here....

Text: Walked up to eat in the tap room.  14 groups deep. No problem, we’ll get a beer at the bar. Woops. We were promptly told to GO WAIT IN OUR CAR because they don’t allow that.  What? Never coming here again.
