Casey's Cowtown Club
Rating: 3
Text: Food was average fair for the asking prices.  Menu does have a fair amount of choices, including some seafood choices.  The restaurant has a rustic charm, but needs a new coat to spruce the place up a bit.  It would be nice if the new owners could restore the remains of the wagon just outside the doors when the place is sold and left as a steakhouse.  Very few steakhouses are left in this city which once was famous for cattle and steaks.

Text: Cowboy atmosphere and steaks like a cowboy would want. Staff went the extra mile to take care of us. It feels like more than just a meal, it was an experience in Kansas I will remember.

Text: Great food and service, just the prices need to go down and the building needs remodeled.

Text: Very disappointing experience. We visited this establishment on 6/23/17 for the 1st time since moving to western Kansas.  We noticed that the building was for sale. We were seated by the hostess but waited almost 15 minutes before I had to get up and ask the bartender for drinks. We found out our waitress was on break and no one was covering her tables.  We ordered the "large" Prime Rib dinner. It was a very small cut of meat for the $22 price. I've had better cuts of meat at chain steakhouses. The corn tasted like frozen corn that was just cooked out of the bag. Will never come back here again and will not recommend to others.
