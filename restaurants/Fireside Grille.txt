Text: Ate here a couple weeks ago and it was fine. Tonight food was practically inedible and way over priced. Our waitress was nice and there's a good beer selection but the food was really poor quality.

Text: This place has changed quite a bit over the years with their menu, but it is for the best. Excellent food and service!

Text: I was not impressed; our server was very nice and polite, but not very attentive. I suggest ordering two drinks at once because getting your water or tea refilled is almost impossible. I didn't really enjoy my food either, I had a pulled pork sandwich and homemade chips. The pork was okay...not great but not horrible either, it was over cooked. It's not someplace that I would make a special trip to return to, nor would I recommend it.
