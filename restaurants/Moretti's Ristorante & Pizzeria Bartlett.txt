Text: Visited for the first time at lunch. Great lunch menu and variety of options. Prices reasonable. Waitress was pleasant and attentive. Atmosphere was elegantly casual. Not five stars because although I have no complaints it wasn't anything especially marvelous either.

Text: Server was great, checked on it's a bunch, offered to cook another steak since we ordered medium rare and received medium well but overall timing of dinner was so slow so we didn't want to wait.  It was ok, nothing special.  Pizza was good, kids liked making their own pizza.

Text: Food was fresh. The servers were very friendly and attentive. The prices were reasonable. I wish we sat outside on the huge deck, it was a beautiful evening. I am looking forward to going back.
