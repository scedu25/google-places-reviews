The Schnitzelbank Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: The Schnitzelbank is a southern Indiana institution, serving great German food, and some of the best fried chicken in the area. I've been there several times - food is always excellent - but recently we had a birthday party there, and opted for the family-style meal. What a great way to handle a larger group of people - large plates of meats, vegetables, and potatoes, passed around the table and refilled as often as needed - really simplifies things. No waiting for everyone to go through the menu, decide, and then wait for all the dishes to come out of the kitchen separately. All the food came out at the right temperature, just as tasty as the food off the menu, and waitresses were very attentive, keeping platters filled, and explaining the process to people who'd never had a family-style meal there before. I'd definitely consider this option again.

Text: If I lived to be 90, I'd have never elected to go to a German restaurant. But I'll go along with the gang, and the gang wanted to go to Schnitzelbank. Jasper is a very German town, right down to the street names. The outside of the restaurant...well, it looks like it's straight out of the Black Forest. The inside is equally as authentic, right down to the dark, chunky bar and the squeaky wooden chairs. They have a great bottled beer selection, but I'd recommend getting one of their in-house beers. I had the porter and it was excellent. The food was really high quality. I had the bretzel sandwich with German fries. Tasty. Use the hot mustard--it will clear your nostrils, but really adds something. We shared an Apple strudel. I'd swear that was homemade ice cream they topped it with. By the time my meal was over, I was even game to walk around the gift shop and have my picture taken in the photo shoot area outside. They completely won me over with good food and exceptional service. A very enjoyable place and completely unexpected. Highly recommend.

Text: One of two restaurants in southern Indiana I will drive over an hour to eat at.  Wow, their fried chicken, schnitzel and salad bar are heavenly.  I haven't had a bad thing on the menu and always look forward to an opportunity to eat there.  They are always busy, and for good reason.  Plan ahead and enjoy the ambiance.

Text: My favorite German restaurant.  This place has delicious food and wonderful service.  We arrived 20 minutes before closing with a party of 8 and were treated spectacularly.  Our drink cups were never empty and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this restaurant for it's good and atmosphere.
