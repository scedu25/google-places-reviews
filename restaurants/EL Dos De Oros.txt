Text: We were just passing thru town, stopped in. It blows my mind that only one guy can take the money, and the orders. Control issues???? There were like 8 people up at the register,  splitting their ticket. The girl walked by, we told her we were ready to order, she said the person working the register, didn't catch his name, had to take our order. Four workers out front, only one can take the orders? Seriously????? I could write my own order on a damn napkin, how hard is It? More were going up to pay, I wanted to get back on the road, so we just left. Don't bother stopping unless they don't have more than a few people in there. So ridiculous!
