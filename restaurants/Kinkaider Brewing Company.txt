Kinkaider Brewing Company

Text: My friends and I took a road trip to Broken Bow and area and specifically went to KinKaider's for lunch.  Burgers and beer were great.  Onion rings were good but very greasy.  The coating slipped off the rings and it was a greasy mess but tasty.  Maybe they should try a lighter, tempura batter and less time in the fryer.

Text: Took my folks here and had one of the best brewery experiences in my life! The fella that served us, I wish I could remember his name, was fantastic. When he found out we were on a trip and I make it a habit to visit breweries, he lit up and was excited to tell us all about the beers. My favorites were the Snow Beast and the Smoked Alt. And the food is fantastic! Don't pass this gem up if you find yourself in Broken Bow!
