Text: Delicious...perfect crust, thin but crispy. Yummy toppings. Great location in Eastern Market. Best thin crust in Detroit. They should go back to line ordering as the servers feel unnecessary.

Text: I am PizzaExpert on YT. Watch my video review of this place.  

Atmosphere was definitely cute and like walking back in time. 

Great thinness to crust. Good edge crust. Too much flour used and remaining on crust. Awesome sauce. Cheese falls flat and fails to keep up to expectation. 

Watch my video review for more.

Text: Best pizza every in my opinion. always super fresh ingredients. I don't care for the fact they went mainstream/ glamorized the place because the previous grungy spot just added that extra flair ya know? but now that it's a full restaurant I'll be expecting breadsticks like typical pizza joints. can I have that?

Text: I don't get what all the fuss is about with this place. Pizza is flat thin crusted New York style which is good. But it's nothing special in my opinion. Is trendy. It has booze. I think it had five beers on tap. Personally I like the Johnny Mac's Bakery that was in here previously better
