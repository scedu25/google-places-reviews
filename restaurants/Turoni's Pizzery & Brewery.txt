Text: Good food and good service.  The pizza was excellent.  Server continuously filled drinks.  We had a large group and they were very efficient.

Text: The thin crust pizza here is on an entirely different level from 99% of the pizza joints in the world. The sauce is some of the best sauce I've had and that is high praise coming from a New Yorker that lived in Italy for a a few years. The dough, plus the sauce, plus the homemade sausage... Well just get yourself a pie or two and then come and debate me. 

The micro brewery is great enough to warrant a sit down to enjoy some of the locally crafted brews but when coupled with the sides, sandwiches, and pizza offered is an absolute delight that is well worth the detour if you are going to be passing close by.

Text: One if the best and well known pizza places in town. Meatball sub is AMAZING! Also good salads and good beer selection brewed in house.

Text: Fantastic pizza. The crust is crispy on the edges and just the right chewy texture in the middle. The smell of the place the moment you walk in is that classic pizza pub restaurant feel. Service was fast and friendly. Cities twice the size of Evansville would kill to have a place like this. Can't recommend it enough.

Text: Pizza is outstanding. I personally think Evansville sucks so it was nice to actually find a good place to eat. Its near downtown. It was really busy, but i figured out why. The inside is pretty cool. Its in an old hostoric building with lots of old memorabilia.
