Chad's Pizza & Restaurant
Rating: 4
Text: We took 2 teenagers to Chad's Pizza on a Saturday night. Two of us ate buffet, one had the cod basket and one had the ham and cheese sandwich basket meal. They offer chocolate and white milk,  beer, pop and even pictures of pop. The kids can supstitute applesauce, cottage cheese, lettuce or coleslaw for side in baskets. The buffet had breaded shrimp, broiled chicken, baked potatoes, pizza, pasta, jello and lettuce salads, and 2 soups. No complaints. Average around $7- 11 for food without drinks. Good price for a sit down meal.

I travel for work a lot and pizza is the hotel staple late at night, and in all of the places I have been, Chad's is my new #1 by far!  Excellent food!!!  Awesome experience!!  I just had some delivered to my hotel room tonight for dinner and again, AWESOME!  The "Chads Special" pizza is awesome!
