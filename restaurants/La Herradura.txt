Text: Authentic Mexican, mediocre food, mediocre service. Place was empty, asked for flour tortilla chips was told all they have is corn chips. Asked if the chef could cut up some flour tortillas and deep fry them, no way I was told. Had the carnitas with cheese enchiladas,  pork was dried out and then re-fried. My wife had the fajitas and liked them. They have way too many items on the menu to do them all properly. This is coming from a seasoned chef who has been in the business for 40 years. Maybe I caught them on an off night but seriously doubt it.

Text: Before they moved into the Tia Zia building, they were great. I loved their food and margaritas. Now, though, the food is horrible. Cheap ingredients and no flavor. Even the "hot" salsa isn't flavorful. It's all just a bunch of grease. And the prices doubled. But the decor is cool.
