Text: Fun place for a date. Tasty steaks - we cooked our own. Good salad and potato bar. Reservations suggested but we were seated pretty quickly without them.

Text: Business dinner. Unique experience. Restaurant decor is very dark and dated. 70's style with maroon carpet. That part was creepy. Food was good. Some pictures look purple from the lighting and purple carpet!

Text: The service is always excellent. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, but I would much rather cook a steak myself at home.

Text: My wife took me to dinner there last night for my birthday.  It was a hour and a half drive and I will do it again in a heartbeat. The cuts of meat to choose from was exceptional. I easily could have done the 40oz beef eater special but I would only be stealing from them.  My wife had the Ribeye and I the Delmonico. Both cuts we're extremely tender and full of taste.  Cooking our own was fun, as that was part of the ambiance of going there. Baked potatoes and salad bar had everything you need and the side bowl of mushrooms and onions we ordered was enough for both steaks.  If you don't want to enjoy yourself cooking your own and wonder why do I have to cook it myself, pay the extra $2.00 or go somewhere else, cooking yourself is part of why you go there and they spelled that out at the beginning.  The price was very very reasonable, and Tricia was way above an outstanding server. Thank you Prime Quarter for a very enjoyable evening!!  Looking forward to bringing many people with us in the near future!!!
