Tudor Room
Rating: 3
Text: A good, solid meal (if tending a bit toward the bland) in an outstanding space. The quality of food seems to be improving as the beginning of the academic year looms. On some days during the summer one might have the whole place to himself. Fresh fruit, good veggies, and a hearty selection of soups, main dishes and desserts. All for about $11, including a soft drink or coffee.
