Text: The staff was very polite and informative. The staff did a great job explaining how the menu works . The food was incredibly delicious and they serve a good size portion (enough to fill me up). Will definitely visit again when I'm in the area

Text: Glad we saw this on the way to the Corvette Museum!  We did the tour and stopped here after and we were not disappointed.  

Big portions for the price.  The pulled pork and ribs were delicious.

This is how I like to see BBQ joints.  Small places with great food, served in styrofoam boxes.  Nothing fancy, just fast service and delicious food.

Text: Fantastic no-frills BBQ at a very reasonable price! A must-visit for Bowling Green if you're not from the area. Portions are quite large, most dishes can be split between 2 people.
