Text: Great food service was awesome. We had a group of 13 and the staff was more than happy to have us. It was great that the owner came out to check on things and visit with us. Will be back ?

Text: I went in to get a menu since we had never been there before. As soon as I walked in I was asked very loudly from the back of the room "Pizza?"  I answered no and asked if they had a menu I could take with me. One was handed to me politely. I was the informed of the pizza that was available "to go only"  I questioned if we ordered a meal and wanted pizza too could we eat it with the rest of our meal at a table since there would be 10 of us and 6 being kids who may just want pizza. I was informed that the pizza was to go only and we could not eat it inside the restaurant. When I questioned this I was told again. That is to go only. 

I do not understand why you would turn away business like that.

Text: Chicken Alfredo pasta was delicious! Great service and atmosphere. We almost missed the location since the sign is small. Owner said they will soon have a bigger sign. We'll be back the next time we're in the area!
