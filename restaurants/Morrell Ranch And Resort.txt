Morrell Ranch And Resort
Rating: 5
Text: I loved this place! I took my wife here for an extend vacation. It was peaceful and the landscape was stunning! The staff were so helpful and the room was beautiful!! We relaxed in the hammocks and had a romantic picnic in "Ariea's park." There was a large family reunion here and then a few days later there was a wedding but there was so much space we did NOT feel like we were crowded at all! I would highly recommend this place for anyone! I know we will DEFINITELY plan on coming back! If your considering coming, look no further!

Text: I didn't spend the night there, I attended a wedding. I lover the dear sanctuary, aviary, and the lake. The decor of the rooms etc are up to date, and beautifully decorated.  However at the wedding, it was hot! It was so hot in the reception room, I couldn't sit in there.  It is a beautiful place for a wedding. Rooms are pricey.

Text: My wife and I stayed at the Morrell Ranch last fall. We stayed in the lodge. It was an amazing experience. Walking around the pond and watching the swans. And then to see the deers on the property. Great place to relax at. We'll be back...
