Text: Great brunch spot in an old inn and restaurant. Food was delectable, and the service is impeccable. We always really enjoy our time!

Text: Had breakfast here twice while staying at the hotel.  Great atmosphere and I loved that they were playing classic jazz.  I enjoyed a large banana pancake + Goetta side ("Getta" a Cincinnati specialty: meat+grain mush fried into a thin patty).  The rest of my group got more interesting dishes and were disappointed each time.  Sauces and salsas lacking in flavor, bacon and english muffins were blackened...  Also the coffee is truly bad and tastes just like the free coffee in the hotel lobby.  Definitely save your money for the Starbucks across the lot.

Text: We like to go on Sunday mornings after church - when it is often very busy. With that said, the service has always been great along with the food. I was impressed on one of the busiest days, Mother's Day, they work even hard to make your visit special, to include giving a flower to my wife and my mother during our celebration. Well done!

Text: The program dinner was disappointing, served without rhyme or reason.
Just brought out and put down. No bread. When asked for  saltine crackers were provided.

 Portions were small. Almost an appetizer. 
Not their usual performance.
