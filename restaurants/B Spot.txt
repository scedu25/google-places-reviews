Text: Fun experience; good for a casual date. The pickle bar is bound to have something you'll find tasty. The burgers are phenomenal. And so are the spiked milkshakes. This is a sit-down place, so a waiter/waitress will take your order (which wasn't obvious to me from the description so I'm putting it here). I went on a Sunday near noon and there were plenty of seats.

Text: All I wanted was a great burger. You know how you get the taste for a great burger. The burger was not great at all and the fries were cold and crunchy. You know how you use an eaterys food to determine if you will eat there again ? Never again...

Text: The Thin Lizzy was an exceptional burger and the onion rings were nice and crispy without being greasy. The ambiance was loud and crowded but the front wall was an open garage door which helped with the noise. The table was sticky on the edges and the floor needed swept but they were busy so I am sure they will get it later. Taste and quality of the food surpassed the negative.
