Text: Of all the times I've been here more than 75% of the time I've had a very good experience. However occasionally in the past I would order chicken strips and they had run out. Not too bad because they do have a chicken sandwich. There aren't really any viable vegetarian meals. Themed cocktails are good and the bartenders are great!
