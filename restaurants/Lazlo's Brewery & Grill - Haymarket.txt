Text: Our server was excellent, food was great and the prices were fair as always. Their fries with honey mustard is outstanding. I have never ordered food here I didn't enjoy, but my favorites are the club, Reuben, and any of the burgers.

Text: Great experience. Food is amazing, service was great. Our server Nick was friendly and treaded us great,  not like a lot of servers that treat you like just a tip. Beer is great too. Got some to take home.

Text: If you haven't been here you need to go NOW! It's a Lincoln owned restaurant, food is cooked fresh when you order it and the beer cheese soup is to die for. The atmosphere is lovely and staff is always friendly.

Text: After taking our order for quantity two of one of the nightly specials, they came back and said they were sold out. We upgraded to a filet for the price of the special. Not only was that a nice thing to do, the steak was outstanding. Very flavorful and cooked exactly how we ordered them! Great service. Nice establishment.
