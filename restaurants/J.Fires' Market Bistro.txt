Text: It's always lovely, but tonight it was fantastic!

Any time I order prime rib anywhere, I order it "as rare as they can find" knowing that I'll likely find a medium cut on my plate.  I'm comfortable with my prime rib fate.  Tonight it came out a perfect warm, red, delicious cut.  I've never had better prime rib.

5 stars, and I nearly never give 5 stars.  Everything else was perfect too.

Text: Service left a lot to be desired.  Dirty wine glass, long time to get anyone to our table, no beer glass was given with the can of beer, dirty dishes are left at our table vs being cleared. Appetizer took a LONG time to get to our table and our server keeps disappearing.  Food seems good so far but service stinks... Only reason they are getting 3 stars is due to the food.
