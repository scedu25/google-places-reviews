Jack Stack Barbecue - Country Club Plaza
Rating: 5
Text: I am a corporate flight attendant and ordered a carry out order for eight passengers the night before I needed it at 8:30 the next morning. Jack Stack doesn't open until 11 but they came in early and prepared it fresh. It was hot and ready at 8:30. They showed me exceptional service and all of the food was high quality and delicious. The brisket was especially tender and got lots of compliments from my passengers! Very impressed and grateful for such a wonderful experience.

Text: Darius is one of the best servers I've seen in years. Very welcoming, gave us great recommendations (love the crown prime by the way!) and there was the perfect amount of attentiveness that made us feel like we weren't being rushed. Thanks to Darius I've had one of the best dining experiences ever. I've already my plans to bring my family when we come back to Kansas City. Thanks to the cooks for the amazing food and Darius for amazing service!!!! #TeamJackStack

Text: Burnt ends, back back ribs and beans are their finest fare! Nice selection of about a dozen beers on draft, but not many dark beers. I always ate at the bar and was entertained; by fellow patrons and/or staff. Convenient parking, but I always walked from my hotel (Intercontinental).

Text: Neat upscale BBQ joint with the decor of a steakhouse. The mixed drinks were well crafted, flavorful, and strong. The burnt ends were tender and the short rib looked like it came from a dinosaur it was so huge! Highly recommend, it was worth the wait (it gets busy).

Text: Wow! Seriously, get the Big Pig. You will not regret it, especially their honey sauce! Service was outstanding, best I have ever had and food service was out within ten minutes! Definitely eating here again.
