Oyama Sushi & Steakhouse

Text: The service staff is cool, direct; but business polite.  The ambience is 'park pavilion'; very open and cold.  Not a romantic or special ocassion destination. Cheap wine at an unreasonably high price point. Do not order the salmon.  It is 1/4 inch thick previously frozen 'cardboard' hidden beneath a sauce intended to disguise and hide the dried texture and taste. The vegetables were generous and perfectly prepared.  The menu is inviting, the dinning experience unfortunately fails to deliver.

Text: This is my favorite sushi spot around. They have excellent traditional rolls and a really fun variety of American style maki rolls. They even have a Mexican style roll that's pretty yummy (the Fiesta roll). Quick service, clean place, average prices.

Text: Fairly busy for a Tuesday night, which I think is a good thing for an off the beaten path sushi joint in IA. Got a seaweed salad and 2 sweet potato rolls. Both were decent and fairly priced. Pretty std salad. Sweet potatoes crunchy. Not a Veg, just still struggling with the idea of raw fish in the Midwest. I give 4 stars for a pleasant experience and value. Would come back.

Text: Very good sushi, the best in Cedar Rapids. My wife and I travel ~45 minutes just to go there because of the quality of sushi. The atmosphere is very relaxed too, which we both enjoy.

Text: Nice staff, however, food was mediocre.

They hovered over us the entire time we ate our food. We couldn't enjoy anything.

Ordered yaki soba, Iowa city rolls, and seaweed salad.

Iowa city roll was not great, I wouldn't order again... 
Seaweed salad was so gross and salty.

Yaki Soba was good. Needs more flavor.
