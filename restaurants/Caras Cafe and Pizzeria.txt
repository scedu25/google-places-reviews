Text: I had been walking 20 miles before I stopped it.  I had barely entered the door when I was greeted.  Very friendly.  The food was absolutely delicious too!

Text: I had a bacon and blue cheese burger and my grandfather had the biscuts and gravy. Both were really good and the price was low for the amount of food that we got. To top it all off we had some really great service there, I was all around impressed and will look forward to stopping by again soon!

Text: The food is always really good and the staff always nice.  I'm from Sterling and go to Cara's whenever I get a chance due to the lack of good food around here

Text: Cara serves wonderful homemade sandwiches and breakfast items, as well as soups, salads, and pizza! Her specials are the best. There are plenty of healthy options too.
