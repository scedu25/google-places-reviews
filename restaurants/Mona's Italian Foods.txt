Text: There are 2 restaurants you can choose from on the weekend- Monas or Capponis- choose Capponis- nicer people, fresher food, an altogether better experience.

Text: The original Mona's....a great place, great atmosphere, and yet slightly different than its sister Capponi's and Benardi's.   Our family has come here for over 40 years.  My wife's family is from Toluca....so it's a great meeting place.  We live in Washington and visit Benardi's couple times a month, but stop in Mona's (or Capponi's) at least once a year for the memories.   They make their own pasta, sauce, and dressing.  Good stuff.

Text: Great atmosphere.  Very family friendly.  Casual environment.   Food is excellent.  Known best for their fried chicken and pasta.  Staff is courteous and down to earth.  Management is always walking around and having conversations with customers.

Text: Always a great dinner at Monas. Had family style fried chicken, salad, green beans , and half spag and tort...and of course the delish bread that I dipped in parmesan cheese sprinkled in Olive Oil.  So good.
