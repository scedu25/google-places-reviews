Text: The best part of the whole meal was the waitress. I ordered the "hand breaded" chicken tenders and have honestly had better at some gas stations. My husband had country fried steaks with gravy. The gravy was out of a can and like my chicken it was frozen out of a bag. Nothing homemade about the whole meal. Honestly disgusting.

Text: Good food and pleasant service.  Be aware they allow smoking and while they offer a no smoking section, it's an old small building, so you can't completely escape the smoke.  Personally I love the pork chops and suggest trying them.  BTW, they are closed Monday's.  Therese they're open 11-8
