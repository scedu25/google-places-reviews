Text: Had a tasty breakfast on a weekday morning. The service was fast and competent, and the food came hot. I recommend the Ranch Omelette.  The sausage gravy is also really good. Don't be shy about getting some on your hashbrowns. I look forward to my next visit!

Text: They offer a delicious piping hot all you can eat fresh home cooked lunch buffet daily, with a huge variety of scrumptious dishes on the all you can eat buffet. I found a large selection of fresh country cooked choices, golden crispy fried chicken, special cheesy potatoes, along with many fresh vegetables and salad choices. The wait staff and owners are very helpful and friendly. The restaurant is clean and welcoming. The breakfast buffet on the weekends is amazing. Try them next chance you get, we eat there often and never disappointed.

Text: Food was ok and my kids ate for free which is always a good thing. But it was made obvious by the other customers that if you're not a local, you aren't welcome there. The waitress that sat us and cashed us out was as rude as could be, but the waitress who actually served us was very nice and pleasant

Text: Not sure how anyone could rate this place good at all. Not a single smile and no apology for spilling a full drink into my wife's lap. Rude staff....! And the food.....was lousy. I'll tell everyone I know how bad this place was. I should have taken the advice I got from someone else and avoided it.
