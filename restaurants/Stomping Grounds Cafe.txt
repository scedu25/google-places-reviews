Text: These arebaome of the tastiest crepes I jave ever had. The atmosphere is exactly what one wpuld expect for a college town crepe shop. The low key studying in the corners mixed with the random games and laughter on the side. Conversations verying from light and whimsical to the deep thought provoking conversations of aspiring theologians and scholars.
