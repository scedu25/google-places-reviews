Text: Please stay away from this place! If I could give this place a 0 star I would. Food is absolutely awful! I got the Cajun Pasta and Salad. The pasta was supposed to be a cream sauce but really was just oil mixed with Cajun seasoning. super gross. The salad had no flavor to it at all the dressing might as well have been water. I will never ever be back again.

Text: The beer, service, and food are fantastic. Their garlic fries are out of this world. The food here is a bit overpriced, even for being downtown. Drinks and beer are reasonably priced. Their menu cant seem to decide if it is American, seafood, Mexican, or German- very confusing and annoying. They also need smaller menus for the high tops as an individual menu takes up half the table. Bottom line: a good place to drink or get appetizers, but I wouldn't come for a meal.

Text: The inside if the restaurant was spacious to be in the arena district. Prices were pretty moderate as well. My wife's muscles were really good but the wings were bleh. They had a great chili sauce but they need to get the actual chicken from somewhere else. The chicken was like a bar texture and pretty dry. I tried their Belgian tripel beer and it was amazing. Overall the server was polite and he knew his beers. Pretty good experience overall.

Text: Really great food and service. Food was pretty cheap too, I would recommend this place to anyone. My sliders seemed a little small but man were they delicious.

Text: Great service, friendly and prompt. Our food was delicious and I was glad to see some unique items on the menu. I'll have to go back several times to check them all out. Very good.
