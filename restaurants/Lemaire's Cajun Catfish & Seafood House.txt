Lemaire's Cajun Catfish & Seafood House

Text: I couldn't have been more impressed. This is a simple family run Cajun restaurant with outstanding service and even better food. Attracted to the crayfish in the window, we stopped by for lunch on our way through Missouri. The hush puppies were proper, the catfish was plentiful and outstanding, the rice and beans were amazing. This and a drink for under $6 during the lunch special. If I ever pass by again, I will be stopping!

Text: We have been so disappointed in Laman res since the nephew Storm has taken over management. The food is OK but the service has been terrible and my 96 year old mother has given up the beans and the rice, the Cole slaw and the hush puppies and asked for fries.  For this Storm has said that cost you 50 cents exyra.  We have eaten at Laman res for almost 5 years and have never been charge extra till Storm came along.

Text: Best Cajun in town. Well really the only Cajun in town, but a good one. Super popular with the 65+ crowd on Mondays due their special then. Recently added a bar area that seems nice, but it looks like many over look it.
