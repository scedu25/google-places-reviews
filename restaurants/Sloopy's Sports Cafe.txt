Text: Hop in your car and drive to a nicer, friendlier restaurant in Port Clinton. The service staff here is just not courteous but downright rude and borderline mean. We called to order carry out and before we could continue we were interrupted and told it would be 2 hours. We ate somewhere else that night but we called at 3 pm the next day to request 5 o'clock pick up. We were told that they couldn't guarantee a time and that our order "might be ready then or it might not." I arrived for pick up at 5:05 to find our order "was not completely ready" and to wait. I had three small grand children with me and there was only one table in use so we sat down to wait. A waitress approached and asked if we were ready to order. I said we were there to pick up a carry out and she told us to stand and wait because they needed our table. Not so. After waiting 15 more minutes our order was ready. This is a really odd way to run something as basic as a pizza parlor. We've been going to Lakeside for decades and have finally had it with Sloopy's. Never again.

Text: Their Paige's Delight specialty pizza was the BEST pizza we have ever had. Crust was perfect, taste was sensory overload-better than the ingredients might suggest.  ?

Text: The pizza there is out of this world, probably the best I've had in a long time. The pizza with strawberries was amazing and certainly worth the drive just for that. Service can lack at times, but the flavor makes up for it.

Text: Wings were great. Philly fries were just ok. The kids noodle bowl were very small could be a bigger for $5.00 charge.
