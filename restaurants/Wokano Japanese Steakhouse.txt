Wokano Japanese Steakhouse

Text: Pretty disappointed. Our chef was most unenthusiastic, even turning his back to us and dazing out the window while our food cooked. Minimal tricks and not a single smile at any point. Honestly, really just a drag. The food was hardly seasoned and overall, really just an expensive gas station version of hibachi.

Text: Good food. Brings back memories of when I was courting my wife. The tempura veggies and shrimp are really tasty.
