Text: ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!!  If I wanted to give my son Kraft mac'n cheese..yep would've stayed at home. My mouth feels totally violated. Black wilty lettuce on my husbands burger. The fries from the bottom of a bag of freezer fries....and not even crispy!! We were the only paying patrons in the place...and their family member that walked in after us got their order first? WHERE IS BAR RESCUE WHEN U NEED THEM!! this patron will never return...enter at your own risk!! I had to put a star for it to save...or no star would they have gotten!! Yuk yuk yuk

Text: Good food. Super slower service, waitresses are nice but slower than the kitchen. Wait to get waited on was insane for no busier than it was.

Text: A great place to eat. I try to come every time I get back to Ottumwa. Their homemade blue cheese dressing and tenderloin is my favorite.
