Text: So I'm an over night worker but had the night off. And so I couldn't sleep & felt hungry. Best place ever to go at 3:30am. Great service best waitress I've ever had. Amazing food came out perfect. Best lil garden salad ever. It was cheap and just great. Totally going to be back there. Waitress name was Bree I think or maybe I forgot.  But best ever specially working those weird hours, I totally get it. Anyways amazing, great, and just perfect.

Text: Place was not clean. Tables were sloppily wiped down. Floor was not clean. Water has a funny taste. The plain tea was not identifiable as tea. Waitress treated us as an inconvenience to her. The garments worn by the workers were filthy.  Very unappetizing.

Text: The place seemed very busy but we were quickly seated. Waitress did a good job getting our drinks out fast and taking our order. Food was good. I'd go back.
