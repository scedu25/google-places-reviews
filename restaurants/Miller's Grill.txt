Just passing through and decided to stop for dinner. Well I'm glad we did!
The prime rib was amazing!  
My wife said her bacon cheeseburger was awesome and everything else we had was oh so good.
service was great! Place was nice and quiet and clean. 
We will definitely stop by again if in the area.

Text: My wife and I have been going to this restaurant for years during special occasions.  The last 12 months we have seen a decline in the quality of food and neatness of staff. The facility has developed a faint odor that is just noticeable enough to curb an appetite. Miller's Grill has turned into a nice quaint cafe.
