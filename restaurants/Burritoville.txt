Text: Burritoville is a truly Mexican culinary gem in DeKalb. It serves up some of the best and most authentic Mexican dishes and does so superlatively. This spot is also great after a long night of drinking at the bars.

Text: I've always gotten served very quickly here, but the food quality is quite variable. I received one of the best plates of nachos that I've ever had on my first visit here (fresh fried chips, excellent guac, etc.), then TERRIBLE nachos on my last 3 visits (stale chips, slightly-off guac, cold, etc.). Ditto for tacos-occasionally very good, but usually pretty bad. I think I'm about done with the place at this point-there's a consistently competent Mexican place literally across the street, so it's pretty silly to keep throwing my money into the Mexican food equivalent of a slot machine.
