Text: We went today for lunch, a carry out.  When we got home, my soup was missing.   I called and told them.  A young girl made a special trip to deliver the soup.  Now that is going above and beyond.  The food is always fresh and so good but thus service was exceptional.  Thanks so much

Text: So I have ate at several McAllister's over the Midwest and always had wonderful service but, today was exceptional. Sara did such an awesome job helping us and getting our order (which was a specialized order) correct. So if you're out and about and want a great place to eat with just absolutely the best service, stop here and see Sara, and you'll be taken well care of.
