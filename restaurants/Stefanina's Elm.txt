Text: Salad is disappointing,  but garlic cheese bread is delicious.   Spaghetti with meatball is proportionally large.  However, the sauce had a slightly burnt taste and unfortunately that was the only flavor it had.  Obviously was heated straight out of a can with nothing else done to add flavor.  

Service was friendly even though it seemed having 2 tables with orders plus a couple of call in orders was overwhelming to the 2 workers working, one of which was also making deliveries.   But have a large and nicely priced lunch hour menu.

Text: I always had great pizza there but
The last 2 times I went my pizza was burnt to a crisp!  It was a carryout so I called the manager and she gave me a credit so all was good! Then today I went and was the only customer and pizza was burnt and couldn't even eat it!!  I feel like it was deliberate!! So that cost me $10.00. I will not go back to ekn street location again!!

Text: Food has always been good. Usually dine in for lunch and the service is pretty quick. Wish they still served Coke products.
