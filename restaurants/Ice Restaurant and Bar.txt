Text: We went there for lunch while downtown at Beth Moore seminar today. We were in the first 10 groups in the door... Order our food in a timely manner but we were the last group to get our food in a packed restaurant and the last to leave. We asked to speak to the owner but they never told her. No apology just said "the Wraps are faster... Now soup and sandwiches is all we ordered... Nothing fancy just plain. Now the food was delicious.... I won't be coming there for anytime soon....

Text: Let me start off by saying this place is HORRIBLE... i had lunch here this week and the hostess was rude and had a attitude. She looked like a drug addicted. She even had visible track marks on here arm! The food was terrible for the price they charge i could honestly get better tasting food from another place down the street for cheaper!! I felt as if everyone who worked there didn't even want to be there! The service is just plain terrible!! I won't be going back here and I don't recommend anyone to eat here!!

Text: Food was awesome and the restaurant was clean and staff well groomed. All the important things for s quick supper before a concert. If you haven't already tried it go ahead  it's a gem of a restaurant . Toledo's very own  hidden gem .

Text: Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Dinner tonight was just what I wanted! An outstanding Greek salad with the addition of steak! The homemade dressing was just right!
