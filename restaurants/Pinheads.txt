Text: Wow this is a really cool bowling alley and more! There is an arcade, dining, and sand volleyball area. They play great music. The seats are comfortable and it does not feel cramped. There are cool little Dinosaur helpers for small kiddos to help them bowl!

Text: It was alot nicer than I expected. The food was decent and the bowling areas and bathrooms were clean. The bar could have been better staffed. It was slow service.

Text: Two different skeet ball machines reduced my ball count during the game which lead to points not being counted which lead to my four year old son beating me two times at this game!

For that reason alone I can only give Pinheads three stars. Fix your arcade machines folks. Now my son won't stop reminding me that he beat me at skeet ball!
