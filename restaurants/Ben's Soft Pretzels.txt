Ben's Soft Pretzels

Text: Today was the first bad experience. I asked for the pretzel bites to go, they were going to be my dinner, needless to say I had one when I got to my car.  They were horrible. The pretzels must have been in the case for hours. They were hard and tasteless. If it wasn't 93 degrees out, and I wasn't parked so far away I would have gone back to get a refund.  Aunt Annie's is in the mall, next time, I'll give them a try.

Text: Very poor this time.

Getting a pretzel from the mall is a must do everytime I go. Today I was the first customer, I was served a cold pretzel with even colder nacho cheese. What a terrible experience. From a place that used to serve good food.

I would never recommend going early.

Text: Best pretzel you will ever have!  One pretzel is enough for my family of 3.  We love their nacho sauce also. Its a mandatory stop when at the mall!

Text: Out of all the places I've eaten these at, this place has a different taste. Pretzel doesn't taste the same but the nacho cheese is by far the best dip. Overall I love these pretzels and will go to no other place.
