Gino's

Text: A great place to enjoy your favorite Italian dishes.  Gino's father had a place on the East side of KC called "Have a Snack" ....thru the 70's my family ate there often and my favorite sandwich was his famous Italian steak.  They still use the same red sauce and the sandwich is still dead on as I remember.  I had a side of pasta...my wife had meat filled ravioli.  All was wonderful...and a step back in time for me.  Don't miss this...we will make it a frequent stop for us....for sure!

Text: Absolutely loved the food! I'm a culinary student and this was worth every penny! We were looking for something local and yummy. This place met and exceeded everything expectation! Also loved the atmosphere. Gino is one of those guys you want to listen to his story and his journey to get to where he is. He brought that light throughout the entire restaurant. Another amazing restaurant for the traveling books

Text: Some of the best Itallian food north of KC. Worth driving to Kearney. The prices are cheaper than Olive Garden, and the food far exceeds it. Fresh, friendly, and delicious.
