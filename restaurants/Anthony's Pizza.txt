Anthony's Pizza

Text: Good food at a good price. Wild Wednesday deal is the best for pizza. They also have a lunch buffet and are connected to Anthony's Wild West restaurant which serves burgers, steaks and everything else. Both are owned and operated by the same person. Anthony's Wild West is a little pricier than the pizza shop. I have always had good experiences with both.
