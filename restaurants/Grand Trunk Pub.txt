Grand Trunk Pub
Rating: 5
Text: Always a five star experience here.  Great local pub with delicious food.  The Foran burger is one of their signature sandwiches (pictured) accompanied with a homemade Bloody Mary.  It's a must try! They also do an awesome Brunch. Great beer selection and full bar.  This used to be an of ticket station for the train back in the day, hence the beautiful architecture.

Text: Food is good, not a ton of variety though. Drink selection is excellent. The speed of the food is the biggest downfall. It takes absolutely forever. I’ve been here for brunch and dinner on a number of occasions and without fail, the service is incredibly slow.

Text: Went on a first date with my boyfriend here. We just had drinks and chatted. Stayed for hours because the atmosphere was excellent. Even though it was busy, the acoustics made conversation easy. No one pressured us to order more, or to move on so they could turn over the table. Tables were a little too close together, so there wasn't much privacy, but overall a wonderful place to make an important memory.

Text: I always enjoy coming to Grand truck. They have a solid beer collection and our bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. I also recommend checking out The Whiskey Room.

Text: Great food and good atmosphere. Great place to just grab a drink, or go for a full meal. Would recommend to anyone visiying Hart Plaza or downtown in general.
