Art & Joe

Text: The owner makes a mean latte and is very friendly.
There is a slight "My Little Pony" obsession. MLP art, decor, episodes playing on TV.
It's definitely different, but the ambience is welcoming and the coffee is great.

Text: I can truly tell you that this little shop offers the best espresso drinks around!  They serve Kaldi coffee and they also serve home-baked muffins, cookies and scones.  It's a great place to meet friends and have a cup of "Joe".  Stop by while in town!
