Text: Very slow service due to there only being one waitress. Food is good though.

Edit: Started with four stars then deducted a star for every 15 minutes it took to get the bill after getting boxes for left overs. Waitress seemed more interested in going outside to smoke or spending her time in the back with the cook.
