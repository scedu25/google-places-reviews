Text: Overall a good spot to grab a fairly quick bite. Last time we went, they gave my daughter in noodles and added seasoning we had asked to not have. It took them 10 minutes to get the noodles back out to us and they served 3 other tables. This is the first poor experience we've had, but the reason for the 3 instead of 4 stars.

Text: Good food. Clean restaurant.  Ideal for a quick bite that's not fast food.

Text: I am not thrilled with the food here, its good, not great but very fresh tasting. The mac n cheese is pretty good though. I give it 4 stars because its clean and fresh and still pretty good and the people working are always nice. Plus my husband loves it!

Text: First time here. Came with my 9 year old. We both got spicy dishes & weren't disappointed! Delicious, fresh food! My first thought when I saw the food was "well they didn't really fill the bowl" however, the small was still plenty of food! We will definitely be back.
