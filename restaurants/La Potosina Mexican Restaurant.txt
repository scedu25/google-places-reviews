Text: Good food, clean appearance over all! Our waitress did good! Our group of 18 kept her busy! Bless her heart, she then got another large party of 20! Not sure why, but there was only her for 40 people. Manager did help serve plates & did a few refills! We never did get a ticket! Was told to just go to the register & tell them what we had! We could have been dishonest & 'dine & dashed', but we are not that type!

Text: Ordered chicken fajitas, a children's combo, and an adult combo.  Didn't receive correct food for the adult combo dinner.  Never received more chips, when the basket was empty.  Service was okay, but restaurant was pretty dirty.  Wouldn't eat here again.
