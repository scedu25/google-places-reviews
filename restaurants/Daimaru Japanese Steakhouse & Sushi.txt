Daimaru Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi

Text: My wife and I went tonight arriving about 5:50. The host was confused when seating us. A party of 3 was seated in the middle of the long table between both grills leaving an odd seating arrangement.  After seating us, the waitress was suprised as she had already started table service at the grill we were seated at.  The party of 3 then informed the waitress they were waiting on another 2 in their party still. This confusion carried over throughout the meal as the extra 2 arrived as the chef was starting to prepare the rice. Multiple items were missed, the group of now 5 extended to the other grill.  The chef struggled to keep orders straight and had to even make a trip back to the kitchen for additional food. The whole process was a mess.  It took nearly two hours from the time we walked in until we received our final check. Sade the waitress did an Amazing Job of keeping her composure and trying to please everyone. Without her, this would of been a complete disaster. This was our first trip to Daimaru as we live about 40 minutes away. Not sure we will attempt a visit again anytime soon.

Text: So we were here for my son's birthday. Not only did we end up in a grill top with some really rude people but they seemed to just be out to ruin it for everyone else.  I have never been so greatful for Justine our waitress and Christian our grill master.  They made my son's day with pictures, a hat, smiles, lots of laughs and just great personality.  So they food was great but we couldn't have asked for a better people to celebrate with cause they made it a perfect atmosphere.

Text: Food is amazing when you dine in but  Togo sushi orders sucks.  There never cut right and loosely wraped.  We always tell them no ginger or wasabi  and they always go ahead put it in.  I will be never ordering food to go from them again. Dining is the only way to get the best service
