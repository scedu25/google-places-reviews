Text: Ate here last week with my adult kids. Wasn"t too thrilled about the atmosphere. Air conditioning was on, blowing on our backs. The music was way too loud, food wasn't enticing. Don't think I'll go here again. Although, if you want a good drink and chat with a friend, it's a good place but not as a family. Wouldn't take younger kids here at all.

Text: The food is okay but the service is great--no complaints even if I forget to ask for burritos without beans, they smiled and re-ordered my burrito. Waiters and Waitresses are very friendly and pleasant.

Text: Food was good and the waiter Chris and came to the table a couple times before the food got there. We were maybe half way done eating and brought us our check. Never asked us if we wanted another drink or dessert before leaving the check. Felt hurried.

Text: My party was seated and sat totally unnoticed for over 20 minutes, no chips, no drink order, nothing. We also got up and left without being noticed at all. On the bright side we tried the authentic mexican place right down the road by the tracks and had good service and fantastic food for less money than we would have spent here.
