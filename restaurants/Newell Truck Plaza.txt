Text: Nice little stop. Mostly 5 stars for NO BIODIESEL BLEND. Now there's no way of knowing it as fuel stations in KS are not required to disclose the percentage of biodiesel, however the pump decal showed pure diesel, and the manager stated that they've stopped blending about a year ago.

Text: Ordered the liver & onions @ the restaurant & got 2 pieces that was real thing & slightly over cooked. Plus, my baked potato was a little over done. Service was satisfactory,, just ok.
