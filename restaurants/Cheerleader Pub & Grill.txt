Text: Bloody Mary tasted good on this rainy Sunday. Lacy recommended the quesadilla. It was great! They have $5 appetizers and all the games on!!! No matter where you sit, you can see the game you want.

Text: Came here for lunch, the food wasn't bad at all but is a tad pricey for what you get. the waitress wasn't the most professional but she wasn't rude or anything either. What made this a 5 star experience was the manager Sam! We had lunch during a slow time and she came out to check on us, ask how our food was, apologized and explained the waitress was new, we had a great chat and overall turned this average experience into great one!

Text: One of the laziest, piss poor managers I have ever seen. The wonderful waitress and waiter took care of 40 plus people while the manager sat or stood by the bar drinking her water. I starred at her across the room. She starred back.  I will give her credit for  checking the thermostat, bringing ice to the bar, and delivering a few, very few orders. She sould have helped in so many ways. At one point she hid on the other side of the bar, drinking her water when she should have been asking the customers if they needed a refill. I can not stand lazy people who do not do their job. The food was good but the manager needs to work a morning shift at Bob Evans to learn how things are done.

Text: Average service, average food. The drinks were good and the building was very open and clean looking. They were not busy at all for a 7pm dinner, although it wasn't a game night.
