Text: They say best sandwich in Missouri and they might be right!  It definitely has the small country town feel and it's perfect!  They can and are happy to customize everything. Highly recommend.

Text: Warm, intimate,  and homey feeling restaurant with a touch of history.   Food is creative, delicious, and offers great selection for different diets.   Their ingredients are fresh and that certainly comes across.   My family had a wide range of food particularities,  they were able to accommodate.   We had a bit of a wait for lunch, you might want to call ahead or just be ready to wait at busier times.
