Text: Potato soup was watery! It normally is very creamy,  and I was so looking forward to having the coconut cream pie, that I always have when I come to McPherson, but it didn't taste the same , no coconut flavor! I ate it of course, but was saddened!!!! I've always loved everything before!!! Sorry

Text: Kim and her staff always provide a good experience at the Deli. The Reuben sandwich is my favorite and soup in a bread bowl can't be beat! Often I will try the "Featured Sandwich" to branch out a little and I am never disappointed!

Text: Foods was exceptionally good at a reasonable price. Place was busy and it took quite a while to place order. I had the chicken taco salad and would buy it again.
