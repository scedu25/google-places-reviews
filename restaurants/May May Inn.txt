Text: Very bad experience. I've lived in many places and eaten in many Asian restaurants but I've never been charged extra for white rice. It's always been included in the price of the dishes. One dish = one complementary white rice. $3.90+tax for two tiny boxes of plain and white rice when you order 3 different dishes for more than $30 is NOT normal. I've already had a bad experience of the same nature with them before and thought I should give them a second chance... Never again. Customers should rebel against these stupid and cheap policies. It's pathetic.
