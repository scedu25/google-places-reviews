Text: Ordered sesame chicken. Menu states that it's breaded and fried. Picture on the menu shows a beautiful picture of golden fried sesame chicken. Order comes out as just marinated plain chicken breast cubes. Was told i was in the wrong for not stating that i wanted it like menu and and picture shows. Horrible service. Over priced, bland food. Don't recommend.

Text: 10/10 doctors recommend. Best food around, tons of vegetarian and a few vegan options, friendly attentive staff and cute atmosphere.

Text: I love this place.  Sushi is always fresh and so are the entrees.  Pork fried rice is amazing!  The pork strips get just a little crispy on the edges and the veggies are perfect.  Not hard and not mush.  The rice is never mushy in anything I order and I love their seaweed salad.  It's not for everyone though.  They will make anything you want them to.  Don't forget to tip your sushi chef!  Love this place,  best restaurant in town.  Most consistent with their food, and most importantly fresh, fast, friendly service.
