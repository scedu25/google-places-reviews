Mediocre food and mediocre service. Good drink selections tho.

Text: Not very impressed by the food quality got the price.  I ordered the Brunch hash and my food was very overcooked.  The black beans were almost mush and the egg was very dried out from being over-fried.  I understand the price for a nice brunch but the food should be spot-on, and it was simply sub-par.  Also, my friend got the Eggs Benedict, and her eggs were completely hard- much more akin to hard boiled than poached.  I mean, not the biggest deal but when you pay $14 for a classic dish it should be perfect.

Text: Amazing brunch with bottomless champagne and delicious dinner items.

Only been here 3 times, but each was amazing. Brunch has lots of not-so-expensive items with bottomless champagne. Everything was delicious.

Dinner also has lots of options, but for a prettier penny. The chicken is absolutely melt-in-your-mouth and incredible. Steaks are great too. And for dessert, the sorbets they had were one of a kind. Blueberry and mango sorbets that had a ton of flavor. 

Would definitely recommend.

Text: Good food and beer, but a bit overpriced for Champaign. Doesn't always feel like it's worth the money. But the patio is truly a nice place to hang out
