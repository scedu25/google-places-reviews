Westphalia Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Outstanding place tucked away in a quaint town that's a mini version of Hermann, MO without the river.  Westphalia Inn is housed in an all-brick hotel, built in 1930 but now, the rooms have been converted into a restaurant on the first floor, and a bar/wine tasting area on the second.  The bar serves pizza, nachos, and appetizers, while the restaurant, which is only open Friday and Saturday for dinner, and Sunday for lunch and dinner has a simple menu--fried chicken, German Pot Roast, and ham and Kobe beef hamburgers. Dinners are served either by the plate, family-style, or a smaller portion in a basket.  We got the family-style German Pot Roast and Fried Chicken.  For starters, they brought out homemade bread, real butter and jelly, and freshly made sweet and sour slaw.  Dinner came out with real mashed potatoes and brown gravy, string beans, a sweet cucumber and onion salad, and sliced tomatoes.  We found out that the chicken is pan fried in an iron skillet, and is hormone-free and locally sourced from Backes Poultry in Loose Creek, MO.  The Inn's owners also have a winery and feature their Norton wine in the bar and restaurant, and they also raise Kobe beef, which we were told they use for their  pot roast.  The ham is from Burger's Smokehouse in California, MO. The tomatoes and cucumbers came out of the inn's garden and could not have been more fresh.  If you're up for a weekend jaunt in central Missouri, stop by and visit.
