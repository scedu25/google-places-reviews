Text: We had the most fantastic experience at Andiamo recently!  Where do I start?  First of all, the food was absolutely fantastic!  I had the filet, and I can honestly say I've never had a steak this good!  Everything we had was incredible.  The desserts, oh my!  I got the tuxedo (I think that's what it was called) and I'm still thinking about it days later.  Above and beyond the food, the staff were fantastic!  Our waitress was great, helpful but didn't impose on our time.  The manager Ali was seriously the nicest person I have ever met.  We would go back again and again just to chat with Ali, as he added to our whole experience.

Text: I can't say enough about the staff and management here. They treated us very well ... then when they found out we were celebrating an anniversary, they all went above and beyond to make this special night even more special. It almost overshadowed the fact that the food was delicious and presentation was beautiful. The outdoor dining was a scenic, peaceful atmosphere.  This is our new favorite restaurant.

Text: This place is so dirty and the carpet is disgusting! I along with my family came to have a nice dinner on Sunday..which they open at 4 pm..you'd think they'd have plenty of time to cleanup this highly priced place. The food was not fresh either it was as if it was reheated leftovers! The chairs are not comfortable, and dirty! For such  a highly priced menu you'd think that this place would at least keep this place spotless! Paper menu's were dirty too! 
I will never go back to Andiamo's again! Disgusting!

Text: Clean establishments, wonderful service delicious food. I'd say it's a tad pricey 17+ $$. Food was very flavorful, great portions.
