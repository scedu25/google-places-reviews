Text: Besides the low prices for alcohol, it's hard to highlight good experiences from my visit here. Maybe they were too busy on a holiday, but the place was crowded, dark, and loud. It also seemed understaffed for such a high number of clients, which resulted in bartenders' inability to keep up with everyone on time.

Text: Although the food was tasty, I can't get past the filthy state of the place. The restrooms are especially nasty. The floors in the entire place are hideous, which begs the question of the kitchen's cleanliness.  Management! Turn on the lights, hire a professional company to scrub regularly.

Text: Good food in the day and a really good happy hour menu. Wings are to die for. College crowd parties at night. It's got a lot going on.
