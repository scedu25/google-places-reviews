Ram Restaurant & Brewery

Text: Very good family dinner on a casual Saturday. Each of us had vastly different meal choices which worked out. Only complaint is the 2 still frozen dessert cupcakes. After bringing up this issue, a manager came over and quickly resolved it for us. Keeper location another occasion.

Text: Better than average bar food, more creative and better prepared than most. Service in the restaurant section is always good. Join their email list to get lots of good offers and special discounts particularly on holiday weekends. Currently (10 - 1) has a limited time add on menu with some very interesting items

Text: Place used to be good and used to have good food and decent service but they are slipping hard. The few people who work here who like their job actually do a good job but almost everyone else doesn’t seem like they want to be here at all. Customer service is not that great, even on slow nights. Food overall is 6/10. Service is a generous 2/10.

Text: I've been going here for years and it's my favorite family restaurant for great food and friendly service. If "Cheers" was a real place, RAM would be that place for us. It's a huge place, with a full bar, dining room, private events room, and outdoor dining, so you can do anything you need to do there. They are constantly updating the food and beverage menu so it never gets stale, and the customer service is fantastic. I can truly recommend bringing the whole family.
