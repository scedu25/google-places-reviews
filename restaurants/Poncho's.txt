Text: If I could give this place half a star I would, we had 4 dinners and none of them were any good. The shrimp tacos were flavorless and made with salad shrimp I even found a price of burnt bacon in one, the hard tacos had barley any meat and no cheese, the rice was horrible and the beans were horrendous. The only thing with flavor was the cheese dip.

Text: I loved this place as a kid and so I had to bring my kids to try it. Sadly the food wasn't as good as I remembered and none of us finished our meals. I will always have fond memories of this place but I will not be going back.
