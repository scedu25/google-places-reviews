Text: The service is gòod. The food is fair. Lots of small portions. The beans and rice are out of a can. The drinks are watered down. The prices are way to high. I've had better burritos at taco bell. The vegetables like  tomatoes are hard as a rock.The meat they use is full of fat and tough.  I have had wonderful mexican food in lots of cities, but they need to make an effort to taste and portions. Won't be back .

Text: Great authentic Mexican food! My favorite Mexican restaurant around....Clay Center is beyond lucky to have such a gem! Fast service, and even better, they recently obtained a liquor license so you can order a yummy margarita to go with your delicious meal. They provide generous portions, too! Highly recommended.
