Taco Delite

Text: Great American Mexican food. Taco D is a local favorite for a lot of residents especially compared to Taco Bell. Great prices and great service. I tried it for the first time a few months ago and got a burrito. It was nicely sized and had a really good flavor. It was smothered in red sauce. I had to wait a little while but it was worth it! Definitely try this spot out!

Text: Just driving thru Pratt. Have a Taco Bell but I'll always try another taco place before them! Glad Pratt has Taco Delight cuz that was really good tacos! Nice little place, clean and friendly. Hit Taco Delight if your going thru Pratt. Way better than your typical fast food places.

Text: I went to the drive thru. Got in line  to order at 1228. Got my food at 101. 33 minutes waiting for 4 tacos. They were good but I won't be back. Nobody has that much time to wait. I would give zero stars but that wasn't an option.
