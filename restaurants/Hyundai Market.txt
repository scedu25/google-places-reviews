Text: Best place for original Korean food. The menu is authentic, filling and oh so savory. They also have a great market. The prices are reasonable. Don't waste your time and money going anywhere else.

Text: Great menu of fairly authentic Korean food! The ladies are very friendly and the food is reasonably priced. The menu is not huge, but it should cover every taste. There's a grocery on site as well that has a wide selection of Asian foods. I love to have a melon pop from the grocery after lunch there.  Reminds me of Seoul!

Text: Like most small Korean stores operating on slim margins, you can expect to find several expired market items listed at full price.  The restaurant food is good but would not be surprised to discover they recycle side dishes, as it is a common practice at a lot of smaller Korean restaurants.  It is worth the extra 30 minutes to travel to 888 mart or another larger asian market with better prices and fresher products.
