Jeff Ruby's Carlo & Johnny
Rating: 5
Text: It's no secret how much I love Jeff Ruby and just about anything he is associated with, so it was only a matter of time before I made it to Carlo & Johnny to check out what it had to offer. 

The layout is much different than his other restaurants, and it feels like a large home, rather than a traditional restaurant. The first thing that stands out is the raw bar, something I had not seen at his other locations. We enjoyed some of the largest shrimp I've ever seen and a king crab legs that was out of control. 

We enjoyed a drink at the very crowded bar before dinner and listened to the live music playing. The bar had a speakeasy vibe about it that was really nice. After we were seated at our table we enjoyed service of outstanding quality that feels personalized to you. Its the service I've always received at all of his restaurants. Not to mention this guy knows steak, no other steak ever compares. 

We were celebrating my sister's birthday and they even took our picture and put it in a frame for us both to take home. But the final touch came a week later when I received a thank you card from the manager delivered to my home.

Text: Perfect in every way! New York Strip cooked exactly as ordered. Tender and delicious. My wife had the Chicken Parmesan and had enough for 2 meals. 
Our waiter, Zac, helped make the meal as fabulous as it was. He was naturally personable, informed, and most professional.
Can't wait to return. Don't know how the entire experience could have been any better. As always, Carlo and Johnny exceeded the hype.

Text: Amazing food and amazing service. The location is cozy and adorable. Of course it's expensive, but it's true when they say you get what you pay for. Best steak I've ever had. It was my husband's birthday, and I guess we wrote on the reservation that it was a birthday dinner. They surprised us with a slice of amazing cheesecake, took our photo, and even printed the photo out for us right there. It was such a special touch! Will definitely be back.

Text: Great food if you are willing to pay the price. Easily the best steak chain in the Cincinnati area! Their carrot cake is out of this world! My one critique would be that while the service has always been excellent, the restaurant occasionally gives the waiters too many tables to manage, resulting in the waiters not being able to check in as often as they ideally would, this might be out of the restaurants control is it is extremely hard to find help meeting the high standards Jeff Ruby's demands.
