Text: Room was very clean and upscale, there is a TV in the mirror in the bathroom, the mirror in the bathroom was heated so the center doesn't fog up. The beds very comfortable, and pillows ranged from hard to soft. The concierge very helpful in recommendations for food and attractions. Definitely looking forward to the convention I am coming in October to attend at this hotel. I came out ahead of time to get an idea of what to expect in October and I know it will be a great experience thanks to the exceptional service I received this visit.

Text: Overall the place was very clean and the rooms were very nice decorated. We went to a convention there and the place is pretty large. They had a great amount of parking so we didn't have to walk far to get in. I felt that overall the place was very organized and well kept. Definitely would recommend to a friend or family.
