Text: Food is absolutely delicious with generous potions sizes, too! With fast, friendly service from a clean, cheerful restaurant.

We really appreciate their LUNCH SPECIAL MENU - with 37 varieties to choose from for ONLY  $5.45 each (as of 7/7/17), which includes choice of sides. They also offer the most generous availability for their LUNCH SPECIAL MENU: Available 7 days a week from open until 3 pm. SERIOUSLY!?! That has got to be the BEST offering of ANY restaurant we've even known.

MY PHOTOS
Taken 7/7/17 - three lunch orders:
#L32 Pineapple Chicken
#L19 Beef w/ Chinese Vegetables
#L16 Sauteed Mixed Vegetables
*We ordered each with same sides - Roasted Pork Fried Rice, Roasted Pork Egg Roll, and as always, includes a Fortune Cookie

NOTE: We enjoy the "order to go". First, we rather enjoy eating with 'real plates & utensils' vs. plastic ware - looks beautiful plated, too. PLUS, we enjoy creating our own "mini buffet" where everyone tries it all. Generous portions: this order of 3 LUNCH SPECIALS fed 5 adults and one toddler. 

WARNING:
Their menu is extensive!
Not a bad thing, but easy to be overwhelmed.  We have a 'take home menu' that we mark our personal rating for each new item we try. Fun and Adventurous, right!?! LoL

HINT:
See their "PHOTOS" for more info as I'll add more menu photos & descriptions as we try more varieties.
