Luna's Fine Dining & Catering
Rating: 5
Text: I've been to a couple Chamber of Commerce daytime retreats at Luna's in which we talked and strategized business with the group, and then took a break to prepare our meal together (at least many parts of it) and then sit back down and enjoy it together. 2 times out of 2 it's been a really rewarding experience. Heather, the manager, communicated well and was a great hostess, and the food was terrific. Really worth considering for a unique group dining experience.
