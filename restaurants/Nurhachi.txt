Text: Good, but pricey for large groups (I think it's about 8 a bowl, or 10 for unlimited). My family loves the hibachi, but personally I prefer Hu Hot (more options, more explanation) but since it's over an hour away, this isn't a bad substitute. They do sell some things, like sushi, as well for an extra price. I do wish they explained the sauces and things more, like with Hu Hot, they need a sign that tells how much of each sauce to use for certain flavors and tells the spicy level of each one. They could also use some more signs or maybe have the server explain what to do, because if I hadn't been with people who had been there before, I would have been lost. Even with help, it was still a bit confusing and I had trouble getting my food the way I liked it.

Text: Great for large parties.  No one can complain about their meal because they put it in the bowl to be cooked.  Crowd pleaser.

Text: I like this place but courtesy is a bit half and half for me sometimes they are nice other times not so much. Is a little pricy if you are on a budget. I got a lunch there one day and they charged me diner price for it even though I pointed out their mistake. I left my debit card at the register one day and realized after closing time but called the people inside and they let me in to get it which was nice. I enjoy their sushi it's pretty good in my opinion. I'd give them two and a half stars just because of how ifey it is.
