Text: The Golden Margarita is amazing. Delicious Mexican food, nice staff with a strong family vibe, Edgar the owner is warm and welcoming, and they are willing to do whatever you ask. My Mother has Alzheimer's and can be picky about her food, especially meat because she has trouble with her utensils and is embarrassed that she needs us to cut her food up for her. I asked if the grilled chicken could be cut into small pieces and they gladly, happily accommodated the request. A great place for a good meal out.

Text: Fantastic atmosphere and friendly staff. I used to live in Mexico, and recognized a number of items on this menu that one does not typically see at U.S based Mexican restaurants. I have learned to temper my expectations when eating Mexican food in the Midwest, but I was not at all dialing this time. Everything was delicious and I will be back.

Text: Great place for lunch.  The doors was amazing and they are able to accommodate a gluten allergy with no problem.  Make sure you try the tomatillo salsa!

Text: The food here never fails to please. My tostadas with pork were very tasty. And whatever that green sauce that they serve with the chips is... can't get enough of it. We will be back.

Text: Homemade gluten free chips were awesome! Salsa and pico were also great as well as the guacamole. Fast and nice service and really good tamales!
