Text: Convenient location in Fremont, clean rooms and good water pressure in shower. Did not care too much for the bed but ok for one night. Reasonably priced.

Text: Our experience here at Oak Tree Inn in Fremont has been incredible.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  The rooms have anything and everything you would need in a room.  We have never stayed in a room that was so quiet and that could get so dark, making it easy to stay asleep in the morning.  The housekeeping staff does an excellent job keeping the room  super clean.   What makes the experience so wonderful is the friendly, helpful, accommodating staff- especially Nancy and Brenda. Andrew was very helpful as well.   They really took great care of us, especially when we had to return unexpectedly.   They were so loving and  caring  towards our dog too!  We would highly recommend the Oak Tree Inn to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Fremont area.
