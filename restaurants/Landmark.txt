Text: food was exceptional!  the chicken noodle soup was delicious and home made.  The pork tenderloin was hand breaded and very generous portion.  Hubby got the 1/2 lb bacon cheeseburger and it was very good as well.  prices were reasonable and service was great...efficient and friendly.  We'll be back again.

Text: First time there but the food was good. Good soup, chicken sandwich was good. Sweet potato fries were awesome. Tortellini and cod sandwich were great too. Service was on point. All in all glad we stopped.

Text: Traveling from Milwaukee my 3 year old son and I stopped here to get something better to eat than fast food and after 45 minutes without getting our food we chose to walk into the Casey's that is connected to it and grab some pizza so we can get home back to Kansas City. I can't write the food but the service was terrible we were brought water and then they took our order 15 minutes after the water was brought to the table and 30 minutes later we chose to leave. We travel this route on occasion and we'll never stop at this little crappy place again. Why would it take so long for a grilled cheese sandwich and a pork chop? I am disgusted

Text: We have been here twice.  The first time was okay, not great.  The last time we went the side salad was disgusting.  The food was below average.  All of this for an above average price.
