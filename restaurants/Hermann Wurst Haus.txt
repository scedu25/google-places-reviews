Hermann Wurst Haus
Rating: 5
Text: Took the wurst-making class 9/9, and as advertised, it was the "wurst" time ever!  Mike and Ron were great, sharing their knowledge and experience freely, and it was evident that they loved what they do.  I came away feeling like I had the confidence to try making my own sausage, and look forward to giving it a go.  The Wurst Haus itself is worth the visit, full of great products, awesome deli, and we can't forget the beer.  I will definitely be coming back.

Text: The Hermann Wurst Haus is definitely one of the places you have to stop by if you are in the area. The food is delicious and the staff is fantastic. We've been there twice and attended the Wurst 101 class and enjoyed it thoroughly - did NOT leave hungry. We will definitely come back again!

Thanks to the Wurst Haus Team for a great time!

Text: If you're in Hermann, you've got to at least see this place. It's like Cracker Barrel meets the local Butcher store. I kept reading reviews saying how great the pear Gorgonzola is. Fortunately, it was one of the four brats that could be sampled. It was delicious. I ordered it. I did not receive it. I carried my plate back up the front where the girl was standing ready at the register. She seemed confused at first, but quickly and politely fixed my order without skepticism or attitude. I wanted my family to experience the brats for themselves. They were not only impressed with the brats, but with the sides as well. Dad kept talking about how sweet the baked beans were, and also how he liked the German potato salad better than that served at Stone Hill's Vintage restaurant. I look forward to my next visit.

Advice to the owner: The brats were barely warm. It may be wise to either crank up the heat lamp/steam table, prepare fewer at a time, or offer a microwave in the dining area. It may also be good for business not to close at 6 p.m. on a Saturday evening, especially when special events draw crowds of tourists into the streets.

Text: Amazing service and food. Make sure you go for lunch or atleast stop in and get some sausages to go! Your dogs will love the large bones they sale by the pound.
