Text: We had our small wedding dinner here and have also been a handful of other times. Absolutely the best service and cuts of steak around! You can't beat the cozy atmosphere and the friendly owner who finds time to visit each table! HIGHLY recommend for a great steak and awesome customer service

Text: Delicious!! We showed up at 8:00pm on a Monday evening and we were seated immediately. Drinks ordered and delivered immediately and appetizers came shortly after. The meal arrived right after we were finished with our appetizers.  Our drinks also stayed full without even asking for refills. We had dessert and coffee. We are from out of town but if we lived here, we would be regulars!!
