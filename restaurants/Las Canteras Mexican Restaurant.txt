Text: Great service. Authentic Mexican food.  Came with the whole family and they had no problem serving all 20 of us.  Considering our large group they brought all the orders very quickly.  They also had no problem giving everyone the correct bill.

Text: I would give less than one star if available.  This was a very negative dining experience.  While the restaurant ambiance is quite nice, the food was terrible and service not much better.  Seasoned travelers that KNOW good Mexican food could find nothing redeemable in the table fare.  Food presentation was also poor.  Save your money and dine elsewhere.

Text: Stopped here for lunch on a whim during a road trip. It's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu with many impressive options. Several of the menu options were unique dishes that I had never seen on a Mexican food menu before. I ordered the Pollo Veracruz and it was fantastic. Tasty and unique. I may have to drive back to Kansas just to go there. Excellent service and clean bathroom as well.
