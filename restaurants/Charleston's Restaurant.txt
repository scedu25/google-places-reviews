Text: The atmosphere in this establishment is the best. Try to get seated in the dinning booth area. You can see directly into the kitchen where they have a wood burning grill! The wall sconces with real flames burning set the mood too! The decore is gorgeous and peaceful. You must try the smoked salmon and a blended Peach Bellini! *****

Text: Had a good time. Food is always good and while the menu is small, all the items are tasty and unique in there own way. Having a smaller menu allows the chef to perfect and touch each dish,  rather then having so many to cook and crank out like an average quick-serve American restaurant.
