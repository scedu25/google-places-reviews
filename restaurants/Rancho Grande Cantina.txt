Text: The salsa that they serve with the chips is disgusting. It tastes like its made with tomato sauce and no flavor. The menu is not appealing, there is no authentic food at all. Ordered a steak fajita burrito and that actually had flavor and a hint of heat from seasonings. Not too terrible.
Waitress had body odor. Yuck!
The cheese dip was the best part of the meal.

Text: Terrible Service, We came with a group of 9 which I understand is an unusally large group and can be difficult to sit. But we were told that it would take around 20 minutes so that they could clear 2 tables in order to fit us, but instead it took an 1 hour and 30 minutes and then we finally decided to leave and go to Mi Hacienda down the street with no wait. The reason why I say they have horrible service is because during our wait they sat 4 tables for 6 people and 5 tables for 4 people. All of which arrived and were sat within 5 minutes of getting there. So I personally will never go there again.
