Text: I'd love to give this restaurant a 5 star because they have great food but they lack good service. Our bad experience? We requested diet pop before we went to put our food together. During those 5-10 minutes, the server has time to grab our drinks and silverware. We got to our table and the server completely forgot about us. She finally remembered after I gave her a look and came up to us and repeated our drink order (which was wrong). I corrected her and she came back with the wrong drinks! To top it off she gave us regular pop, which was horrible because we had a diabetic in the group.
It's hard to enjoy your food when your server can't do one specific job.
Blue Pacific should just invest in a hostess and a drink station. Just a thought ?

Text: I went here years ago and loved it. Then went on my birthday a couple years ago and it seemed run down n close to closing in comparison. Dirty, unpleasant service, overall terrible experience. I've never been back.
