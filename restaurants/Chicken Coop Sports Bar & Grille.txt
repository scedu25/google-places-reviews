Text: This was the 3rd time we have tried it and the 1st two times were mediocre. But we see people posting on Facebook about this place so we gave it another try and it's terrible! The wings were cold and burnt! Not doing it again! Drinks are strong so maybe that's how they keep their business...

Text: Cheeseburger and fries were served hot and delicious and not that long of a wait. The bartender serves us and was great. Atmosphere was great and would be a great hang out spot for any age.Want to go back and check out wings and pizza before I give 5?.

Text: Went during lunch time.  Six of us had a long table.  Service was quick and the Sports Bar menu was great.  The pizza was tender and tasty.  Cooked to perfection.  Great time too.

Text: This is a dive bar.  The drink specials are okay, the food is very fatty and greasy, and the service is disappointing.  The bathrooms were nice though.
