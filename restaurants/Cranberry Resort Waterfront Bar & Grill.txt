Cranberry Resort Waterfront Bar & Grill

Text: Customer service, food and drinks are excellent here. During summertime you can access by boat. We sat outside on the back patio overlooking the water with some live music playing a wide variety of music by one man and a guitar. He had a lot of crowd interaction of all ages. We had a great time and have been back again several times. The Rueben sandwich was awesome. I highly recommend it if you are visiting Indian Lake. You won't be disappointed.

Text: Excellent location and great service. However, my beers (Stella) weren't cold and my wife's Crown and diets were watered down. Overall a good stop but could have been great.

Text: Very awesome place has great food and friendly faces. Just don't go there before they get ready to close on Sunday. Because the brunette thick girl is very rude. I mean the customers make them money that's what pays there wage but still rude WTH. But 90% of the staff working is very polite and very pretty

Text: As soon as we get waited on, been awhile! Maybe with end of the year, less staff to get waited on. So we finally decided to take a vote & send someone to the Bar. That worked well! OK were moving forward...ended up we left,  they said 1&1/2 to 2 hrs to get our food.
