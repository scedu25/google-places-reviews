Des Dutch Essenhaus

Text: We used to go here years ago when I was a kid, and we were always blown away by the quality of the Essenhaus's Amish food. A few years ago we were back in the area and decided to see if it was as good as remembered. We were all more than pleased to discover that it was. This place really blows some of the other "Amish" restaurants out of the water. It's smaller than many, but very high quality. 

Suggestions: the family style dinner is great for groups. You pay per head and they bring out platters of food. Their fried chicken is out of this world. The salad bar is unusually good; it's not just a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some cheese, and everything really does taste homemade. The pies are always great too; they usually have some interesting local specialties along with the usual apple.

Update: I managed to get back here (I live 40 miles away) and ordered the apple dumpling with WHIPPED cream. It was the best apple dumpling I've ever eaten in my entire life, and the cream was real.

Text: Very friendly service.  I ordered from the menu and was happy with the Swiss steak. The salad bar was good also.  My wife ordered the buffet and her chicken was dried out.  And nothing she tried was hot except the soup.  Everything was clean. Will go back if in the area but not worth making a special trip.

Text: It was a family reunion meal that couldn’t be beat!  Thirteen of us, from my wife’s youngest sister to her 93 year-old father (from Rittman, Ohio), came together around a long, festive Des Dutch Essenhaus table for an authentic Amish “family style” supper.  The meal featured two meats—we chose sliced ham and turkey, both flavorful—and an array of savory sides (stuffing and mashed potatoes with gravy, creamed corn, bountiful salad-bar and soup offerings), freshly baked bread, and, for dessert, a choice of assorted homemade pies (with vanilla ice cream if desired).  Owner-manager Bill Nelson was warm and friendly, making us feel right at home, and our young Amish waitresses were attentive and quietly efficient with our large group.  
Wonderful atmosphere in a historic downtown Shreve village setting plus excellent food and service at a very reasonable price made for a Five Star (*****) experience all around!  THANK YOU!

Text: Salad bar and soups are good. Meals are average. Country music playing in the back round and hard wood chairs to sit on,not very relaxing.
