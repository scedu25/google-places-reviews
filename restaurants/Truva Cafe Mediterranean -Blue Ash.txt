Truva Cafe Mediterranean -Blue Ash

Text: I've stopped in for lunch a couple times while traveling for business recently.  Excellent Turkish food.  I lived in Turkey for a couple years; this is very authentic Turkish food. Fresh ingredients, prepared well, with excellent service by friendly staff.  Modest but authentic Turkish decor and background music.  I'll be back!  If you like Mediterranean food, especially Turkish, this is the real deal.

Text: Stopped by for some take-out on a Sunday afternoon. The service was fast and super friendly. In casual conversation we mentioned  that we were going to a park afterword and the server went the extra mile by packing us some extras (plates, cups, etc.). From experiences other places, that isn't the norm without explicitly requesting it.  Not only was the service fast and super friendly, but the food was good.  I had the gyro sandwich and my wife had the falafel sandwich.  Both were good. We would definitely recommend and will be going back for dine-in sometime as the atmosphere inside is a mix of upscale and relaxed.

Text: We are vegetarian and don't have many choices here...hence the 4*
We always have the combination platter and falafels as well as the lentil soup. The food is amazingly tasty and fresh. The pita is hot off the oven most of the time.  The wine list is thin but acceptable.
Service is variable,  mostly slow but friendly. 
The place is on the expensive side for a diner which is mostly empty, but the food makes it worth the price! We will come back often.

Text: I love Miyla cafe for gyros but this place topped the quality aspect of a lunch Gyro. The Gyro itself could use more meat but the flavors are awesome with a light tziki sauce it was divine. When I am feeling a higher quality gyro or a lighter gyro this is my spot.
