Fast seating, fast, friendly service. 
Servers were all fun and talkative. 
It was Sweetest Day and they were giving single long stemmed roses in various colors to all ladies, even little girls got roses! 
The food was fresh, good quality and came out nice and hot. 
The only issue was each course came out quickly, so we didn't have time to enjoy our appetizer before our salads arrived and again with our entr�es. 
Everything was clean, including the ladies room.The best Cajun food ever!  
Red beans and rice delicious! 
Huge screens to watch games on.  
Several bars within this huge place. 
Luv the patio seating and great service.Haven't been there in about 8 years give or take... 
Although much has changed inside the memories and amazing fun are still there. 
They could use some nicer bartenders though I'll tell you that but other than that I recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun night out.I want to thank KAYLA, our waitress, so much for making my mom�s retirement party one of the best parties we ever had yesterday! 
Kayla knew exactly when to come over and check on us, and what to recommend when we asked for some specialty drinks or cocktails that weren�t exactly on the menu. 
They didn�t have any banana liquor for BBC, but the vanilla liquor worked out perfect instead, and it was a hit among several guests, including my mom! 
She and the other gentleman were on point with making sure everything was going okay so far while the time passed by waiting for more guests, and then making sure everyone was taken care of after all of the guests had arrived and the clock struck 3.I don�t recall ever having service quite like what we had for a long time around here! 
Kayla definitely deserves a promotion for her outstanding work, her professionalism, and how personal she was with everyone. 
Thank you Bourbon Street, and thank you Kayla! 
We will return for any parties we host in the future, and recommend 115 Bourbon Street to all of our friends, guaranteed!
Nice place.. 
Just always to crowded for my liking. 
All though I do always have a good time here! 
Seen OAR here and the sound was pretty good for a bar. 
Great place to see a band up close and personal.Arrived at Three Floyds with low expectations due to some of the recent reviews. 
However, my party and I had a decent evening with quick friendly service. 
Our food was delicious and our server was happy to bring us samples of the many beers we wanted to try.Music is loud so be aware Food menu is great.Only issue was wait we arrived on a rainy day were asked to wait outside "in the rain".Appeared to have open tablesWas told  45 min wait turned into 10.????
Almost seemed that they wanted us to go elsewhere NOTHung around and had an enjoyable experienceLove this place.  
Service has always been excellent with passionate waiters and waitresses.  
Food is really good,  if the menu is small.  
Take home some jerky!
Tucked away in an industrial park, three floyds is probably the best/most interesting food in the area.  
Food gets high marks for creativity but execution is sometimes lacking, but that doesn't matter because you're in northwest Indiana.  
Obviously the beers are great and they have many offerings from other microbreweries as well.  
For some reason I don't want you to bring your kids here....Walked up to eat in the tap room.  14 groups deep. 
No problem, we�ll get a beer at the bar. 
Woops. 
We were promptly told to GO WAIT IN OUR CAR because they don�t allow that.  
What? 
Never coming here again.Amazing sushi, fantastic service! 
Everything is at a great price and you get plenty of food. 
Ask for Roy - he's a wonderful server and is great to chat with!
good chine food happy people .. just fish tank litte by more clean up ...Our dishes and utensils were dirty. 
The food wasn't as good as expected. 
Maybe we went on a bad day.Never had a bad experience. 
I have had delivery and dine in. 
It's generally a good experience and the food is always good.Great food with impeccable service! 
I have been to this place multiple times and was never disappointed. 
And their price is reasonable.This is a review for the bar menu. 
We arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday and had no trouble getting a seat. 
The two standout dishes of the evening were the Connecticut-style Lobster Roll and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
We tried the bar tasting menu, which included canapes, egg yolk ravioli with truffles, roast quail with savory bread pudding, and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
We also ordered the cauliflower dish and the famous Acadia hamburger.I would come back in a heartbeat for the buttery and delicious lobster roll, and we also left with the impression that the pastry chef is very talented. 
Outside of those dishes, however, we were disappointed by the execution and felt a little surprised that Acadia has two Michelin stars. 
Many of the hot dishes arrived cold and tasted like they weren't seasoned carefully.The service overall was excellent. 
Our waiter did forget to light our candle after we asked him about it, but of course that was a minor detail. 
I think the Michelin stars carry so much mystique that we noticed those little details more than we usually would.Excellent service and great food! 
Honestly this restaurant met my expectations but did not exceed them. 
It is what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant but does not go beyond to really revolutionize the art of food. 
Overall, if you want to eat great (Michelin starred) food then it is a good place to get started (given the strong/bold flavors are very subtle), but that is it. 
There are other amazing places where the food can really 'blow' your mind. 
Great service, presentations and delicate food but not the best taste. 
We did 9 course plus 3 supplement courses. 
We spent close to 400 per person and with this kind of money I expect the best from every aspect. 
During this trip I visited 3 Michelin starred restaurant and Acadia was not the best one. 
I wish they can work on the flavor so it can match up with their presentation. 
Good experience in overall but won't go back for a while.Sat at the bar. 
The burger was very good. 
The environment is nice and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.One of the best restaurants in Chicago (Michelin starred). 
Terrific chef and great service. 
Very inventive tasting menu. 
The bar serves light food that comes from an amazing kitchen - worth trying. 
A must try in Chicago as it is a foodie destinationGreat experience, pleasant employees. 
Clean eating area.  
The new turkey sandwiches are great.Deep fat fryed turkey not as good as original beef or rubenPlaced sucked food not warm and not cooked good at all. 
Well never go back.Excellent service today. 
Good very good.There's absolutely no consistency here onetime you go there it's awesome the next time you go there you swear they just went and bought the roast beef from Walmart. 
No offense to Wal-MartWhen is a burger better than the sum of its parts? 
That's the question I've been asking ever since I ate at Au Cheval. 
Nothing extraordinary stands out when you first see the burger. 
Simple patties, cheese, sauce, without the bacon and egg it's really pretty standard. 
Even so, once you take your first bite you realize that the flavors all compliment each other so perfectly that you can't find any faults. 
Nothing leaves you thinking "that could have been a little better". 
You'll find yourself eating slower as your realize the inevitability that this burger you've now grown attached to will run out. 
You take smaller bites, trying to procrastinate  further by ordering another beer or another round of fries but still the burger gets smaller. 
As that last bite sits on your plate, gleaming below the harsh light in an otherwise dark restaurant, you have to make a choice. 
Eat it and accept that it's over, or leave it as the ultimate display of respect. 
I chose to leave it; my way of saying "see you later" rather than "goodbye". 
What an amazing burger.The burger was truly the best cheeseburger I�ve ever had. 
Just so full of fatty flavor. 
The bacon on top is a must - and the fried egg, too. 
French fries were thick and salty, and the aioli was flavorful. 
We also split the porterhouse four ways and it was so so good. 
The sauce was �Thanksgiving-y� as someone put it, but the meat was really fatty and fell off the bone. 
Drinks were refreshing and tasty (favorites were the pink vodka lemonade and the secret brew). 
Waitress was super friendly and very helpful.Basically everything was made of high quality, fatty ingredients. 
Best American food I�ve had.Came here for a post Marathon meal and was not disappointed. 
If you�re a couple or flying solo would recommend sitting at the bar. 
You�re able to watch this very talented crew create burger after burger brilliantly.Even though they have an extensive beer and wine list we focused on the cocktails. 
Began with a pickle back (whiskey and a shot of pickle juice) followed by a Hemingway Daiquiri, Bees Knees and Old Fashioned. 
The list is their take on classics which all went down perfectly with our food.If it�s your first time here and you�re hungry, highly recommend the double. 
It�s three patties, cheese, minced red onions and a delicious sauce. 
It comes with a knife in it which I promptly used to saw this beast of a burger in half. 
The bread and butter pickles are fantastic and their fries are not to be missed. 
You will walk out of here completely satisfied.Delicious burger, amazing fries, but over hyped.I really wanted Au Cheval to be my favorite burger place. 
I wanted to have a religious experience that would force me to drag my out of town friends here. 
However what I found was a delicious burger (get the egg and bacon) and awesome fries.It was incredibly difficult to get a table. 
They have one line which forms for both people that have a table ready and for people looking to add themselves to the wait list. 
This causes confusion and would be better setup as two lines, perhaps add people to the wait list outside and people that have a table ready go inside?
Our wait ended up being about an hour which wasn't the worst I've seen, but it's still a long wait considering you can get excellent burgers elsewhere in the city without waiting.Overall I'll come back someday. 
However this isn't going to be a regular spot for me.Best burger in the USA IMHO. 
It's a heavy burger, add get the egg and pork belly and you are in burger heaven. 
I bring everybody who visits me there and so far everybody agrees. 
There is always a wait, but if you go alone or as a pair you can get in a lot faster otherwise around a 45 min wait. 
The small Au Cheval does not compare. 
They don't even have their signature pork belly and egg option.This review is for the Chicago location. 
The Ambiance is nice but modern. 
The pizza is excellent, with a sweet sauce and a salty cheese. 
It is the best thin crust pizza that you can get. 
I have been eating it for 35 years. 
I was a busboy and their Homewood location in the early 1990s.Had the super six the works. 
Definitely among the top 5 pizzas I have ever tasted. 
Can't remember any that were better. 
Ask for the old oven. 
It is a brick oven about 75 years old so the pizza taste is baked into every brick. 
DELICIOUS!!!!!
We were a group of 16+ and 4 high chairs on a Sunday at 1230pm( we reconfirmed the advance notice 2 times earlier in the week) and although the restaurant was mostly empty, we were put at 2 cramped tables in a corner with 4 completely empty tables next to us. 
After waiting to be acknowledged by a server then waiting again for pitchers of water, we had to flag down the waitress for beverage service. 
While waiting on our beverages, the hostess approaches our group to request that we remove our items from the empty table next to us as they need the tables -reiterating that we were assigned 2 tables,  not 3- this is long before we were even given the opportunity to place a food order. 90 minutes later the empty tables next to us that were so urgently needed were still not occupied. 
Aurelios pizza is the best in the area, but the customer service definitely needs improvement. 
I plan several events in the area but unfortunately would not recommend this Aurelio's for group events.Most people think of big deep dish pizza when they think of Chicago Style.  
Not me, this is home, this is Chicago style pizza for me.  
The best crust, sauce toppings in the area.  
The Homewood location has the best atmosphere and is truly the home of sit down family pizza.  
It is pricey but worth it.Server Was the rudest woman that I have ever come across and she snatches things from your hands and don't allow you to ask a question without saying that lunch specials were over. 
Wasn't offered anything regarding lunch and when the order was ready to be placed could not find her. 
Poor time management skills and customer service consideration too. 
First time visiting and will be the last. 
No One had any manners or consideration for other people then themselves. 
Too much time spent on personal conversation.We've always loved Aurelios. 
I grew up going to the original one in Homewood and now so very happy to have one basically in my backyard.As usual the food was good, but we stopped at 1230 for the buffet,  we are vegetarian, and to wait 30 minutes for a cheese pizza. 
We could have just ordered our own at that rate. 
Our lunch time over before you can eatBuffet was excellent. 
I wanted some salad and a couple of pieces of pizza with no leftovers, so this was awesome. 
Nicely priced, too. 
Friendly staff. 
Great food and great options. 
Great place to hold parties for large groups. 
Gluten free crust options. 
Great tasting Pizza, try their super 6. 
Will not be disappointed. 
Their buffalo wings are very tasty also.Was really disappointed this evening with the way the food was prepared, I sat there and watched it being cooked and it seemed like everyone was having a great time in the kitchen, I trusted the order to be right, I got home and was missing chips and salsa, missing the extra hot sauce, missing the fact I ordered flour tortillas with my chicken tacos and i received corn tortillas, I am glad the staff was having a great ol time talking dancing and singing in the kitchen, they need to pay more attention to what people order rather than sit and have a coffee shop conversation. 
I called the restaurant and it took 45 min for a chips and salsa to arrive, let alone I had to call twice, then they didn't even seem to care to replace the order that was incorrect. 
Get your stuff together, I order from here once a week and they always get it right, because it may be an off night doesn't mean screw around and get the order wrong. 
I am to say VERY disappointed in the way I was treated as a regular customer. 
I will find other places to go unless this place corrects the order accordingly. 
Unacceptable!
The food was good and fresh.No minimum order to get delivery. 
The delivery was fast.First off this place is located in wrigleyville aka party town so it's drunk people food which means it's nasty when you're sober I got a suzio chimichanga and rice and beans and an horcahata and it was $20 the rice wasn't Spanish the beans were from the can the meat was nasty and overpriced as hell for nasty foodWeb page menu deceiving. 
It shows  carne asada  a plate in a photo but it's not served. 
I had the chicken taco dinner which the meat was dried out. 
Other people in our party had steak burritos which they said were good. 
BYOB. 
Very average food.5 of us landed on a gold mine last night Everything was delicious. 
I ate the shrimp taco dinner with black beans and rice. 
Oh it's so good! 
Everyone was very pleased with their meals.Amazing meal and atmosphere. 
For our special occasion, we were treated to a special seat in the kitchen. 
We at our food only a few feet away from where it was made. 
The chef and staff made our experience unforgettable.Always have great meals at Balena! 
Particularly if you go with a large enough group (8-10) -- there's an awesome table in the back. 
It's like you're in a home (with some top notch food!)
Good food and nice place. 
I enjoyed the drinks. 
Went her for the gf birthday. 
It was well lit with very good food options. 
I think that's the best part is the menu and the wait staff. 
The orchietta spaghetti and steak were excellent. 
Portions are on the smaller side, so if you like a lot of food I recommend a sideI've dined here twice and loved it! 
A little pricey but the food is worth it. 
The pizza is the best!
My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner at Balena and it was a wonderful experience. 
We heard nothing but positive feedback from our guests about how fantastic the venue, the drinks, and the food were. 
Everyone  loved the homemade pasta and especially the chicken (heard several compliments about how delicious the chicken was as well as the rest of the food). 
Additionally, the waiters and staff were extremely friendly and helpful with assisting our guests with their questions and needs, they went the extra mile to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.The Balena team was very easy to communicate with and made it easy to ask questions to get things organized for the rehearsal dinner. 
We truly appreciate the hard work the Balena team put into making our rehearsal dinner happen and making it flawless.Great secret little spot right in the middle of the mag mile. 
It's warm, cozy, Sumptuous and stylish. 
The food is top quality and the service is very attentive. 
I love their cornbread, do not miss it. 
All their salads are phenomenal as well.I loved the food and the ambience, it was fantastic.  
The live jazz band was great.  
The one thing that was hard to do was find it.  
It is not located facing Michigan Avenue, you enter on the Grand Avenue side of the building.  
The cornbread there is some of the best I ever had, and I know food.  
The appetizers were great, especially the spinach dip.  
It had great servers who took their time and explained everything to our group.  
We are the Unlimbited Potential Amputee Support Group all of our wheelchairs fit in the place at our table.  
Food was served hot and fresh and was good to the last drop.  
Drinks were a bit pricey, but worth it.  
I would recommend this place to visitors easily, including the elderly in wheelchairs.This place is pretty swank and the burger was excellent. 
Service was good. 
Prices reflect their location (pricey) and everything was just too dark for no reason. 
The band was pretty good though, and that was a neat experience. 
Bring someone here if they're a date that likes nice things; don't come here with a buddy.The first thing caught our attention was the server. 
He was a mid-age super professional and charismatic server I have ever seen in my life.We had burger and the lamb sandwich. 
Both of then are absolutely awesome in terms of taste, quality, and presentation. 
My only suggestion: I expect the lamb to be more flavorful as the nature of the lamb is little bit smelly compared to beef as many people don't like it.Though there was a bit of a wait to get started (due to a shift change mixup), once it did the experience was lovely.  
The service was then on point and the food was damn tasty. 
I'm a Southerner who does not like sweet cornbread but from what I could tell, those who do will love Bandera's version. 
The house smoked salmon was fantastic as were all the dishes that my party ordered. 
The banana cream pie is well worth it, too. 
Excellent live jazz was an expert touch. 
This place is great for dates, business meetings and/or nights out with your friends if you're 30+. 
This was an awesome, random find in downtown Chicago.This is my neighborhood spot when I want to watch a game or get a decent happy hour special. 
I come here very often on Wednesdays for the $1.25 beer / half priced martini special. 
And of course they have half priced appetizers every day from 4-7pm.  
There is almost always a place to sit since the space is large, although the top area is blocked off pretty often. 
I usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders do a great job of serving everyone quickly. 
The drinks are always made correctly, but I do think they could have a bigger selection of whiskeys.The food here is also great. 
I usually get the boneless wings, which come out on a cute little cast iron pan. 
The chips and dips appetizer is also good for sharing. 
I will keep coming here as long as they have their great happy hour specials and fun environment for watching sports.Phenomenal service! 
I hosted an engagement party at this location and they went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. 
The event coordinator, Amanda, was super professional and answered all my questions and was super helpful especially since I was trying to plan this event from out of town. 
We had a large party of 30 plus and we were in the upstairs private loft and our waitress made countless trips up and down the stairs to make sure all of our orders were taken care of. 10/10 Service. 
Would highly recommend.I really enjoy Bar Louie! 
Cheap drinks, and really cheap burgers on Tuesdays. 
For being a dollar, also, the burgers are pretty good, though of course, the specialty burgers are much better. 
My boyfriend and I come here whenever we can just for a night out. 
We love the food, and we also love the ambiance of the bar: not too crowded, not too sports bar-ish, just a fun and cozy place for food and drinks.Cozy atmosphere with interesting locals and tourists having various beers and cocktails. 
Friendly staff and your choice of bar seating or sitting next to the windows.We originally went here for the outdoor patio and craft beer, but ended up staying inside for lunch and multiple drinks once we saw the great food selection and interior design. 
Good food, good service, and amazing atmosphere.  
Highly recommended.Great casual sandwich place in Evanston. 
Huge portions and large list of craft beers. 
The bar seating area is quite cramped so those that don't like getting cozy may prefer a table. 
The prices are on the higher end hence 4 star rating. 33 dollars for a chicken sandwich and 2 beers is a bit much.Amazing beer selection, generous sized burgers and sandwiches. 
Beer towers. 
Salads. 
Sides. 
Nachos! 
Also serves brunch. 
Bat 17 also has a pool bar next door. 
Definitely an Evanston establishment!
I would have gave this place 5 stars because the food is amazing! 
But we drove all the way here for the food and pool hall and they do not have pool tables like advertised! 
They should change their website and let people know that they no longer have pool tables availableCame hungry, left full.  
Burger was above average, sweet potato fries good, and local IPA beer good as well.  
No shortage of sports on TV.  
Both White Sox and Cubs on at the same time.  
Nice!
Pretty decent.  
Not the most amazing. 
They need to quit bragging about a "best of" ranking that is several years old.Great service. 
Really friendly staff. 
And the food was perfect. 
I haven't been on the Southside in awhile. 
And I was so glad I stopped there to eat. 
It was great. 
Thanks you guys, you made my night.Excellent service from the bartender that took care of a full bar and tables. 
He did an amazing job! 
Food is hot, delicious and timely.My server Kate, short hair, was the best server I've ever had! 
She was so polite and took care of our table so well! 
The manager of the night, Aham is also fantastic!
Waitress was nice food was delivered on time places nice and welcomingGreat food but lazy staff I get my order messed up all the time and have to argue for compensation like it's the least you can do charging those prices, ruining a customers meal experience is unacceptable with no compensation not that is even with compensation but atleast then the company would be decentFirst off, the service here is bad. 
It took forever for them to make an omelette. 
The waitress kept coming back to the table to make sure she had the order correct. 
It was very quiet and the two waitresses were running around clueless. 
It may be hard to believe, but it actually seemed like the waitresses were helping cook in the kitchen. 
They would disappear into the back and come out frantic serving food. 
The icing on the cake was when our waitress messed up our bill and acted as if she was doing us a favor by not charging us the coffee, but it is included in the breakfast. 
The food here is incredibly bland and on the verge of tasting just plain bad. 
How do you get an omelette wrong? 
We are talking eggs here. 
Avoid this place at all costs.Cute little restaurant that has some very tasty food but even better service. 
Francisco, the manager went above and beyond to make sure our first time there was memorable. 
Also, the owner, bartender and even one of the cooks stopped by our table on the patio and checked in on us! 
We felt at home and will definitely be back. 
Great view and reasonable prices!!!
This is a "gem" of a spot hidden beside trump tower in Chicago. 
Great staff and met the owner.  
It's a family business so  cool it's not a chain.  
Best pizza I ever had!!
We were looking forward to a great meal due to overall great reviews, however, had quite a poor experience. 
The restaurant was not very busy, but it took us a while to be served by our waiter, and he was fairly rude throughout our service. 
We ordered the mushroom rigatoni and it was so acidic it tasted like stomach acid or vomit- no exaggeration. 
Also, we ordered the lasagna of the day, which we were told was 4 meat, and there was absolutely no meat and just mushrooms. 
We attempted to tell our server, but he didn't give us the time of day. 
We ended up each taking a few bites of our food, paying, and leaving. 
Maybe they were just having an off day, but we will certainly not be returning. 
Pros: great location downtown.The tacked-on �Italian Bistro & Pizzeria� is the first clue that this location of Bacino�s goes well beyond the �heart healthy� thin and stuffed pies that put this Chicago chain on the map. 
The decent breakfast selection includes waffles and omelettes, but we�d recommend going in the afternoon or evening for one of the nine pasta plates and, yes, the pizza. 
John Robbins 1504755563The cook recommends the double cheese burger. 
Once you've got burger in hand add condiments, pickles are there, along with the standard offerings one would put on a burger. 
They also have hot dogs, Italian beef, and some other selections. 
There's a fully stocked bar. 
United Center, formerly Chicago Stadium, is a couple of blocks away. 
Glenn Russell 1505963786Very friendly staff. 
Place is a little odd. 
Some areas feel like it's a partial storage area. 
Getting food to go might be best. 
Sean Dennis 1504374309If you're looking for a good burger.. 
Do not go here! 
Pickles are thicker than my burger patty and its tasteless. 
The bun was massive and dry. 
We ate in and they have a stuffed dead Goat in corner that is falling apart. 
Very unappetizing. 
Beware.  
Emily A 1508178250Decent place to watch a game. 
Layout is odd, not a ton of seating and it's extremely busy before and after Hawks game. 
Did not have food. 
Guillermo Balandra 1501608006$6 for a double cheese burger is too much when you make me put my own toppings on it. 
I got to choose between onions and pickles. 
That's it. 
All I tasted was bread. 
The meat is small and thin.I just returned from eating at this place. 
While seated there, I kept on checking the name and reading the reviews because I was certain I got confused and I had gone to the wrong place. 
To make it quick: worst burger ever! 
I ordered a regular cheeseburger, the patty was so think I thought they were kidding. 
The bread was ok, but I didnt mean to eat a bun for dinner. 
No lettuce, no tomato, no mayo. 
Nothing. 
Just a dry, thin patty inside a toasted bun. 
You gotta be kidding me! 
How could anyone thing their burgers are good is beyond me.Iconic dive bar, which has since spawned a local chain. 
I highly recommend hitting up this original location if you're in town or looking for something touristy to do. 
Also, if you love retro places this is a spot for you. 
Walking in you're immediately transported back to the 70s and earlier. 
Made nationally famous by SNL's cheezeborger skit. 
Beer prices are a little higher then normal. 
Staff was very nice. 
You could probably look at the memorabilia all day. 
Don't forget this place is below street level so you've got to go down to the tunnel streets to find it. 
Don't let that intimidate you though.I went here because of John Belushi. 
It was a fun atmosphere, but they move you along, so don't expect to be staring at a menu too long. 
And the guy that was pestering me to get a double cheeseburger was right - a single wasn't enough. 
Don't make the same mistake I did.Nothing like walking down into a parking garage and finding an old bar.  
The burgers were great and the service didn't disappoint. 
Sat at the bar and had a beer.  
Bartender was chatty as well as the other patrons.It is the thing you think it is: Decent value dive bar doing a running reenactment of that SNL skit. 
A lot less pricey than other tourist-targeting spots, though. 
Bring out of town visitors in for a beer. 
Aiman Zayed 1505337384I’ve been coming to BIN 36 for the last eight months roughly once a month. 
Service is great, the manager or owner (not exactly sure) is always there making sure everything is running smoothly. 
Today, at lunch the manager/owner noticed that my table was a little wobbly and took it upon himself to fix it without me bringing it up. 
A+ service in my book, exemplary  service. 
Mrs. 
Stewart 1508170367The atmosphere is pleasant and light. 
The brunch options were unique and well  prepared. 
Its worth a try. 
Pamela Kramer 1497912531Don't miss lunch or dinner at this lovely restaurant. 
The food is fabulous -- make sure to order the Brussels sprout appetizer. 
We loved the meatball appetizer as well. 
The burger was great, the salads are good, and the fish sandwich was terrific. 
We were there for lunch, but with the excellent wine selection, dinner would be fabulous as well! 
The owner, Enoch, is there a lot and makes sure that everything goes well. 
I'll be back! 
Cory Straim 1506019448Great food, smallish portions and the food took a long time to come out.  
They gave us free drinks to accommodate the wait.  
Hopefully it was just a glitch Shayna Atkins 1503347461Organized a private event at Bin36 and truly had a phenomenal experience. 
The service was excellent, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and we truly has a phenomenal time. 
Would love to do it again.Wonderful coffee shop and cafe located in downtown Valpo one block east of the square.  
Large menu for both breakfast and lunch with wonderful food and some of the best coffee in town.   
Great bakery selection of homemade pies, cookies, pastries, and more.  
Comfortable atmosphere makes it welcoming for families as well.Great coffee and food!  
Staff is friendly.  
Expect to possibly encounter a wait. 
Not fast food, a place to sit and enjoy your food outside of the rat raceBig fan. 
On a soup bender and they keep a great rotation of homemade soups daily to keep it "fresh" for me.Coffee is great and reasonably priced! 
Staff could be a bit more friendly. 
Maybe not much experience in the restaurant business.One of the best cafes in Valpo. 
They have good food and an incredible loose lead tea collection. 
Being a tea enthusiast I love this place! 
Very chill atmosphere too.  
David Shih 1506972615We love the Bongo Room up north. 
This one has the same great food. 
But for me, the downside is just how tiny and cramped the space is. 
It gets really packed here and the space is just incredibly tight with little elbow room.Other than that, I can't fault the food. 
It's really good. 
So if you don't mind small spaces or don't have a large party, it's a solid choice. 
Rachel P 1508716159The food at this bongo room is great!! 
Coffee and tea selections are really good. 
They would do well if they sold coffee to go. 
I just hate they don’t have alcohol. 
Gregory Heller 1507602708Eggs benedict were fantastic. 
The house potatoes were over seasoned though. 
Also  they charged 3.5 for tea/coffee without showing the price anywhere Catina Moreno 1500835983Very cute place, small menu but very delicious items and large items.  
Really great place. 
This is a breakfast/brunch place so fair warning. 
Loved it though. 
I got the lemon brioche French toast so yummy Cassie 1497795598Delicious! 
Portions were big especially for the price! 
Price range was about $8-15 but well worth it. 
I had the tomatillo egg white scramble. 
It has a generous amount of avocado which impressed me. 
Staff was friendly. 
Probably not the best place for a large group because it's a small restaurant but our party of 4 was fine. 
I would definitely go again. 
Kitchen closes early on Sundays. 
No dark beers. 
The staff was friendly and the locals were more than happy to chat with us while we were there.Alot of good food for the price! 
We will be back next trip up that way! 
Nice sized beef patties not some thin strip of meat! 
Food and service was very goodAnother great time. ..  
I love it. 
Reminds me of the good old fashioned bars that use to be around.  
Dawn the bar tend and the staff, people in the bar very friendly happy go lucky people. ?
Enjoyed this bar in the past when I use to live in Crescent City , IL . 
A lot of us bike riders stopped here because it is a great friendly place . 
Music on the weekends, good food, good people. 
I ordered the Loco Burger and kimchi fries. 
Overall, I liked the food and the place had a good atmosphere for a quick bite. 
However, I found the food quite salty and had to drink a lot of water to get through it all. 
Additionally, Restaurant cleanliness could be improved, I noticed quite a food crumbs on our table and around the floor.I love their burgers! 
Great tasting burger not over seasoned. 
I recommend place!
Tried an unique and delicious BNG burger with bacon, onion, and egg.  
Homestyle fries are amazing and worth the visit by themselves.  
Service was quick and although I ordered carry out, the ambience inside seemed really nice.Their bNg is a great tasting burger! 
All the ingredients make it great. 
Even the fries are good. 
Not overly salted and/or seasoned. 
Even the location is great. 
Close to the beach so you can go for a walk on the beach after you're done eating. 
And let all that food digest with a calm listening of the waves afterwards. 
We certainly did. 
I'd for sure recommend. 
Amazing fusion Korean restaurant near Loyola. 
I love this place. 
The atmosphere is very casual. 
I love eating outside during the summer. 
Favorite things: kimchi fries, bi bim bop with barbecue chicken added, and chicken katsu.I highly recommend this to everyone. 
Really great food. 
The burgers are huge and taste fabulous, the chicken is the best, fries are perfect, and the employees are amazing. 
Great craft beers, food was good for a bar and service was excellentGood food, great service, nice environment Great fried chicken and good friendly people Order was wrong, fries were overcooked.  
Better off eating beforehand. 
Bottom Lounge was the venue for our recent wedding (September 2017) and it was perfect for our 80 guests. 
We had the ceremony and reception on site, utilizing both the indoor and outdoor space on the second floor. 
Natalie is their wedding coordinator and is absolutely wonderful to work with. 
She's very efficient, knows what she's doing, and makes sure that everything looks amazing on the big day. 
She has an inventory of items, such as dessert platters and cut wood discs for display that she's happy to let couples utilize. 
The space already has nice lighting, a Chicago feel, a permanent bar, and a DJ booth, so it saves the time of trying to plan the room from a completely "blank canvas." 
The optional photo booth and pinball machines are a fun touch. 
The food was delicious and was served family style. 
It was an overall great planning experience and perfect wedding day. 
Thank you to Natalie and everyone at Bottom Lounge!!
This is a great small venue where you can be close to the performers from anywhere in the room. 
Though it can be a bit cramped in the hallway where merch is usually sold, you can see the stage from most of the tables. 
The staff is helpful and they have a great food & alcohol selection. 
They were even very accommodating to my gluten allergy, which is not always the case at concert venues. 
Even though it's a small place, it's one of my favourites. 
And as an added bonus, the bathrooms are reasonably clean for a concert venue!
Fantastic venue for sound, anywhere you stand has a great view so you can still see the performer if you want to stay out of the madness in the front. 
Most importantly the drinks are very reasonable priced and bartenders give a good pour. 
Make sure to tip well. 
They deserve it.Truly friendly and accommodating staff. 
The beer selection is second to none. 
My only gripe is pricing, but it seems within reason for this town, so yeah..Was there for an event for TechWeek. 
We were upstairs in that space which was nice. 
It was small for the group that was there. 
The service was excellent all the bartender were attentive to however stepped up to the bar even with all the people that were there. 
That is one reason I would come back. 
Also since I didn't have a change to have any food there. 
I have to see what it's like.The Mexican restaurant Fiesta Brava is very good you must give it a try!
Good place to get fuelBrick Stone is one of those micro-breweries / restaurants that really has done that mix well.  
The atmosphere is warm with a touch of elegance.  
The staff is friendly and the food is top-notch!   
The price is a bit on the high side, but you get your money's worth.  
The in-house beers are good and they always have deals going on.  
Another side note: they focus on American style burgers, steak, and chicken, but they do some other types of cuisine very well.  
The pork flautas my wife and I had were delicious and just enough for two!
They also have larger tables available for larger parties.  
With all those things, it's little wonder why they have been around for years!
Wonderful place to go with friends or family. 
Very good food and drink Selection. will be back soon.Always a great meal;  Love the beer sampler; Jambalaya was huge, tasty and just the right spice; Shrimp & Grits was good as well.Excellent beer, good food, and great service. 
They accommodated our last minute family reunion party of 24 on Saturday night by opening their back room for us. 
Highly recommended!
Brick Stone is great. 
They have a wonderful burger that is put between two Grilled Cheese. 
Everything I have had on the menu has been fantastic.The service was great! 
Get the single glass of white sangria vs the carafe, its stronger and prettier. 
I also wish they would've warned us off just how large the rigatoni is because it couldve fed 8 people and there were only a couple of us.  
The food was pretty good. 
The mozzarella garlic bread was amazing though!!
I ordered using a delivery service so I can't speak for the service or atmosphere, however my order had no eating utensils or seasonings. 
I ordered spaghetti & meatballs w/ bread, but everything was pretty bland & tasteless. 
Very disappointing for $20, or any price for that matter, so I don't recommend.this is my favorite buca! 
there's always something fun to look at, and  the food is great. 
For lunch there's an option other than family style,  which is good!
We made reservations for our son's graduation party with the family. 
We needed a place with a variety of food items and space to contain our chaos. 
We found both. 
The food, from the salad to the chocolate cake, was amazing. 
They packed up our leftovers for us and we celebrated again the next day. 
The waitstaff were attentive and did a great job with our party. 
This is the second time we have met here for a celebration and both times have been great experiences.One of our favorites. 
Great food, hard working employees that seem to really care. 
Some of the very best food you can get, home style Italian is where it's at. 
The best ambiance you can have at a chain restaurant  W Ray Jack 1502303740Chicago is rich in culture. 
That is exemplified by one of it's premier  gems, a blues club known as Buddy Guy's Legend. 
When I stepped through the doors an electrifying  ambience embraced me. 
Guest from near and far enjoying the house delights literally were treated with a Monday Open Mike that included a Buddy Guy moment backed by the Jimmy Burns Group (house band of the evening). 
The night featured  riveting appearances by Mr G. Guy (Buddy's son), Mr Wes, Ms Holley Maxwell, and Ms Queen. 
The evening was rounded out with a rotation of sign in jam musicians who were not short on talent themselves ... 
Also, a shout out to my new friends from St. Louis, glad you had fun .... 
Nice spot Buddy
Had an amazing time. 
Prices were reasonable. 
Service was great. 
Louisiana Al was fabulous. 
Highly recommend Legend's. 
The Mike Dangerous Band was incredible. 
They played 2 hours nonstop. 
Buddy Guy sat in with the band to make it that much better. 
It was a wonderful experience. 
Rated 5 stars for the overall experience.  
Food is a solid 4 - wonderful homestyle Cajun/Creole. 
I was delighted to find that the new location, while a little bit bigger and cleaner, retains a bit of the "dive bar" feel and has a similar intimate layout like the original location.  
It's all about the music here. 
Pure and true blues at it's finest. 
Every table close to the stage. 
Even if you don't like or know the blues when you go in, you will love it by the time you leave. 
Great music...great atmosphere....great food. 
What more can you want?
I come here for pick up 1-2 a week and always have to good experience even if it�s slammed packed busy. 
The general manager, Phil is always helping his staff and treats each customer very well. 
Coming from a server background it�s so nice to see a GM get his hands dirty and help!!!
The server told me that something was too new, shouldn't have been on the menu, and cannot be made because there's no button for it. 
After I explained that there are 2 ingredients and if you have those, a monkey could make it...she then said "well I'll go ask if they can". 
Why didn't she do that to begin with? 
"There's no button for it" is a terrible reason not to at least ask if something can be made that is on the menu.Luke was amazing... he helped my daughter when she got the wrong (to spicy) wings...amd it was great.. very up beat and a joy to be around..kist all around fun...Food was okay nothing special. 
I was expecting more flavor from the screaming nacho burger. 
All you could really taste was onion and an unflavored meat patty. 
I have to give them the service was quick.Have had great service every time I've eaten here, which has been for lunch during the week. 
The fried pickles are amazing, as are the boneless wings in Wild sauce.Love this local fondue restaurant!  
The owner was so wonderful- really made it a great experience.  
Our server Parker was attentive and friendly.   
Portions were a bit small, but we still left feeling full.  
Desert was delicious- we scraped the pot clean!
I did my daughter's Sweet 16 party here and the children loved it!! 
The staff were AWESOME and the food too! 
I would most definetly come again and again.It does cost a pretty penny, but you also get a lot for the money. 
It's a fun time and the food is delicious, great to go with a small group of friends. 
Me and my boyfriend went to try Caf� Fondue for my birthday and it wasn't a good experience for us at all. 
When we went inside there was about 2 tables with people and it was fairly empty for a Friday night. 
The waiter was very kind but the food was awful. 
They brought out salad for us and it was clearly store bought bagged salad that was clearly old because the edges of the lettuce were brown. 
The meat they brought out was not clean. 
They served my chicken and it was coated with flower instead of being clean and fresh. 
Seemed as if they coated the chicken with flower and put it away. 
The desert was maybe the best thing they served. 
I expected a nice experience, to be able to go to a fondue spot that was closer but I could I have went to Gejas in Chicago instead and spent the extra money for the better quality. 
Caf� fondue was cheaper but it was a rip off.  
It was not worth the money or time.Amazing!!! 
Love the food and awesome customer service.The best chicken around!  
The owner tells me the chicken is all delivered fresh in the morning and never frozen.  
The skin melts in your mouth and you cannot beat the prices.  
Way better than the chains and the hyped boutique fried chicken places in the City.I'm giving them ONE star because the workers tried to play me for a foul. 
Noticed that there were fries sitting in the basket that appeared to be old, pointed over to the basket, told them I didnt want those fries, and asked for fresh fries. 
Saw them drop fresh fries BUT then noticed the OLD fries from the other basket were gone. 
Get my food and here I got some light fresh looking fries and some that looked like they were cooked longer which is impossible UNLESS you put the OLD fries back in so they appear to be fresh too. 
REALLY! 
After I specifically said i didn't want the old fries you give them to me anyway thinking I wouldn't notice. 
Had my business up to this point.If you are looking for a great dine-in experience....this is not the place. 
If you are looking for something greasy after a night at the bar, LOOK NO FURTHER! 
Their Chitterlings, fried fish, fried chicken, gyros, Italian beef, and philly are all excellent. 
I love the mild sauce! 
Even better -- you can place your order and walk to the liquor store next door. 
;P For this neighborhood, they are the best option and are open late!
Y'all just suck.. 
Why can't you ever get a simple Italian beef right? 
And god forbid you call and ask for it to be fixed it ain't happening... 
Plus it takes 40 mins at least for the damn food even when u call ahead y'all ain't that damn busy.. 
UghThe chicken here is always fresh and very well seasoned. 
Recommend it to anyone looking for some good quality chicken love and miss this place..Had a 6:30 reservation for a group of 18. 7:30. 
Still waiting. 8:30. 
Still waiting. 
Offered a round of free drinks. 9:00 finally seated - at two tables instead of the one large table we reserved. 
Took forever for the food to arrive and we were not even offered menus.  
The food was great, but not worth waiting over three hours for.  
We watched several groups of 2, 6 and 8 get seated while we waited and waited. 
Entertainment was fantastic.We were visiting friends in the area and we wanted to get some lunch before we left town to go home. 
We travel a lot and we really like eating at "local" places that have some character,  and this place has it in spades! 
As my wife and I both have lived in Germany, our hosts suggested Chef Klaus's and we were very glad they did. 
My wife had her standard Jaeger Schnitzel and I had a German beef sandwich. 
They were both very good, and we would love to go back the next time we are in town.Authentic German and great live music. 
My whole family loves this place (even the kids). 
If the Nazi�s won the war, this would be every restaurant in America... you�ll see what I? 
mean when you get there. :)No offense to the readers, as a former chef I very rarely give 4 stars and know very few restaurants that deserve 5. 
Though, this is a very good restaurant. 
I have only been here twice, but nothing was disappointing about the meal. 
For whatever reason we started with the raw oysters. 4 of the 6 were fresh and good blue point oysters. 2 of them were on their way to turning. 
Still, that's our fault, who the hell orders oysters at a German restaurant? 
Aside from that the schnitzel and Goulash dishes we got were very good. 
We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and humorous. 
Prices are a little high for the eats, but all in all, you can enjoy a nice atmosphere, nice beers and good food!
Horrible service. 
Waited 25 min for waitress to take our order. 
Never got our salad, never got drink refills, sides were cold. 
Had to ask twice for bread. 
Hardly ever saw our waitress. 
Been eating at the Bier Stube for the past 25 yrs including the one in Frankfort and in Peotone never had service this bad. 
Check was $130.00 and I'm not sure I'll go back. 
So disappointed.I was very skeptical about how the food was going to taste. 
Mind. 
Blown. 
So so good!! 
The staff was awesome! 
Loved the decor! 
Wish there was a place like this on the south side,  will definitely return!
My wife and I had lunch today at the Chicago Diner and it was fabulous.  
I had the hash with biscuits and gravy, and she had the country fried veggie steak.  
It was delicious.  
Our server was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.  
The diner reminded me of a small town cafe, but with great visuals on the walls.  
We'll come back next time we are in town!
My partner and I were visiting the city and just happened to walk in about 9:45pm. 
We had no idea we were so close to closing time, the staff were so welcoming. 
We also had no idea we had walked into a vegetarian restaurant, so that was a pleasant surprise as well! 
The food was maybe the best vegetarian food either of us ever had. 
Our server was hilarious, too. 
Highly recommended!
Finally visited this diner with an old friend who was in town. 
The restaurant is so crowded that you feel like your neighbors are at your table, and it's loud. 
The food was good, but not allergy friendly. 
My friend had one of the lunch specials and was very impressed, saying that despite being vegan the sandwich was really awesome. 
I had a veggie omelette that was good, but apparently contaminated with gluten. 
:(I knew going in it was suppose to be some crazy good food, they did not dissapoint. 
Good to know meat free doesn't just mean salad! 
Get dessert...no seriously get it! 
Julie Anderson 1505923400Absolutely delicious food!  
Oh my gosh, we will definitely go back there to eat again.  
Appetizers, lobster bisque, seafood, steaks, were all ordered at our table.  
Everyone was very satisfied.  
Love the ambiance, our waiter Phillip was outstanding!  
His passion clearly showed as he explained each of the menu items.  
You must go!!! 
Francesca D'Arcy 1506476973This place is very impressive. 
The decor and atmosphere is wonderful. 
The food is tasty and well done especially the steak and oysters. 
Robert Bogolin 1507210453Chicago Firehouse, having reopened after a devastating fire in 2014 is an awesome place for both lunch and dinner. 
It has a very open feeling with the tall ceilings and great decor, and the food is fantastic. 
Their steaks, burgers and Amish brick chicken are all must trys. 
They have a variety of meeting and banquet rooms upstairs along with a veranda. 
Ivee L 1501980740This place has a very different atmosphere comparing to other restaurant in South Loop. 
The food are good but I didn't think it was outstanding. 
I was impressed with their own Firehouse red wine blend though. 
It's a nice change of the restaurant type in the area.  
Maribel Chacon 1506218822The food and staff are amazing. 
The ambiance inside is relaxing and elegant. 
It is a great place for a casual date or a special celebration.My cousin recently had a wedding here, there was almost nothing good about the place except the decorations and the manager. 
The food was awful. 
The wedding cake was cut and served when it was not suppose to be. 
The bartenders were not friendly at all and service overall was very mediocre. 
Worst of all, many decorations and valuables for the wedding were seemingly stolen by the employees and days later have still not been found. 
I would not recommend this place for anybody, especially if you are going for something special like a wedding.I work for Comcast and we have had a few employee meetings there. 
We love there banquet hall.Great for banquets. 
And their live music night are good too. 
Just get to an event early so you don't have to park in their overflow lotI have been here twice for a funeral luncheon and a baby shower. 
Both times the room was great, service was good and the venue itself is such a nice open place to hold events. 
The rooms all break down to the perfect size for your event including a great outside area.Great staff. 
Very friendly and accommodating.A friend who lives in Chicago took us there after discovering that my daughter loves chicken and waffles. 
At 10a, I am eating some of the best mac and cheese, collard greens and fried chicken that I have had in a long time. 
I�m from the south, and I can�t find a restaurant with food this good at home. 
This is the caliber of food that your parents and grandparents cooked. 
Service was good. 
Even had real sweet tea! 
No complaints. 
If I lived there, I would be a regular, for sure!
My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast recently.  
We ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of grits.  
The chicken was seasoned really well, but the waffles were just alright.  
We loved the grits and the music was great!  
A very comfortable setting to eat in.  
Our waiter was very nice as well.My wife introduced me to this gem. 
The chicken is seasoned well. 
The best side is the mac n cheese. 
I always ordered the smothered chicken and waffles. 
To me the gravy is awesome.Amazing food all around. 
The greens are fabulous, which is always a good sign they're doing it right. 
Service was fast and friendly. 
Portions are big, and prices are reasonable. 
The interior is really nice and great music. 
There were lots of groups of people all eating and laughing and having a great time. 
A very fun experience.Such welcoming staff! 
Something sooo magical about the atmosphere, feels like home. 
And the food has me in a food coma!
Great food and service, has Byob (1 wine bottle for 2). 
We shared food, so I tried steak, pork ribs and stuffed pepper and it was really delicious!!!! 
The chocolate desert was great too!! 
Just don't be scared it's in basement and bit crowded, but worth it!!!!
Ingredients were well balanced out in a very playful way.  
Lots of depth in flavor and surprising elements.  
Everything makes sense.  
Nice ambiance and good music.  
Friendly staff.We were so hungry, we ate all the foods before remembering to take picturesOne of our favorite restaurants in Chicago. 
They definitely won't seat you until your party is all there, but once you are seated the food is fantastic. 
Menu changes regularly and food is always fresh and inventive. 
BYOB and mostly gluten free. 
(Not middle eastern as other reviews as mentioned), it's Mexican with an inventive menu. 
Would highly recommend, a great local spot!
No frills, BYOB, but so yummy. 
Expect a loud, crowded atmosphere with a fun menu. 
Perfect place to bring a few friends and a bucket of beers.Great food with just enough spice. 
Small and cozy. 
Great for date night.Great place for local Chinese food and good pricesWe eat here at least once every month.  
Their food is fantastic and the servers are great.Always friendly service. 
Enjoyed the Curry chicken today, with Crab Rangoon, and 2intin soup. 
All Delicious.The interior is showing its age, but the food is very well made and time is taken to make it. 
There is no buffet like most Chinese restaurants do.Good food, friendly service, a will drop in again. 
Thank you.This Chipotle used to be great. 
But now it's filthy and the staff is pretty rude. 
We've had to wipe off a table to sit and eat the last 3 times we have visited. 
The food was good, but they don't keep the line clean so as they push your bowl across the line, it will collect plenty of smushed toppings. 
I think one of the cashiers is racist. 
He will only greet/talk to African American people that come through the line. 
If you are white he will not respond to "hello" "how are you" "thank you" or "have a nice day" or even make eye contact with you. 
Just a very unpleasant and odd Chipotle. 
If you know of another, I would say it is worth the extra mileage.Went there at 8:30 on a Tuesday and a line out the door the whole time we were there. 
The staff was quick to get orders out. 
Orders were correct and portions were fine. 
They seem short staffed but it was probably unexpected for a Tuesday. 
A few things lacking napkin holders empty and there was a wait on chips. 
Ours were stale probably from a lull before the rush but wasn't willing to sit around just for some chips.Consistly good. 
I order with the app and it is always ready. 
Portions are good and people treat you well. 
Definitely will continue to visit!
This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. 
Try the Steak Mexicans. 
Yummy?
Always a pleasure at this Chipotle. 
Food always in large portions, and very tasty. 
Restaurant clean. 
Staff friendly. 
Even though line long, it moves at a steady pace. 
I will definitely be back.Food was great! 
Much to my surprise. 
I didn't know what to expect from looking at the place from the outside but inside was pretty nice and the food and service made it even better.What can I say, I love the service the food and the atmosphere... 
You feel so at home when you enter, the owner greets everyone with a smile and a hand shake... 
Great place all around !!!!!!!!
We had dinner there last night, specials were superb.  
All the food items were perfectly prepared without being preciously presented.  
The chefs are amazing.  
The waitstaff, including our server Roxy, also completely charming, professional, attentive without hovering and never pushy, qualities that I as a former waiter from college days can totally appreciate.  
And this was reflected in our tip.Tuna amazing! 
Salmon not so much. 
Service and atmosphere great!
Ok food service was great, small portions. $7 for a salad with your meal I thought was a bit pricey.This club is becoming the worst Club in Chicago!!! 
And trust me I've been there from the beginning, when they're was pool tables and the girls were friendly, polite and Hot!!! 
And Nick didn't have a limp!!! 
And Chris, Tom and Dino used to shake my hand and thank me for coming in, And champagne room were reasonable priced, and the pictures of the girls on the walls actually work there, some of those girls haven't worked there in over 10 years!!!!
Plus when you actually went there on a Wednesday night and it was jam-packed!!!! 
Now the place is dead, the girls are rude, ignorant and 25 pounds overweight!!!!  
Me and my buddy we're there for over 2 hours and none of the girls came up to us at all!!! 
But there was 3-4 girls sitting next to us stuffing their face and bitching and moaning about how money they weren't making!!!! 
So after about 45 minutes of listening to this we decided to leave and go to polekatz where the girls they're treated us like royalty and we ended up getting great back rubs and lots of dances and talk to some wonderful girls. 
That's the way it used to be here!!!!!
This club gets worse every year! 
and I think it's because of management, all they care about is whoring the girls out and  selling champagne rooms!!!!! 
Plus They need to give some props to the wait staff instead of beating them up all the time threatening the fire them. 
If it wasn't for them this place would already be close just like Allure Gentlemen's Club which they owned!
Here is my advice stop remodeling the place because every time you do you make it worse!!!! 
Nobody likes this new design feels like we're sitting on school bus you, might as well put seat belts in the chairs if that's the look you were going for!!!! 
And remodeled the management, security and the girls!!!! 
Customers could care less how the place looks, we care about the entertainment and the service we receive not how the establishment looks!!!! 
If that was the case Jimmy's would have been closed 20 years ago!!!
Wow this place is awesome, Gracie and Asia are the most friendliest, best dancers around. 
My husband and I went with a group of friends and we all love this place. 
My husband and I recommend Gracie, she's awesome and very friendly. 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER FOR SURE AND ASIA. 
THEY'RE THE BEST!!!!!!!!?????????????????????
Went with a group of seven ordered two bottles and as I was playing the slot machines a stripper walks up to me and I told her watch my machine and I'll give you $20 as I go to the washroom she clears my machine of 175+ dollars and walks off... when I bring it to management they get mad at me and kick me and my group out before the second bottle was even touched and as I have made several attempts to resolve this issue there has been no response back from management nor the owner Dino.... 
Been going with friends for years but after this this I will no longer....  
The worst part is I now have a group of 10 people ready to leave 10 more reviews!!!!
Nora is definitely one of the cutest girls there. 
She�s your girl next door type and is extremely talkative and will certainly make your heart race!
Girls suck, "security/bouncers" assholes, overall experience was terrible. 
The girls extend dances with out telling you. 
Ended up paying for 2 dances when I only wanted one. 
Shady place, stay away from here and spend your money elsewhere. 
P.s. 
Girls here look like my big toe.Went for the Halloween event. 
Paid 12 bucks at the door and felt like we were part of an intimate 90s rock concert. 
Bands were great, people were friendly and everyone had a great time. 
Best time at Halloween in a long time.I eat lunch here fairly often, had everything on the menu at least once. 
I have my preferences, but have never been disappointed. 
Usually some good rock/metal playing, though I've heard a lot of things playing. 
Great patio, and delicious beers. 
Just go.We we're in town for the Frozen 4 and stopped by because of the closeness to the train stop. 
Really wasn't expecting much but boy were we surprised. 
The beer was outstanding and even better was the food. 
Our waitress Joey was great, her recommendations for food were spot on! 
The pork sliders, apple fritter hush puppies, and green beans were some of the best dishes I have ever had. 
Highly recommend this place! 
Keep up the good work.I always love coming here. 
Staff is cool. 
And the drinks, food are not priced bad at all. 
And the live music is always phenomenal. ?
Great outdoor seating area, friendly service and good food. 
I had the cobra club sandwich with tots. 
Three types of bbq sauce on the table along with ketchup made for great flavors on the tots! 
No drinking this visit, but they have a plethora of beers to choose from. 
Will definitely be back.Love the go-carts. 
Golf coarse needs new carpeting.I walked in and was greeted immediately with a big smile by Wendy. 
She signed me up for the rewards program while I was there as well. 
It was one of her first days on the job and she was so patient with me. 
I wasn't able to get the other co workers name that helped us out that day, but you guys are always sooo nice. 
Thank you for making my experience seem less stressful. 
I don't usually carry credit cards with me, so we were having issues processing my rewards. 
But we go it to go through and I'm happy that I will be able to enjoy my free bottle of wine each month! 
Thanks Wendy!
Always fantastic food and service. 
Michelle was so sweet and attentive. 
Hostesses are all friendly when you walk in, great atmosphere!
The best bread, service, food, and soda/tea!!!!!
Come here for any special occasion or just because, this is the best food ever they are so friendly here and if you have kids they give you a free chocolate covered strawberry the burgers are the bomb and the pretzel bread is the best bread I've ever had!!!!! 
Come here I promise you won't regret itA great wine selection and honestly the food is really good. 
It's a chain atmosphere, but still enjoyable. 
My only suggestion would be to be less pushy on selling the wine. 
However I do understand that is the job of the restaurant. 
Good selection of food and reasonably priced, good value wines. 
Not exceptional, but good value. 
Especially for a resteraunt.You should visit Illinois center location. 
People working there treat you real well. 
I buy lunch a couple of times every week and I am very happy with each and everyone working there.Thank youOnly came here because I had a free entree coupon but I was pleasantly surprised by the superb taste of the rustic food. 
Love the bread they use and I would definitely recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner stop. 
Try the pesto chicken! 
It's delicious! 
Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. 
Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh. 
It gets busy on weekdays during lunch, but the line moves quickly.I've been to this Cosi a few times now, both during lunch rushes and without and once for breakfast. 
Each time I've felt that the lines were a bit disorganized and the staff was a little behind, even the one time that they weren't all that busy. 
Everyone was friendly but it felt rushed and not the level of service I've had at other Cosi's. 
That being said, if you've eaten the food here it is the same as the other locations, good cafe food. 
I think with some of the other options in the immediate area that it isn't my top choice for sandwiches but the soups have always tasted pretty decent.The service here is very quick and the food is pretty good. 
So many healthy options to choosr from (salads, samdwiches, soup). 
Popular spot at my workAwesome stay! 
Hotel staff were amazing. 
Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)! 
Trusted him with making me whatever drink he wanted and I didn't regret it. 
Prompt service. 
Housekeeping did an excellent job. 
Laura at the front desk was always so helpful. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Really nice hotel�heard they recently did some renovations. 
If this is true, it paid off! 
Within walking distance of many great restaurants and the staff is very nice! 
Can't go wrong here.Wonderful hotel and even better location.  
The staff was very helpful and friendly.  
We had a  king room with fold out couch.  
The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  
My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   
Pool was small but nice.  
I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  
Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. 
Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  
I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  
The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  
Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  
Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!
I was there for a training for work.  
The customer service is wonderful.  
They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. 
The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. 
I will definitely be staying there again soon. 
This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. 
This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. 
The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. 
It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. 
There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. 
The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. 
Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. 
Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. 
The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. 
It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. 
We will definitely be staying here again.Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
Hotel was clean and check in was a breeze. 
Beds were super comfortable. 
Would definitely return again.I had a wonderful stay for nine nights. 
This place is a great secret. 
Great people. 
I have been to a lot of hotels and I have to say this is my favorite. 
They are there to help 24 hours.Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  
Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  
Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.  
Great location and friendly staff. 
Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. 
The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. 
It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.This is a beautiful hotel. 
Beautiful water views, patio, sofa sleeper in the suite, comfortable beds, and on top of that a friendly staff that meet you with the smile, and even bring you up at toothpaste and toothbrush when you need one. 
An indoor swimming pool, bistro, and Starbucks are a few amenities in this beautiful modern decorated hotel. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area.I'm only giving four stars because I have a concern regarding service. 
On Sept 3rd I came in to eat your buffet. 
I remembered. there  was a format for customers that said when they were finished eating to turn over their paid receipt. 
Well I had a plate of salad that I finished and headed back to get more food. 
When I got back I found my glass of water and a clear table. 
I said "What the"? 
and the server told me where the table I was sitting at. 
She apologized and brought me another glass of water. 
Later she told me that some of the staff doesn't comply with that policy of a turned over receipt. 
Do customers have to inform the server that they are finished and not returning from now on? 
Or is this something the server has to make the call on? 
I'm just glad I didn't have to get up and didn't leave a plate full of food! 
Also I'm glad that the section I was in wasn't crowded or I would be out of a table also. 
I just want to know what to expect if I ever come back to eat there again! 
It would be interesting to know!
Because it is a good buffet and I been eating there for years. 
Surprisingly awesome breakfast! 
I haven't been here in a while.  
The manager was super friendly, and knowledgeable.  
Very clean, neat, and organized.  
Can't wait to come back.Been going here a long long time, best deal , best food, best people and the buffet items are always fresh,  the restaurant is always very clean and the staff very friendly. .and it's all you can eat!!!!!  
I have eaten all over this country and Coyote Canyon is the Best Buffet there is...Trust Me.....I LOVE THIS PLACE.Food was good and a decent variety. 
Busy place. 
Being this busy, it's hard for staff to keep up... 
Both drink stations were out of ice and ladies room wasn't clean (according to my wife). 
But overall, was good. 
Better than we expected for a buffet. 
Lots of families here. 
If you're looking for intimate dining, this is not it. 
But if you're wanting to feed a lot of people a lot of decently good food quickly, we'd recommend it. 
The food isn't wow-great, but everything we had was pretty good.I love this place and they have the best food. 
Super clean everywhere in here. 
I was impressed by how quick the team moves to clean up. 
Everyone working had a smile and greeted us right away. 
We had a chance to meet the owner Jim, who seems to be an amazing guy and we could tell he treats his staff awesome. 
If you like food.... 
You need to come here!!!!
We love Cracker Barrel, but our waitress here needs to go, at least get a stern talking to.  
I know she forgot to put our order in.  
We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but waited over half an hour for our food.  
The people who came right awhile after us got their food right after we got ours. 
AND she wrote "over medium" when we both ordered "over hard." 
Time was important because we're traveling 500 or so miles today.Food was fine. 
Service was slow.  
She didn't clear the plates when we were done. 
I'm glad there is more than just this store locally.There were 4 of us. 
Place was pretty full. 
However our service was above top shelf.  
Thank you Billy Jo. 
Food was pretty good as well. 
Stop and see her. 
She's that good.Sandra, the waitress, was a gem and Peggy, the hostess, was so kind and nice. 
Great people and consistently delicious food. 
Couldn't want better. 
Even picked up a nice winter cape on sale in the gifts department. 
Whooppee!
Always a great place to eat. 
Nothing fancy but good basic breakfast foods. 
I really enjoy the eggs in a hole. 
And they have a good sweet tea. 
Michelle Jerge 1505601363Easy growler and howler fills off I65 - less than 10 min detour.  
Inside a pizza parlor.  
Smelled good.  
Good service.  
Easy parking. 
Kevin Werner 1500683981This place is perfect.  
Good beer.  
Good food.  
Excellent staff.  
It is small, which adds to the appeal.  
Nice outdoor seating for the warm months. 
Jeff Brown 1503271124One of my favorites in NWI.  
Quiet lounge area with lots of room.  
Beers are delicious and so is the pizza.  
Sunday you get a XL for the price of a large pizza.  
Nice place and I will be going back! 
Justin Singer 1508703778Great beers, mediocre service, pretty good food. 
James Bannan 1502151889Comfortable surroundings and good beer. 
Got good beer recommendations from Raven. 
Food is okay. 
Still a five star.We walked in to Dave and Busters October 20th for lunch and was thinking the lady in front of us was wearing way to much perfume, so bad that my eyes started to burn and tear up when she walked away the smell was still there we decided it was an air freshener and I ask one of the people working was this smell through out the entire restaurant and he replied yes it was. 
We lost our appetite at that point from the smell and left.  
I have never been in a restaurant that smothered there food aromas from the kitchen with perfumed air fresheners. 
The aromas from he kitchen actually enhances the taste buds and makes people hungry therefore increasing your sale potential from orders. 
Bad idea from the manager at this site. 
After we recovered from our nausea and burning sensation to our nostrils  we to Cheddars and had a wonderful lunch.We just went here for the first time and it was absolutely phenomenal. 
The food was so delicious and our waitress was super cool. 
Not to mention after we got done eating our delicious food we got to go right over and play games. 
Great experience. 
Can't wait to go back.Games are all that this location has going for it. 
The food is terrible and overpriced for the quality served. 
Short staffed waited 20 min for drinks the waitress was rushing talking so fast we didn't know what she said. 
We have been to many Dave and Busters on the east coast but this location is a joke.First time going here with my family it was awesome our server was the best we spent about $200-250 a little pricey but it was worth it, definitely beats chuckee  cheese ? 
will come back soon!
I celebrated a birthday here and everyone had a great time!  
We got the Eat and Play combos and our server was excellent!  
All of the arcades were working and the prizes were affordable, had a fun time!
My wife and I have eaten here a few times.... 
The food has always been good, well-cooked and promptly delivered to our table.  
Refill service and table seating can be slow with no apparent relationship to how busy or staffed they are.  
If they could work on their service/staffing issues this would be a first rate Dennys.Driving cross-country, we were tired of fast food and waited to find a Denny's, looking forward to sitting down and to the usual good service.  
However, while the food was typical good Denny's food (when we finally got it), the service at this Denny's was the worst we've ever experienced, virtually nonexistent.  
Upon entering the restaurant we stood at the front desk for five minutes, totally ignored, and saw only one waitress running around handling everything in the restaurant.  
We saw no other staff.  
Finally a hostess (manager?) 
came out from the back to deliver a check to a table.  
She made eye contact with us ... and then headed toward the back again, ignoring us.  
We waved our arms and she came over.  
We were shown a booth ... and then proceeded to sit ignored for twenty more minutes.  
By that time several other staff members had appeared, mostly walking in and out from the back and standing around talking while that one waitress continued to do most of the work.  
We couldn't tell who was supposed to be doing what because when the other staff members did do anything, there didn't seem to be any clear division of labor: at different times different people seated customers, bussed tables, rang up checks, etc. -- all while ignoring us.  
We were on the verge of walking out in disgust when finally we caught the waitress' eye and waved her over.  
We felt bad for her because she seemed to be swamped and stressed.Excellent! 
I admit I went in expecting a long wait given how busy they were and slow to seat people. 
However they handled it well! 
Didn't take long to get my food once seated. 
Plus it was cooked to perfection and exactly how I ordered it. 
Great Denny's! 
??
This place has greatly improved. 
The manager Ashly is a wonderful loving person and I personally was blessed to spend some time and chat with her. 
She strives to satisfy her patrons and provide a friendly atmosphere with quality food and service.I work a dedicated route here and usually eat breakfast here 3 to 4 times a week.I'm here quite a bit. 
Service is very very very below poor. 
Sorry ladies you ain't getting no tip from me. 
The only way I even come here is to sit and visit with friends. 
I thought maybe after the remodel it might get better, but no. 
Service is beyond poor. 
It's obvious the management don't care it all bleeds down from the top.. 
I do apologise for a crappy review, but it is what it is..Ordered pizza for our late night cravings on the Dominos app. 
Super freaking easy to use. 
I made special instructions to not ring the doorbell because I've got kids sleeping, and the delivery guy, Matthew, was awesome enough to call us when he was coming up the street to make sure he didn't wake the kids. 
Freaking awesome. ?? 
Chatted with him about his night, and he's honestly the nicest delivery guy my friend and I have ever met. 
His wife and kids should be proud ?????? 
Good job Matthew . 
OH AND THE PIZZA IS GREAT ?
We use the app to order almost weekly. 
Love it and love Dominos!  
Quality has improved and the prices can't be beat.Michael the delivery guy is cute af and it made my day. 
Thank you very muchOrdered from here 5 or 6 times and it has always been good. 
Your not going to get a $20+ pizza for $8 but you will get a very good $8 pizza.So far, my boy ceaser that's supposed to be delivering this pizza and garlic knots isn't here from a 2.2 mile destination after like 20 minutes of saying he was on the way. 
Wth Ceaser, we really counted on you. ** UPDATE** so freaking Ceaser just cancelled our dang order. 
Dang Ceaser. 
We are so disappointed. 
And to think I almost had faith and gave you three stars.The hotel staff was very friendly. 
No complimentary breakfast.  
The breakfast buffet was delicious and you get quite a bit for $11.99. 
They also give free warm and soft cookies..... on another note, they hold $50 per night. 
We kept seeing little brown ants in our room on the wall.  
I thought the price was too high due to not having a microwave or refrigerator in the room. 
The Evian bottle of water in the room is $4, so drink up if you want. 
Pillows are extremely soft. 
They do offer cots. 
Must wear wristband to get in pool.The room was amazing and closer to the highway than we expected. 
Staff and associates were helpful with directions and hospitality. 
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. 
Wish they had a microwave in room to re-warm cookies. 
But other than that, amazing stay!!!!
Hotel stay was comfortable. 
NOT at all happy with transportation from airport. 
Returned flight,, called hotel at 7:45 pm for "shuttles on the hour" only to find that it was going to be 50 minutes. 
Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. 
I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. 
To which I was told that I could take a taxi. 
So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. 
Should be called park and get stranded.  
WORST park and fly experience ever. 
Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.The on site restaurant was cozy even though they had a wedding going on. 
We sat in the bar. 
Service was slow that night, but the food was very good and worth the wait. 
We had the taco salad with chicken. 
All of us like it as an appetizer, then burgers. 
Definitely a nice time. 
I would go again.My son's Wedding was held here...beautiful ceremony and beautiful room for the reception. .food was exceptional as was the wait help. ..I will look to hold any occasion at the Double Tree..I know they will give me excellent service.Who can beat Dairy Queen ice cream. 
Love their hot fudge. 
Had a molten lava cake That was very good. 
Clean locationThe staff knows me. 
I would be embarrassed  (I eat a LOT of blizzards), but I almost find it endearing. 
They also tend to get really excited when I pull up with my dogs, and they give us pup cups.Fresh and fast. 
Can really tell a good  difference in the food since a couple years ago.Great food quality and it took about 2 minutes for our group of 5 people to receive our food. 
Great visit overall.This DQ has always been great as far as i remember. 
I have always had great service and they seats are always clean. 
I love the outside seating. 
My favorite meal is the chicken fingers 5 buck lunch with the upgrade to a blizzard. 
Vaibhav Ravi 1508970137I've been here a couple of times. 
The music is always loud but the second time it was just too loud. 
Not a fan of that. 
Ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries, both were great with a nice mayo dip. 
Would have liked more dip as there were lots of fries. 
Will update review once I actually eat something there. 
Tarun Chawla 1494979920This place was great. 
Just a nice casual neighborhood bath with good prices and specials. 
Ben the bartender was great to meet and talk to. 
They had a pretty great playlist playing (lots of indie rock) before the dj showed up, who switched to remixes of top 40 as the crowd shifted. 
Would have preferred the indie rock but not a big deal, later night crowd probably doesn't. 
All in all though I had a great experience here.  
Chris Osment 1500845378Cheap, tasty food and drinks via friendly and attentive service. 
Matt Drab 1488470015Just a bar. 
Nothing more, nothing less. 
With Three Aces gone, this could be one of the better ones on Taylor Street. 
Pretty random crowd when I was there (early-mid evening) - some old regulars, some super young college kids, which is pretty cool. 
On the other hand, there was a DJ setting up at around 11 when I was heading out, so it likely flips heavy college crowd late night. 
Kimberly V 1504131921Love the food and service, everyone is always so friendly! 
Tracy Garon Hojka 1506277159The food is amazing here.  
If you want really good homemade Cole slaw, then this is the place you're looking for.  
I had the grilled pork tenderloin sandwich (aka the Naked Pygmy) and my husband had the smoked chicken breast sandwich (sorry, don't remember the name of it) and both were amazing!  
Also, the bartender is very friendly - even to newbies like us!  
Come and enjoy an afternoon or evening out here!  
You'll enjoy it! 
Holly Horst 1508722735Love it! 
Awesome food and Awesome service! 
Diane Shutter 1487120896It doesn't look like much on the outside but the ambiance on the inside is awesome. 
A lot of items are smoked..tasty. 
Definitely a place you can kick back and relax.  
The help are friendly and don't rush you. 
At one time this was a bank and you can go into what was once the vault. 
Sherry L. 
Johnson 1498926936EVERY entre features smoked meat. 
Smoked meat is NOT a favorite of mine, though it was ok here,  I"d have preferred something NOT smoked! 
I was with other people and had no choice of dining. 
Please offer something for those of us who don't like smoked meat! 
Michele Stamp 1501119175Amazing food , good atmosphere .....Always a good drink and or food special.  
Bartenders Rock !
Went for a private event. 
Worst mixed drinks I've ever had. 
Bartenders were rude.The service and management what a joke. 
The server we had took for ever to come to our table that we had to order our drinks at the bar. 
Then when we told the gerneral manager what had happened didn't care nor did he wanna compensate for what we had to go thru. 
I was like wow this is a joke right and he said no next time go somewhere elseGreat staff great menu and drink specials every night. 
Friendly atmosphere and fun crowdWent for brunch. 
The deal is AMAZING for drinks, but the food is mediocre at best.No frills sports bar with a casual vibe. 
Came here for the p popular Sunday brunch which includes unlimited Mimosas and beer and includes an unlimited brunch buffet. 
The food ok, nothing to mouth-watering but for 25 bucks, it's definitely worth it. 
If gets packed and loud during the time which gives it a lively feel. 
Great service by the waitress and food was good.  
Drinks were decent.  
The bouncers though are basically giant idiots pumped up on steroids.  
While violently removing a patron one of these grunts knocked into me.  
I was on crutches so it's fairly easy to lose my balance and landed into one of their slot machines.  
No apologies given and landed on my broken foot.  
I will never return because of their desire to use violence over diplomacy.Ordered delivery and got a fresh hot pizza within half the time of my expected delivery. 
Best pizza I've had in a while!
Yes this place is a local dive bar but service here is always above amazing. 
Everyone is so friendly, plus the place is clean and they have a great outside patio. 
Pizza is pretty good also. 
Another great plus is that you cannot beat the drink prices. 
I would definitely recommend this.Great place to hangout with friends. 
The food is perfect and the service is outstanding.Food was Great. 
Drink was Delicious. 
Service was Awesome.Entrance foyer gets crowded during lunch people are trying to pay as others are trying to get seated from the same girl. 
They should push the seating 4 feet back and the entrance would be more welcoming. 
I ordered a chicken breast  dish which was a butterflied to ensure it is cooked thoroughly. 
The texture was rubber and I could tell it was the solution injected type. 
Salt water solution.  
Waiter could barely communicate in English and was pushy to get my order. 
This was my first and last visit.The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the room itself is fantastic. 
The high ceilings make it feel so much larger. 
The food was delicious and there are several options for any type of eater. 
The lay out when you first walk in is cramped if the restaurant is busy, but manageable. 
The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. 
I would recommend stopping in!
Having grown up in Southern California, I was used to excellent, authentic Mexican food. 
I've lived in the Midwest for 20 years and eaten at doses of restaurants. 
This is the only Mexican restaurant that meets my high standards. 
I love the food and the team at El Mexicano!
I love to eat and it is very hard to fill me up and this place did it in  one plate!! 
I highly recommend this place if you want your money's worth.A little out of the way, but worth the drive.Really a nice place to visit. 
The waiter who served us had very good knowledge about everything in the menu. 
Everything was nice and tidy. 
Food was delicious, especially the british beer was amazing! 
Definitely a go go!
Usually have several really good beers on tap.  
From what I recall they also have a decent scotch selection.   
Its got a nice interesting atmosphere as well.One of the better and cheaper casual dining restaurants in the loop. 
It's not haute cuisine, but there are a variety of British and American themed comfort foods available with a little something for everybody. 
Good appetizers, soup and salad variety in addition to main courses, all good food at good value. 
A great stop when you're travel-weary and need a warm meal late in the evening.The food was good, if not a bit over priced for the quality.  
Standard British menu items.  
The beer selection was adequate but not outstanding.  
They had all of the standard beers to be sure, but their "craft selection was limited to the standard stuff.  
I didn't notice and unique beers from the UK.Went for breakfast service was good, typical breakfast. though the banger tasted as if they spilled a jar of pepper in it.  
Pricing is about average for the city ( higher than normal for everywhere else)HORRIBLE. 
Soooo disappointed. 
Had been coming here every so often and did at the time enjoy the food. 
WOW ! 
Has it ever changed and not for the good.  
I took my daughter their for dinner and the quality of the food was terrible. 
The perch was soggy, the rice was overcooked as were the beans. 
They she had a dead FLY in her soup. 
When we showed the waiter he had this shocked look on his face. 
He took it and walked away and didn't come back for like 10 minutes, laid down the check and said thank you. !!!!! 
WHAT!!!  
No manager, No, I'm sorry,  No discount, Didn't even ask how our food was or if we wanted dessert. 
Will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN !!!!!
This is an attempt to bring casual dining mixed with fine dining atmosphere. 
Casual dress is ok, you will pay fine dining prices and not as good food.We were pretty bummed. 
The menu didn't match what was online either. 
Good service though. 
Save your money go to another place.We could not have had a more pleasant brunch. 
The staff was amazing. 
The buffet was great. 
The staff constantly prepared fresh food for the buffet. 
My friend, myself, and our kids loved this place. 
We had terrible experice at jellys the weekend prior, so Fahrenheit two twelve definitely restored our confidence in visiting local restaurants. 
Thanks to staff for our awesome experience!!
Amazing food and amazing service! 
Best Lake perch and prime rib we've ever had. 
Reasonable prices and nice atmosphere as well.I love this place! 
The food is great! 
I had a very attentive and sweet Waitress!  
We had the perch and it was delicious!
The best tasting BBQ ribs I have ever had. 
We always order naked ribs. 
The chicken was also very good. 
The sides were tasty. 
The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service. 
One of us is diabetic and we asked for some crackers before we got the meal...and you guessed right ... we did not get until it was pointed out. 
Only bad part of our visit was that we were waiting at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes before someone helped us. 
Our food was also apparently slow to be served, because they gave us $5 off and free dessert. 
Not that we had noticed or were in a hurry to  eat, but we didn't argue. 
Food itself was great; basic BBQ menu but well prepared. 
I had the spare ribs, excellent; my wife had the cedar plank salmon, good; my son had the beef tips, good. 
Free dessert was the bread pudding, incredible. 
Be warned: just reading the calorie counts on the menu is enough to give you a heart attack.I will say the food was amazing!! 
The only reason why I'm eating it so low was our server. 
Between her comments about her baby, ignoring us, and making comments about how she didn't want to be there I don't know what was worse. 
When we first got there she said how she wouldn't eat anything on the menu because her baby wasn't feeling it.  
We had to ask the host on 2 occasions to please get us refills. 
What was the worst is we waited for 10 minutes to get our check and it was like there was no one in the whole restaurant. 
When our server came back she made a comment that she was cleaning in the back so she didn't notice that we were done. 
The food was amazong but a bad server ruined our experience. 
We may try this place again due to the amazing food and the bang for your buck. 
The server we had definitely needs more trainning.I've come to this place several times and it has always had a very chill atmosphere. 
Friendly staff and good food.I'm definitely gonna keep making the drive to the one on L street because of the customer service. 
We ordered a platter and was told they were gonna call when it was ready to pick up and never got a call. 
After that I had a coupon for buy one get one half off entree and they wouldnt do anything even though the one on L has done multiple times, Lets keep in mind the platter is about 6 entree. 
Ill keep going to L street one.DO NOT EAT HERE! 
I took my husband here for his birthday and it was not a great experience. 
Yes, we were seated right away. 
The decor and modern feel makes this place look like it has potential to knock your party out of this world, but that's the best part. 
It took 20 minutes for our table to be waited on and we were the only group in the place. 
We ordered our food and waited from 45-60 minutes before food was served. 
When the food came, some of it was cold others over cooked. 
Everyone was upset. 
They attempted to provide us Champagne for a toast, but the champagne tasted bad as well. 
Most of the glasses we left completely full on the table. 
Overall, it was a bad experience. 
DO NOT GO HERE.Mob Mentality was at Filini!  
Great staff.  
Great drinks.  
Today we had a horrible experience at Filini.  
We were seated right away (which is the best part of the story), the waitress took our order which consisted of an appetizer and two lunch entrees.  
We waited eternally for the appetizer, which we had to ask a busboy to get for us.  
Then one entree came out alone, so we complained.  
The waitress said  "so sorry our kitchen is backed up."  
About 20 minutes later my pasta came out, all limp and overcooked.  
They did comp the entire meal, but what a horrible lunch.  
One family of 4 sat for 45 minutes without even a single waiter/waitress stopping by.  
If I could give it zero stars I would.Amazing experience and food! 
Highly recommend!
The pizza was excellent--most likely because of the amazing oven they have on full display in the bar. 
Service was mediocre and somewhat on the slow side. 
The burgers were passably adequate but definitely did not live up to the expectations from the description and price. 
It was my first time there.  
Birthday dinner for a long time friend. 
Dinner was good. 
But like I stated, it was a birthday dinner. 
My friend told the waitress it was her birthday when she first came over. 
A little while later the waitresses acknowledged another patron's birthday with a candle lit dessert and a song. 
My friend however never had this experience. 
Her Birthday gift bag & card were in plain sight the entire time we were there.Great food and atmosphere!! 
The staff all worked well together between seating customers,  taking and delivering orders promptly and clearing tables for those who were waiting. 
There is a private room for those who  have larger parties or have a private event. 
Personally tried the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger....fanominal!! 
For Dessert... 
BlackBerry Cobbler w/ Vanilla ice cream...delicious! 
Will be returning for another wonderful dining experience.I've known of this place since high school but didn't start my patronage until about 2 years ago. 
The bartenders are always friendly, I never have trouble with parking and the house beer rotation had much variety. 
Their fruit wheat beer is seasonal and super tasty (we had blueberry tonight). 
And the food had never disappointed my palate.Words can not express how Grateful and My Love for the Services provided here. 
I always will Highly Recommend this place to everyone.Thank you, so much for all the Awesome service here and the Staff is very professional and Polite.The place is Clean and I feel very much comfortable and at home here. ??????
Skip the ribs and brisket, stick to the burgers, etc. 
Ribs and brisket were dry, definitely needed the BBQ sauce. 
House beers are good though. 
Had 2 different IPAs, and the Hefeweizen, very tasty. 
Robin de Bled 1507818408Francesca's is consistently great and, while not cheap, it's generally reasonably priced. 
The staff are friendly and efficient. 
The food is great. 
The atmosphere is very pleasant.  
There are other Francesca's locations and in my experience they aren't nearly as good, but Francesca's on Taylor has been a consistent winner for me for years. 
James Williams 1502315761Great service and delicious food. 
The chef will make a special dish for you if you want something special that not on the menu.  
Staff is always extremely courteous.  
Environment is wonderful.  
Dana Chille 1504054595The pizza was fantastic! 
It was nice speaking Italian with someone who was right from the same area as my Great-grandparents! 
Excellent service too! 
Christine Martin 1506129588Great pasta. 
Bread with very high quality olive oil and parmesan with every meal. 
Ryan Breen 1505259497Held a work lunch meeting there in a private space. 
Great food, service, and value. 
Jacqui Erickson 1506140815My group (6 total) was looking for a place close to us that would be laid back and not too pricey. 
The food was fine, a little over cooked, but our waiter was terrible. 
He never checked on us, and when we went up to him to ask for sauce, we had to wait as he slowly poured drinks and watched tv. 
There were maybe 2 or 3 other couples in the establishment, so his attention shouldn't have been an issue. 
When we finally got a check, he never offered to split it (probably so he could add on gratuity because he knew he was terrible). 
When we asked him to split it, he told us to flip the check around and write out what our orders were because there was "no way" he would remember what we got. 
So we had to write out and tally up our checks, and he still had the audacity to add the 18% gratuity to the individual checks. 
I only gave it 2 stars because the guy helping him was nice overall. 
I would not recommend though, and will never go back. 
There are plenty of other places to eat in Chicago, it's no wonder nobody was there on a Friday night. 
Ben Blissett 1503445548We stopped in to get out of the rain and have a drink. 
Service was good considering how busy it was at the time. 
Good selection of beers - they claim to have over 100 available. 
I particularly liked how many local brews they had. 
Didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that, but what I saw looked good. 
The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is that there were only 10 beers on tap. 
Selection was pretty good, but I'd think a place like that should have at least a couple dozen. 
Good experience overall - I'd recommend it. 
Billy Phillips 1499241285Stopped in for a bit to let my dog rest while we walked around the city. 
They were so friendly. 
They brought out a dog bowl and a treat for my buddy to snack on while I enjoyed a beer! 
Great beer selection. 
Really friendly staff. 
I will definitely be back again! 
Matt Mottier 1505591262Standard Chicago style modern bar with high top seating.  
The food is rather standard and a bit duplicated from other similar bars.  
Still a decent place to grab a bite to eat in the south loop. 
A Flynn 1502707250Good bar food. 
They have great mac and cheese. 
Service is always good and fast.Excellent! 
That word describes everything you�ll experience here. 
Food was superb, bartender made the drinks fast and they were unique to the restaurant, server knew what to recommend by asking a few questions and speed was on point for each order. 
First time here in Chicago and have been a fan of his show so decided to try it. 
I love Mexican food and each dish was spectacular to the last bite. 
I just wish I had a bigger appetite.Wonderful! 
My business mentor and I dined here. 
It was my thank you dinner for her asking me to join her for a conference in Chicago.Come to find out she was a foodie like me! 
We appreciated each bite. 
This is not a place for just a meal. 
This restaurant is for those who appreciate food, the mouth feels, the flavor profiles, and the back stories. 
This restaurant - and those like it - are for the 'fans'. 
It's like buying an album of a music artist then seeing them in concert with front row tickets. 
It's like being into art and going to The Picasso exhibit when it comes to town.Quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had. 
We got the tortilla soup, holy smokes. 
Then these little tamale boats with carnitas inside, insane. 
Shared the Thursday special of flank steak and made tacos out of it... 
To die for.Best Mexican food made in America. 
I have never been disappointed no matter what I had off the menu. 
This place is great for lunch if you have time to spare.Second visit. 
The food and service were very good. 
I think the  River North taxes make some of the simple dishes a bit much, but in all, very delicious.I loved it! 
Everything was delicious! 
The service was great! 
Never heard of it before the party,  but I would definitely recommend it!
Had the filet mignon, very tasty.  
Not very impressed with the attitude of the servers or knowledge of bartender.  
A solid 3 on my scale for overall opinion of the restaurant.Superb Northern Italian Cuisine. 
Attentive wait staff. 
Elegant surroundings for both dining and parties.Best place in NWI by far. 
You feel like you are part of the family in Italy.Great restaurant, with excellent food and great service! 
A D 1497106687Fantastic popcorn. 
Got the one with caramel and cashews which was delicious. 
Reasonably priced as well, about $5 for a bag of popcorn. 
Bob Gordon 1491400722They seems to be a bit busier than others I have been to.  
While that means a little extra wait at times it also means fresh popcorn. 
The staff I have had is always very pleasant and the service is quick.  
Ryan Fee 1490656388Standard example of a Garrett's.  
Popcorn is fresh.   
Why I'd go here vs. the ones on Michigan Ave?  
NO LINES.  
EVER. 
Anthony Matos 1503683298Good popcorn but way over priced. 
I got the mixed which was really good. 
R Scott Weaver 1494199422Chicago just isn't Chicago without a visit to Garrett's! 
Love the cheese popcorn but you will need the moist towelettes you will find in the bottom of your bag!
I love this place. 
The food is awesome and the staff is great. 
This restaurant would be my 1st choice to recommend for Italian food.Try the deep dish pizza--you won't regret it! 
I'm sure a purist will say it's not as good as the ones in Chicago, and they may be right, but it's still the best pizza I've had in Macomb.Great food, good price, and EXCELLENT service... 
Highly recommend!!
Loved my lunch with my guy.... great guy serving us too!!
Loved the lunch pizza buffet and great service!
The food and ambience have always been outstanding.  
The general manager, Riley, she went above and beyond to make our experience great.  
She went out of her way and made a not so good situation into one that will bring us back multiple times over.  
Can't wait to eat here again!
One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. 
The tartare, bone marrow, and mussels are enough to travel back to Chicago for. 
Don't skip the cocktails - they're perfect. 
I definitely recommend this place, just ensure you get there early to avoid a wait!
Really the only down side was the main course portions are a bit less than what I expected. 
The pot roast was excellent, but the menu said it came with root vegetables. 
Root vegetables consisted of maybe 4 or 5 bits size chunks of carrots and 6 whole mini onions. 
The pot roast just fell apart so easy, tender and delicious with a great sauce! 
Beef tartare was excellent, black Manhattan cocktail was perfect.meatball appetizer was good, carrot cake was good but not phenomenal.Couldn't ask for anything more regarding service.Many reasons that I love this place... 
I usually travel to Chicago alone but always manage to find a bar spot here, my longest wait for someone to get up was about 5 min, even on a busy weekend night. 
Bartenders are pros and do justice to classics, Martinis, Manhattans, Cosmo, whatever. 
Food is always outstanding, although a la carte is not my favorite... 
It's not about cost, I'd just rather leave pairing of sides to the professionals. 
I wish they'd correct that. 
But the attraction is the ambiance... dark, hip, cool, and even a bit romantic making me regret traveling alone. 
So many great restaurants in Chicago but Gilt is always a must for me. 
Always leave wanting to tell someone about it, so... there you have it.Riley the GM is amazing. 
She turned our �not so good� situation into a five star rating. 
Thank you again!
This spot will hit your pizza spot! 
Deep dish Pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook and sometimes there's a long wait depending on the day and time. 
Call first.Solid Pizza and the atmosphere is really unique. 
This spot is pretty legendary and is definitely a crowd favorite. 
If you go to Chicago I definitely recommend checking it out. 
You won't be disappointed.The parking is really limited due to it being in the city, but they do offer $17 valet service. 
So why not.Amazing food (not sure how they made such great hummus for a pizza place). 
Pizza obviously awesome. 
Great wines. 
All were friendly other than the host who didn't like that we asked to sit in the other section.My daughter and I got a Lg sausage & pepperoni deep dish. 
It tasted good but was served way too hot - our hands got burned from scalding hot grease. 
The server never voluntarily refilled our drinks and rarely even came around after we ordered. 
Our drinks went dry FOUR times - unsat! 
3 of those times we had to ask other employees for refills. 
Did not feel the love.Went there with a large group and we're very accommodated. 
A bit pricey - and the deep dish takes about 45 minutes to cook, but the staff was smart, kind, and pro-active in the way they prepared you for the experience.It was super tasty, deep dish was good and the hand tossed was also tasty.  
Bread sticks were nothing special but good.The serving staff was above average - and promptly kept us all full of waters without getting snarky about ALL the water we were drinking.  
We'd been walking a ton from the navy pier.Highly recommend!
We enjoy Chicago deep dish pizza so we stopped in here. 
Fun place with  grafitti everywhere. 
Pizza did not disappoint! 
(Wasn't our first time eating Gino's.) 
Great server, too, for a busy night, he stayed on top of everything!
Went there for my birthday celebration. 
They were able to accommodate my party which was 15 people without any issues. 
We had plenty of room. 
The food was excellent, so worth the steak house price. 
I had the rack of lamb. 
It was prepared perfectly and tasted awesome! 
The service was also excellent. 
Definitely recommend this place for a dinner party or a quiet dinner for two.I called to make a reservation and they told me they could not accommodate for that many people. 
The funniest thing is I been making a reservation there for the last three years for my company. 
The manager was very rude to me and needs to go back to school on how to talk to people and learn how to run a business. 
The place must be going down hill if you let anyone in there without a reservation. 
And please stop serving old crab legs my wife got sick there and nothing was done.I took my boyfriend out for his birthday and we would have been happier at Wendy's. 
The service was horrible. 
Not only was our waitress uninformed of the specials but uncaring we were celebrating his special day! 
The cocktails we ordered were either pumped up with sugar or drowning in sour lemon juice. 
Our steaks we orderer were still walking/ raw when we asked for med. raw. 
The potatoes were from a box with powed garlic mixed in.  
We didnt stay for dessert and it wasn't even asked. 
We had to wait for our food to come out then our waitress was ready to box it up in 3 minuted. 
Can't believe they are still in businessNever disappoints. 
Had appetizers. 
Wait staff were awesome.Colossal Shrimp cocktail...good!   
Excellent service.I have been here or ordered from here multiple times and have always had great food and service.  
However, I ordered takeout last night and my stuffed pizza was not up to par.  
Half of the pizza was under cooked or something and I called in about it.  
The manager was super nice and offered us another pizza even though we were able to eat half and the issue may have even been caused by excess water from a poor topping choice (no more spinach for take out). 
Anyway, great establishment and they really do care if you enjoyed your experience or not.One of the best dining experiences I've ever had was here. 
I was visiting from CA and decided to try out this place. 
The service was excellent. 
The waitress was so kind and helpful. 
We got service you would expect at a 5 star restaurant . 
We had a party of forty-five, sixteen of which were very hungry soccer players. 
Made reservations earlier in the week and they were very accommodating.  
Had it all set up for us when we got there and the service was great even though they had another huge party right before ours. 
Food was excellent. 
Only reason I gave it only four stars was because it was very hot in the back where we were seated. 
I know there were a lot of people but the air didn't seem to be working.Would have LOVED to have had a deep dish tonight...but after being seated in a section right away and then IGNORED for twenty minutes, we walked out. 
It would have been different if the server hadnt walked into our section FIVE times to help the other customers there without even acknowledging we were there. 
To make matters worse as we were pointing this out to the manager who seated us, he was so busy helping the other people waiting to be seated, all he had was a rushed 'Sorry'. 
Really very dissatisfied and of course, hungry.....?
Very nice. 
Great beef sandwiches. 
Delicious beef juice.Everything about this place was amazing. 
We sat at the bar and the experience was incredible. 
We had a very attentive bartender/server that explained everything to us and asked questions as we went. 
I�m a vegan and I thought finding options here would be difficult. 
But they have set vegetarian options that can be made vegan. 
Sometimes when you get the vegan alternative, it�s just bad, but all of the vegan dishes I was served did not disappoint! 
Can�t wait to go back!
Everything was so amazing! 
There were 3 of us so we got to taste a lot. 
We had the beets, the chickpea fritter (probably my favorite), the goat empanadas, pig face (don't pass this up just because of the name), the crispy pork shank, and the goat belly. 
I recommend every single one. 
The ring of fire is also an amazing drink if you like something a touch sweet and spicy. 
Definitely plan to make reservations a few months ahead of time if you want to come here while visiting Chicago.The food here is rich and savory, if that's what you're looking for on date night then this will be the perfect place. 
If instead you're looking for small plates or something lighter I would say maybe hold of for another time. 
We were lucky enough to get a 10pm reservation and I was extremely impressed with the empanadas and the green beans. 
Nothing we ate disappointed us but I did find myself wanting something light to balance the meal better.What can I say that hasn't already been said� I don't know. 
The food is fun, the atmosphere is inviting and the service was great. 
Could not ask for more. 
We let the waitress pick the dinner for us and not only did she have fun doing it, but she picked some great items for us to try. 
I have already recommended to my friendsWhile it was an interesting experience and great service, I didn't feel like the taste fully justified the price. 
For two people, the bill was $130 before tip. 
We each had one cocktail and ordered average priced items. 
The atmosphere was upscale and fun. 
The hosts and servers were friendly.Course was in GREAT SHAPE.  
Haven't played there in a while. 
Pleasantly reunited with Glenwoodie.  
DEFINITELY will return.  
Clubhouse is beautiful.  
Course is in great condition, even after drought conditions in the early summer.  
Greens were sanded slightly, but they still were fast and true.  
Fairways were immaculate and pace of play was great.  
Back nine is much tougher than front nine.  
Watch out for 14 and 16, very tough holes for low handicappers.Challenging course. 
Great condition.  
Friendly atmosphere?.
It was a nice comfortable place. 
Love the area and the space.Glenwoodie is a beautifully maintained course. 
Greens can be somewhat challenging.Great selection of food and tons of deserts. 
I wish the salad section was a bit bigger but it's adequate. 
They have cooked ham sliced just for you at lunch, classic comfort food such as chicken and potroast. 
Lots of great sides to pick from, and oh yeah, lots of deserts including a chocolate fondue fountain. 
Everything tasted really great for buffet food. 
I will go back, I love the variety.Decent buffet for what it is. 
Meets expectations. 
Extensive choices. 
Some are hits some are misses. 
Most are acceptable. 
This isn't fine dinning. 
Worthwhile with the right expectations. 
People were rude. 50 bucks for 4 people to eat. 
Absolutely not worth itBest food. 
Great service. 
Feel at home.The golden coral in Coleraine Oh was terrible. 
We got there at 9:30 pm. 
We asked the girl at the counter what time they closed because we saw them taking food away she said I don't know and yelled for I think her name was Chalice. 
She said 10pm and website said 11pm. 
It was my son birthday and that is where he wanted to eat. 
I asked her since you don't have a full menu will it be full price?  
Very rudely said yes and that it was 17 dollars per person even for my son who is 8 and the website has price for 13 dollars.  
So we left I heard her say I don't want those people in HERE!  
Not sure what she meant by that but I felt insulted.  
Then people walked in after us and they served them. 
So not sure what type of people and place you are running I work in customer service and have never been treated so rudely especially as soon as you walk in the door.  
On my son birthday no less. 
I used to eat there often but not anymore.  
Train your staff in customer service also the parking lot had dirty diapers I almost stepped on one. 
It is sad really how poor customer service is at your facility.  9/15 Ron'shell Fair 1470941684Will never go here again the food is not worth it. 
Just didn't like it. 
But the people were nice.  
Marco L Negron Jr 1460311784I love you guys Robert White 1380338352It was not good the food was under cooked I made me sick I have to go to the hospital freddy rodriguez 1409598138Burnt ass food A Google User 1317157126U felt like I been going there for years Donna Van Gundy 1505431175Went there on a recommendation to have the rib eye steak sandwich. 
Was terrible..probably not cooks fault could of been a bad cut. 
Regardless. 
I didn't eat it nor anything else on my plate literally took 2 bites. 
Bo manager on site and guess what i paid for a meal i never got to enjoy. 
Sad to say i will not be back. 
Was my first time there too. 
Oh well. 
I don't cause a scene and bartender was nice to offer to call owner to see if she could comp it. 
Nope i had to be somewhere and was just so disappointed it ruined my appetite. 
Sorry Goodfella's this is not a happy customer. 
Sara Binyon 1501792014The bartender, Kaylah, was very intelligent and welcoming. 
I been to Goodfella's a number of times and I have never been disappointed. 
There menu offers a variety of options. 
I have previously had their pizza and I highly recommend it. 
Since then I am dairy free and gluten free, Goodfella's was able to accommodate my dietary needs. 
There is a fire pit in the back area which is cozy. 
The ambiance is inviting and friendly. 
If you are in Cedar Lake, you must stop there.  
Bob Sandling 1502117685We've recently become regulars within the last month or so.Great food and prices.Yesterday it was extremely busy for an early Sunday afternoon.My wife and I ordered lunch. 
It took about 30 minutes to arrive at our table.A man named Drew (owner/manager) apologized for it taking longer than normal. 
The lunch was fabulous as usual.Before we left, Drew brought both my wife and I 2 awesome T shirts!
A great gesture on his part to assure us to come back again. 
The food alone was our guarantee that we'll be back.Thanks Drew....Bob n Patty Gary Heiser 1505488463Their Italian Beef sandwich has an outstanding taste and they are very generous with the amount of beef they provide.  
In fact, it is a lot to eat for one person, a great deal and is highly recommended.  
We are frequent patrons so we can add that they do well in their waitress picks in that they consistently provide good service. 
T H 1498483452The bands playing were great!  
I drank four beers on tap..
(all Fat Tire) in a few hours...then Half a small pizza (right from the oven)....before I left. 
(Sausage pep.) 
Left feeling great! 
Hour later.... bent over the toilet all night! 
Couldn't even keep water down!!...
Missed work Saturday morning. 
Stomach was twisted in a knot! 
Thought I might die!! 
Bad beer or bad food...idk. 
Never again!!! 
I liked the atmosphere. ....but please stick with the bottled beer!! 
.and definitely skip the food!!!  
(Unless you want to debilitate yourself for the next 24hrs.) 
Was hell.Went today on lunch--I do frequent the location as it's close to work.  
Today my experience was so terrible, I took the time to write about it. 
While the food is ok, not many choices in the area, I usually go there for the quick service.  
When I walked in, I stood in line behind someone who appeared to be paying for their order.  
The young lady behind the counter walked away.  
Didn't strike me as odd, then no one came to the window.  
After standing there a couple minutes, another young lady comes to the window, stands there, says a couple words to her co-worker and closes the window.  
I'm still standing there.  
I open the window and asks where can I pay for a to go order.  
She does not respond.  
I assume she didn't understand me.  
When another young lady assisted me, I explained what occurred.  
Her response, "She does that all the time!"  
She apologized profusely and really felt bad.  
Food not bad, service from that particular person today, TERRIBLE enough for me not to give you any more of my money!!!!
Needed a late night snack... googled em. 
Staff was friendly food was good! 
I�ll be back!
Good food, slow service, check you order before you leave sometimes they get the order wrong but the nachos are amazing!
Food looks good and the amount of food is ok, the flavor still needs some love in it, as well as the temperature of it! 
But averall it is a good place for something fast to eat.Authentic Mexican food and friendly service. 
Though it seems they can only speak spanish, but I don't have trouble with that.The food and service is great. 
Honestly, when it comes to Hibachi style food, everything is extremely tasteful. 
Noodles, chicken fried rice, the chicken is amazing, the steaks are tender, service is always quick. 
I recommend making reservations because they get super busy during the weekend and hold times could be super long without a reservation. 
Definitely recommend it. 
One of my favorite places to go to when I want to indulge with food.Horrible Service, Decent Food. 
The chef show is good however the food (steak, rice, noodles, shrimp & chicken) all taste the same because of the flavoring they use - but this i didn't mind. 
Both times I went the first time me and my boyfriend asked for extra shrimp and steak and the waiter looked at me and said and I quote �girl you so funny� like it was a joke. 
I was perplexed. 
Finally once everything was paid I was waiting to get my extra steak and shrimp I asked for and it never came. 
I was insulted. 
Was he assuming it was a joke and We couldn�t afford to pay? 
Either way I didn�t find it funny. 
But I let it go. 
The second time we went (today) we asked for extra again. 
The lady repeated back to me and we verified twice my order but however when being served by the chef we didn�t get extra I literally had to walk over to the cashier spot where all the servers were and asked where was our order of extra at and she started acting as if she didn�t understand me or I didn�t ask for it the first time, I kindly and patiently told her again my extra order. 
We were waiting for almost an hour along with some other guest sitting with us - who were just waiting for a SPRITE (and who were complaining some of the food was burnt which I�m not one to be picky about food but agreed it honestly was). 
I�ve also heard stories from other people how they went asked for extra and never got it and how slow and bad the service was. 
We will not be returning and will happily find another Hibachi grill. 
Which sucks because despite the bad experience I really liked this spot, but because of the service I won�t be returning. 
I�ve worked in the food industry in the past and can understand how it can be but I also know what good service is, and they failed horribly at this. 
Hamada�s please get it together!
Food was fairly good, very over priced for what you get. 
Had to seek out someone to explain the menu and I feel like they tried to take advantage of you not knowing the pricing of the entrees. 
I did like them bringing out the carry out containers and bags right after the cook finished, it was like they was rushing you out. 
Could have been a lot better. 
To bad that this was my first experience.The service was great. 
The staff was friendly and speedy. 
However, two of the 4 people in our group have food poisoning right now. 
The two people that have it ate from the same sushi platter and started experiencing the symptoms at about the same time. 
Again the service is great, but proceed with caution.Excellent Hibachi Grill Japanese Restautant!  
Excellent steak, delicious noodles, awesome soup, and great sorbet (or ice cream) for dessert!  
A little bit pricey, but the food was delicious!  
Would highly recommend!!
Came in a little before 1pm on a weekday for lunch. 
Party of three. 
Walked in and saw there were four other small parties. 
Then realized there seemed to be only one server for the indoor parties and one server for the outdoor parties. 
That's it.We waited for a few minutes to even be acknowledged. 
After we were seated, our server took our drink orders (2 waters and 1 coffee). 
Took quite a while. 
Took long enough that we felt like we should've timed how long it took.This kind of delay remained pretty consistent. 
Our server was very polite, though. 
He was definitely doing the best he could on his own.The food was also tasty. 
I wouldn't go back, though.Looking for good food? 
Great drinks? 
Fun staff? 
Hamburger Mary's offers all that and more! 
Whether it's a breakfast to help my hangover or a burger for lunch, the food is consistently great. 
The beer from next door is also a bonus! 
Check em out!
I haven't been to a show here, but have been here for food and cocktails with my lover. 
The food is good as are the drinks, although it's louder and more crowded than I usually like - - my hearing is poor, and it was difficult to have a conversation, but I think most (gay or at least non-homophobic) people would be able to have an enjoyable date here. 
Upstairs is a Mary's Attic where we went to a Sunday tea dance one afternoon and had a lovely time. 
I would definitely come back.I love the atmosphere here ad the food is great.  
A bit overpriced but worth it for a nice night out!
A very quirky hamburger jiont/bar.  
From karaoke to charity bingo to Friday night drag queen performances  If you like great burgers and non traditional entertainment, this is the place for you. 
Corey Jensen 1502372836I really like Haymarket. 
It's in a cool building in West loop, nice ambiance.The wait staff was friendly and quick. 
The beer was good and loved the variety. 
We went to Haymarket knowing they had mostly pub type food, so we were not surprised when we saw the menu and got our food. 
That being said, the food was really good and presented really well. 
Do not let the fact that they have pub food fool you, its upscale pub food. 
Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be back to Haymarket.  
Andrew Merchant 1500570407This place is excellent. 
It has good beer (not sure why someone said it was crappy in a review). 
The food is great. 
And the service was even better. 
We flooded this place with a group of about 40 people and they did an outstanding job keeping up with everyone. 
Lynda H 1503686937What a great place for beer and wings. 
Big selection and large variety of their own draft beer. 
The wings were meaty and tasty! 
I had a Bratwurst on a roll too. 
Divine! 
Although I don't really watch sports, they had big screen TV's playing the sports channels. 
The bartenders (I ate at the bar) were super friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the beer and food. 
The prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere was comfortable for enjoying an evening out. 
I visited twice. 
I wish I had found this place sooner into my visit to Chicago! 
It's definitely a favorite that I will be suggesting to friends! 
Adam Johnson Jr 1497408759The food has been great. 
Loved The Riot sandwich and sweet potato tots! 
The flavor of the pulled pork was beyond what I expected. 
Very unique and delicious. 
Visited 3x during my business trip. 
Enjoyed their beer. 
The atmosphere is nice and simple. 
The staff is friendly and attentive. 
Simeon Vogiatzis 1499787039This place is epitome of solid brewpub. 
Extremely solid bar food - personal favorite are the fried cheese curds. 
Huge tap list of house made beers with enough variety sure to please everyone. 
Service is always attentive and friendly.Great drink selection for a sports bar. 
One of the few places to get gumball head on tap! 
Food is also pretty good as well, I recommend the burgers.It's  Delicious. 
The  Staff are always fun to be around and helpful. 
Food is greatAwesome food! 
Had the Salmon special. 
We also had the famous burger. 
Everything was awesome!
Really horrible experience. 
Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. 
But everything you get here you have to ask for. 
Get a burger well if you want any toppings you have to be the one to bring it up otherwise you will get a plain burger. 
The biggest problem here was my waitress, Taylor. 
She came by my table probably 3 times the whole visit. 
One to take my order. 
One to drop off my food. 
One to collect her money. 
I needed a fork the entire meal but she was nowhere to be found. 
It was obvious The check was supposed to be split but wasn't. 
When we needed her to split it we had to wait for 20 minutes. 
Just the way she talked to us was horrible. 
I felt discriminated. 
I would understand if they were busy, But they were not! 
Horrible visit will never be backDelicious food but the bar needs help.  
I ordered the same drink 3 times and everyone tasted different.  
The final onne was juice because they ran out of cherries.  
Instead of charging me $9 for juice how bout ask me if i would like to try something else.  
My husband order a martini and it was less than half way filled.  
We asked our server where the rest of it was with no response.  
Come fornthe food wine and beer skip the cocktailsThis is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  
The service is fantastic, and so is the food!   
The clams are my personal favorite.   
The awesome staff members made me a special B-day cake with little bunnies made of grapes, strawberries and oranges crafted into flowers.  
And whoever thinks this place is bad, the reason I have provided:YOU DESERVED IT BECAUSE OF YOUR BADDD ATTITUDEI have never given a one star review before.  
Everything seemed nice when I sat down I asked the hostess to put me in a quiet area so I could read. 
Not five minutes later did she also set a table with with four infants and Toddlers. 
There were at least $16 tables around the area that she could have sat them at.  
I saw my server twice once to pick up one plate and then to drop off the bill never to be seen again. 
The food is the typical buffet style food.  
My only problem with it is that it it was cold by the time I actually return to my seat to sit down and eat it, some of it did not taste as it should. 
There are signs at every table it says please pay your server well I got tired of waiting so I went up in front I was going to voice my concerns to the cashier but she was on her phone in a hurry to leave saying I'll be back in 1 minute then she told the hostess to collect my money but not to touch the register or run a credit card so luckily I had enough cash not a big deal but it for poor service.  
You got your own rest the food is iffy some of it did taste bad and the service is even worseGreat restaurant. 
You can't beat the price. 
The sea food options are phenomenal in the price range. 
I had been to this restaurant several times never had any food digestion problem. 
During the special events like mother's day or father's day watch out for endless crab . 
Again you can't beat the food quality in that price range.The food is still delicious; however, the waitresses are not the way they used to be (say to 3 years ago)!! 
My husband just found out that the stir fry cook is no longer getting the tips from the tip jar. 
The owner is taking all those tips!!!
That is utterly pathetic ????
Food was good in recent visit on October 4th 2017, but me and my female friend were both sexually harassed by the grill cooks even after our accompanied males confronted both of the cooks announcing to stop the harassment. 
I love me some sexual harassment with my lunch...not really.The hotel is located very centrally, right on Michigan Ave. 
It was. 
Wry close to walk to talk the L to many Chicago attractions and landmarks like Wrigley field, Willis tower, the bean, the pier, the planetarium and more. 
The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
The hotel is gorgeous with elaborate designs and features like their grand stair cases, chandeliers in the ballroom, and fountains. 
The rooms were spacious and clean with great views of the city. 
I would definitely stay here or attend events here in the future.We had a block of three rooms. 
They couldn't put us anywhere near each other. 
My in-laws rooms had ants, like a lot of ants. 
Our room was fine. 
But I checked my statement for my credit card last week and found that someone else had charged almost $80 to my room. 
How is this possible?!? 
They told me they would look up the receipts and sort it out and get back to me in 2-3 days. 
It's been a week and no contact. 
I'm likely going to have to dispute the charges and figure out it another way. 
The location is nice and the hotel has historic beauty,  but it's just not worth all of this hassle.I worked a private event at the hotel that covered multiple floors and can say that the Hilton is gorgeous. 
I live in the South Loop and have walked by the hotel multiple times but had never been inside- it gorgeous to say the least. 
The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly to myself and team members. 
All of the rooms we used were clean and fully stocked at all times with anything we asked for. 
I would absolutely come back as a guest and will be referring family and friends to stay here during their next trip to Chicago.Maintenance items to address: I�m a Hilton Diamond member. 
As a person who travels as part of job, I�m leaving this review as balanced and unbiased.I have stayed at this hotel many, many times. 
All of my stays are for a minimum of 10-12 days. 
These stays are always part of a business trip and with a group. 
Parking is pricey. $75 per day - valet. 
The service, attentiveness, and attitude of the staff is always spot on.  
No complaints with the staff. 
The hotel itself is getting a bit tired. 
It definitely needs freshened up.The biggest complaint I have is losing the executive lounge. 
Why take the lounge out?
It�s a grand hotel and has always held a special place in my heart but she needs some attention.The hotel is easy to access from main street. 
Interior is clean and welcoming lobby. 
Very open space, surprisingly they have an entire hair salon downstairs! 
Along with some cool anaxj shops and 2 gift shops. 
The pool is clean and gives you a great overlooking out to the park and lake. 
Room was comfortable and secure.What a joke at the bar. 
This guy cares more about his friends then the customers. 
As a regular patron through my company this is a joke. 
Week drinks n no service unless your a personal friend.  
Disappointed is to say the least.. 
Dwayne cares more about personal friends then customers, not like anyone cares. 
What's a joke. 
Bad language n customers are disregarded for friends.  
Never had worse service from this hotel chain  period. 
Makes me rethink my loyalty.Nice stay. 
Very friendly staff. 
Lots of attention paid to small comforts. 
I appreciate a hotel that goes above and beyond with the little toiletries in the bathroom! 
Haha. 
Comfy beds and pillows, nice furniture, bathroom was small but well appointed. 
Great location also.Recently stayed for work. 
Checked in Sunday night departed Thursday morning. 
I noticed a bite on my arm. 
Didn't think much of it in the morning. 
By mid afternoon noticed several more bites. 
Currently have 12-15 bites on my arms, legs, feet and face. 
Anything that wasn't covered by clothing. 
I immediately contacted the hotel to let them know so they could check the room and treat it before any other guests had to deal with this. 
The front desk person was friendly and apologetic. 
I wasn't irrate or rude.  
I was told the manager was unavailable and was in a meeting but would call me back immediately. 
I gave my name and number. 2+ hrs and counting still zero call. 
Bed bugs happen, I know that but I think how a hotel handles bed bugs says a lot about a hotel. 
I will note that the head board on the bed has a gap even though most hotel chains have gone away from this due to the fact it gives bugs a place to hide. 
I informed my managers as this is a hotel we frequently use for employee training classes as well as regular stays.Stay here once a month for work. 
Good location, right by the blue line and two blocks from Union Station. 
Staff are friendly and courteous. 
Mini fridge in most rooms.This is the second time we've stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago downtown. 
It's conveniently located near the center of downtown Chicago. 
The hotel is clean, the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. 
They have a pool located on the top floor. 
The hotel has all the amenities you'd expect. 
They have a nice restaurant on the floor level that doubles as the room service kitchen. 
Parking is expensive, but there is a city lot next door as an option. 
Package deals for the room with parking included at a discount are available online. 
We had secured one of those packages, but we had to point out the discounted parking to the staff at check-in. 
They were pleasant and accommodating when we pointed that out. 
Over all, we have enjoyed staying here and look forward to returning on future visits.It has been quite awhile since I've been to Hollywood Casino.  
I love that there is no more smoking here.  
Waitstaff was attentive, and dealers we pretty friendly.  
It appears that the business may have slowed in recent years, as it was easy to play any table on a Saturday night.  
Lost money, but had fun.This place nice. 
They only give some people hotels and free play . 
How I know my friend don't go here anymore she has not been here. 
Since 2015  And she ALWAYS get free room And free play. 
I was going once a month and wasn't getting ANYTHING. 
I. 
Started going last year. 
And spending good money. 
But I never got a free anything. 
So don't think I will go back.Used to be good.  
The machines are tight.  
They cut back on the quality of food in the VIP Lounge.  
Room filled with dirty tables with food left from previous guest.It isn't very big, but the game variety is nice. 
For the most part it is clean, and there are usually games available even on busy nights. 
The snack center on the lower level has a particularly cranky woman who usually works Friday evenings. 
Watch out for her.I don't even want to give any star to this place.people are just racist.! 
Especially, Roulette dealer.They just clean your pockets out??!!
We all know that table are controlled. 
But at least in Harrahs Casino makes you win!!? 
So, you still come back and enjoy returning. 
The dealer are friendlier.Tiny Overpriced Waste of time.  
They're Packages are a rip off
.
  $20 for 2 hour unlimited bumper cars, Himalaya from Kiddie land and Giant slide with burlap filled with holes
.
  $5. 
Game card play 2 games $2 each.  
All in All Major Rip off.   
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  
Left and took the kids out.  
Total loss $90 two hours.  3 $20 packages and $10 on each card extra!
You guys really stepped it up. 
I wouldn't suggest eating here but the games were fun to play and the outside was pretty fun, update the bumper cars or even just turn it into a playground ball pit and you guys will shut down oddessy fun world AND chuck e cheeseBest amusement business in the area.  
I absolutely love the go karts.  
I also like the VIP program and that they always get new games.I recently went to a birthday party there and the set up was amazing.  
They had everything a kid could want.  
It was a super hero party and the kids had a ball!
Nice clean newish inside, just fast token consuming games ok prizes. 
Outdoors needs rehab all fencing, hardscape and mini golf prop houses need to, otherwise ok.Fantastic food. 
Locally owned. 
Very nice place to eat in or carry out. 
Friendly staff.I always get a boxed lunch with the ham classic on a croissant. 
It is literally the perfect lunch.   
They give you the option of your sandwich,  a sml side, a cookie, a spear pickle, and a drink.    
It's a beyond  delicious sandwich.  
If you haven't been in there before the staff is really nice about helping you out.  
Clean, friendly, and tasty food. 
Jeff and Toni are great people and offer a great product.Amazing food. 
The ham is great, I love the turkey.Absolutely the best ham ever! 
The employees and owners are the nicest. 
They may have a higher price than Walmart but you will not have the owners of Walmart deliver to you or walk your products to the car for you either. 
I can not say enough about this place and I will order my hams from them for every holiday.Stopped in before a show at the concert hall next door.  
Just wanted a quick bite.  
We had a pork sandwich and a brisket sandwich with a side of Mac N Cheese.  
They were all amazing!  
Cannot wait to come back and try more items on the menu!
Great food. 
But, the patrons can either enhance or kill the vibe, depending on when you go. 
It's a hip little spot that nails the BBQ and music though. 
I'd recommend giving it a try, if you're ever in the area.Great food. 
Very helpful staff with great service. 
They have $3 PBR tall boys which is great, and I�d recommend the platter to share between 2 people.They booked this band called 'The Westerlees' and this was one of the most fun times I had. 
They really had a great energy with the crowd swing dancing. 
I will definitely be back here again!
Sorry. 
Not impressed. 
No smoke ring seen on ribs. 
Meat didn't fall off bones. 
Tasted like it came from the steamer. 
Too much pepper in dry rub. 
Serving photos show ceramic plates presentation. 
Actual service plates look like metal pans from yard sale. 
Empanadas good. 
Prices good. 
I have come to this location for awhile.  
It seemed to be taking a down turn. 
They remodeled it and changed staff and it has been delightful to stop and eat. 
The food has improved and the staff has been kind and attentive.  
The floor and bathrooms are clean and new  I will probably upgrade my review next time.Our waiter Brent was super nice and very friendly. 
He immediately took care of any needs we had and was very prompt in his serving. 
The food was fantastic and the restaurant was super clean. 
Best doing experience I've had in a while.We waited 5mins to be seated, 3 employees saw us standing there waiting. 
It took another 10mins for our server to come to the table. 
We ordered our drinks and my orange juice was pretty much warm and I had to ask twice for a glass of water. 
Then had to ask another 2 times for our sides, my stuffed French toast didn't have the icing or whipped topping on it, my husband's cheesecake pancakes didn't have the whip topping on it either. 
All this and it wasn't even busy.So far this IHOP has been the best IHOP my family and I? 
have eaten at, from NC to NE. 
Staff was awesome.Food was really good, comparable to Denny�s and CrackerBarrel.Always a wait on Sunday, but usually only 10-15 minutes.  
Service is fast.  
Nights (after 11pm) are usually slower service, but still friendly.cooks messed up my wifes simple order, so had to wait for it to be remade, took forever. waitress expected a tip even though food was wrong. ended up taking her meal to go which probably goes into trash. what a huge disappiontment to a great evening.I have to say I was very disappointed in Vegas baby. 
We had a very special night in honoring our coach Miss Slater who was also an Olympian we wanted to eat and dance and drink and enjoy the the reunion. 
We had a large group coming in wanting to eat dinner. 
I went to the hostess and ask them if we could have tables and that it was going to be 20 plus people she said yes we can seat you. 
After we got in there the manager started freaking out you could see it in his face and in his actions. 
He actually talked his business down trying to discourage us from eating there. 
He said we're short-staffed and we can't handle anymore and stated that also the kitchen closes at 10 so if we wanted to order we had to hurry up. 
We understood they were short-staffed and we understood that it would be a while to get everybody served and that we would be patient. 
I've never seen a manager talk their business down turn money away but they did serve us and I have to say the servers were excellent the food was excellent. 
But here's where it takes a turn. 
At 10pm they change into a nightclub which we all knew was going to happen we came to eat drink and dance we were ready to spend money. 
I spoke to the waitress understanding that there's going to be a cover charge I asked if we had to leave and come back in she expressed that no we did not and that they would come up and just stamp our hands as we paid. 
So Joe Blow rent a cop comes up and speaks rudely to some of the ladies there saying you have to get out and come back in and pay $5 if you want to stay in this nightclub.  
The way he spoke was rude. 
We had already made arrangements with our waitress to pay and we would have. 
So instead of having over 30 people spending their money in their bar buying drinks and shots Etc we all decided to leave and spend our money elsewhere. 
Mistake Vagas Baby big mistaked. 
They missed out on a great opportunity to make some money. 
What's worse is that we have our ball the next day and most of those people woukd have probaly camr to your bar afterwards but now they probaly won't so that was two nights of income your bar missed.  
Not cool Vegas baby don't know if I'll recommend you to anybody at this point. 
And I've been coming to your establishment a long time.Fun night club with good bands.Fun place to go out and have a few drinksGood food, fun place. 
We met some new friends here, had a good time.What a wonderful Chicago restaurant! 
I'm so glad to have experienced this to its fullest! 
From the time you walk in, get seated, order, refills, receive your foods, through to the end of getting out the front the door, the customer service is the best along with the food. 
The food is prepared with intention for your taste buds to have an experience on their own. 
Go there. 
You won't be disappointed.Great date Spot. 
Best Shirley temple you�ll ever have.  
Amazing service.  
Delicious food.  
Atmosphere is stunning. 
I�ve been coming here with my family for New Years dinner for years and it�s become one of my favorite family traditions!
Amazing atmosphere! 
We celebrated an anniversary and they surprised us with a slice of cake to share for free. 
Very nice! 
Food is amazing! 
Expect higher prices when entering but it is worth it! 
Service is incredible!
Peter is the best server! 
Very kind and made sure our food came out perfectly. 
Super good food and great atmosphere however the rest of the servers/staff were running around a lot, looked to be very stressed and in a hurry. everyone should be a little bit calmer to give the restaurant a relaxed, more "take your time" vibe.Visited in 2014.  
My wife and I ate here on our vacation to Chicago. 
The Italian Village is one of three restaurants in one building and this is the one is in the TOP floor. 
The service is great and Italian! 
The ambiance and decor is great and Italian! 
The food is great and Italian! 
Point is that this is a genuine Italian fine dining experience for a reasonable price.Great food and helpful staff. 
Plenty of specials and televisions to watch all sporting events. 
They have a huge beer selection.Great specials everyday, especially Sunday! 
Great for families and adults only as the bar and dining room are very well separated.Nice log cabin design. 
Place is clean. 
Waiting staff similar to Tilted Kilt, but a bit slow. 
Food and drinks were good. 
Daytime female bartender was nice and efficient. 
Nice outdoor patio with a view out back.Very good salads, better than you'd expect!! 
Great friendly staff!
Awesome food, drinks and atmosphere!!!
My favorite JJ in all of Omaha. 
Staff is fun, food is great. 
Love the bread ?
So i usually get a really good sandwhich from this jimmy Johns but today i got the BLT and for the price they charge three strips of bacon is CRAP!
Not happy customer today!
Open early, fast, attentive, sharp workers. 
Good stuff. 
Keep it up! 
Better than Subway in Good Sense by farOne of the guys here ran my card and then just didn't give it back to me. 
I had to tell the guy who made my sandwich to give me back my card. 
How short does your attention span have to be to run someone's card and forget to hand it back to them? 
Never had that happen before. 
Makes me think something fishy is going on.The food here was absolutely incredible. 
It was expensive but you would expect that from a high end restaurant like this. 
The service was great and the atmosphere was amazing. 
It was very crowded but that means people like it there and they are getting good business which they deserve. 
I will eat here every time I visit Chicago, no matter how expensive it is. 
It is worth every pennyMost definitely the best meal I had in Chicago! 
The servers were extremely professional very detailed oriented. 
They were precise and very accurate in their description of the menu items and in their delivery.  
Make sure you save room for dessert!
Every single item I put in my mouth was excellent! 
The steak was top notch, grilled to perfect live-fire. 
Try the hash browns you won't be disappointed! 
Mac and cheese was creamy and the pasta wasn't over cooked! 
I had the seafood salad to start it was a wonderful blend of texture and flavor and the perfect dressing! 
Try this place it's worth every penny!
Would have given this place 4 1/2-5 stars but I'm disappointed in them tonight. 
I dine in and the food is great I order carry out from time to time and tonight I'm not pleased with the food. 
Looks like it was thrown together and a lot of additives were missing like the butter for the bread. 
The scampi sauce was skimpy for my stuffed crab shrimp. 
The potatoes seemed to be skimpy plus they were cold as well as the shrimp. 
I've had better so I know they can do better however I'm disappointed. 
I know it was late but who doesn't like a good late night meal? 
If it's not worth it don't sell it. 
You don't want to lose a customer!
The worst experience ever. 
Our waiter used horrific profanity to his assistant server Ivan. 
More than once. 
A family with small children dined next to us. 
Was heard by many. 
As an educated professional, I truly am appalled and my evening was ruined  along with my guest as well. 
Found this restuarant to be one of the top 10 of Chicago.  
Never again.Great service, food was good, but not great.  
Standard diner fare.  
Fried chicken was good.   
Salad bar would have benefited from more fresh veggie options like broccoli, carrots, etc.Very good chicken with great service.  
Worth the price paid.  
The next time I am in Kankakee, I will definitely stop there to eat.Great food. 
Good prices. 
Best Mac salad ever.Not bad. 
Coupon for $5 off. 
Makes $10 buffet $5, not too badGood food nice staff.This place rocks. 
Bands were great. 
The BBQ. 
Ribs were excellent.  
The atmosphere of the decor fits just what u picture in your mind as a cool blues bar. 
There u have it, if u love the blues, this is a place for u.A friend of mine got kicked out tonight for no reason and the bouncers were unreasonably rude. 
They tried to move us away from her and force us to stay by blocking the door despite our insistence to leave with her. 
It was a big group of girls and we felt incredibly uncomfortable around the two towering male bouncers, particularly because the female manager was egging them on to badger us out of the venue. 
We’ve been there many times and now don’t feel comfortable recommending it to anyone we knowAbsolutely amazing place!!!  
The dual stages were spook much fun.  
The music never stops and the drinks are so reasonably priced and they just keep coming.  
I'm 44 and I would be hard pressed to remember having a better time in my life at a venue.  
I will be back every time I get a chance.  
Amazing job!!!!!
Used to love this place. 
The switching of stages is okay, I usually just stay in one side because I don't want to keep going back & forth. 
Last time, I was disappointed when I ordered food because their portions are much smaller now but somehow cost more? 
(ordered sweet potato fries) Then the waitress seemed annoyed because I got my drink from the bar instead from her. 
Never buying food there again, actually not sure if I'll ever go back.As a regular here (at least twice a month) I was disappointed with the food on the past two Thursdays I've been. 
There seems to be something different in the kitchen because the food isn't the same on Thursdays nor is the taste consistent. 
I love coming here Thursdays Fridays and Saturdays because my favorite cook is in the kitchen, but now no longer Thursdays..I recommend ANYONE comes on the nights he works! 
Don't know his name but I know he has dreadlocks and is very polite and professional, just based off the short interaction we had when he had a so called break/breather(which lasted all of 3 minutes). 
You guys should have him there as often as possible! 
There was a gentleman that claimed to be in charge of the kitchen, but he was very rude and arrogant and dismissive when I inquired about my mystery chef. 
I will go ANYWHERE he's cooking! 
Look forward to coming to the Mines tomorrow for some quality food!
This place is fantabulous! 
Mango margarita was off the chain, the sampler was big enough for two people to get full. 
(My husband & I shared it), decent atmosphere.  
We will definitely be making frequent trips!
The drinks are strong, the food taste great, the service was excellent, definitely gotta come back ??
Food was great we had the Lacarreta sampler and the drinks were strong. 
Great staff and the male waiter were all good looking. 
Yum yum ?
This place sucks! 
I told my waiter that my strawberry margarita tasted very salty and that it was discussing. 
He said he would have to talk to the manager. 
That jerk (the manager) never came to our table to see what the issue was. 
The waiter came back and said that I waited to long to complain that there was nothing he could do.I guess while I am at it, my taco salad wasn't that good either. 
It was supposed to be chicken with no bean, they definitely got the no beans right. 
There was hardly any chicken and it was flavorless. 
It tasted like I was eating lettuce and sour cream.The quaccamoli wasn't anything to write home about either. 
The shell wasn't  good, stale and had no flavor.Needless to say we wont be back, which is sad cuz my husband enjoyed his dinner.Love this place handsome waiters great eye candy and amazing drinks food and serviceReally good food and a fun atmosphere at night with margaritas and mariachi bands, but the service is the slowest I've ever experienced. 
The last time I went, a one hour meal turned into two hours. 
First, they took one person's order wrong, then it took over 20 minutes to correct, and we were still charged full price for it. 
Then, it took a good half hour to get boxes and the check after everyone was finished eating. 
The first time I went, service was slow as well and our large party couldn't get the check split at all. 
Service is the only downside.I always have some enchiladas and drinks. 
The food and margaritas are par for a Mexican restaurant in the US. 
The wait staff were very good. 
Karaoke was a blast last time I was there. 
It's a good floor for doing songs by yourself or in a group.I am never returning  here for dinner. 
It's literally some of the worst reoccurring dinner service.  
Every time I go,  the hostess behaves very arrogantly (it's always the same one, don't know her name, she's usually there when I attend Wednesday's, Thursday's, and Friday's). 
The first time I tried waiting for a table, she interrogated me on whether I was really going to eat dinner. 
I'm not sure why that would even be a question because it's a restaurant right? 
So if they rather earn most of their money from selling booze (explains the security guards) then just close the kitchen and call it a club. 
There's no reason for a hostess to intimidate customers who are simply asking to be seeking to be seated. 
The second time I tried having dinner for a friend's birthday. 
Again, I was interrogated over whether I was actually going to eat. 
She finally signed me up for a table, and then conveniently forgot to tell me that my entire  party (who were driving from the suburbs) needed to all be present so that I may be seated. 
Because they weren't present when the table was ready, I lost our place, and I had already waited over an hour and fifteen minutes. 
Honestly, if I knew the entire party had to be seated at once, I would have popped into another nearby establishment to wait for them. 
The third and last time I went to dinner, I went with my co worker after work (9:30p). 
The hostess seated us on the dance floor.  
Busboys kept clearing out tables around us so I asked to be moved to another section. 
However, our waitress refused because apparently the restaurant can't have my bill transferred to another waiter (makes no sense). 
Our waitress referred us to the hostess, so I tried asking her, and she was of no help. 
Our waitress that night was very slow and kept forgetting small things we ordered like limes and water. 
She never even bothered checking in. 
It took forever to get her attention in order to obtain our bill. 
The waitress finally brought our check, but didn't bother to return for the payment. 
I was very overwhelmed at this point, and decided to just walk up to the register to cash out. 
The hostess was at the register when our waitress gave her my card and asked her to cash me out. 
Instead of apologizing for the delay, the hostess glared at me, gave my card to someone else, and then walked away. 
I'm not sure what's up with employees here, or what type of reputation this restaurant is after, but I wouldn't encourage anyone else to try and find out.Decent, I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could... not bad but so many more authentic places available.I came to celebrate a friend's birthday.  
Great atmosphere.  
Kid friendly.  
The service was very good and fast.Very good food.  
We go here often.  
It can be very crowded and loud in the dining room,  but I guess that's pretty much every restaurant in the city.  
This most recent time we had a bad experience with the wait staff.  
Had a super drunk table next to us that smashed a bottle and got into a fight while using the bathroom, but was allowed to carry on until they decided to leave.  
Also had a bad interaction with a pregnant member of the waitstaff who tried to power past my wife's chair and then failing to achieve that goal yelled at my wife about not being considerate of pregnant people.  
I find this accusation unlikely to be true as we were seated with our 3 year old, 2 year old, and 2 MONTH old.We will be back for the food but if service and the atmosphere are this bad again, we will cross this place off the list and im sure many others will too.The food was very good and the service was spot on.  
I would recommend the flank steak.Great service and atmosphere,  menu includes many vegetarian options!
The house special entrana steak is amazing! 
Conversely, the service is amazingly bad. 
Salad came after meal. 
Forgot beer order.Very good service and very good foodGreat service.  
Food was good.  
Atmosphere not quiet but very busy night.  
The have various dining areas.  
Outside on patio with overlook of Cedar Lake.  
Patio area with nice view. 
Very unique placeThey were very busy!  
However; we were on a rare date night so not a big deal.  
It took a little while to get our entrees,  but I was offered a glass of wine on the house as a result.  
Amanda Lee was our waitress - outstanding!  
Request her!  
I know we will in the future ?
Food was EXCELLENT!  
Well worth our wait.  
Oh, we were early for our our reservation and went to the bar.  
EXCELLENT service there as well by several friendly bartenders ??
Food quality, presentation, and service were excellent. 
Had the Grouper special, potato leek soup, pulled pork tacos as an appetizer, a house salad, and special lemon raspberry multi-layer cake for dessert. 
Also had a Margarita. 
You could tell it was made with fresh lime juice, not reconstituted or syrup type, and there a full dose of booze. 
A very positive experience. 
It was almost kitchen closing time and we were not in any way rushed.  
Other diners were having a good time too. 
Fantastic experience. 
We had a drink out on the patio and watched the sun set over the lake, then inside for a delicious dinner with appetizers. 
Make sure you don't wait until the last minute to book because reservations fill up fast.  
Don't be fooled by some of the photos you see here in Google, either. 
It's not some giant banquet room.  
Here's where we sat for our meal. 
Plus, ask for Donnell to be your waiter. 
He's awesome.Food was very good.  
Staff seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else at the time.  
The hostess never greeted us.  
She wanted for us to approach her and explain why we were there.  2 different bar tenders kept walking be without acknowledging we were there.  
Then one bar tender finally did take an order after us sitting there several minutes.  
But I notice she didn't ring the order into the register to its completion.  
Our change was right and all but putting in the order, then cancelling it and still serving the drinks means the establishment did not get an accurate count at the end of the night.  
Next our waiter was OK but again like he didn't really want to be there.  
We were seated at one of the lake view windows and watched the sunset.  
Very nice.I liked it. 
Your normal little Caeser. 
Sometimes it seems like they let their pizzas over cook in the warmer, but maybe that's just because I caught bad timing. 
Otherwise, seems decent.Easy dinner night.... hot & ready except not always hot. 
No seating inside or out. 
No restroom.  
Not really for kids as there's no seating; just waiting. 
They don't understand the meaning of hot and ready. 
They advertise having their food premade and ready to grab and go but on several occasions even when we called ahead for a larger order we had to wait for food. 
Great price but you will have to wait.What can you say about Little Caesars? 
It's the "$5 holla". 
Ok pizza for a great price. 
Great for a quick cheap lunch. 
Between the small lobby, and the parking things can can get pretty interesting on Friday nights.Cheap pizza fast service I have to say I am extremely disappointed, I flew to Chicago for the sole purpose of having Chicago's famous deep dish pizza for dinner and well my personal pizza was not cut and had absolutely no flavor... my husband and son shared a large pepperoni pie and each barely ate a slice... 
(for a 14 year old who can eat a whole dominoes pie by himself the pizza has to be truly terrible for him to barely eat a slice he does give thumbs up for the amount of pepperoni on the slice.  
I'm truly sad to have spent enough money to buy 6 pies back home and be unsatisfied.Best pizza in the northern suburbs based on ingredients and flavor. 
Deep dish and thin crust are both amazing. 
Delivery times are usually longer than estimated. 
Best to just call ahead and pickup.I was hesitant to order, considering the reviews regarding wrong orders and double charges. 
I ended up ordering online for pickup to avoid those issues. 
Ordering online was easy. 
I was actually impressed that I could order plates, forks, napkins and such also. 
When I arrived, I was greeted warmly and my order was confirmed. 
They told me I just had to wait for the salads, which was 3 minutes tops. 
As I walked out, I noticed my 3 cans of root beer were missing. 
Easy fix, but again, if I had gone delivery, no telling.... 
By the way, this location is take out / delivery only, there is no dining area. 
The deep dish was amazing! 
Perfect temperature, thick sausage, cheese for days. 
The salad was super fresh and portions were huge. 
I would definitely come back for more!
I will state right up front that I dislike Lou Malnati's pizza, and deep dish generally [Pequod's being an exception]. 
For as much as I am not a deep dish fan, their thin crust is way worse. 
If you are a big deep dish fan, Lou Malnati's is known for their deep dish, so you will probably like it. 
If not, then their non-deep dish pizza just flat sucks! 
(They use that gross chunky tomato sauce.) 
I don't eat their pizza, I always order a beef sandwich (which is no better than Rosati's, who has better pizza as well) when we order, which I find sub-par compared to Buona or Portillo's. 
At least Rosati's, who makes a better pizza, offers fries (not nasty Lay's potato chips) with their sandwiches. 
I can sort of understand why some people may like Lou Malnati's. 
I will never be a fan. 
My brother LOVES this place. 
Upon its mention, he will excitedly shout out "OH, Lou Mal's" and go "oh-ho-ho..." and "oh-oh-ho-ho-ho-oh!" 
often dropping to his knees and dreamily shouting out the names of various Black NFL players. 
But that's him, go figure... 
I will say, that the location itself is interesting. 
They have a long winding hallway leading to the rear parking lot, suitable for hanging up all manner of frames.Saved Valentine's Day dinner with a 5-Star customer service experience to resolve a missed delivery.  
Our favorite deep dish pizza back in our good graces. 
Teri VanDyke 1508693869Waited 20 minutes and totally worth the wait. 
Accommodating and informative staff, lovely people. 
Huge breakfast food. 
Egg white omelet was delicious and huge. 
Real maple syrup on the tables. 
Eggs Benedict-incredible. 
Fresh donut holes from a wicker basket, served by a cute little lady,  while you wait. 
The hostess was wonderful. 
Chased us out the door to ask why we left so quickly...we told her we saw the line and didn’t want to stay at the table. 
That made her smile. 
David Garcia 1508073385a very unique diner. donut holes when u walk in, great service. food is a step above a regular diner. waffles and pancakes are good. all egg dishes served in a skillet with potatoes. biscuits and gravy are solid. if u are looking for a diner with some character come here! 
Donald Browning 1502149532Best waffle I've ever had. 
Both the pecan waffle and the bacon pecan waffle are great but I'd say just pecan is better. 
Super friendly and efficient. 
Crowded but not uncomfortably so. 
I would recommend this place for breakfast and I will for sure be back. 
The two times I was there I had two of the friendliest waitresses.  
Karla Padbury 15048835492 egg breakfast is actually 4 eggs so unless you are super hungry '1 egg' breakfast will be plenty. 
Everything I've had has been great and the staff is friendly and helpful. 
I am usually by myself so I sit at the counter. 
Somehow a box of donut holes finds its way home with me nearly every time I visit. 
Oh! 
And they sell bread if you find you like the toast and want to take some home too.  
Charles Reeves 1507663730Well...it was an interesting place as it is at the starting end of historical ROUTE 66(But never claim that to an Angelenian). 
Huh Great food offerings and my breakfast meal was just right and the service was top notch!!!!! 
Truly..a must do when in the WINDY CITY OF CHICAGO...Excellent pizza at a good price.Really good food all around and the service from the kids inside was excellent. 
First time ever eating at Loven Oven....I called and asked if they could make me a very thin crust pizza..1/2 mushroom and pizza sauce...1/2 pepperoni and barbecue sauce....the women told me she would try....well they nailed it! 
Happy customers that will be back. 
Great customer service as well.Love their veggie pizza. 
Yum....Great food and serviceWe came here for a night of drinks and fun and we got exactly that! 
They were insanely busy and took a while to get drinks and food, but the  superb customer service made up for it. 
Our server, as busy as he was, was very attentive and made sure we were having a good time. 
I look forward to coming here again!
I left my card at the bar with a tab open. 
When we were ready to leave I asked bartender to close out the tab and get my card back. 
She said she couldn't find it and insisted my tab was already closed. 
Turned out she returned my card to someone else, and kept denying and responsibility for it. 
Manager promised to contact me with the update after they try to locate the person that ended up with my card. 
I never heard from them...Fun. 
Bowling and arcade next door. 
Yes it's loud but its a bowling alley. 
The burger selection was decent.Great place to go with the kids or a night out with your friends. 
The bar tender James is a fun friendly guy and the rest of the staff are really nice as well. 
And they have good food. 
I love it here.I was on business trip to Chicago from Milwaukee. 
We decided to spend saturday night in a bowling Alley. 
We came across a rude staff. 
Though we arrived there at 4th Nov 11:30 PM on saturday and the place was promised to be open till 2AM, we were denied to play anything after 1AM. 
Reason being - Staff was racist,  she allowed all the other members to continue their game except us, second she wanted to leave early.  
I paid $140 for my bowling but i ended up stopping my game in mid way just because she denied to extend my game. 
I will never visit this place again and i will tell all my friends in Chicago to refrain.  
Learn from Wisconsin people how to be friendly Lucky Strike. 
Torrey Vegter 1508880040Great Burgers. 
I tried the Mburger which was delicious. 
I really enjoyed the special sauce, and the fries were good too! 
I'll be visiting this place from now on whenever I want quick burger. 
Peter M 1507949193Sad Impossible Burger (vegan) experience :(. 
I hate to make this comparison but it looked & tasted like an old, dry, overcooked McD's burger (from what I remember)...for about 8x the price.  
Huge disappointment! 
Janelle Reilly 1485794852The staff was so warm and friendly.  
I noticed if they needed something from a team member they used the word' "please."  
They really moved the line quickly and were attentive to their customers needs,  Very efficiently run restaurant.  
Oh, and I enjoyed the food too! 
Rena Rose 1492815212Milkshakes are tasty,The 'M Burger" is juicyFries are crispy Stuart Conover 1454817917A couple of my friends have been raving about the burgers here for awhile.  
I finally had a chance too and am glad that I did.  
I've been hoping for a good fast casual burger option in the area and can happily report that I've found one. 
Tried out the M Burger itself with fries and it had the full flavor you can expect from a burger that quality ingredients were used and not just what you'd get from a fast food joint.  
Awesome spot!!! 
Great drinks, people, food and service. 
The Upside-down Cake is a must have drink of choice.Great atmosphere for Michigan State football games ?. 
Be sure to try and get there early for a booth with a personal TV in it for you and 5 other friends. 
Affordable drinks and good pub selections to snack on during the game.Four stars is for trivia night only - I have never been otherwise and I understand the bar is a pretty different vibe otherwise. 
Four stars instead of 5 because their food menu just changed and is significantly worse - it wasn't amazing or anything to begin with, but they removed some of the interesting options on the menu. 
Trivia night is a blast and moves pretty quickly. 
I don't feel like the group I go with are trivia geniuses and we do pretty well. 
The rewards are alright and match the skill level needed, so it's just a nice place to spend some time doing something with friends.On a Monday it can be calm. 
But any other day it is great vibes and great food specials . 
For a bar I�d say B+ foodThis is the second time I came around 1:10 and he didn't let me in because he said it's late.  
I just wanted to go in there and grab a drink with my friends.  
It shouldn't say last call at 1:30 but they didn't let me go in at 1:10.Awesome Food and Service:  Came here with my girlfriends to celebrate my sister�s birthday.  
Our wait staff was superb, though the place was packed.  
Our food (apps, salads, main course, dessert) were all great.  
We went with the family style menu, and let me say,  everything was simply delicious.  
I highly recommend Maggiano in Chicago.This is place was wonderful, even when dining alone on a business trip.  
I sat at a high top in the bar area and received outstanding service and recommendations from the bartender.  
The food was delicious and the atmosphere almost took me back in time; Sinatra softly playing in the background of a dimly lit restaurant with leather booths and exposed brick walls.  
Highly recommend this place.Maggiano's pulled out all the stops for my two girlfriends and I celebrating an engagement last night! 
The staff was incredibly kind and made sure we had a great experience. 
The food and drink were also great, as always. 
Thanks for such a fun night!
Great service and great food. 
We were visiting with family and the server took great care of us, there are limited vegetarian options but the offerings were very tasty. 
Some of us got a complimentary pasta dish to take home too which was just as good the next day.Great food and service, and a nice atmosphere too. 
We received some complimentary dishes too, which tasted just as good when reheated the following day. 
My only complaint is that there is a serious lack of vegetarian and vegan options.I've been ordering from this place since 2013 and they have quick, thorough service. 
It's not a sit down spot though there's ample seating for it. 
By far the best take out Chinese in the area ?
I really liked this place. 
Food is good, but a little pricy.Good food but atmosphere is a bit dry...more of a "take-out" type restaurant. 
Very good Chinese - probably my favorite in the area. 
Wouldn't want to go anywhere elseExcellent food at a reasonable price for the portion size. 
I have had several of their entrees and appetizers at different times and have never been disappointed. 
If they delivered, I would eat from here every week. 
SO much better than Panda or buffet places.I do not know how this hotel is ranked at 3 or 3.5 stars.  
The beds were really comfortable, but the rest ofnthe room had issues.  
First we had requested a non smoking room, it was confirmed as non smoking and yet it reeked horribly of cigarette smoke.  
There were several burn marks on the bathroom sink, so if this room is no longer a smoking room but was at one time, it needs to be overhauled cause the smell hasn't left.  
Next there was a decent sized gap next to the tub and wall that looked like it had been caulked multiple times.  
The curtains did not offer any sheers just the blackout blinds which meant either no outside light or all of it.  
Lastly we walked from the hotel to the casino, about a 5 min walk.  
Hallways were dirty, tons of dust and food were caked on the floor.As far as service and the staff if I could rate them separately I would give them a 5.  
Everyone was no nice, friendly and helpful!  
What this hotel lacks in cleanliness and upkeep it more than makes up for in its high quality staff service.  
Still I am going with a 2 rating because these other areas of opportunity are so abundant.The Majestic Star has been around for over twenty years. 
Both boats need some cosmetic improvements, but the staff.... for the most part unbelievably friendly! 
Unfortunately, the last visit to Jackpot Java was not pleasant. 
I stood in line for 10 minutes and was told they didn't have any hot dogs or polishes ready. 
Terrible! 
And was also told they run out of hot dogs all the time. 
I wasn't offered anything for my inconvience. 
Thumbs down for my last visit.I took my wife to the buffet on crab leg night. 
That was on 9-9-17.  
The crab legs were salty as hell.  
We didn't enjoy them at all.  
We notified the manager and she stated that the crab legs come that way.  
I will say that the fried chicken & fried catfish were good and mashed potatoes.The rooms are over priced, especially for Truck Drivers, two towels in a room that sleeps at least two people, when everyone knows a woman uses two towels to shower,  No fridge or microwave in the room, have stayed in cheaper motels that had fridge and microwave, the choice of coffee in the rooms is nasty,  will go back for the casino, but won't stay in the over priced motel again, very disappointedNow about the way over priced Buffet, Where was the shrimp?!!! 
Two people being charged 70 plus dollars for the buffet and one doesn't even eat crab legs is a bit much, the crab legs cooked with the crawfish and clams were NASTY!!!! 
The crab legs on the far end were cold, definitely won't be eating there again, not for that priceRoom was fairly cheap and clean. 
Our room was facing the lake, so that was nice to get to see. 
We just stayed overnight here one night on our trip to Chicago.We love this place! 
Great grinders, and pretty good pizzas. 
I like the salads too, but rarely get them. 
They daily lunch specials wrote in their chalk board inside restaurant. 
They also have a "text club". 
Where on your first text u get free garlic cheesy bread. ? 
then after that about every two-three weeks they send you additional deals. 
They also have kids meals, and they are reasonably priced. 
I usually get the mancinos club. 
But there are enough options to make everyone in your party happy! 
Good pizza, better sandwiches (grinders).  
Only get a half grinder unless you're buying for two.We placed a large order for work, sent an email with detailed list of each item for each person. 
When we received our food - we were missing a club, pizza sub, and also received a hair in one of the salads. 
I love Mancino's but if they can't build an order off a list then something needs changed. 
Very disappointing! 
To find a hair in our salad was also upsetting especially since it turned our appetite off! 
Don't let my One time experience affect your thinking! 
They are worth a shot! 
The sandwiches are awesome! 
Decent staff also.Service was good...9""subs & 18" @ reasonable price...A hidden gem in the south burbs. 
Authentic New Orleans style meals at affordable prices. 
I would recommend a call before taking the trip. 
They have weird hours. 
Live entertainment on some nights. 
Love the pecan pie... but they will not serve it w/ ice cream ?
Great experience. 
I ordered the wrong cocktails and the waiter exchanged them with no problem. 
Food was delicious, I love the cool atmosphere of Maple Tree. 
Even the soundtrack was an oldie r&b which lent to a fun evening. 
The mgr recommended a wine which was a winner. 
Overall great experience. 
Great little hidden gem in Blue Island! 
Good food, craft drinks & beautiful decor make this a real winner. 
Place is small, so I'd definitely recommend reservations to beat the wait.Service is excellent and food is delicious. 
Very relaxing and enjoyable experience.It is  a nice clean place the food was good the drinks was good the service was astounding. 
The only drawback was their bathroom was not handicap accessible which made us have to rush I'll meal Ritika Mane' 1508775224Pretty solid place here. 
They have some good craft cocktails and decent seating. 
I went to the patio for lack of space and then moved outdoors cos the inside was so loud. 
It's a general bar. 
I found the bartenders a little short and not really friendly but they gave me what it needed so minus points for that. 
The bar doesn't have table service so you have to get your drink at the bar and eventually bus yourself. 
I had the corpse reviver- I liked it since it was fresh and not super bitter. 
Plus point- they let the people from pleasant house next door serve you so you can have a drink and food together. 
Rick Leitch 1505281051Hipster central and pretentious whiskey selection. 
I'm just not that sophisticated or trendy. 
This is not my scene. 
If you're an aspiring actor, working in a call center, and dress like a bike messenger, you'll love this place. 
Everything tastes great, food and drinks. 
I would not consider it a good value. 
Sam Svita 1505485730I really enjoyed this bar. 
Such a nice neighborhood/homey feel to it. 
The bar tenders were all super friendly. 
They had an extensive craft beer supply. 10/10. 
Will be back! 
Jo Brill 1505175295Great beer -- try the Marz Splash -- and if for some reason you want even more wow than the regular menu, drop in on a Monday. 
Come 5 pm today a guest "grill master" was cooking up freshly homemade sausage --- sooo delicious. 
His associate/girlfriend/chef added mango salsa and yogurt-coconut chutney. 
A unique taste event. 
I'm still swooning. 
Dan Carp 1502977490Would have loved to stay to hang out at the bar proper, but my visit was purely to grab a cold brew to bring back to our vacation stop to enjoy with dinner.  
I was overjoyed to find a couple of coolers filled mostly with beers I'd never even heard of (coming from the East Coast)!  
Quality selection of local beers with friendly folks in the place.  
Very good stop!
Great food and great service.  
Went for my birthday.   
Was treated great by everyone there.  
This was my first time at this location.  
I will definitely go back.This place was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. 
Our server was totally miserable. 
Barely spoke and acted like we were bothering her. 
It was very clear she did not want to be there. 
Perhaps she was forced to work the patio when she was supposed to go home.I don't know but she was not happy. 
We sat on the patio with another couple. 
She came over and her first words to us were not hello but "so do you want drinks?'" 
We ordered bottles of wine and appetizers and when they came had to hunt her down to get forks to eat with. 
Then we ordered our main meal and I was brought the wrong dish ( I ordered salmon and got shrimp) so it had to go back. 
The rest of my table had their food and I had to wait for mine to be made. 2 other people at the table had ordered steak. 
One rare and one med rare. 
They came well and med well. 
Again we had to hunt her down for some cutlery to eat with. 
I finally got my dish and it was average to say the least. 
The steaks had to go back too. 
They were so over cooked. 
I understand mistakes happened but this was just horrid from start to finish.The service, wine, steak and shrimp were great. 
No complaints. 
And the price is great for the area!
Ordered small size portions of mussels and shrimp kisses. 
The portions we're much more than expected. 
Delicious, too. 
Especially the shrimp. ? 
Dined in the dining room during happy hour; a bit on the noisy side.I'm bummed that the restaurant lived up to the reviews. 
The service is indeed terrible - I believe they have a staffing or organization problem because there simply weren't enough waiters/bartenders to accommodate guests in house. 
Waiter kept apologizing for delays but still only came around every 15-20 minutes and our food took forever. 
My salmon was pretty good, but expected it to be better for it being their signature "Scottish" salmon. 
Salads and sides were poorly plated. 
My boyfriend ordered his sirloin steak medium and it was extremely chewy. 
We're normally not picky, but it was really tough to eat.Stopped by late for a quick snack to share. 
Tuna Melt was surprisingly good and fries were pretty good. 
Overall, service was great and food tasty � and priced right. 
I�d definitely visit again!
The existence of vegetarian chili cheese fries on their menu is enough to recommend them alone! 
But the atmosphere at Medici's is great, the staff super friendly, and their food is in general great. 
Their fries don't travel well, so definitely recommend eating there rather than delivery, but their delivery service is generally fast and reliable. 
Also recommend their strawberry lemonade, which I'm pretty sure is made with seltzer water and is totally amazing.Don't eat here as often as I used to, but used to eat in restaurant as well as order pizza here when I was a student. 
The food is solid, quality, casual dining fare. 
I think their pizza is underrated and one of the best options in Hyde Park.Comfortable casual atmosphere with great service. 
The air is filled with the smells of great home-cooked bread perfectly cooked burgers and other treats like pastries and special items on the menu. 
Visiting Chicago for a while and really looking forward to going backI love how they can split the cheapest bill. 
And the service is great too. 
But the food is even better and the price range is great for the portion size amen. 
Rusty Shackleford 1505705771Great food and great service. 
Upscale but also familiar chinese food. 
We ordered at least 15 different items between dishes and appetizers to share and I can say you cant go wrong with anything you get. 
Quan Le 1508697949Many Chicagoans that I met have seen this place as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago. 
It was also beautifully decorated and upscale look-alike. 
We got into here for a take-out dinner on a Thursday night. 
It was predictable that the restaurant had got busy the moment I came. 
After using the tablet to order the food, we were waiting around twenty minutes for it to be ready. 
We had the Crab Meat Corn Soup for the appetizer, which turned out to be fair and unimpressed. 
The Kung Pao Beef is original, though, its taste was sweeter than I could imagine. 
I used to have this dish elsewhere, but they were all not tasted like this. 
It was much better as pouring a little soy sauce into it. 
The Beef with Zucchini in Black Pepper Sauce was bland, greasy, and lack of seasoning, sadly. 
I hardly recognized there was black pepper sauce in it. 
The meals come with two boxes of rice and tons of condiments, including duck sauce, chili oil, hot sauce, sweet and sour sauce, mustard, and soy sauce. 
I even had no idea which sauce to go for which dish. 
The price was acceptable as the portion of all the food we ordered could feed four adults sufficiently. 
Probably, I should have a revisit here, but apparently not for getting the meals that we had. 
Angelica White 1502845406One word: fantastic. 
This restaurant will be an obligatory stop for any future visits my family takes to Chicago. 
Incredibly diverse menu, wonderful bubble tea, the best orange chicken I've ever eaten in my life. 
Generous portions & everything the five of us got was top notch delicious. 
Loved it!!!  
Rod Merritt 1505689808This is it, based on reviews, and they were right. 
A great chinese restaurant in Chicago's Chinatown. 
I am tempted to say it is the best around, but can't simply because I haven't tried all of them here yet. 
But food was perfect and staff very helpfull and attentive. 
This restaurant is huge, and the downstairs filled up quickly anyway by around 6 PM. 
The menu is expansive, so thank goodness it is on tablets where you can scroll through the descriptions with pictures which you can zoom in! 
Then you just order from the tablet. 
Thilini Sandamali Pathigoda 1503153011food is delicious here. 
Place is beautiful. 
Wine is expensive though. tea, seafood, beef, pork, everything were very tasty.  
They have private rooms in Chinatown restaurant which are great to have a giggle and a chat with your friends. 
Place is packed with people, better to prebook.Okay, our server looked soooooooo similar to the lady in the painting. 
She also had a tattoo where the lady had a glowing jewel. 
And then we'd be looking at it, and she'd walk through our field of view and then turn and look at us with her face exactly superimposed over the lady's from the painting! 
Once, she stopped in front of us and turned sideways, taking the same pose! 
I'm pretty sure it was intentional, it made the experience a lot of fun ^_^ Oh, yeah, the food was good, too ?
An interesting upscale diner that blends American and Latin cuisine. 
Only open for breakfast and lunch. 
Has outdoor seating in the summer and the inside is covered in beautiful paintings. 
It can be a little loud inside so it's not ideal for conversations but it's all over of my favorite brunch places. 
There are lots of healthy and how free options and they source most of their food locally.  
They also serve great coffee and offer cocktails and beer.I had the plantain sandwich. 
It was good. 
I like the atmosphere and the service was excellent. 
I think we went at the wrong time. 
Brunch was only available. 
I'll be back soon and will update my review accordingly. 
We had a good time! 
The waitress was terrific! 
Our sandwiches were delicious and the pistachio cake was amazing!
Great Mom and Pop restaurant. 
Breakfast was amazing. 
The experience was great.Best pizza in the area, maybe even in the greater Chicagoland area! 
The description is wrong as they don't offer "stuffed crust" it's actually called stuffed pizza and it's made like a pizza pie. 
The thick, fresh pizza pie crust is first layered with delicious toppings, then layered with top-notch cheese and then finally with freshly prepared tomato pizza sauce. 
It's award winning and mighty delicious. 
It doesn't stop there though...the thin and rustic crust and also delicious along with pastas and sandwiches that are second to none! 
Whatever your taste buds are craving, Nancy's has you covered with something that'll exceed your expectations!
We have tried many pizza places, and while you can get good deep dish pizza at other restaurants, Nancy's is a notch above the rest!  
Consistent quality and flavor.  
Great crust!  
We do not go anywhere else for pizza.The food was fantastic and the wait time was minimal. 
The staff was very courteous. 
I am definitely going back.Fantastic deep dish!  
My very small thing to keep in mind is that there is no sitting room inside.  
Other than that, I would totally recommend!
Recently ordered online with them, so far we have never had a problem. 
Got an e-mail confirmation that they received our order and our wait with delivery was about an hour. 
Needless to say an hour and a half later, Still No food. 
We love this place and have never had a problem until now. 
You would think being loyal customers they'd want to rectify their mishap, but they never did. 
On top of it all, we get blamed for their incompetence. 
Shameful they just lost our business!
My wife and I were in Chicago for our anniversary, and we stopped in here twice. 
The food is amazing, the staff is very friendly, and the atmosphere is wonderful. 
We were particularly impressed with the Native Chicken Wings (crispy), both naked and buffalo. 
I also really enjoyed the meatball sub and we both thought the oatmeal creme pie tasted just like you would expect from one in a box (in a good way). 
We were very happy with our experience and look forward to stopping in again whenever we are in the city.The best Native Foods location in my opinion. 
The staff is awesome and super nice even when you come in 15 minutes before closing. 
The food is to die for! 
You NEED to try the buffalo chicken wings!! 
Or anything chicken there is really above and beyond anything!
When it comes to your favorite chains, consistency is key. 
I tried the Native Foods Cafe in San Diego as well at this location; and the bistro steak sandwich is just as delectable. 
Great place to catch up with friends and people watch. 
The lavender lemonade is fantastic! 
?
Came to the restaurant well out of my way, excited to enjoy a proper Vegan meal.  
After a long wait, the Macro Bowl was disappointing: undercooked crunchy rice, tired looking kale, soggy tempeh.  
Sauce was nice.   
A piece of random cauliflower in there, telling me something is amiss in the kitchen.  
I give stars for courteous counter service and the enjoyment I see in other patrons.LOVE this all plant-based restaurant chain! 
Seasonal menu features in addition to mainstays. 
Be sure to get your frequent customer card and get a free meal. 
Love animals, eat plants. 
#vegan Carolyn Roberts 1506354995A once in a lifetime experience I am so happy to have had. 
Beautifully and creatively presented dishes. 
Wonderful, friendly, knowledgeable staff/servers. 
And for someone like myself who does not often eat fancier dishes such as caviar, it was great to expand my palette. 
We did the wine pairings, which was a perfect add on, however the amount we were given was a lot and we were quite tipsy at the end. 
Maybe only a mouthful or two should be poured, and if you want more you leave the glass in front of you, and if you don't you put it off to the side or something along those lines. 
All in all it was amazing! 
Georgia Burke 1502231078Always the most enjoyable evening.  
Take a break from making decisions and relax while in the hands of an unbelievable group of talented people.  
The service is always my favorite part.  
Everyone working there seems to enjoy presenting and serving the food as much as we enjoy eating it.  
Love it! 
Theresa Wilkerson 1508610677The Ancient Roman dinner was one of the most interesting meals I've ever eaten, and the beverage pairings were delicious and well considered. 
The service staff were very well informed about the cuisine, and a kitchen tour was gladly given upon our request. 
Katie Sabino 1497633622My Mom and I were lucky enough to get a reservation for the Hollywood menu. 
What an amazing and unforgettable experience! 
I'll be honest - I didn't love every course - but the presentation and showmanship behind every course was a masterpiece! 
SO fun! 
Brendan Bremener 1498445146It was good enough taste-wise. 
However, I found the majority of the courses to be too dependent on inedible props, often utilizing huge complex dioramas featuring only a couple bites of food. 
I attended the cinema-themed dinner, and just to run further with the analogy, the experience as a whole was similar to seeing a highly anticipated film that had amazing special effects but lacked the similarly amazing plot to match. 
The service was amazing.Their worker named Emily was amazing. 
Recommended me a great choice and always had a smile on her face and eager to help. 
Thanks for being a great worker.Not a very good noodles location. 
Usually quick but food is sub parProportions are very large and food is meh. 
But cheap tho yasthe foods good but the service is so slow and for no apparent reason on one given night I was in there I along with 5 other people waited 30plus minutes for food and when I asked about a refund I was told it be ready in one second so I waited, but the good food isn't worth the hassle of waiting Best place to go to get decently tasty noodles very quickly. 
Almost always getting your food in Went for half-priced maki on a Sunday. 
No waiting, quick service. 
The rolls were so delicious, perfect proportions. 
Service was friendly and kind. 
I'd definitely come back. 
Recommend.Nothing terrible but also nothing spectacular. 
Decent prices.Fast and great serviceLove coming here on Mondays Half of sushi!
Great food and friendly service! 
Very reasonable prices.  
Happy to support local cafe's especially when they're great like Nori Sushi Lincoln Park..Horrible sushi, you can tell it is frozen, the texture is terrible. 
Didn't even finish the dish I got.I'm writing this review solely to help out any fellow vegetarians who may go to this restaurant. 
While I appreciate that there is a veggie burger on the menu, don't get it. 
It's big and mushy, tastes like straight mashed up black beans and it's drowned in ranch. 
Completely not worth it. 
Get a salad without the meat instead. 
Our waiter was nice, and I'm sure they have better options for meat eaters but if you're vegetarian, steer clear of the veggie burger.Large craft beer selection! 
Music selection was awesome while I was there! 
Staff were friendly and helpful. 
Loved the TV setup, big and easy to see from anywhere but not overwhelming. 
Atmosphere was more relaxing than other bars and pubs in the area.  
I really liked the overall look and feel of this place. 
Grilled chicken sandwich was excellent.Great selection and friendly staff. 
The bro vibe doesn't fly with me though, that's why it's only four stars. 
Having a guy spit his beer all over the counter next to me to the cheering of his Bros was not an ideal experience.One of the better spots in Chicago for craft beer -- and that's saying a lot these days. 
From the big upstairs to the game room downstairs, the beer selection is astoundingly expansive and good. 
And spirits, cocktails and view and food ... what a great place.I went to the old town pour house twice now, and had awful experiences both times. 
Will never go back and make sure my friends / co workers don't come here either. 
First off , thome food is DISGUSTING. 
I got the veggie burger and it tasted like warm dog vomit with a cookie dough texture ..... the bun was rock hard & the veggie burger was just pure Mush with no taste !!!!!!!
Second off, we ordered fried pickles and the busboy or food runner or whomever brings out our entrees first asked us if everything looked okay and. we were like uh we ordered fried pickles but it's ok... next thing we know the server (who was my server last time too . 
Who was an awful server both times) says he forgot to ring the pickles in and he just rung them in for us and he expedited them. 
Excuse you! 
We don't want an appetizer now?? 
We just got our entrees?!? 
Then He even charged us for the pickles!!!!!!!!!!!  
Worst customer service honestly , do NOT come here. 
Do NOT do NOT do NOT.  
go to the vig!!!!!! 
They have amazing good with AMAZING customer service!!!! 
Old Town pour house doesn't care about your experience or the food you consume.  
They should also ensure their servers write down orders and not Act like they can remember everything in their heads.  
Awful place. 
Awful food. 
Awful people.Our food was really good!  
Our waitress did an amazing job!  
I wish I remembered her name, because she deserves more praise.  
The bread-sticks were not as good as they normally are - but they were still good!  
The building is very nice as well, and clean!
Every time I go here the experience just gets better. 
Our waiter was amazing and made sure my best friend and I had a top notch experience. 
The food as always was amazing. 
It made for a very appreciative veterans dayCan't go wrong here! 
Bring your wife and take a break! 
Friendly service, open and inviting atmosphere. 
The food is amazing. 
If you leave here hungry your in trouble. 
Lunch prices are great. 
The manager even took the time to visit with us and make sure everything was to our satisfaction!  
Great job at the Olive Garden guys. 
Keep up the awesome work.The food here is really good!  
The service was some of the best in town that I have found anyway!  
With the endless basket of bread sticks and endless bowls of pasta, I don't see anyone could here hungry!  
So, bring your appetite, you won't be disappointed!
Smallest steak ever! 
Pasta wasnt the greatest ...endless  bread sticks!? 
They bring one per person about every 15 min why not just put a bread basket on the table. 
Only good thing was the salad but not for $55  and my margarita glass was a sticky messGood food, great service. 
Great lunch specials.Great place for an affordable meal. 
Decent beer selection, sports are always on of you're into that. 
Only complaint I've had is the bald bartender with tattoos is rude.Always enjoying coming here for after work gatherings it to as a quick getaway during events in the nearby ballrooms. 
Good food and drinks.The food and service is always good here.Good drinks good prices Daniel Glezer 1507604121Tasty lunch spot, great burgers.  
Also good for an after work drink.  
Not the most cost effective but the quality justifies the cost. 
Erin RavenSkye 1506047988Had a farewell lunch here with my coworkers, complete with rum and cokes, plural. 
Had a tasty burger and some fries as well. 
Took a while for the food to come out, would not have worked if this was my typical 1 hr break lunch. 
Megan Tapp 1504996830Super friendly server, but he seemed to be the only server on the floor making service a little slow. 
Great food! 
We enjoyed everything we got! 
Ed Chubin 1507330722Elegant bar/restaurant. 
Bar food is above average. 
David Martin 1481762756Good bar food. 
Lively atmosphere.  
Dinner menu pretty common. 
Food well prepared but not outstanding or remarkable.  
If you're going to the opera, it's right across the street. 
This is the only reason we return.Yesterday I went to hooters for my first time. 
And let me tell you, it was clean, very good welcome. 
Didn't have to wait to be seated. 
Food was so good. 
Never had chicken like that before. 
Our waitress made sure we were okay. 
None of the workers were rude.Ok, so I never believed it when people told me they went to Hooters for the wings but good lord was I wrong. 
Those wings and those fried pickles are absolute heaven! 
I've never had fried pickles I liked until we went here.Definitely ask your waitress to bring you samples of the sauce before you order. 
I wound up getting the mild. 
Nice and crispy on the outside. 
Crunchy on the inside. 
My husband loves spicy stuff and said the spicier wings were really good too.I'd say the only downside here is the dress code. 
Being a heterosexual female, I found the abundance of butt cheeks a bit unsavory.The place was pretty darn crowded and the wait was longish but worth it.Best wings ever. 
Get all drum sticks hot and double dip. 
You won't regret it. 
Blue cheese is on point as well as the ranch. 
Shrimp hot is amazing as well.Terrible  service ever I order crabs legs they gave me crabs legs frozen and they fish taco nasty ass hellThe staff was very friendly. 
The dining room and bathroom were clean. 
The food was a good portion and quality for the price.Excellent service from our waitress, Rachel. 
She suggested meals and was extremely courteous and prompt. 
The food itself was delicious and reasonably priced, and the ambiance was also excellent.Our waiter, Brandon, was excellent. 
Got our orders in quickly, kept our glasses full, food came out perfect. 
Area was clean, bathrooms were nice.Korean chicken stir fry had tons of flavor. 
Crispy honey shrimp never disappoints. 
A little pricey but always worth the trip.Sydney was right on time to the table, and the brussel sprouts and asparagus are fantastic! 
Good job, P. 
F. 
Changs!
Food is always good, but you can get the same quality at a lower price at most Chinese buffets. 
Husband, daughter & I stopped in late Tuesday night. 
We live 5 hours away, all of us were craving Thai. 
We had the chef to ourselves and he was an absolute delight visiting with us and his Pad Thai was most excellent! 
He did not disappoint us! 
Thank you for your hospitality!!
I had the basil chicken lunch special. 
Pretty good, standard Thai meal, although there was no heat even though it had 1 chili in the menu. 
Waitress complained about carryout customers, but whatever.Very good Thai food. 
Got busy while there so service slowed down with only 1 cook and 1 server. 
Help wanted sign on door.Loved this place, I will be back.  
Great food.  
Spicy as you want.The food was excellent the service was excellent nice clean I really enjoyed it and it was my first time thereI went to Paddy Long's with a crew of 5 guys to get the Paddy Bomb. 
What is it? 
It's 6lbs of meat wrapped in bacon, served with buns and french fries. 
We went around 1pm on a Sunday and the place was nearly empty (maybe 2 other tables) which was fine since the waitress/bartender was really nice and attentive anyways. 
The bomb looked as formidable as it sounds, and while cooked thoroughly, it was a little cold. 
It was good, in the sense that it's meat and bacon, but at the same time tasted a bit bland without the BBQ sauce. 
It's definitely a fun thing to do with a crew, but eh wouldn't have to do it again.Really good staff. 
Solid beer choices. 
The everything-is-bacon thing is gimmicky, but there's really nothing wrong with the food. 
I like this place.I get seduced by the front patio into coming in here every time. 
Every time! 
And yet i forgot to take a picture of it! 
They have an excellent better selection, but it's kind of pricey. 
Good was good and interesting. 
Crowd was cool and so was the staff. 
Come here!
A great neighborhood bar with nice drafts for beer enthusiasts and great food for bacon and pork lovers.Great beer selection. 
Enjoyed the outside patio. 
Service was okay. 
Food was yum. 
Well where to begin. 
Ordered my food online $10 Cheddar Cheese Burger pizza for $10 with $6 bacon cheese sticks with a ranch cup and Brownie to boot, total $25.60. 
After placing order I called them to add on a 2 liter soda which then ran it up to $33+ O.o What the hell! 
After explaining that I order it online they finally lowered the price to $29. 
Driver showed up with no soda and after opening the box for the cheese sticks there is no Ranch cup either. 
I normal love Papa John's but this is WAY BELOW their standards! 
I use to work for them and I should know.So I don't know when papa John's stopped making Hawaiian pizza at night buy tonihht they told me they could not make one for me I also ordered extra garlic dip and did I get that nope I VARY disappointed in their service. 
I feel like they were being lazy when it came to the pizza plus the pizza was burntOrdered here many times and always friendly staff and drivers. 
Great food and the one time we had an issue I was apologised to and compensated for it very well. 10/10 company and staff!
Called my order in over the phone just wait two hours then I call about my order amd the whole time whoever tool my order did not even put my order in the system which is really bogus of him lets not forget I was at work. 
I didnt get accommodated for the incident or anything lack of customers service skills. 
They pretty much just told me oh well about the whole situation.Ordered at 9:30for delivery they called and told me they can't deliver because all they have is 1driver and it would take 2 hrs. 
To get it so I said I would pick it up they said 15 min gave a half hour and they didn't make had to wait 15 more minutes? 
till I finally got itThis was my first time at the restaurant. 
The atmosphere was romantic and elegant (we were the only 2 there for the first 10 minutes) and the waiter we called D was extremely professional; you would have never known he was a student doing an internship if it wasn�t revealed. 
The menu was simple which I liked with 4 options of entr�es to suit everyone; there was salmon, steak, chicken, and vegetarian. 
Four courses for only $25 and the salmon and steak was delicious. 
My ONLY issue with the experience was that at the end of the meal there was a fee on the bill called a �Scholarship Fee�. 
One of the reasons I initially said I would go back was because it is a restaurant giving students the experience they need to succeed so I�m all for educating and supporting students. 
My problem with this is that we were not informed of it beforehand. 
Therefore, I feel like we were being forced to contribute to this cause when it should be optional. 
We were told it wasn�t option and we had to pay it. 
What if�. 
Just what if we only had enough money for the meal and a small tip? 
What would happen then? 
I had plans on taking my mom and daughters there to support the school and introduce them to this hidden gem of a place, but that left a sour taste in my mouth and not sure now. 
The fee is based off the total bill amount so it was only $6, but it is the principle of the matter. 
This should have been listed on the menu or disclosed before the bill arrived and being told it HAD to be paid. 
Customer service is everything to me.Excellent food clean environment and  romantic setting.keep it upGreat experience all around! 
My wife and I had dinner here to celebrate our 18yr anniversary. 
We had our wedding at the South Shore Cultural Center so this was the perfect place to have dinner and celebrate. 
I requested the best table in the house and when we walked in they had placed a reserve sign on our table. 
The food was good and the waiter went out of her way to ensure we were having a good time. 
They brought out complimentary sparkling apple cider in tall champagne glasses for us and really dressed up the desert especially for us. 
It was quiet with a small crowd, good background music, the ambiance was romantic and the view was fantastic. 
Quality cuisine at affordable prices. 
Thank you for a making our evening special!
I went there about 2 weeks ago with my wife and son and the food was amazing. 
The decor was so romantic. 
We went on a Friday night and had a 7:45 pm reservation (which the last reservation is at 8). 
The place had just the right amount of people in it. 
I think there are less people toward closing hours which makes it more romantic. 
It seemed as though we were transported back to the 50's I should have had on a tux and she a lovely night gown. 
Unfortunatley we were unable to see the lake due to it being night. 
The service was bad at best but the food made us make a reservation again for tonight!
After making a reservation several weeks ago for my wife and two friends, I received a call an hour and a half prior to the reservation that the restaurant would not be opening. 
The reason given was that there were not enough students to serve because of the new semester. 
How unbelievable is that for a restaurant that has been and is the practice application arm of the school for decades! 
Our friends were coming from a far north suburb to join us. 
We were so anticipating the experience. 
C'est la vie! 
No Bon appetite! 
Maybe only 2.5 stars.  
Great location in the theater district with fun decor, and had good service, but the food is predictable and often less than great with prices higher than they should be.  
Caesar salad was decent. 
Chicken Parm was dry and not so good. 
Chocolate mousse cake was good, but really wished they had a Chicago cheesecake option.  
Every so often, I forget and come back, and I'm disappointed again.This is a great restaurant before or after the theater! 
If you are having dinner before the theater, make sure to let the waiter know and they will keep track of time so that you are not late for the show. 
The service at this restaurant is always great and the staff are very attentive, cleaning the table and replenishing water. 
One of my favorites is the chicken potpie but everything that I have had at this restaurant is delicious, including the fried calamari and short ribs of beef - oh and the Blueberry Lemontini is quite tasty! 
Overall, the food is delicious, the service is good, relaxing atmosphere and reasonably priced. 
I definitely recommend this restaurant!
Delicious food and great service! 
Perfect for before or after seeing a show! 
The homemade pasta makes my mouth water thinking about it!
Located conveniently in the Chicago theater district this made for the most fantastic pre-theater dinner we could have asked for! 
This was part of our daughter's 21st birthday celebration weekend and the chef and our server prepared everything phenomenally! 
The birthday dessert presentation could not have  been any better and the food was terrific with large portions!
Dined here twice during a trip in July 2017. 
Every dish was on point and generally fantastic. 
My party tried pasta, seafood, beef, and vegetable dishes and two desserts. 
All great. 
Tricky things like squid, scallops, and asparagus were high quality and cooked perfectly. 
Dinner for 3 about $125.Traveling through the area, craved pizza instead of another road burger. 
Walked in, prompt service, personal pan pizza was perfectly cooked, service was friendly and fast. 
Heads up that the location is carry out only, wasn't a problem for me because I was eating in the road, but may be to others.Bone in chicken wings were to hard on edges and just tossed into a little bit of BBQ sauce in the bottom of bowl. 
Could not even offer any napkins as I was on my lunch break. 
Also the chicken was dry, I could only eat two out of an eight piece. 
Sorry, what's going on with Pizza hut.Waited 2 hours for our pizza then ended up having food posing. 
My little sister and I both got sick from it. 
Will never eat  here or at pizza hut again.I ordered online for an delivery, the delivery never came to my house. 
I waited thirty minutes to call to see about my order, and the employee tells me it should be on the way(It wasn't). 
Fourty five minutes later I call to see about my order again, the same employee tells me I didn't place a order, then puts his manager on phone who say "The delivery person came to your house but didn't get an answer" which is a total lie. 
I've been sitting in my front window about fourty five minutes and not one person has knock on my door, or walk on my porch. 
THIS IS THE WORST PIZZA HUT AND PIZZA HUT EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!!! 
VERY UPSET.Worst pizza ever. 
It was half baked...it bordered being raw. 
And didnt get my receipt too after the delivery. 
Very disappointed. 
I wish I could be able to post the pic of the pizza. 
Bad serviceI bought a groupon for Pizza Mia in Frankfort, I didn't realize it was take out and delivery only, not dine in. 
Even so, I ordered/picked up a small The Chub, and a sausage thin crust pizza. 
I have to say, OMG THE CHUB IS FABULOUS! 
What an awesome pizza. 
The sausage pizza was great too. 
I am going to bring the menu into my work tomorrow, and tell them to order from here next pizza day!??
Awful service. 
Great food... 
But AWFUL service. 
We called in an hour before we went to pick up the food and we placed our order and stuff. 
Then we get there and we werent even in the system. 
So we decided to pay for it and have it delivered, and she took the cost for delivery off because they messed up. 
But then she tried to charge us for it. 
So we went home and then we got a call later saying that she couldnt have the pizza delivered because U MUST PAY for delivery. 
We got irritated and got a refund. 
And wont be coming back unless its a pizza emergency Jsyk.This place has good pizza at a reasonable price. 
They also have good sandwiches and sides. 
I enjoy the fact that my order is always accurate. 
I have had problems at other local pizza places forgetting items, but pizza Mia always gets it right. 
Love it. you need to try the chubThis place is awesome but I called just after 9 they were done delivering the girl said but they're open till ten krystal tyo 1505601502Save your money and time! 
We're visiting here and thought a rooftop bar would be fun; we were wrong! 
Our server was very sweet and would probably do better elsewhere because the food was disgusting. 
Fries were undercooked,  wrap tasted like it was moldy,  and the drinks were so watered down and WAY OVERPRICED! 
I'm sad that this place was so gross as it was the first place we visited when we got here. . 
Now we know where to avoid. 
Bummer. 
Chris Cordes 1508444743Solid place to watch a game.  
Our group, in town for a convention, was in need of place to watch a sports game and ended up here after not finding success at other places.  
The bar was good, solid.  
However, they did pretty much kick everyone out once the game was over, which was ok, but still not the greatest.  
Overall would go back but not rushing back there either. 
Ted Eliakis 1501504164Great roof top Bar Grill.  
Only had drinks but the food menu looked real good.  
good place to meet with friends or come out as couples for affordable drinks and appetizers.   
Had a good time. 
Will be back when in area. 
Rebecca Schwab Peoples 1500940738SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS... 
THEY STEAL!!!
My bill was padded without my authorization and I was overcharged.  
I was in a private party so the gratuity was included ($3.95 on a $22 bill).  
I chose not to add any additional gratuity (due to the horribly slow service).  
I specifically crossed out the "Additional Tip" line and wrote out the total.  
However, Donna (the server listed on the receipt) chose to steal from me and give herself an additional $5 tip without my authorization.  
She apparently thinks she deserves a $9 tip on a $22 bill...Save your receipts and check your credit card transactions ASAP.  
They are most likely stealing and padding everyone's bill - counting on people not checking or remembering what their total was. 
Nicholas Cecchi 1504466730Terrible food, terrible service, 3rd-rate view.No doubt this was a cool spot 20 years ago but now there is life in the loop and much better options than this.To elucidate: ordered a burger. 
Bottom bun was so soggy it was inedible and other than the hamburger patty, the other ingredients were an undifferentiated flavorless mass.Friend ordered chicken tenders... 
They looked like cardboard and apparently tasted the same.Super tasty food, great service, and awesome value. 
I ordered a half barbecue chicken dinner and usually restaurants give you really small chickens but this place doesn't mess around. 
It was a pretty solid portion and I'm really satisfied with everything. 
You get your food, you sit down and eat. 
Simple and great Great food, great service, great price! 
No complaints, it wasn't a mind blasting meal, but it was good food and filling. 
Perfect for the price rangeDidn't like the fountain soda had unpleasant after taste, fish sandwich was tasty. 
Love the fries had a nice amount.At first I was a little nervous about going to get an intalian beef from the area, I read the reviews, & gave it a try.. 
It was so delicious, I got mine dipped w/mozzarella cheese, hot & sweet peppers& cup of cheese for the fries. 
My pop was kind of flat though, &its not even expensive.Worst philly I have ever had in my entire life. 
Like who the flip makes a Philly with Italian beef meat. 
It was a wretched experience. 
The staff wasn�t even that nice they didn�t talk to their customers. 
Never coming here again!
For fast-food, Pop's is good stuff. 
Their beefs, burgers, gyros and fries are as good as anyone's. 
The staff is already very friendly, and the place is clean. 
Never have to wait long for the food either. 
The only thing that bums me out is the wifi never works. 
They say they have free WiFi, but my older iPad won't ever let me connect because it doesn't meet minimum security requirements. 
I would go there a little more often if I could get connected.I like this until they changed the onion rings totally garbage what they need to do is go back to the other kind so disappointed but I understand what is going on. 
Its called CUTTING CORNERS and CUTTING COSTS they don't care about the customer, I just found that out in a phone call to them manager didn't even give a rat's a**.Great food nice peopleJust stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. 
Place is clean, service was friendly and our food came our quickly. 
There's a lottery scratch off machine by the door when you first walk in and two male emplyees kept walking over and buying tickets. 
Like, a lot. 
LolFast friendly service and great food! 
What else do you want?  
Great Gyros!
Was not pleased with the speed of service. 
By the time we got our food, mine was getting cold. 
That being said, it was still very good. 
Atmosphere is good and staff that puts it all together at the counter will keep you smiling.Had a wonderful experience!  
Food is always delicious.  
Great service, especially Ms. 
Price.  
She was very friendly and extremely helpful.  
What a nice and happy welcoming!  
True hospitality for those of us visiting from another state.Love love love Portillo�s. 
We make a point of stopping at one whenever we are in the Chicago area or driving through. 
This one is great because it is right off the highway and easy to get to. 
The food is amazing!
This is the second location I've been to now. 
This location is just as clean and fun. 
Excellent food, clean bathrooms, lots of parking. 
Deducted one star due to the excessive wait for the food and the other ten people waiting at the same time as myself, but it's worth it once you get it.I was literally not disappointed at all with anything at this place.  
The food was very good! 
The staff was very on it n courteous. 
Im grateful for such a great first experience! 
Definitely returning to this place.So good! 
We ate before a show and the waitress was super efficient and delightful! 
Chicken sandwich, burger, and "tatchos" were great. 
Chicken sandwich flavors were well balanced and chicken was super moist!
Went here for a happy hour after work. 
The food was good, but prices were a bit high. 
Our waiter was easily confused and our food wasn't prepared together, so even though we ordered dinner all at the same time, entrees came out sporadically. 
They do have Andes mints at the door, so be sure to grab some of those on your way out! 
Don't grab the entire bowl though, the host doesn't think that's funny. :)Great entrees, great desserts... 
GREAT desserts ( order the carrot cake).Though you'll have a better experience at night with a much livelier atmosphere.Thoroughly enjoyed my whole experience here! 
The food was fantastic and had great decor and atmosphere. 
Was significantly less busy than I would have expected for how highly nice and delicious this place was. 
Our waiter was funny and personable. 
The drinks were well made. 
Would highly recommend this restaurant!
I went to dinner at Primebar for a 7pm dinner on a Saturday, and it was almost completely empty - probably due to the fact that Wacker is mostly a business street. 
The drinks were good and the prices for the food were fair considering the portion sizes. 
My issue was that while the food came out quickly and at the same time as the rest of my party, it seemed cold? 
That surprised me since there were only maybe 4 other tables.Always delish and perfectly cooked. 
Having a baked potato here reminds you why you love them. 
Ribs yummy lake perch lightly breaded wonderful.My favorite place to eat. 
Usually go for the beef tornadoes, but I also love Dover,  fisherman platter and everything I've ever had.  
Lemon drop martini is delish tooI haven't had a bad meal anytime I've been there. 
Outstanding quality and impeccable serviceWent here a year ago on mothers day with my sister and her kids. 
The waitress was abominable. 
She was acting like she was waiting tables against her will. 
I didn't complain at first because I thought perhaps I was misinterpreting the situation however by the time the appetizers arrived she had walked away from us twice while we were still talking to her and one time I think she rolled her eyes at us. 
She was extremely cold towards us and rarely checked in with our table. 
At this point I couldn't complain about it for fear of upsetting my sister on mother's day. 
This situation was the absolute worst dining experience I ever sat through, and our bill was over $300. 
It was so uncomfortable, when that check arrived I was eager to get out of there. 
Maybe we were dressed too casually, or the waitress was having a horrible day. 
Whatever the case, I would avoid this place, just on the chance you might get seated with this server. 
Went here with a large group of people just the other night. 
Firstly, you can barely read the menu because it's too dark in there. 
Ambiance is one thing, but I realized that it was dark so that you couldn't quite see how dirty the silverware was.  
Our server was rather rude and forgetful. 
Jimmy was his name. 
Just hearing how he talked to other tables, making excuses, forgetting drinks or bread...things like that. 
He should have asked others for help.The food. 
Steaks were cooked correctly.  
The French onion soup was mediocre, at best. 
There wasn't near enough onions. 
I think I had maybe one spoon full of onions in my entire bowl. 
The bread was just a slice of bread and wasn't toasted at all. 
It's supposed to have a crunch.  
Dionne's had the best French onion soup in the area. 
The oysters that our table had, on the other hand, caused me to vomit up my entire meal.  
I know about not eating oysters in months that don't have "r's", but this was the straw that broke the camel's back.I grew up in Momence and had never been here...although I had heard good things. 
I will not return.  
It's over priced, ineptly staffed, and some folks need training on how to interact with customers. 
Kara Zajac 1506705390Simply amazing.. the sandwich I has was very good! 
And the charcuterie board we had was also just simply amazing.. from the house mustards to the sourdough bread. 
Everything about this place is on point! 
Theresa Radko 1497544067Wait staff pleasant, soup was good but the take out market salad mediocre. 
I've had better for half the price. 
Music was very loud, this is not senior friendly. 
Counter person not friendly, wouldn't suggest it to friends. 
Wish them well. 
The bread is good. 
Justin B. 1507570042Catarina’s cheese game is strong...and they got good sammies too!
Recommended:Tom’s Silver Medal Soroush Yousefisahi 1505674279Food tasted decent, but expensive. 
The entire outside stank of sewer. 
The kitchen and freezer was right next to restroom without any walls in between... 
I'm talking hygenic! 
Patti King 1502046796Tasty food and friendly service. 4 stars for NO gluten-free bread.Awesome restaurant!! 
Food was phenomenal!! 
Atmosphere was upscale but cozy. 
The service was fantastic. 
Our server was nice, attentive but not overly so. 
She also was very knowledgeable of the menu if I could've given more stars I would've.Amazing food. 
Really great crust on the pizza, light and crispy with just enough cheese. 
Risotto was okay but the pasta was very well made. 
The seasonal beetroot salad with cheese was really nicely marinated, I added a bit of vinaigrette that was on the table to get some additional taste. 
Overall a great experience! 
Bookable online :)We came to Quartino on a Thursday night for a private event in the Wine Room. 
The whole night was a great experience. 
Our event was for a post-proposal dinner between two families. 
The service was great, not rushed. 
We got to use the TV to display a slideshow. 
Before the event, I called the restaurant several times to coordinate the use of the TV and they always answered my questions. 
I highly recommend using the Wine Room for private events.I dine here at least once a month and the food is consistently amazing, and I love the small plate/sharing style of dining. 
Service can be a bit hit or miss, but generally friendly and smooth. 
It would also be nice for us regulars if the menu changed occasionally. 
Its kinda loud and fun, so maybe not a great place for a romantic date, or business meeting. 
Great for a group though, plenty of variety for everyone, and sharing is always fun.The food is so good here. 
I just love they're small plates and sharing menu items. 
It's really one of the best places to go and have a quick bite and a glass of wine when you're in between things downtown. 
The service so friendly and so on top of their game, it's really a pleasure to spend time in this restaurant.Been going here for a long time. 
The food is good and the bottomless fries are truly wonderful. 
Do yourself a favor and get a side of campfire sauce to dip things in, you won't regret it. 
Went here this past Monday night with a large group of guys and the restaurant and they handled it without any delay! 
Our server Sam was fantastic! 
Always courteous, a bit sarcastic and charming. 
She was swift and accurate.I did a review about 4 yrs ago. 
The burgers still taste great. 
The only difference is the portion size. 
Just my guess, but I'd say the burger size has been reduced by at least 30% since my original 5-star review. 
I had my expectations set & now I feel like I'm getting less than that expectation. 
I used to take the family there about once every 2 months. 
Now, maybe once per year. 
Corporate-wise, smaller portions at the same price = greater ROI for the investors. 
Family-wise, smaller portions = not enough ROI for me to make the investment.5 stars because this is the only franchise I enjoy eating at besides Chipotle, so I'm grateful it was here while I was traveling.  
Reliable place for a good burger.  
Trisha F was an exceptional waitress who made the experience a lot nicer than it might have been and brought fries to supplement the dismal fruit salad.Attentive And Quick Service, Awesome Food, And Pleasant Atmosphere. 
Husband had burger with mac 'n cheese which he said was very good -- had a bit of a spicy taste and liked it. 
Myself, the Alaskan Cod Fish and chips. 
Smaller pieces than I expected but very filling!!!  
Definitely will be back!
Great service and enjoyable atmosphere nearly every time we end up here. 
This locations servers are friendly and accommodating. 
Kay Robinson 1508566278Our bartender Nichole was awesome!!! 
There   was a ticketed event going on downstairs but the rest of the bar was open to the public which was a surprise because most places are normally closed when things like this happens which I thought was great. 
My first time there, my experience was awesome I will be back!!! 
Brennan Zeigler 1507771294This place is awesome!!! 
It has a nice stage. 
It has good food and drinks. 
It would be better if it were in a nicer area of town though Dexter Smith 1501730349Great place fun especially for groups.  
Drinks and food are good.  
Music is eclectic great roof top bar.  
Awesome party spot.  
Can get crowded  but if you like a crowed and good drinks and great music this place is a must!     
Rachel P 1508634799They reserve tables for people whether they show up or not. 
It’s really dumb for them to have empty tables for hours at a time. 
My whole party of 20 left for this very reason. 
A few people tried to sit down in the reserved section and were told to move. 
Seriously? 
I guess this place doesn’t care about making money. :) Timothy LeCour 1505655350I liked the rooftop. 
First floor was a little noisy but that could have just been the band. 
They wanted $20 to see the band on the 1st floor. 
Other than that it was decent atmosphere.Very nice hotel. 
Room was comfortable, clean and a great place to relax after walking and visiting the sites of Chicago. 
Nicely located with great places around. 
The breakfast was pretty decent. 
The lady who helps there was very nice. 
She made breakfast extra pleasant.This was the forth time I have stayed here. 
This is another great part of the Marriott collection. 
The staff was supportive and provided me with every level of comfort. 
Centrally located and easy to get around. 
I will always recommend this location to family and friends.The hotel is nice enough. 
Pricey....way pricey, but probably because of the MLB playoffs...no problems with the room. 
There is a workout room and a pool/hot tub. 
Breakfast is pretty standard and does  not vary from day to day. 
The staff is nice. 
All in all though, a pleasant experience.Good City Hotel when you want some extra room.  
Entrance is on the 4th floor.  
Remodeled lobby and breakfast area.  
A couple of blocks away from Michigan, a little more quiet. 
Breakfast included. 
Parking is $65 per day.Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.The rooms are clean, warm, and well equipped for a stay. 
The staff is friendly and helpful. 
They go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. 
Veronica makes great coffee!
Good place to grab a bite and some beers before a game.  
Seating mostly out side.  
Prices are on par with the area.  
Decent beer selection.  
Upscale pub grub.If you go there on  Wednesday night you know there is an offer because it's full of cheap Spaniards getting their half priced burgers. 
Delicious food but a little bit of a wait on special days.Mediocre, didn't have the drinks we wanted that were on the menu. 
Waitress forgot our silverware and napkins. 
I probably wouldn't go here again. 
On the other hand, the Mac N Cheese was very delicious. 
I had a Chick Pea burger and it was a little over spiced with the garlic. 
Almost forgot to mention the one piece of feta. 
Smh, I'm done.Best turkey burger ever. 
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. 
The price is amazing for what you get as well...I couldn't even finish my meal! 
All that and Within walking distance from Wrigley!
Enjoyed having a burger here while going to Wrigley for a concert. 
Would get 5 stars, but service was lacking. 
Seemed like chaos and it wasn't that busy.Go to this restaurant if you like being herded like cattle and treated like a 1st graded to get your food. 
Terrible Experience...The food was actually pretty good, but the quality of service was on another level of bad. 
The attitude of the employees when I made a simple request was very poor. 
When I asked to purchase an extra pita, they immediately threw my bowl back to the start of the line, 10 orders behind me, and made me walk back to the start and repeat my request. 
At that point, I got a roll of the eyes and was told I already got one and the girl shoved my order forward and ignored me. 
Yes, I knew I had already gotten one, I wanted an extra... 
Never going back if this is what I can expect.Great food. 
I recommend the chicken kabob rice plate. 
You can pick and choose the extra ingredients such as cucumbers and tomatoes and Dill yogurt sauce.I've eaten here several times. 
The food seems fresh and the staff have always been efficient but friendly. 
I feel like I'm eating a healthy option while getting a decent value.Very healthy and delicious food. 
I really enjoyed it.This place is amazing! 
I brought one of my close girl friends here for her birthday. 
The atmosphere was very dark and romantic but my friend and I still had a great time. 
They even gave us a free dessert because of her birthday! 
The service was great except it took a while for them to bring us our beer & wine. 
We already finished our basket of bread so I think our server probably forgot? 
Oh well.. 
I would love to come back on a date night sometime :)Fast service! 
Food was great! 
Prices are very reasonable. 
Staff was very friendly! 
Phone your order ahead. 
They’re usually busy.Best slice special around period! 
Great pizza and burgers are amazing too!
I order cheese burgers,   well done I said when I order them, is like if a said uncooked stupidsGreat Customer service! 
Slice of pizza & fries is enough to feed a 16yrs old athletic boy. 
Burgers meals are delicious & fulfilling. 5 piece Jumbo Wing (regular sized wing that you would buy at the grocery store) meal are delicious & fulfilling. 
Reasonably Priced! 
You can easily spend under $20 to feed a family of 3 (1 adult & two teenage boys). 
Hopefully this review  helps😊Besides the half raw burger I got.
(maybe there were in a hurry)  I love the jumbo hot wings and pep pizza. 
The hot wings in my opinion are better than the chicken fingers at purple steer.Loval family owned establishment. 
Stsple of Valpo. 
Smoke-friendly atmosphere. 
Beautiful outdoor area with free games. 
A must-goGreat local watering hole and restaurant. 
Lots of bar games, decent craft beer selection. 
Owned and operated by the same family for four generations. 
Food was really good. 
I had the bacon smacked chicken sandwich. 
The server was unaware of what beer was on tap, or if they had Riesling.Great food, friendly waitresses, and fair drink prices, but they allow smoking so be prepared for that because it's usually thick.Always great food friendly service it's just really busy so it may take a bit for a waitress to appearWe had a great appetizer. 
The entrees were just ok. 
Also, the bathroom was run down. 
The paper towel holder was broken and just hanging out on the counter. 
The kitchen is open for guests to see but not meant to be an open kitchen. 
It's doesn't appear clean or orderly for a kitchen exposed to guests. 
We were on vacation and the reviews were great so we decided to try. 
Not horrible but not greatShoreline is one of my "Go To" beer, and food, places. 
They have fantastic brews that are great for relaxing or enjoying with a meal. 
I try to get in there anytime they have a new release. 
I've enjoyed their burgers many times along with some of their sandwiches. 
The Lamb burger is awesome and don't forget to go with the pub chips. 
**Update**It's been sometime since my first review. 
I had lunch at Shoreline this past week (Aug 2017) and felt a quick update was necessary. 
I still enjoy going to the brewery for lunches and quick meetings and will eat here at least once a month. 
The burgers are really great nearly every time and I can't recall the last time I wasn't satisfied. 
However, the beer is fair. 
It's possible I've outgrown their beers and I'm just not respecting them enough but it just doesn't hit the spot like they used to. 
That said, they have actually improved. 
There was a period a couple years back when the beers were giving some odd flavors primarily noted was a copper or metallic tatse. 
Since the new head brewer has taken over that issue has been resolved. 
I still think eating, and drinking their beers, is well worth my time and money and would continue to recommend visiting.Ordered the Mac and cheese and it comes in a very small potlrtion for the price. 
Added grilled chicken and had 6 small cubes of re-heated (distinctive flavor) and tough chicken. 
My wife and I will not be returning. 
Service itself was fine.I really enjoy the time I spend there. 
I like the IPA, the staff is very good and the food that I tried was very good. 
One tip for their future customers. 
You may have to wait for table but get a cold beer from the bar and you can seat outside until your table is ready.Took my craft beer loving son from Alaska to this brewery for dinner. 
Ordered the sampler and was impressed with the variety of beers. 
Our food came in a timely manner and was delicious! 
Portion size - very generous. 
Our server, Drew, was professional and courteous. 
I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great craft brewery experience.It was a little noisy but the food was amazing and the service impeccable. 
We split the Hearts of Palm salad and then selected the short rib ravioli for our entrees. 
We split the sticky Parmesan potatoes because it sounded too good to pass up. 
It was a good call. 
There were no leftovers. 
All the food was beautifully presented and full of flavor.Great atmosphere and service.  
Food is excellent, though I have had better pizza (it's not bad  pizza, I've just had better).  
Octopus appetizer was excellent.  
Really enjoyed the homemade pastas.I came here for a business lunch and it was very good. 
The menu is full of traditional favorites with the restaurants own special unique tweak to each dish. 
I went with the very basic burnt pepperoni pizza and it was excellent. 
We also shared some starters which were off the charts good. 
The service was also very good. 
All in it was a great experience. 
Came here for brunch today and it was such a great experience. 
The avocado toast was pretty good, all fresh ingredients. 
My mom had the eggs Benedict with pesto hollandaise and it was incredible. 
Really would love to come back to try some other things on the regular menu.Large dining room with sleek decor and huge, 360� bar in the lounge area. 
The layout was well designed so that those seeking a lovely dining experience could do so without any disturbances from those enjoying a night on the town.Gabe and the rest of the bar staff are great. 
They all work well together and often times greet us regulars with a wave despite the fact that they are juggling multiple tasks at any given moment. 
Bar food menu is brilliant, Italian light fare that hits the spot without sending you to bed. 
The resident DJ on weekends keep the uptempo atmosphere peaking by mixing popular hits and classic house with contemporary electronic dance music.All in all, Sienna Tavern is SLEEK, SEXY, SAVORY & UPBEAT. 
Conveniently located at Kinzie & Dearborn Streets in Chicago's River North neighborhood. 
This is a destination to see and be seen so dress to impress, especially on the weekends. 
How much you spend is up to you. 
A tab can range anywhere from $30 per person to well over a hundred if you lose track of the number of craft beers or signature cocktails you and your guests enjoy.  
romil shah 1502661063Good vegeterian options and great value for money DP Indetkar 1477184951Tasty, healthy food. 
Clean crisp veggies and well cooked meat. 
Great pricing too. 
The occasional winter soups are very good.  
Karl Schmidbauer 1463193620Good choice for a half sandwich / half soup combo. 
Lettuce is pretty fresh. 
Adrien Gracia 1364408466Gross.I've been there a couple times and i thought that it was actually not bad.Today, I had a nice surprise in my salad.I started eating my salad when suddenly something felt wrong in my mouth.Something was not right, really crunchy for a salad.I spit it out and there was lying on my salad a 2 inches long grasshopper.Grossssss.I took it back, did not make a scene, and before the guy gave me my money back, he asked me if i wanted another salad instead.....H3LL no!!!!!!!
Ain't going back over there daniel Hu 1391346938A friend of mine at work introduced this place to me for dinner. 
I ordered a pesto chicken Panini sandwich and to be honest, it was the best Panini sandwiches I have ever had. 
I would love to order more if they can deliver down in Des Plaines. 
Smith and Wollensky is a must try if you are looking for a great steak house with a unique experience. 
There are two floors to this restaurant. 
The upper floor consists of the bar, indoor seating (with no river view) and outdoor seating (very minimal river view). 
The lower level is the more desirable seating option. 
If you are booking a reservation for a special occasion ask for the lower level seating that is closest to the windows for the view. 
This is the most scenic view where you get to watch the boats pull into the Chicago Winery on the other side of the river. 
In terms of food the steak is pretty good but what stood out most in the meal has to be the �cup of bacon�. 
This is an appetizer option that is a must try! 
The bacon is this lean beef bacon that is made specially just for their restaurant. 
The bacon is so good that it will make you think all other bacon you have previously been eating is fake. 
�This is how bacon should always taste like!
�Pretty sad how the horrible service here can ruin a good name like Smith & Wollensky. 
It was obvious the server wasn't even listening to me when I ordered because I asked for a bottle of wine and he brought over a completely different wine from another part of the wine list. 
When I asked him to correct it he told me the wine I wanted wasn't available. 
When do restaurants update their wine lists? 
Once a year? 
The server even put his hand up to get me to stop talking at one point. 
Really, really awful experience. 
The manager did try to make it right by comping the wine I eventually got but the experience was totally ruined already. 
Go to the location in Houston instead, they're pretty cool. 
Or literally any other restaurant because they might actually listen to what you order.Smith & Wollensky should be 5 stars. 
I am shocked. 
I have been to the NY and Boston restaurants and they were easily 5 stars. 
Our waiter was very nice.... 
When we saw him. 
He was way overbooked. 
My 24 ounce bone in rib eye ordered medium rare was about 16 ounces and medium well. 
Granted they offered to bring me a new steak, it should never have been delivered that way. 
I kept it. 
Ate it. 
But is was far from what was ordered. 
These are the reasons this one gets 3 stars. 
The rest of the meal was about 4/4.5 star worthy. 
We won't return to the Chicago S&W again. 
Way better options in Chicago. 
Sadly disappointed.Great place to dine for any occasion . had one of my best Valentine's day dates here. 
After dinner we were invited down to the lounge for some wine and cigars. 
Hospitality at its finest.Oh and the Porter House Steak along with the South African Lobster tail was a signature satisfaction I have yet to forget about. ( they dont come together,  I had to order two entrees)No matter what anyone says, this is THE steakhouse in Chicago. 
Excellent service & food! 
Pricey...yes but totally worth it. 
Very beautiful view of the marina if you eat outside on the patio. 
Great for a romantic evening.  
This is a "must do" if u are in Chi-town! 
I strongly recommend I would give lower if I could. 
I really wish the employees would change their gloves when working with a different flavor, it would be beneficial to people with allergies. 
Nice coffee, though.Wide variety of chocolates and candy that's cheaper than going to South Bend, great drinks and it's a good place to stop in for a bite to eat while shopping at the outlet mallI'm having a great time here nestled away from the cold sitting in a cushy chair drinking hot  chocolate ? 
living this blessed gift watching the few cold hardy people trudge by.   
No Good!  
Unprofessional and annoying worker's ?
The woman working tonight argued with he co-worker right in front of us. 
It was so unprofessional. 
I can't believe she works dealing with customers. 
The employee was very sweet and tried to cover it up. 
He is someone to have run the place.  
Bob Gordon 1508002336This was a nice experience. 
The food was good and unique.  
The drinks were tasty and the staff was friendly and helpful.  
The only downside would be the location. 
It is located right at the end of a bridge which makes getting picked up a little more difficult than a typical occasion, but it was worth it. 
Hans Juergen Wio 1508045093Too expensive and overcrowded. 
Sitting inside it's hardly possible to talk without shouting to each other. 
Service fully fulfilled my expectation of American restaurant service. 
Tarun Chawla 1494196695This place is a staple location for happy hour but fills up very fast and gets very loud, even around the tables. 
Definitely make reservations if you can plan ahead. 
I've also attended a small catered corporate event here. 
They provide some standing tables and cater apps, and the food was fine. 
The waitress did a great job delivering drinks accurately and quickly for a large group of people.  
Jamie Edwards 1501879936Delicious and inexpensive food! 
I normally get a bacon,egg,cheese sandwich on wheat with the eggs scrambled softly. 
After a few mis steps with over cooked eggs, now my sandwich is perfect. 
Friendly staff who know your order as you step up to the counter, what could be any better in customer service? 
Wendy Klarman 1508529913Great spot for summer happy hour.  
Good food, and Rose' all day(served in beekers)Awesome hotel! 
Extremely hospitable staff. 
If you can, stay on one of the higher floors for a nice view. 
Spacious rooms with nice amenities. 
We visit the city fairly often so this will definitely become one of our staple stays. 
And there's free breakfast!!
This hotel is great! 
My spouse stays here often for work. 
The rooms are clean and the beds comfy. 
The staff at breakfast make the whole stay worth it, they're so friendly! 
It's nice and centrally located in Chicago, close to lots of things. 
My only complaint is the amount of chlorine in the pool/whirlpool, but that seems pretty standard.We were in Chicago for a wedding and SpringHills Suites was a great place to stay. 
The facilities were nice, the location is central, and the staff was very nice and accommodating. 
They helped us out so we can be on the same floor as the rest of our family, and even provided items we forgot to pack like a toothbrush and razor. 
The breakfast was good but what made our stay great was the friendly service. 
I would definitely recommend the SpringHill Suites if you're in Chicago.This was a wonderful location for our family weekend in Chicago.  
Near all of the downtown attractions, and the breakfast was wonderful.  
Only 2 things prevented me from giving 5 stars...they do not have ice makers on the floors, so you have to go to the lobby for ice or call the front desk...and there were no rooms available when we wanted to go back in October.Stayed for 3 nights visiting Chicago for the first time. 
Great location. 
Walking distance to so many attraction. 
Rooms are very comfortable. 
Breakfast had a great variety and staff was very friendly and helpfulAmazing food, cool family restaurant. 
The stuff is super friendly, and they are always looking around and checking if you need something else.I did Thai food before, but never like this one. 
If you like spice curry, noodles or just wanna try something different... 
Go here!
Prices are not bad neither.Great service.  
You can tell that the restaurant is thoughtful towards the customer.  
Received two empty soup bowls to go along with soup (we order out a lot and never experienced such thoughtfulness).  
Also they added a large Perrier for free - as a way of thanking us for our large order I think?  
The red curry chicken (Chicken Pad Ped) was awesome.  
Will definitely be adding this place as a "go-to" for Thai!
great food here! 
I personally really like their crab rangoons. 
Also love the location, there's tons of different kinds of people who come in. 
The place is also really good for people watching, thanks to its location and huge window which I like sitting by. 
The food is good- I would say that although its kind of stereotypical, its fresh and well prepared.  
Best to go there when you want to grab a quick lunch. $15 each for 2 people, with 2 entrees and an appetizer. 
Oh and there's plenty of food to take home as well.Amazing Food, large portions!!! 
It was busy and we did have to wait in line for 10 minutes for a table for 2, it was a busy Saturday night! 
However once seated, servers were very attentive and food was served quickly. 
The restaurant is very nice inside, great decor! 
Loved it and would highly recommend :)Ate lunch here after viewing the solar eclipse at the Adler Planetarium.  
Found items on the menu that two adults and three kids 13 and under all enjoyed. 
Large portion sizes. 
Could have ordered one Pad Thai to feed three kids. 
Enjoyed Chicken Satay appetizer. 
Did not like the spring rolls as much. 
Pot stickers were very good, large portion size for an appetizer.  
Got Chicken curry with potatoes and peas, really liked it. 
Had enough left over for two more meals. 
Free refills on kid's soft drinks. 
Down side was having to purchase rice to go with the entrees. 
Waitress was very friendly, but very hard to understand/communicate with. 
Pricey. 
A family fun entertainment place to go and enjoy yourself with friends and family. 
If you enjoy bowling they have many leagues that you can join if you're interested. 
They also offer children leaves on Saturday morning. 
Some leads play for money at the end of the season some play just for fun.My friend and I went here to bowl two rounds and asked the girl at the counter to split the cost of two whole rounds, not split the price of one game. 
When the first round ended I went to bowl and the manager yelled at us for bowling because she said that what we paid for was over. 
The manager ran over somewhere else before I could come up and talk to her. 
I know it wasn't the young girls'fault for misunderstanding, but the manager had no need to be so rude. 
Won't come back here. 
Happy Birthday to me I guess!
Fun place with plenty of lanes and good deals on bowling. 
The snack shop is good, the bartender is very friendly and helpful, and the pro shop is great. 
The front desk personnel are great too.It's a fun place to bowl but a lot of their games are either broken, out-dated, just swallow the coins. 
Other then that you'll have a blast and get full off of there amazing Pizza Went there to drink a few and play pool and drink a few. 
Got there at 10:50They close at 12:00 figured I should have enough time to play a game and get a bucket with my buddy. 11:20 rolls around and they say we got 10 minutes. 
So we have to finish our game and slam our beers..... not to mention all of their pool cues suck. 
Wish I would have brought my own ,but didn't have it with me. 
Next time I'll just go to a place that closes when they say not when they want. 
Don Miha 1508460671Friendly  "Local" bar. 
Good food/drinks. 
Staff is usually very attentive and friendly. 
Peter Manzanet 1502973213Great music,great service. 
Awesome place downtown to relax. 
You'll find white collar workers here fresh from work. 
Ian C 1506655224The worst meal I've had in over 3 years.  
Ordered a fish sandwich and it was the size of a slider.  
The sweet potato fries weren't fukky cooked and were cold.  
Would never eat food from here again. 
Uros Jankovic 1504373049It look a bit iffy but the staff is amazing, the food is great. 
Very good beer list that gets updated regularly. 
Eugene Griffith 1505438247Great little bar in the heart of downtown Chicago!  
Real friendly staff!
Request Amanda. 
Super attentive, delightfully interactive, distractingly attractive. 
Food is quality. 
Beer is plentiful. 
Atmosphere is prime.Very good food! 
Great amount of TV's to see all sports. 
It's a fun place to hang.Pretty good food but VERY noisy!
The cheese soup is excellent but they only have it certain days so definitely call ahead if that's what you're interested in having.Best food ever. 
Lots of ipa beers . 
Great service. 
Otb and Blackhawks fans. 
Great atmosphere. 
What more could a girl want.I have been coming here for a few months. 
Service is great, the menu is awesome, no complaints. 
If you want to play the ponies or just enjoy some cocktails while watching your favorite sports this is the place to come.The dining room is clean, and the sub making process is fast. 
The employees are kind and quick. 
Recommended.Friendly staff. 
Orders filled quickly. 
Open dining room, but it's pretty quite. 
GreatAlways good serviceit was so bad it's not worth my time going over the list! 
i would eat out of a dumpster before i ever eat here again. 
Great venue for watch sports events. 
Attentive staff and decent food. 
I've visited Sully's for the last two years watching Formula 1 Races and Sully's is centrally located and easy to find.Thanks for finding a screen to watch our game. 
Nice people, come check this place out! 
(And Go Big Red!!)
Great drink and food specials daily. 
Nice small rooftop spaceBeen to Sully's many times, always a pleasant experience. 
Great rooftop, awesome service  and affordable. 
Great service, the chicken wings are the best item on the menu. 
The beers are great. 
I come here all the time! 
Best place to watch the Cubs, the Hawks, etc. 
Swinging music and chilling atmosphere. 
It's pretty decent priced too. 
Great bar food! 
Went through Drive-Thru on this particular occasion and loved it. 
Wasn't stuck waiting too long, and my order was ready almost as soon as I ordered it. 
I even had custom changes and everything was correct when I got it. 
They didn't forget to ask me what sauces I wanted, and they suggested something new I went in for and liked.  
The reason for 1 less star: During actual lunch time, it would seem that this restaurant is VERY inundated and things don't move so quickly at all inside or out. 
This is an ongoing struggle for this particular place.We were very impressed with Cheryl the cashier working Saturday the 28th....She was VERY FRIENDLY AND TREATED US VERY WELL . 
Thank youSo much food for such a good price. 
Service is always great and drive through lines move quickly.Worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. 
We ordered through the drive thru and was hoping to get some Chicken Chips. 
We were told they were out. 
Okay, fine, whatever. 
Instead, we ordered 5 Doritos Locos Tacos (3 Supreme, 2 Regular) and 1 soft shell taco. 
One of the DLTs barely had anything in it; I may as well have been eating a damn taco shell by itself. 
None of the tacos had a great quantity of meat, it was like eating a salad. 
Absolutely ridiculous. 
Oh, let's not forget the crappy customer service. 
The guy handed us the food and closed the window. 
No "have a good day" or "thank you". 
Seriously? 
This location is terrible at just about anything and everything. 
When the employees are not doing anything with orders, you can see them in the back on their phones... 
While the lobby is a damn mess with trays piled high on the trash. 
I would recommend going in for lunch and not go after 2 P.M. when the idiots come in for their shifts.Great staff fast and great takeoutGreat long time local mexican place. 
Food and service always good. 
Prices are reasonable. 
Open for breakfast. 
Carry out or dine-in, serves alcohol.It's the best place for some delicious Mexican food. 
The prices are nice, and the people who work there, are friendly.  
Excellent food and excellent service. 
Thank you!
Very good food an serviceI have never had a bad experience at a Mexican restaurant in my life, and I have been to tons. 
The gucuamole was blan, had no flavor the "chicken" I requested for my nachos tasted like pork, I had to pick and chose to try and force myself to eat it , while my boyfriend ordered the enchilada which he loves and the sauce on it was absolutely repulsive. 
I told them I wasn't going to pay for food I had no intentions on eating. 
Taco Bell has Better food then this place and that says a lot!!! 
I do NOT recommend.This place is a gem! 
Not only was the food delicious, but staff was extremely accommodating of my vegan diet. 
She made sure she understood what it was I do not eat and pointed out everything on the menu that was safe for me to enjoy. 
The place had a wonderful energy, was very warm and inviting. 
I had such a lovely evening! 
I will definitely dine here again and again!
I will not say that the Taj Mahal serves the tastiest or the most authentic Indian food, but it is not bad either. 
The best thing is that they have a buffet during lunch and dinner hours. 
The service is quite good. 
I quite liked the owner/manager. 
She seems a warm and an inviting person. 
The food, as I said, was okay. 
Although, in all fairness, I only had the vegetarian dishes and I thus can't comment on the meat dishes. 
All in all, it is a good place if you want a quick bite at affordable prices.Went there for the first time in years and was impressed.  
The quality of the food is great. 
We had the buffet,  amd the variety of dishes offered was good enough to accommodate everyone in our group.  
I came with my family,  but it would also be nice for a date.  
I stayed in Chennai, India for two weeks for work this last July - the food here was the most authentic South Indian cuisine I've had since being in India. 
The Chicken Biriyani was fantastic!
Really good food & good service:)Teibel's is a long established and phenomenal restaurant. 
I have been coming here for decades. 
The food is wonderful, the service always friendly. 
Don't pass up a chance to stop here if you are in the area!
My family loves Teibel's! 
They always have great food and a really nice atmosphere and service. 
Make a trip around Christmas time to see the amazing model train displayI was there for a meeting.  
The servers were loud, seemed disrespectful for the speaker. 
But all in all good food and nu e place to eat.We had a group of 13 go here for their all you can eat perch. 
It was delicious.  
Since we were a large group, we had 2 servers.  
They were outstanding! 
They laughed with us, they took pictures for us and with us. 
From the minute we walked in and were greeted by the most gracious and accommodating hostesses, til the minute we walked out the door 3 1/2 hours later, we were treated tremendously.  
Thank you Teibels for making our night so special.I was very disappointed today. 
My server was very nice but never came back to ask me how my meal was. 
My fish, well it was nice and hot was barely cooked. 
My French fries were wonderful. 
My carrots were not even lukewarm. 
A couple of them were ice-cold. 
I've been coming there for nearly fifty years and I have never had an experience like I had today.The Texas Road house is a great restaurant. 
There is no shortage of peanuts to snack on,   there is fresh warm bread with cinnamon sugar butter to dip into at the table when you are seated. 
Servers are quick and courteous.  
The food is delicious, my steak was tender, juicy and properly cooked as requested. 
My wife's slab of ribs was also tender and juicy, the meat fell apart like good ribs should. 
The restaurant is a great place for groups or individuals, with a bar and tv's strategically placed around the establishment. 
We even seen two kids have a birthday party here and the restaurant went out of their way to make it special for the two boys. 
All and all a great restaurant!
Went on a "Father Daughter Date" with my six year old. 
Service was fantastic. 
Food was great as always. 
Our server was Kara. 
She was great at having a conversation and interacting with us at a table, but  didn't feel like she hovered all night. 
We had cheesy fries. 
Cooked perfectly. 
Kid had ribs and mashed potatoes and they were as always excellent. 
I had a 16 oz. 
Ribeye by recommendation of Kara. 
Everything was done exactly as we ordered it. 
If I could give a 6 out of 5 I would. 
Great job overall and we will be back again.Service is good and your food is prepared fast. 
The price is reasonable if not cheap so don't expect to have an excellent meal. 
It's just a good meal for the price I believe the chain accomplished what they want to be to the public.Doing the fundraiser Real Men Wear Pink for breast cancer awareness. 
The good is awesome. 
The manager was great to work with. 
The staff is excellent.First, the food is top notch. 
Second they happily cook your second, any way you want without judging a well done request (which they get right the first tine). 
Last, the value can't be beat even in a steak town like OmahaThis place is rock solid. 
So it's a little tricky to find, which made the whole experience even better. 
We see a bouncer who tells us to head to the back and up the stairs. 
Only second level is open tonight. 
We clamber up an old, but tidy, backstair. 
Soon we're seated at a small with comfy bar.  
The place is sort of plush and feels like a gastropub.  
The drinks were awesome and the bartenders were friendly and helpful.They are going for the cozy speakeasy atmosphere and yet the music was ridiculously loud and the staff was incredibly uptight.. 
Dim, warm lights, old electric bulbs, and chic upholstery paired with blaring crappy house music... an unfortunate contradiction. 
I had to shout in order to have a conversation with my companion. 
We sat at the bar. 
The service was slow, inattentive, and abrupt. 
There are too many great bars in this city, do not waste your time at this one.Monday night happy hour upstairs is great. 
Awesome speakeasy type historic like vibe to the place. 
Good deals, and good drinks. 
Very cozy with lots of lounge areas. 
Perfect for a date.Low key, dimly-lit cocktail bar with a speakeasy atmosphere. 
There's a piano and pool table upstairs. 
There was a small group of flapper girls when I went in one evening and it really played up to the 20's vibe. 
Loved it!
Very weird bouncer - tried to kick me out after saying goodnight to my Mom and Sister, as I was visiting from out of town. 
I had one cocktail there in the span of an hour, but the bouncer told me "I've been watching you all night, and you're not the type of person we want in here." 
So I spend $15 on a cocktail, sit at a bar with a couple mid-30's friends, my mom and sister, and were literally the only ones in there on a Friday night, but I guess I'm not what they want in there. 
Best of luck Barrelhouse! 
Guess your bouncer thinks its a better vibe when there are zero people in there. 
Chris Cordes 1508352666Very good German food.  
The beer is great (their house brand).  
There is a good selection of food and varieties.   
It was a bit more expensive than I thought it was going to be, but it is high quality good.  
Recommend it to anyone in the area.  
Good for dinner, lunch or happy hour. 
Katie Shankster 1504737489Nice restaurant with a lot of history.  
We were visiting from out of town and picked this because it was the oldest restaurant in Chicago.  
We each ordered a beer, which were good, and burgers.  
Partner had a burger with bacon and I had the lamb burger....both tasty!  
They bring a bread basket out with different types to snack on while you wait.  
Service was mediocre at best.  
It was later at night when we went, and the restaurant not packed, so not sure why it was slow.  
Overall a good experience though.  
Definitely worth a visit! 
Holly Hanson 1502908617This is one of the oldest restaurants in the City of Chicago. 
I came here with my grandparents as a child (a long long time ago) and I keep coming back for good reasons.Outstanding food and drinks.Outstanding service.Lovely atmosphere and location.They are re-working the main bar right now to make it a bit larger, so I can only assume business is good, for good reason. 
Cheers! 
Uri V 1505358324Great place with a lot of delicious choices. 
I don't eat pork thus eating German cuisine can be challenging but they had many non pork items on the menu including sea food, chicken, duck. 
I had an orange glazed duck and it was amazing. 
Highly recommend for business dinners. 
Ron Ramsden 1509011116We had a business lunch here with 22 people.  
The food was quick and we all ordered off the menu and they handled it very quickly.  
Root beer was great as well as the german food (I would tell you what I had but would spell it wrong).  
Thank you for a great dining experienceFriendly staff, great atmosphere and the BEST scramble I've ever had!!! 
I'm an out- of-towner and I highly recommend The Egg and I to anyone. 
It's family friendly and wheelchair accessible. 
Wish we had this place back in Council Bluffs,Iowa!!!?
Excellent breakfast options!  
Wisconsin Scramble is great!  
Great service and food!  
Basically a breakfast and lunch restaurant.  
They close early.Tasted great. 
However I asked for over easy and got scrambled. 
The tables that came in 5 min after us got served a good 15 min before us   the topper was when I found a part of a sugar packet at the bottom of the cream meaning it had been on someone else's table. 
When i showed the server he shrugged his shoulders. 
Not impressed and the last time I will come to this location.It was good and fast.  
The potatoes were a little soggy and the prices were a little high for breakfast but on par with Perkins.  
The service was very good (friendly and responsive to your needs).  
I had the Hiker Benedict, my only compliant with it was one of my eggs were over done, but the flavor was excellent.It was the best meal we've had in a long time. 
Cleanest restaurant ?. 
Great service, and fresh, melt in your mouth food.... 
Thank you Soo much!
Nothing wrong with the restaurant but the only problem I have is with the Google reviews. 
They have it marked in the $$ price range and the appetizers were 20$ and some entrees were in the 50$ range. 
It should be more appropriately labeled. 
Even the cheaper entrees were between 20 and 30$.Nice restaurant on the Ave.  
I wasn't too keen on eating a venison burger..but sure glad I did, it was awesome.  
Sat at the bar, the bartenders were very friendly and served awesome drinks. 
Hint..they are Cub fans!  
:9)Great service & vibe. 
Food was tasty, brought out as asked with all modifications made properly & was hot!  
Fish and chips were nicely battered with thick chips! 
Elk rack was smaller in portion than anticipated but, still glad we tried it. 
Mussels, great twist with the vindaloo sauce! 
Venison burger, cooked to the right temp, not dry and very flavorful. 
Would definitely go back!
Good service. 
The food was good. 
I would have liked  more options. 
The location is great. 
I would go back.Fantastic place to enjoy great food in a unique atmosphere.  
Party up front, elegance in back, a place to sit for every mood.  
The food was fantastic.  
Plenty of selection and variation.  
Nice wine list.  
All in all a spectacular venue.I read the reviews online and made my reservation before seeing Hamilton. 
My reservation was complete with my remarks we were seeing Hamilton. 
The restaurant atmosphere was lovely and the food was divine. 
Our reservation was for 5:45 and we were promptly seated on time. 
I expected to be in there easily and hour. 
I thought we'd have enough time to get outside and take a few pictures before we got in line for the show. 
I read this elsewhere and I have to agree, it was a little too slow. 
The waiter was fantastic and kind but I didn't think our dessert would ever get to us. 
Of course you want to be seated in the theater in plenty of time to freshen up, use the restroom, whatever... before you get your seats. 
Dessert finally arrived at 7:00 p.m. and we had to eat fast even though the theater was across the street so we could get in line and get settled. 
We didn't get into our seats until 7:20. 
If the service was't quite so slow, I would easily give 5 stars and two thumbs up but it just shouldn't take 20 min. to get dessert and then not have the time to enjoy it. 
I would definitely go back but arrange my time better so I don't stress.Went here for dinner after seeing Hamilton at the Private Bank Theater directly across the street. 
We arrived at 4:30......very early but had great service and a delicious meal. 
Had the sea bass and it was outstanding! 
My friend had the roasted chicken and enjoyed it. 
Good service, kind waiter!

One of the most tender steaks I've had. 
We got reservations for dinner before a show. 
(I was in the room where it happened) and they timed our meal perfectly. 
The decor is dark wood and very cozy. 
We didn't drive so I don't know about parking, sorry. 
It was a pricy meal but worth it.We came here since it was right across from Hamilton & we were looking for a good steakhouse. 
It did not disappoint! 
We got the 8oz filets with a side of giant baked potato & it was so delicious!! 
A great cut with very good flavor, it practically melted in your mouth. 
An added bonus were their cocktails we're Hamilton themed so of course I had to order one (or three). 
If you're looking for a great steakhouse look no further, though I'd recommend a reservation as a lot of people seemed to pick this place as a place to grab a bite before the play.  
Eve Chou 1503862635The space is so open and airy. 
Service is friendly and accommodating. 
There were some hiccups but it got fixed. 
The pound cake was baked to perfection, the buttery goodness topped with fruits, hazelnut and ricotta. 
The bacon is a must and their eggs are soft and fluffy. 
The meal is so tasty and definitely a great brunch place. 
Idris Evans 1505188673The food was excellent and worth the wait. 
That said, the kitchen isn't all that fast. 
I got pretty hungry waiting for my meal, and to see the server for the first time. 
The place is also pretty loud, which might make a date difficult. 
Small quibbles though. 
Try the monkfish - it's divine. 
I'd gladly come here again the next time I'm in Chicago. 
Joe Campbell 1504473604This restaurant would get 5 stars, the food is excellent but the wait staff is "not so" excellent. 
Ask the waiter for a recommendation and he has nothing to offer. 
Ordered the side order bacon, excellent! 
Coffee, pork shoulder all 5 star.  
Pound cake was a little dry but passable. 
Yorkshire pudding was just OK, description on the menu makes it sound great but the dish is just so so.  
Chris Lazar 1500590166Wasn't anything special. 
Food was good, price was expected. 
They were super delayed for us even though we were one of the last tables they were serving for brunch.They also had booths open that they didn't prioritize handing out over the family-style long table which was very loud and impersonal. 
They did, however, move us upon request which was appreciated. 
All-in-all it was okay. 
Wouldn't care to go back but wouldn't put up an argument if people were going again. 
Vince Panepinto 1501199297I went here for a late brunch this past Sunday with some friends, and we all were really impressed. 
As a vegetarian, I was a bit apprehensive on what I could eat, but there were actually more options than I was expecting, and they weren't the typical lazy veggie option that's pretending to be high class (can we get a break from portobello caps, please)? 
If you're vegan, options narrow down a bit, but I'm sure if you call ahead they'd prepare something tasty for you (staff here were super friendly). 
Anyways, two of us got the summer squash egg dish, which was absolutely amazing. 
Their coffee was really great too, had no problems drinking it black. 
The carnivores really enjoyed their plates, too. 
It does get loud here, so you'll have to use your outside voice when talking to your group. 
Definitely recommend getting reservations. 
Came here the other day on a whim and would definitely recommend. 
The lines were a bit long for us, but the food was worth the wait. 
Everything tasted so good and the cornbread is to die for. 
Sitting on the patio was a little chilly so make sure you have reservations for inside if you don�t like the cold. 
Also, there are only two unisex bathrooms for this bustling place so plan your sitting accordingly.EDIT: FROM 5 STARS TO 1 STAR.I originally gave this place a five star review after I ate here, but when I was going through my receipts after my Chicago trip and comparing it to my credit card charges, I saw that they tried to double my tip and overcharge me. 
I left my original review below in case you still planned to eat here, but make sure to check your credit card statement afterward.
----Had an amazing experience at The Purple Pig! 
It definitely isn't cheap by any means, but it is an affordable high-end restaurant if you're looking for a nice night out.They are a little pushy and rushy simply because there's so much going on at once in the restaurant, but at least the food came out pretty quickly.The Bone Marrow and Beet Salad and Pork Jowl were amazing foods that were both excitingly new and still delicious! 
These three dishes made the whole wait worth it The fried pig ear was alright, but a little too oily and nothing to balance it out. 
The tuna was a major disappointment because it was too salty and there was barely anything on the plate.While there were some dishes that we didn't like, I'm still giving it a five star review for these innovative dishes that are hard to find anywhere else. 
It was about ~90 for a good filling meal for three people!
Fantastic food! 
We asked for suggestions and our server picked all his favourites for his. 
He even gave me a delicious wine pairing. 
As we'd finish one dish they'd clear and bring the next immediately which was great. 
The lag between the 3rd and 4th dishes was almost 20 minutes though and we didn't really want it at that point. 
Only the smallest disappointment to an overall amazing experience.Amazing experience, bone marrow is a must have!! 
If you have just one dish, this should be it, with the jerky a close second. 
The rest were awesome as well, with the exception of the beef shoulder which was just fine (tasted just like well cooked home prepared shoulder, nothing exceptional like the rest of the dishes).Read that there's a long line during busy hours so we came at 1730 and had plenty of room, though when we left there was a line forming, so if like us you hate lines be sure to come in a bit earlier since they don't take reservations.Located in an assuming place, which makes it evident that it's the quality of the food (and amazing and friendly service) that draws in the eager clientele. 
Sharing style (and even communal with huge shared tables) is heartwarming. 
Come with a warm and inclusive attitude, an open mind and palette. 
You will not leave disappointed. 
Had the bone marrow, octopus, fennel three ways, beets with goat cheese, duck prosciutto, jamon, pork and bacon pate and of course, the short ribs. 
Chasing it all down with their recommended wines and some bourbon. 
A good night in Chicago. 
Kessashun Arthur 1508034788This place has a very classy atmosphere and serves high quality sports bar dishes. 
It's apparent that they put effort into making excellent food. 
It's a good place to watch sports as well, but they don't show a very wide spread of games. 
Wonderful experience nonetheless! 
J G 1506387070I use to love this place. 
But after being served warm beers and not getting what I ordered I was severely disappointed. 
Told the staff nicely one bar back was sympathetic, but his manager offered no solution. 
I never complain about food service. 
But warm beers, bad service and over priced sum up this loud over priced locale. 
Maybe I'll give them one more chance, but I'm weary and perhaps you should too! 
Corey Becker 1505317528Seems a bit confused about what kind of bar it's trying to be. 
Kind of a jack-of-all-trades kind of place. 
Good for groups and watching sports. 
Good food, but not amazing. 
I would call it a safe bet for just about any occasion. 
Thomas O'Neill 1507911838Great bar for watching sports. 
They must have 20+ TVs and a wide open layout. 
Food was very good. 
Bloody Mary was top notch. 
Friendly staff and good service. 
Yogesh Patel 1501817671This place was extremely rude and very disrespectful. 
It was raining outside a lot, the bouncer asked me and my wife for our IDs, so I attempted to get our IDs out and apparently as I was getting our IDs out, we were "blocking" one of the doors while I was still trying to present our IDs, just like the bouncer had asked. 
The bouncer hastily pushed us in through the revolving door because apparently we were in the way and made a smart/rude remark as he hasted us through the revolving door. 
When I attempted to speak to the manager, the bouncer confronted me again inside and was extremely rude and aggressive with me and my wife. 
The owner/manager without question, failed to listen to my complaint about how his bouncer was too aggressive towards us and proceeded to ask us to leave without any reason. 
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
They are a disgrace to businesses and do not value their customers. 
I am ashamed that a place like this exists in such a modern and forward city. 
Please avoid this place if you have any questions about it's validity. 
You will not regret it. 
The pizza shop across the street is much more welcoming.A very nice downtown Chicago mall. 
Well designed and visually appealing. 
No one is rushing but seems to be moving fast. 
Good store offerings but not much of a selection of food variety. 
Remember they have Downtown prices that includes excellent service. 
Great Place For Selfie.Nice place. 
Perfect place for the slow day, "take your time" shopping. 
Prices aren't too bad, when one considers where one's shopping, and by that I mean not only the store, but downtown Chicago on Michigan Avenue. 
For the prices, however, I truly do wish I could find ANYTHING made in the U.S., or at an ally, but good luck with that anywhere I guess.I walked the area a couple time and saw lots the second time I hadn't seen. 
The place is packed with shops, stores, and restaurants. 
There seemed to be a lot of construction going on and the sidewalks were really messy. 
You have to watch out for the road material slung down with the intention of helping transition from places under construction and those not or the road. 
You could end up with tar all over your shoes. 
If you plan to use GPS to find a place you could have difficulty. 
It has difficulty because of all the tall building and multiple levels. 
It might be wise to get a map from the hotel too.It's a very beautiful shopping complex although the general attitudes of the staff could be better. 
Very metropolitan and a great selection of stores. 
A great general area for Chicago city shopping.I liked how this mall was built up instead of out.Visiting from Texas, it was different how this mall was elevated. 
I would prefer all malls be this way. 
Less walking and I am more inclined to spend money if I'm not tired ...Great place to eat , and hang out. 
Have not been dissapointed much at all. 
Family friendly bar / resteraunt. 
Recomended.On the hole .....it's a great place . 
Got tossed out for humping . 
It plainly states " No Humping " on the wall. 
My bad ........Let me start off first with the fact that I grew up in Alma and had been to this restaurant often back even back when it was called the Depot. 
I loved this place. 
Best restaurant in town...now skip forward many years, I moved away and came back to visit family for the 4th of July. 
My in laws and husband have NEVER been to this restaurant and we're eager to try it. 
So we go and order steak. 
We all ordered medium rare and my husband and I ordered sweet tea to drink. 
We got unsweetened tea, undercooked steak that was luke warm..like it sat on the plate for 20minutes before they served us our plates...we paid 85$ for our food only to be disappointed. 
I was very disappointed bc this place used to have great food and awesome staff. 
What happened?
Side note: glad to see they still had money on the ceiling!
Shrimp was good.  
Steak had alot of grisil hardly any meat.  
Great food and great service.I came with a group of 8. 
Derek served us without hesitation. 
I asked for an old fashioned, and it did not disappointment. 
Derek took care of us.  
He made the best old fashioned I have ever had. 
If I ever come back to Chicago,  I will absolutely come back to this bar.Awful service.  
No assistance or apology offered from manager.  
Spent over $500 on lunch for 7 people, never received part of the order.  
Were told 30 minutes after we ordered that they were out of mussels.  
So, like fools, we ordered the Benjamin burher($100) instead.  
This was not brought to the table for 40 minutes.  
Overall terrible experience.  
Would not recommend.Overpriced tourist trap that caters to unsuspecting yahoos who don't know any better.This place is a jokeCocktails are terrible The table was dirty wet and stickyWe had 3 different type cocktails  and all 3 were just disgusting Food: fries for 18$, server brought spoon for dessert without napkin and put it on the dirty table.Also ordered grilled octopus, it actually tasted pretty good but it was coldSo if you are looking for a place to make a couple nice pictures u can go hereIf you are looking for a restaurant don't ever go here, you will just wasted your time and moneyRelaxing atomsphere.  
We took our time and enjoyed the best view of the city - followed by Wednesday night fireworks. 
Our server was great, the food was great.  
Come to relax and "take it all in".I went there for the chicken wings. 
The wings are available  in different flavors and are crispy on the outside while juicy inside. 
I also ordered the artichoke dip...which had spinach and was creamy. 
I liked the dip because it was served warm!  
The ambience is very nice with pool tables, large tv screens,  and high stools to sit on. 
The service is also quite fast. 
Atmosphere a bit noisy but overall a neat place in the middle of Chicago's downtown.I love their garlic Parmesan wings! 
So so yummy! 
I only come here for that! 
I had a burger once and it was pretty good but the wings are my go to! 
I got them to go this time! 
The fries are yummy too! 
I'm super picky on my ranch also and this place's ranch is on point!
Very crowded for Monday Night Football, tough to find a seat, be careful of the prices for single malt, 15 year Balvenie cost $30 per glass. 
Tuesday night was much less crowded and we had dinner there, pub food at its best. 
If you're looking for a quiet comfortable place for a business meeting this place can work just don't go during a football game. 
Extra large selection of beers was a plus.Had a blast at this little bar after the Chicago Marathon. 
Great bar eats and such a cool place to hang out. 
Glad a friend told us to stop by here.Good food, great staff, vibrant atmosphere Bit strange everyone had to show id at the door but that must be the rulesThis place has great seafood. 
We have tried several things on the menu and they were all delicious. 
I wish that the dining experience was as good as the food is. 
Medal tables and paper plates, styrofoam cups and plastic forks and spoons. 
Oh well you can�t have everything , because the food kicks ass.It was great food, had to wait a bit, but it was an off day and they weren't expecting so many people, a person had called off. 
So it took a little longer to get our food. 
But we're were not disappointed. 
They didn't skimp, or cut any corners. 
The food was absolutely delicious. 
Ordering was easy, good selection to choose from. 
Ample choice of local Craft Beers. 
Food was delivered quickly by courteous server. 
I ordered the Sword Fish and enjoyed.I had often heard how good this place was and had to see for myself. 
We went on a Saturday night and we're quickly seated. 
The meal was good and I'll leave it at that.Food was absolutely delicious.    
Service was great.  
Everyone should eat thereWas just there last night for dinner. 
Service and atmosphere was great. 
I really like the openness of the place. 
Cubs game was on! 
Food is ok. 
Second time in a row my baked potato was over cooked and my ribs were dryer than the Sahara Dessert. 
I'll keep going back but hopefully the quality of the meals gets better. 
The food is pretty good and i never get bad service. 
Tim is an excellent waiter and the owners there are there regularly and interact woth customers. 
If they bring back the Guiness burger i can give it 5 starsAlthough, I only pop in every once in a while anymore, this used to, and always will be: "my spot"..amazing ownership/staff and some great friends have been made there, as well. 
Just miss my dart board haha..Waitressing was very pleasant. 
I come often with my relative as a nice lunch break. 
It may be tucked back, but I love it. 
Ive seen business meetings and family functions happen here. 
Very versatile and happy to serve people of all ages. 
Clean, irish-bar/restaurant setting with a fabulous menu of very well prepared cuisine. 
Sports or fanatsy football fans or those of the like would love it as well.Awesome food, lots of seating, super friendly staff and plenty of TV's if you want to watch a game while you eat. 
The bar is great too.I eat there every once in a while for lunch. 
The food is ok, with exception to the pizza. 
The pizza is really good. 
The service is good, and they are very friendly. 
Though for what you get is way to over priced. 
I would like to see what ever I order to come with a side and a drink included. 
Instead of ordering sides and a drink separate.  
For the price I paid here I could of gotten a better meal at a bigger restaurant.  
Still I have to say it is a better experience then going fast food.Customer for 10 years. 
On any given day until 2015 I would have given Tony's either 4 or 5 stars for their pizza. 
Starting sometime in 2016 their pizza dough changed. 
I don't know if it's their ingredients or preparation, but it's gone to hell. 
It is often as dry as dirt, and has about the same consistency. 
I had slices where the edge is separated from the underside of the crust, as well big dry bubbles cooked into the crust. 
Stick to the burgers, sandwich menu and pasta when you come here.I loved this place. 
Great food. 
I talked my husband into getting Tonys instead of aurelios pizza because they always forget something or screw up our order. 
And guess what so did Tonys today. 
Smh. 
I only placed 2 orders. 
And they forget the ranch dressing for the salad and my buffalo sauce for my chicken strips. 
They gave me credit because I was not going to wait another hour for the sauces. 
VERY DISAPPOINTING!
Great local pizza place, food is delicious, staff is friendly Great place to eat. 
Delivery is great. 
Great food. 
Prima Dagoddess 1504027908I had the Burger and Fries it was excellent. 
The establishment had an indoor and outdoor seating area. 
The lighting was gentle and it was truly an amazing restaurant! 
Sunny Amrat 1503488081Good food, but the vibe was totally dead, food was slow to arrive and the wait staff were slow to serve.  
Hannah Klein 1501856125Crowded with professionals from the loop very standard for the area. 
Food was just OK. 
Service was good.   
Ryan Fee 1493764903It's okay food and service.  
Nothing really stands out or is memorable.  
A good "normal food" type of place. 
Vincent H 1505597041Drink, food and service are good, though it can get noisy when crowdedGood service, nice atmosphere. 
Food is good and portions are big! 
Good for sharing and sampling different dishes.This place has decent food, but the service is s-l-o-w.  
Everytime I'm here our service is slower and slower and slower.  
If you have a couple hours to enjoy a long meal service, this is your place.  
Anyone else who expects dinner service to be shorter than a theatrical movie should steer clear.I love this place great local beer selection and the service is also always good. 
And the food is fantastic do yourself a favor and come here instead of where you were intending on going.  
Me and my girl favorite waitress is Jessica she is awesome ask for her!
Came on Saturday, Nov 3rd.  
Horrendous service.   1 waitress attempted to serve a whole room of lunch patrons.   
Waited forever just to get our drinks...... 
Uhgggg... 
Never againNot only do they have great beer on tap, they also have great food!  
A little loud at times but you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. 
It is a little challenging to hear everyone if you're with a group of people.If you open @ 11am....OPEN @ 11AM!!! 
I have had this issue with black owned businesses only. 
They just don't get the concept of CUSTOMER SERVICE!! 
Be ready to serve at the time YOU ASSIGNED or change it...period. 
But don't have your lips poked out when it's time to serve and you're not prepared. 
Not my fault. 
#UnprofessionalI've only been for lunch and the food is great, but you definitely should call in to order if you're going for lunch. 
Otherwise you'll wait a bit. 
Sometimes they don't have certain items prepared or run out, but overall haven't had a bad experience here.The Sauce is nasty and didnt taste like the regular uncle joes sauce and they didn't have anything.  
No shrimp,  no wings,  etc.Jerk chicken, fried cabbage & plantains for me! 
My aunt loves the fried catfish here. 
Always freshly prepared and I don't mind the wait.Great fresh food I always go at night. 
The woman at the window has a very sweet attitude. 
The only thing is they almost always get my order wrong in the back even though it's right on the receipt. 
As long as u check your food u will be good We had a really good time here. 
The band was really good. 
It's a nice place to relax and listen to live music with a drink or two.The tromboner alone is enough of a reason to come here (pun intended). 
But for real; the Bad Ass Company Band is phenomenal. 
The trombone player astounded me. 
After seeng several shows from Austin, TX to NYC I have never heard a trombone player rock like this guy. 
Keep it up. 
Cool place. 
Cover was a little surprising but as long as it goes to the band it's well worth it. 
Found this place by accident and glad we did.  
Great music and such a wonderful and welcoming staff.   
Ask Maurice for his signature drink, Spicy boat of love.Drink prices before 9pm were great for downtown!! 
Saw a few comedians performing downstairs and there was a stage upstairs. 
Couldn't tell if it was amateure or not but live performance regardless upstairs. 
Have to go againWe stayed at the hotel across the street so this place was very convenient.We walked over and asked what time they closed, they told us 4am! 
LolThey also wanted to charge us $5 to get in, i said no thanks we'll be back later....We tried the place on the next block which was chill.After we had 2 drinks there we decided to go back to the underground.All of a sudden they didn't have a cover charge.Friendly bartendersAwesome band.It's an original bar, apparently there's a hand full of bars that are allowed to stay open until 4am if they had a liquor license before a certain date. 
This place has history.JazzDrinksFriendly staffDescent drink pricesExcellent location, if you are staying around there. 
Located next to food! 
Also open late! 
John Hunter 1508953259Get yourself invited here, if you can.  
Rooftop is  amazing in the Summer.  
Highly professional and courteous staff.  
Amazing old school amenities Peter M 1504988432Great experience last night with friends for drinks, dinner & awesome views! 
Surprised to find so many vegan options & wonderful service! 
Mike Corrado 1504373551The dining hall is breath taking and they dont design Roman Gothic anymore as there's not many masons to perform the services required for the art work.   
Rachel Moss 1502077330GORGEOUS views. 
Hoping to have our wedding here. 
The library is beautiful as well. 
Robert Mitchell 1505168339Wonderful views and decor. 
Very nice with excellent amenities. 
Philip Smith 1507557445USA Family Restaurant is everything a small town diner should be: Lots of menu selections, very friendly service, and good food. 
There are no gimmicks here, and I've never seen this place without customers. 
The chefs are quick and get orders right every time. 
Paul Graefen 1506186642Good service good prices good food great pie LumberJackCole Briggs 1508772585Great place 10 minutes from me good food and friendly staff! 
GEORGE HARTLEY 1492893548Nice small town restaurant that has soups that go great with the dinner rolls they also serve (I usually ask for extra). 
It's a perfect place for a family meal. 
I'm a fan of their burgers, but they make so much more. 
My only warning is to make sure you save some room for dessert. 
Rose Bailey 1492891843This restaurant would've gotten a 4- or 5-star review, because the Reuben sandwich and potato salad was really yummy, but we were displeased with the steak fajitas. 
The meat was tough, and the meal came with only three tortillas, which was significantly disproportionate to the amount of fajitas on the plate. 
We asked for more and the waitress brought them, but neglected to mention that there was a charge for extra tortillas. 
We have never dined at a restaurant that not only doesn't provide all that you need for the entree, but also charges extra when you ask for it. 
Furthermore, this meal comes with chips and salsa, which we declined, so they saved money there. 
While the charge was only $1.69, the principle of the matter is that a meal should include all the necessary side items that accompany it. 
If you eat here, be sure to ask about hidden charges before you order. 
This was a great place to eat with a 2 year old. 
It's upscale but not stuffy. 
Our waiter, Richard, was great and so was everyone else. 
The kid's meal was one of the best. 
It came with veges, fruit, tater tots, meat and a cookie. 
My son loved it. 
Our meal was very delicious. 
We had the brisket, lamb chops and prime rib. 
All of it was juicy, well seasoned, and very tender!!! 
I wish they were in NYC. 
I would definitely come back again!!!
Visited tonight with a party of 10. 
The manage Daniel Was great in getting us seated quickly and the serve Matt was awesome. 
Matt juggled the entire tables needs effortlessly and spot on with all the requests.  
The food came quickly and was great. 
Everything cooked to order and so worth it. 
Not my first visit nor will it be my last.Another great experience at a Weber Grill. 
Andres was our server and did a fantastic job.  
He knew the menu inside and out, was attentive and creates a wonderful experience.  
The 15th Anniversary burger was amazing.  
My husband had a half rack of ribs and they were tender and flavorful.This was sadly my worst Weber Grill experience. 
I went several times in Indiana and loved it. 
I was assuming the quality would be the same especially considering the area. 
The mac and cheese seemed to be powered. 
I was very disappointed, but thankful that it wasn't my first experience with the company. 
The gentleman taking my order was nice but seemed a bit over the place. 
I would love a chance to speak with the manager regarding my food. 
I will update if I recieve a callGreat service. 
Food was excellent as were recommendations. 
I have milk allergy and they were accommodating. 
Kids meal presentation was thoughtful.This by far was a very delicious and well prepared dinner from the appetizer to the main course which was surf & turf (Alaskan king crab legs accompanied by 7 oz. Filet Mignon). 
Our waitress Barb was superior and was very knowledgeable of the entire and very helpful in selection of food from the menu. 
Me and my wife have dinned across America and this truly a REMARKABLE dining experience. 
Thank you all for making my wife's birthday a pleasant and memorable occasion.I'd say it's the most overrated corporate-run steakhouses I've run into. 
I've been here a few times over the years and have been caught off-guard by the lack of attention-to-detail, service, or food quality for the price their asking. 
I steer clear from this place nowadays and feel my money can be best spent elsewhere for a high-class night out.My boyfriend's friend recommended this place for us. 
The place is really small and dark but good thing that we got there in time, no wait! 
He ordered me the Scallop of the special and it was so so amazingly good! 
Felt like in heaven, ha. 
He ordered himself a Salmon and it was really good too.I ate there two days ago. 
Thought it was great prime rib. 
Until I started  feeling ill. 
I ended up with full blown food poisoning!  
I had diarrhea,  and sick all night long. 
I ended up in the E.R. they were going to put me on I.V.s because I was so dehydrated! 
Never again will I eat here! 
I only wonder about the other people that ate that night....  
My Dr. said it was most definitely  un safe food handling.  
Worst sick I've ever been in my life!!  
Yuck!! 
I hope you change somthing! 
Make better cooking choices!  
The only reason  you got one star, is waiter was awesome..One of the best dinning experience we've had in a long time.  
The food was excellent and our waitress was awsome.
Food not good at all if i live five minutes away from and my good be cold.
I can't believe y'all card me to use my damn debit card smfh who TF does that anymore smh dumbs down to that.
The wings are good but they take some time to make if there's lots of people.
A good popular place for a younger night owl crowd  good service.  
My wings were a little salty (lime and pepper flavored)but otherwise nice and comfortable.
They have one line for pick up and ordering...i ordered ahead to avoid waiting in line behind mofos who havent even made up their mind of what they want just holing up the line. 
They have one cashier taking phone calls and taking care of the guests in the place and this one guy also serves the drinks. 
Not a good spot, never parking i also had to park in double lane, horrible just horrible i waited in line for 10mins just to pick up and order i placed 15mins prior to arriving for pick up smh never again i mean i only paid like $27 something for food mind you when i called to order i was put on hold by this one cashier doing everything! 
Give the guy a break, get him some help! 
One of the first breakfast spots where I finally had a decent dish of crepes! 
The set up is a bit interesting since you pay at the counter after your meal. 
The wait can get long but if you show up Close to opening it is not much of an issue. 
Staff and quick and nice. 
I would just recommend taking care of the silverware and glasses a bit better, I wasn�t all that confident when I initially saw them, it�s all in the details. 
Otherwise, great place for breakfast or brunch!
We had breakfast here today, wait time, food and service were fantastic! 
We mistakenly got in the line where you pay but a waiter quickly noticed and took us directly to a table. 
As we left, there was a wait but they are fast so I'm sure it wasn't long. 
Selections were great! 
My daughter had the bacon waffles and they looked as good as they taste!
It's a good staple brunch place in Chicago. 
Pretty good food, not spectacular. 
Not overly priced. 
Expect a wait on nice weekends. 
Closes early so check hours before coming!
Delicious breakfast and lunch food. 
A wide variety of breakfast options, with a Southwest flavor. 
Everything seemed fresh, and the portions were generous. 
Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we never felt rushed even though the place was packed.Wow! 
Love the store baked challa bread for french toast. 
Crowds and lines let you know the food is top notched. 
Potato pancakes just right! 
Smiling happy service means happy employees which translates into awesome service experience. 
Permanent marked on my google map.
