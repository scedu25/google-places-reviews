Eclectic boutique hotel in the heart of Ohio Street. 
Old Chicago building so don't expect Holiday Inn sized rooms. 
Eatery and Bar in the lobby and a Starbucks just across the street. 
Comfortable bed and rain shower made for a nice stay. 
Neat and useful that they put Amazon Echos in the room with their own ACME skill too.This place is awesome. 
Won't stay anywhere else in Chicago! 
Cool rooms, super clean, outstanding staff! 
Have the coolest amenities like free coffee  delivery, Alexa in your room, awesome hot tub! 
And they are super adorable! 
Highly recommend you don't waste your time going anywhere else but here!
If you're looking for a hotel with a lot of personality, convenience and great service, this is it! 
The room had a funky retro rockabilly feel to it but still managed to remain unpretentious. 
Staff was very helpful and concierge was great! 
The only negative I found was a handful of cheerios under an auto man and a large bug of some sort that escaped before I could see what it was! 
Cute boutique hotel in a good location with rooms that were nice and clean. 
The staff was friendly. 
I agree with those that said the counter space was non-existent in the bathroom, particularly for 3 people. 
They could also use better and more lighting. 
Start by putting a better light bulb in the entty to room 1408.
This hotel was great! 
Friendly, helpful staff really showed and was the cherry on top. 
Little touches like rock music in the elevator, a guide on the TV (which had a really nice full HD picture), decorative art everywhere, creative door covers a for the ice machine, exits, and elevators, Alexa in the room, and second floor lounge also made our stay enjoyable.
This was a great location for a weekend trip to Chicago.  
Nice area for walking.  
Friendly staff. 
The pump room bar was a nice landing spot after a long drive.  
Lots of people hanging around and chatting. 
The room was great and quiet.  
Valet parking deals with your car.
From the perspective of a first-time Chicago visitor, this place was pretty great. 
It's clean, well-maintained, and reasonably affordable. 
It's a couple blocks from the L which will take you downtown. 
It's a slight jog over to the lake, which has access under the highway to a running trail. 
It is also a moderate walk (just being honest) or short Uber to some really popular restaurants and shopping. 
The concierge was great, there's a bar on the first floor that serves GOOD coffee in the morning (no, not complimentary). 
A good time was had by all.
What a great place! 
The area of the location (Gold Coast) is so nice, clean, and safe! 
Given our first visit to Chicago, we were impressed. 
You can walk to all the popular places in 20-30 min. 
The room in the hotel was small but enjoyable. 
The inside is glamorous and very welcoming. 
Overnight parking is around $60 a night so beware!
This hotel is so overhyped and overpriced! 
The rooms are dark and small and the view to the back is hideous. 
The wall-to-wall carpeting is disgusting. 
The only thing fancy is the accent lighting and the bath products. 
The bed is only ok level comfortable. 
Also, the shower is impossible to figure out. 
Would not recommend.
I was in town for the Chicago marathon. 
The Ambassador is positioned in an attractive area North of downtown with access to numerous transit options. 
The lobby had an interesting decor: modern amenities juxtaposed with classic architecture.Decent,  have petsPlace is ran down We had a whole crew stay here for a week and the staff was super helpful.  
They worked with us best they could with short notice and ave is a great rate on the room.  
Will definetly stay here again.
I wish i could give this place a big fat "0", bad service and no blankets!!!!!! 
all we had on the bed was a top/bottom sheet. 
When asked about blanket or spread they said non was available. 
The breakfast was BAD! 
The  only hot food sausage and gravy looked like it was in the pot for a day or so. 
I paid $75 through priceline! 
RIP OFF! 
Express deal. 2 and half stars. beware.Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Someone please burn this hotel down!!! 
Not familiar with the Chicago area and decided to find a hotel at reasonable price for the night around 99.00 a night!!  
Baymont Hotel is the worse hotel ever and in a really bad neighborhood  so beware!!! 
First off the room was hot air condition broke , mattress had blood stains all over it, bathroom dirty, walls very dirty, sheets dirty. 
We tried three different rooms and all was horrible!!! 
They refused  to issue a refund due to no refund policy. 
The pictures  of the hotel was very misleading!!! 
My guest and I took a loss and left hours after booking the hotel. 
We didn't even unpack our clothes and relax  before we ran out of the place. 
My advice never check into a hotel like this without looking at the rooms first before u sign anything. 
Health department seriously need to shut this building down NOW!!!!
I wish I could give this place 0 Stars. 
Don't stay here. 
I've stayed at this location several times for work. 
Most the time it smells heavily of Marijuana. 
This last visit It took me 45 minutes to check in because I was assigned to the wrong room. 
Then because of this issue I was given a "random" room check phone call at 4am.Never staying here again and no neither will anyone from my company. 
Please. . . 
Choose another.Friendly and helpful staff. 
Great hotel for the price. 
Convenient location!
As a family of 5, we go to Bengtson's every year, and every year we fall more in love with it! 
It's so fun, not only for the kids, but the adults as well. 
Do everything they have to offer, it's completely worth the money! 
This year we went on a day that had a little rain, and it was 2 hours before closing. 
There was practically No one there, which is AWESOME for us because no long lines to wait in for rides!!! 
So much fun! 
So glad we have this family tradition!!! 
Thanks Bengtson's!
The first time I visited Bengtson�s Pumpkin Farm, I was 11 years old and visiting with my Girl Scout troop. 
I still remember the hayride to the pumpkin patch; which has since evolved to a much longer, more leisurely hayride. 
Now more than 15 years later, I have enjoyed visiting the farm annually with my own children. 
I live for the moments of pure joy my children feel while at the farm and am so blessed to have captured many of those moments in pictures. 
I swear you can hear the laughter coming straight out of the pictures. 
Bengtson�s is so well kept and maintained; it offers plenty of fun for all ages and needs. 
The staff members are truly the cream of the crop! 
If you have not been, it is definitely a place you�ll need to add to your list BUT BEWARE...you�ll never be able to just go once. 
It is sure to become a family favorite and like ours, a tradition. ??
This place is awesome! 
I was here for like 3 hours and wasn't bored at all. 
There's so much to do here it was like six flags all over again! 
I would definitely come again. 
Everything is free except the food and drinks of course and that only $2-$5. 
They also had tacos pizza and BBQ. 
Not sure how much that was because we had ate earlier but it's nice to have a bunch of options. 
It was my first time and I had a blast. 
Also I'm 24 and brought my 2 friends, there was no kids with us and we still had a fun time.We are the ultimate Pumpkin Farm Junkies, we had gone to all the Wisconsin pumpkin farms and just wanted something different so after some google searching, we discovered Bengtson's and decided to try it out! 
After driving 2 hrs, we loved every second! 
The drive from WI was great too different scenery! 
My kids (5&10) both enjoyed it! 
Worth every penny- pictures are simply amazing with the background and such a great family friendly environment! 
Tons to do: animated characters, races, hay ride, corn pit rides, etc! 
Food prices are very reasonable for a family budget! 
Rides are unlimited, with  your entry ticket! 
We are def going to make this trip again!  
I 100% recommend this farm, if you haven't gone- don't miss out, you wont regret it! 
(p.s. they have the cleanest potter johns I've ever seen- always a plus in my book! 
?)
I took my girls here on opening day of this year, my daughter's had such a blast! 
It wasn't busy and we got to go on the rides many times and the employees were so friendly and because it wasn't so busy of lines they let the children stay on the ride to go on again! 
Very kind! 
The new cow ride omg it was a blast, I even loved it and I'm 30 :-) we went on that many times. 
The corn pit is so nice! 
I loved the lights inside, and the fact they had stairs to go inside of it, so much safer in my opinion. 
I love also, how you can sit on the edge if you want with your feet in the corn pit as you watch the kids. 
The food and drinks are at a good reasonable price! 
Medium size drink was like 2.50 that's a good price I'm my opinion. 
Their are many many things you can so their. 
For sure an all day thing! 
I'm totally taking them back again soon. 
Also it was nice having two train rides Now, especially when usually the train one is always long. 
So yeah I am so happy and excited for new things they did! 
So much fun!!!! 
???
The rooms are clean. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
Many employees seem to genuinely care about the guests. 
The breakfast is much better than most hotels and the rates are reasonable. 
If I am in this area again, I will definitely stay at this hotel. 
The only thing I don't care for is the location. 
It is on a service road along side the expressway and there is nothing around it. 
It just seems like an odd spot for a hotel.
Dear Manager of Best Western Southland ,I am sadly not impressed with this hotel. 
I have 3 complaints and these are major that need to get fixed as soon as possible. 
First The girl with the lip piercing and marijuana bag your housekeeper , serviced me nicely in my face , not knowing I understood Spanish BUT cause I am a Caucasian woman thought I didnt. 
Told one of your other housekeepers , the one with the BLACK long hair , skinny. 
That I was an "ugly" etc. 
And that I expected her to do S*** for me. 
That is most disrespectful and i expected better from these housekeepers. 
I would like you to handle this with her first and foremost. 
Second of all Sara my front desk assistant also thought I didn't understand and decided to talk about me to the other woman with the lip piercing . 
I dont like these under trained children working at this company . 
You need to get either A mature adults or B qualified and respectful workers. 
And finally my bedsheets were all dirty and not changed properly . 
There's was garbage shoved behind the MINI fridge. 
You need to hire a better housekeeping supervisor or fix it. 
Lastly you guys don't drain the pool all the way nor clean the hot tub fully . 
The breakfast made was chunky waffle mix that you guys made was not mixed well and not cleaned out. 
The bathroom was leaking.  
The Jacuzzi was broken.  
Thank you . 
I hope you learn from this review. 
And improve .Room was in poor condition mechanically. 
Broken slide lock, loose toilet seat, plugins were loose and didn't work on bedside lamp. 
Cleanliness was also an issue. 
Hairpin on floor, ice bucket not cleaned, bed cover looked dirty. 
Windowsill was also very dirty. 
One day a member of the cleaning staff left her spray bottle behind. 
Food ran out 30 minutes before breakfast time was over. 
The one bright spot was front desk staff were very friendly. 
Check in and out went smoothly. 
We were also offered a discount on our stay for the trouble which was appreciated.The BW Chicago Southland is a nice, clean place to stay.  
I stay here strictly for work purposes only.  
I'd like to see a tv in the fitness room and have it open 24 hrs as I am up early and the facility is not open.  
Good breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms, and a nice place to stay.This hotel has improved drastically. 
Comfortable rooms, microwave and refridgerator, breakfast, the staff, and the hotel was amazing.Very nice hotel for the price! 
Great day time employee/owner. 
Nice clean rooms with a great breakfast. 
If you stay awhile the employees start learning your names and become so friendly! 
We were very happy with our stay and definitely recommend this hotel!
Location is descent. 
Food is nearby, right off the main road running through Merriville. 
Rooms are small and a little on the low end side. 
Service is good, very nice front desk. 
No problems with service. 
Just have to upgrade and remodel a bit to make it up to date.Hotel was a little difficult to find but was conveniently close to the interstate. 
At check in, the woman at the desk didn�t really know what she was doing but was nice. 
At check out, the man was very helpful and had great customer service.The five start rating is for the hotel staff, mainly the woman named Carmen who works there. 
She totally saved my butt when I stupidly only booked 3 nights when I needed 4. 
She was so nice and totally understood my mistake and helped me out of my bind like it was no big deal. 
She deserves a raise. 
As for the hotel, it is nice as well. 
Decent breakfast in the morning, it has a fitness area, outside pool and free wifi. 
What more do you need? 
Seriously though, give that woman a raise. 
Will be staying here again.Pool was filthy and liner is old & wrinkled. 
Found rib bones with tons of ants around it on the pool deck. 
Pool is supposed to be heated, but was cold to me. 
Staff came to pool while I was in it and scolded me for not using pool towels outside. 
I had wrapped some of my room towels around me to go to the pool& was going to use them. 
Rates have been drastically increased. 
New management! 
Manager is only concerned about making money. 
He is never there. 
Others are running it in his absence. 
I had to argue to keep my regular rate. 
It took 4 phone calls. 
After my arrival, I asked if there would be a problem next visit with my rate. 
Basically, I was told only if they were not busy. 
I have a disability and need to use the whirlpool, jetted, tub. 
Previous owner graciously gave me a discount. 
New Manager was called and actually called me from his cell & said he would honor the rate. 
The man at the hotel argued with me about it for several minutes. 
Finally, he agreed to the rate for this time only. 
I have never had such a difficult time. 
Their King bed room is $20 more than the one by the interstate. 
There is nothing around them. 
They only have a small outdoor pool & no hot tub. 
The one by the interstate has a huge indoor pool with a hot tub by it. 
May have been my last stay. 
Really disappointed. 
I am a regular long time customer.This is a nice, no frills hotel. 
It's a 15 minute walk to Soldier Field , Field Museum and Sheds Aquarium. 
It's also walking distance to lots of good restaurants. 
Rooms are clean. 
My bed was comfy. 
With 2 double beds the room the room felt a little cramped but it is by no means a deal breaker. 
The room prices were the best I could find for a decent hotel downtown. 
There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. 
There is a small coffee maker in the bathroom which I did not use. 
There is a small bar and cafe downstairs. 
There is a Starbucks a block or two away. 
The staff was really friendly and helpful. 
I would definitely stay here again.We enjoyed a lake view room for one night at the Best Western, and had a great stay. 
Our lake view was truly that, overlooking Grant Park and the lake. 
The staff were friendly during check in, the room was clean, and the hotel looks recently remodeled. 
Comfy bed, big bathroom, great water pressure, etc. 
Comfortable and got a good night's rest. 
Did not use their parking or restaurant.I  have stayed here 2 X this summer and both time was treated wonderfully.  
Very nice rooms . 
Very close to all the sites. 
I  thank you for such a wonderful experience in Chicago. 
The staff seem to make you feel like family. 
I will be back. ??
Our stay here was very positive. 
The staff was very professional and informative. 
Our room was very contemporary and newly remodeled.  
The location was wonderful to access our destination. 
A great value for downtown Chicago.This hotel has an incredible price for the location. 
Finding close parking was a bit of an issue, but that's to be expected with downtown Chicago. 
The front desk staff were always super friendly. 
The building and rooms where pretty standard, nothing special.Such a beautiful ceremony! 
The banquet hall did an amazing job! 
Staff was on point all night! 
Bartender was very efficient! 
Service was excellent every step of the way!
Gurdie is rude... management doesnt return calls... room had no toilet paper only a few towels and smelled weird... rooms numbers were written on notebook paper and taped to the door.... ice machine was old and rusty... my room door was open when I got there maintenance needed to finish putting in filters in some of the rooms... coffee maker but no cups... shower pressure low... soap bars very small... needed new towels and bath mats those were very thin and had hairs in them still... shower still had some hair in itWe stayed here before flying to San Diego for our honeymoon because it was the most cost effective sleep & fly package I could find...next time I will spring for the more expensive option. 
We had to be given a different room right away because the key card lock was not working. 
We found roaches in our bathroom in the middle of the night. 
Breakfast was of very questionable quality. 
I'm giving two stars because the staff were really friendly and helped as much as they could, but I'd say just opt for something else.Horrible customer service!! 
We booked and got a hotel room and put our baggage in it and then when we came back there were OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR ROOM WITH ALL OUR STUFF IN IT!! 
And they made us change rooms instead of telling them to get out of the room. 
Now we have a flight to catch and they won�t recompensate us for their horrible services! 
The manger is also very rude and will not respond to Expedia or Best Western Corporate.For the money, I've been very satisfied. 
The staff is courteous and helpful, and have responded quickly to my needs. 
I'd rate it higher, but the building is being renovated. 
The transition has created almost no inconvenience, but it would be dishonest to compare it equally to a building not being renovated. 
I gave it 4 stars more on principle than dissatisfaction.This hotel was fine. 
It was nice to have meat and eggs at breakfast every morning. 
I had no problems with the wifi. 
It is near many other hotels. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. 
This hotel met my expectations for the price point. 
I give them three out of five stars because it wasn't quite as clean as higher priced hotels I have stayed with.From first welcome, to final checkout the staff and management at this property demonstrate a level of customer service much appreciated, but not frequently enough experienced at other locations.  
It is obvious from the manicured exterior, to the professional appearance and demeanor of staff, to the cleanliness of the rooms, to the presentation of the breakfast items that the aim of management and staff is complete customer satisfaction.  
Located conveniently off major traffic arteries, this property is also close to shopping and restaurants and proves to be a comfortable and reasonably priced stop over.  
Don't hesitate to stay there.Great staff.  
Clean rooms. 
Truck parking made easy.  
Good restaurants close by.  
Lets not forget pool and hot tubI will never go back to this Hotel again, Boiler broken no hot water on Saturday couldn't go swimmingSunday no coffee made at continental breakfast.They wanted to send us to another hotel just to take a shower  but who want to take their clothes from one place to another. 
We decided to microwave  us some hot water .They did offer any compensation but they took all our money. 
They could have offer to buy us lunch!!! 
. 
We was they for a girls retreat  but instead it was like one of their staff member said you guys paid to be in prison and no one cared. 
God has away of  letting you know they is no place like home. 
A  Saturday with no hot water paid for in full I could have stay home were the hot water was fine.I had car trouble a couple blocks away and was having it fixed nearby. 
The staff was so helpful the next morning, giving me and my baggage a ride to the autoshop when I needed it! 
And the accommodations were very nice too.Booked months ahead on Expedia for a excellent price. 
Just off exit 5 on 1-94, but winding road with no street lights to get back to it off main street. 
Check in was slow as it was that time of early evening. 
Room was clean, spacious, good working order of electronics, lamps, coffee maker, microwave and fridge.Bed was comfortable. 
Staff very helpful in telling how to get to places of interest. 
Breakfast was extremely good. 
Hot eggs and meats made everyday with a variety of cereals, waffles, muffins, breads, etc.After a 12-hour stay at the nearby casino my boyfriend and I were exhausted and didn't really want to drive back to Chicago. 
We found a Motel 6 that was our original destination but when I noticed a Best Western next door we immediately changed our minds!  
I'm glad we did!  
From the moment we entered their lobby I knew we made the right choice!  
Their front desk staff has service with a smile! 
He was really friendly and courteous!  
I couldn't expect more with the room -- comfy bed (and pillows) clean carpeting and housekeeping even checked in on us to see if we needed any additional services or items!!! 
This was by far the best hotel stay I've had this year!  
There's no doubt in my mind I'll be back!
Staff is very helpful and friendly. 
Clean rooms, towels were a little thread bare. 
Spacious room. 
Free breakfast was very good.There's only one washer that HALF the time works (if you sit on it). 
Also the front desk has a woman who is very RUDE to customers. 
She ALWAYS has to argue or 'correct' you if she thinks you're wrong. 
And always has an attitude. 
I'd give no stars if I could. 
DEFINITELY needs improvement on customer service skills and better maintenance on your laundry services.Megan and kyle are exceptional service staff. 
They did a awesome job of making my stay as comfortable as possible even though i had a few issues with my own company. 
They stayed patient and worked with me on everythingLocation, location, location! 
If you're going to a Cubs game and staying in Chicago, this is the place to stay. 
While it seems a little over-priced for what you are getting, the location makes up for it. 
It is under a 10 minute walk to Wrigley Field. 
When we weren't at the Cubs game, we were a 10 minute walk to the water. 
Spectacular water front and park system. 
We were also just a 30 minute bus ride into Chicago and the Navy Pier. 
There are local bike rentals and an excellent bike trail that goes for miles. 
The room was clean, but nothing exceptional. 
They have a nice patio out front to eat breakfast or have a morning coffee. 
The hot breakfast was really good and varied but the area where you get breakfast is small. 
If you pick a popular time to eat breakfast, you might be disappointed, as the room can only hold 4 people max. 
Bed was comfortable, the Internet was fast and overall it was a pleasant experience.We had a very nice king room with Jacuzzi. 
Well maintained & clean. 
Staff was professional and helpful. 
The free breakfast is great with awesome cinnamon rolls & coffee.Our party of nine stayed in two suites. 
Rooms were both roomy and fairly clean. 
Breakfast was great. 
We went to two Cubs games and were able to walk to both games. 
Neighborhood seemed very safe. 
Parking was extra but right next to the hotel and was inside/covered. 
Staff was friendly. 
Location was the big draw to stay at this hotel.The staff was nice but the hallway had holes in the wall, our room had holes in the wall a broken light and no outlet near the beds. 
And for being in Chicago in the cold fall we wanted a hotel with a nice hot tub. 
But it was broken every day we were there.This hotel is very clean and comfortable. 
Lovely, diverse residential neighborhood. 
We walked to local restaurants and to Wrigley field. 
Quick Lyft rides to Navy Pier and all museums. 
Enjoyed our stay very much. 
Hotel was also very quiet, never heard noise from anyone.Fantastic value for a prime location in Chicago. 
Walking distance to many major attractions and the inside was recently renovated. 
Nice clean carpets, new paint and comfy beds. 
Exterior still looks old and is in early stages on updates. 
Was not disturbed by noise and the staff especially the concierge were very nice. 
If you want a clean comfy spot in the heart of the city and don't want to bust your budget I would recommend a stay.This hotel was wonderful. 
The rooms were clean and spacious, staff was friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for exploring the shops and going to the Chicago Theater (all walking distance). 
We traveled with our children (ages 7 and 11) and they loved the pool.  
The staff went out of their way to make them feel welcome and gave us great tips for planning our weekend.  
We would definitely stay here again.Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. 
The restaurant connected to the hotel is great as well. 
Good food and service. 
We've been here multiple times and each time is a great experience. 
Location is very convenient for restaurants and shopping.Excellent property in the heart of Chicago. 
Just a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and the heart of Chicago river.  
There is a Chicago Trolley/Big Bus stop right by the hotel. 
Many great restaurants and local markets nearby.  
If you want to hear authentic Chicago blues, Blue Chicago is literally right next door to the hotel!  
Great music!!  
Hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating!  
Plan on staying here again during next visit to Chicago.Love this hotel.  
Will stay no where else in Chicago. 
Check in and check out was so easy.  
Price for in the city was great.  
Staff is awesome.  
Allowed early check in and held our bags after check out so we could enjoy almost two full extra days in the city.  
Pool was great.  
View from pool was awesome.  
Room service available, quick and fast and good.  
Staff is willing to help and give directions to where ever you needed to go. 
Suite was huge, bed was comfy.  
Housekeeping was great.  
Just an overall great experience.  
A++Stayed here 2 nights. 
I was very happy to be given a room really early on the day of my check-in. 
The room was nice and clean, very comfortable and well lit. 
The bathroom was kind of small but very functional. 
Perhaps the best parts of this hotel are its location and the terrific people who work for it! 
I'm definitely hoping to be back here if I'm in the area. 
Thanks so much for an awesome stay.My wife and I stayed here for a conference she was attending. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. 
The room was clean, but curiously designed, as we had to step up a couple stairs to go from the sleeping area to the closet and bathroom area. 
The bed was comfortable. 
Breakfast was good for hotel food, but the location, only a short walk from the stores and restaurants of Michigan Ave., was perfect.Stayed for one night. 
We arrived early on a cool and rainy day. 
It was so nice that the desk clerk waived the early check in fee. 
The staff we all very friendly and helpful. 
The room was spacious and clean.We loved out stay at Cambria Hotel & Suites - Chicago Magnificent Mile. 
The room and facilities were great. 
The staff was friendly. 
The location was perfect to the mile. 
We were able to access everything we wanted by walking. 
We would stay again.If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  
com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...I stayed here after attending a friend's wedding. 
I was very happy with my stay. 
The beds are super comfy! 
They are currently renovating rooms. 
We were in a room that wasn't renovated, but it was still very nice. 
Great water pressure, good toiletries, nice windows, and again super comfy bed! 
The rooftop is really nice too so I recommend checking it out!
Room was mostly clean and in order. 
Coffee machine in room looked greasy and was left full of water from the previous Tennant. 
Coke zero in pantry had expired 6mi ago.Bed was comfortable. 
Location is great. 
TV is good.This is a nice place to stay. 
I love the kitchenette in the rooms and the gazebo with gas grills. 
It is a good place for socializing with other guests. 
Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. 
Not a bad place to stay for an extended time.The baseboards in the room were never cleaned, and our room smelled of mildew. 
Wasn't too bad once your nose adjusted to it though. 
Staff was nice and friendly which is always a plus.Here on reservations made by a friend of the family. 
Fairly nice hotel, but one issue. 
Our air conditioning unit has mildewed. 
Aside from that, not badI recently stayed at the Candlewood in Merrillville, IN. 
Sadly, I was traveling for my father's funeral. 
They knew this (as I was probably crying when I made the reservation), they actually called me while I was on my way driving out of state to find out my estimated time of arrival. 
They wanted to make sure my room was available and ready prior to my arrival. 
The manager and staff were so kind and considerate. 
Even one of the cleaning ladies gave her condolences as I was getting onto the elevator one day.  
Thank you for all of your efforts to make my stay enjoyable given the circumstances.I also need to point out that they gave me a free upgrade to a full suite since the hotel was sold out due to outside events in the area. 
The rooms were very clean, well kept, and very well up-to-date. 
If given the opportunity, I will most certainly stay here again and will refer friends and family to you.  
Thank you again! 
Very restful! 
I'm impressed with their food service. 
Family friendly, and there's so many different outdoor activities. 
The lake, basketball, soccer, gaga ball, and 9 square! 
This is a campground with nice cottages and a very open clean air feel. 
Staff is very courteous and friendly. 
There are many activities, a lake, playground, basketball, volleyball and many cottages for all sorts of needs and guests. 
Beautiful place, welcoming staff. 
My grandson has attended the day camp four yrs in a row, he looks forward to it every year. 
So peaceful and the people here are great! 
Loved this place!
Mostly good. 
Room was pretty small but wasn't too cramped. 
We had to wait over 10 minutes for them to get us another pillow. 
When I asked for ear plugs at night they said they would send some up but when the guy came he only had a "sleep kit" which had a face mask, some tea, and a smelly oil, no ear plugs. 
Otherwise service was very good everyone was nice and professional.The room was nice and clean. 
Lots of little details that made our stay comfortable, like silverware and plates in room, microwave, as well as the free bottled water. 
The attached restaurant was delicious and room service attentive.  
Definitely worth what we paidIf you're on a business trip, this would be an ideal hotel for affordable prices. 
For a short weekend getaway this may not be the best option as everything around it is the financial district area. 
So weekend everything is closed. 
No fridge in the hotel room is a deal breaker for young families with babiesLocation is really great, close to everything you'll need. 
You can easily take the subway, rent a bike or even go walking to whatever place you want to visit. 
Our room was clean, the size was acceptable and there was a pretty complete kitchen in there. 
The Wi-Fi was not good though, there was no safe box in the room, the hotel does not offer breakfast and the lady who told us this was not kind. 
Fortunately, you�ll find a Corner Bakery pretty close to the hotel, which offers great stuff for your breakfast for a pretty decent price. 
Despite the mentioned lady, the hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is good.The staff was very friendly and very helpful. 
Check in was super fast. 
Room was a little outdated, but very clean. 
Bathroom was very clean as well. 
Bed was comfy, room was a good size. 
Would definitely recommend this place to stay. 
A quick walk to different shops and restaurants. 
Will for sure be staying here again. 
The issue people might have with this place is their expectations. 
This is a hostel, not a hotel. 
For a hostel, it is fine. 
A nice neighborhood but with plenty of food options within walking distance. 
The rooms aren't anything too special but they do the job! 
I paid $66 a night for a private room with a bunk bed in it and that's all I needed, no more, no less. 
Free breakfast was appreciated too. 
The only issue is that the bathrooms are shared but they weren't particularly disgusting or anything. 
Keep in mind that this place always has lots of guests who are all using the facilities throughout the day. 
Honestly the place is great for the price. 
Just understand what you're getting into. 
Maybe bring an extra pillow if you need more than 1 since my room only came with 1 pillow per bed.The hostel is located in a very nice upscale residential neighborhood. 
Free breakfast is included which consists of waffles, cereal, coffee and fruit. 
Lobby and dining room has modern furniture. 
Free computer use and printing by the main desk. 
Pool table costs $1. 
The community kitchen is quite large and includes all the cookware and supplies you could possibly need. 
There is community shelving for food and large fridges and freezers for guest storage. 
A few vending machines are located behind the kitchen. 
The patio looked great, spacious. 
Bike rentals are available for $15 for 3 hours or $20 for the day. 
Popcorn was available in the lobby. 
Laundry machines in the basement. 
Room was basic and clean. 
Shared bathroom included stalls and locked showers inside private stalls. 
One hairdryer in the bathroom.Nice place, historical, cozy, multicultural. 
You can bring your own food and cooking there. 
Nice seating and relaxing area. 
The beds can be improved. 
More blankets in the rooms and a deep clean in the bathrooms. 
Close to everything in town, you can walk and they have a parking available.   
Going back again...Beautiful building. 
Scary Shining like hallway, but fun if you know what I mean. 
Staff is excellent. 
Great knowledge of the area. 
Great suggestions on what to do.I am here now and I will definitely return. 
It is home away from home. 
People are friendly, personnel is experienced and good. 
Bathrooms are located a little bit far from our room, but they are clean and spact enough. 
There were toilet stuff to share like shampoo etc. 
In the evenings you can share a room with others and chat and play guitar or pool, or you can work with the computer. 
Bikes are available for rent at a good cost. 
Breakfast is good and we walked to Cloud gate by foot, so it is not far.
