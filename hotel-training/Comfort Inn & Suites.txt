Comfort Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Although I've stayed here before, this last visit was by far the best! The room we had was very spacious, including the bathroom. The bathrooms are usually just big enough to accommodate each guest. This one was big enough to sleep in if necessary. Plus it was not a handicap room!

Text: Great staff who were accommodating, warm and not to mention the fastest check-in we’ve had at any hotel or motel. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great with delicious and surprising additions to the standard Comfort Inn/Suites

Text: It was actually really good for the price even though we had four people and I ended up sleeping on a chair I still thought it was good. They had breakfast too Wich was pretty alright. Overall would recommend.
