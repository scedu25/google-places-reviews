Hilton Garden Inn Kankakee

Text: The hotel is alright but I'm not happy with the cleaning. The room I was originally assigned to had a dirty tub. It looked like dirty water had sat and dried in the tub. Front desk was very friendly and moved me to another room. This room seemed to have a cleaner bathroom. However this one now had a dirty pillow case. I understand makeup can stain (and I really hope it was a stain and not that they weren't changed) but it was fairly obvious. You'd think they wouldn't use it again. Restaurant is good. Pricey but that's to be expected at most hotels.

Text: Excellent customer service. My family & I experience a house fire and our insurance company set us up here. Everyone on staff has been absolutely wonderful. From managers, housekeeping, maintenance and front desk managers. EVERYONE has been very nice and accommodating to my family and I. Highly recommend for any occasion.

Text: Last minute decision to stay here due to traffic jams on I57. Got the last room due to same traffic jam.  Whirlpool tub had a weird shower. Otherwise great stay. Clean and comfortable. Comped breakfast by being a Hilton Honors member. Good value.

Text: The room was clean. The lobby was clean and welcoming. There were cookies and water laid out as you entered the lobby. The gym is small but adequate. The check in process was quite slow but it's understandable as there was an emergency of someone fainting and collapsing somewhere in the hotel. Overall it's a clean hotel and I'd stay here again if I need a hotel nearby.
