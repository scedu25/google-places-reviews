Hilton Chicago/Magnificent Mile Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Everything about my stay was wonderful. From the excellent customer service, to the beautiful room, was amazing. The bed was just the best! I slept the best that I've slept in a long time. The room was clean and beautifully decorated and comfortable. The views were amazing. And the staff was great.

Text: As always Hilton's in big cities are always  a hit! It can never be a bad choice at Hilton. Great location in downtown Chicago. The service here was higher than expected. Maybe because I'm from LA, and service in LA usually is not top notch. Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you're a Hilton honors member.

Text: Location is perfect for walking to Navy Pier and other sites. Close to some great restaurants. Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Only quibbles are no bathtub and the pool has no hot tub (but has a gorgeous view of the lake, and it's clean!) Service so far has been good. Our only interaction has been with the doormen/valet, all of whom greet us warmly.

Text: Excellent rooms. Clean. Some of it is still a little dated but overall very nice. The people were helpful and friendly. It was easy to get to and in a great location to get around to a lot of different things in Chicago. Many in walking distance. There is self park right down the street and valet parking also. It's not over the top and there aren't a ton of frills but it's really got everything you could need and the prices are very good too.

Text: Rooms are nice, renovated and very spacious. The lobby and elevators are old, but don’t let that scare you when you walk in. Also, you may want to bring your own blow dryer. The in room has one speed and will take quite a bit to blow dry your hair!
