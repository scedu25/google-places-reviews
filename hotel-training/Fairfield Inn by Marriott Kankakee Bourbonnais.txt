Text: I have been staying at this hotel for a while as a business guest. The recent remodel has freshend up the look and feel. While not a 5 star hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and always make you feel welcome. I always stay at this hotel when in Kankakee.

Text: Location isn't the prettiest town, but inside the hotel is amazing. Room looks great and they are currently doing renovations to make the hotel even better. Hot tub was not working so that was a disappointment, but the pool is still up and running. Overall great place.
