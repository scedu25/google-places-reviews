The Ivy Boutique Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: I booked here somewhat hesitantly after seeing a few pictures online that made the guest rooms appear small, but it was outweighed by the excellent location. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when we checked into our spacious, stylish and incredibly comfortable queen room. Not only was the room well-appointed, but the staff was professional, courteous, and went the extra mile in suggesting alternative rooftop terraces when they told us their terrace wad closed for the season. Best of all, I had one of the best nights of sleep I can remember and I am notoriously picky about mattresses. There's no doubt we'll be back on our next visit! Location, price, amenities, all exceeded expectations.

Text: Fantastic service! Rooms are sizable and ample, and the showers are pretty great. The daily cookie delivery is a nice, sweet touch. The staff was all very helpful and great to speak with and overall had no issues during my stay. Only downside was that the rooftop bar closed early on a Sunday, wish it was open longer!

Text: A very beautiful hotel with an excellent location in the heart of Streetorville. The rooms are beautiful and well appointed with exception of the damn ice bucket. The rooftop bar is very nice, beautiful view and a good pour for the money. Park your car yourself using spot hero as parking is about $60 if you do it through the hotel.There’s no pool or exercise facilities, but planet fitness is around the corner and they do give you a voucher for a yoga class if you’re into that thing.

Text: Attended a wedding here. Arrived a bit early, so went to the rooftop terrace. Drink prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago. Ballroom was nice for an intimate wedding, but food service was a bit slow during the reception.
