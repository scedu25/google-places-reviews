Text: I wish i could give this place a big fat "0", bad service and no blankets!!!!!! all we had on the bed was a top/bottom sheet. When asked about blanket or spread they said non was available. The breakfast was BAD! The  only hot food sausage and gravy looked like it was in the pot for a day or so. I paid $75 through priceline! RIP OFF! Express deal. 2 and half stars. beware.

Text: Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!Someone please burn this hotel down!!! Not familiar with the Chicago area and decided to find a hotel at reasonable price for the night around 99.00 a night!!  Baymont Hotel is the worse hotel ever and in a really bad neighborhood  so beware!!! First off the room was hot air condition broke , mattress had blood stains all over it, bathroom dirty, walls very dirty, sheets dirty. We tried three different rooms and all was horrible!!! They refused  to issue a refund due to no refund policy. The pictures  of the hotel was very misleading!!! My guest and I took a loss and left hours after booking the hotel. We didn't even unpack our clothes and relax  before we ran out of the place. My advice never check into a hotel like this without looking at the rooms first before u sign anything. Health department seriously need to shut this building down NOW!!!!

Text: I wish I could give this place 0 Stars. Don't stay here. 

I've stayed at this location several times for work. Most the time it smells heavily of Marijuana. This last visit It took me 45 minutes to check in because I was assigned to the wrong room. Then because of this issue I was given a "random" room check phone call at 4am.

Never staying here again and no neither will anyone from my company. 

Please. . . Choose another.
