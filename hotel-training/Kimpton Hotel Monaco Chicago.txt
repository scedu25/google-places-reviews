Kimpton Hotel Monaco Chicago
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed at Hotel Monaco this past weekend and it was everything we needed. Our room was cozy and the service is outstanding! However if I could rate the in-room massage experience it would be a 2. The massage therapists arrived 15 minutes late to start, and I left in more pain than before I started. The therapists performed very little of the deep tissue we paid for, instead taking it upon themselves to perform multiple chiropractic maneuvers that they certainly should not have been performing. Do NOT waste your money on this painful experience. I did not want my rating to affect the hotel in any way because the hotel and our room itself was exceptional.

Text: Stayed here for one night after flying into o'hare. Really nice staff. Wine hour is a nice touch: 5-6pm. Most of the rooms have huge cozy window seats about four feet off the ground. Makes you feel like a kid looking down over the river. Highly recommended.

Text: This hotel was great and I'm not quick to hand out 5 star reviews. Bed was comfy. Views were amazing g. Window seats were cool place to sit and watch the city. Sign up for their rewards and they give you 10 bucks to raid the mini bar or the bar in the hotel.
