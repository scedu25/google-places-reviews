Kimpton Hotel Allegro
Rating: 4
Text: We were greeted by very friendly doormen and lobby staff. They got us checked in very quickly and gave us details on lobby drinks, snacks, and bar hours. The room was clean and tidy, albeit a little smaller than most chain hotel rooms. The bed was very comfortable, the TV nice and big, and the bathroom was very modern and nice. Water pressure in the shower was probably the best I've ever had in a hotel. We loved the 12:00 check out time. This allowed us plenty of time to load up in the morning. My only knock on the hotel is that you can hear things outside the room quite easily. For example, we could hear the shower running in the room above us. We could also faintly hear the people talking next door. Overall, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. The location is wonderful - close to restaurants, coffee, shops, and within walking distance of Grant Park.

Text: Rooms are nice but bathroom is small.  Definitely only one person getting ready at the same time.  Beautiful lobby and stylish room.  Free happy hour drinks.  Great staff.  Good location.

Text: I stayed at the Allegro for my brother's wedding at a nearby facility. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful/resourceful. I arrived there a little after 1 and was concerned about an early check in because check-in is at 3 p.m. When I went to the front desk and gave them my name for the reservation, I was given a hotel key immediately. The room was very clean and nice. I really loved the decor. Checkout was quick and painless as well. The staff is very efficient and I tip my hat to management. I would definitely recommend their hotel. I will definitely stay here the next time I am in Chicago.

Text: Nice atmosphere. Room was relatively small, bathroom was crammed into the room. Undersized tub. Faucet was not tall enough for the wash basin, could barely get a glass under it to full with water for drinking, and it was difficult to properly wash hands under it. One elevator was not working, causing long wait times for the elevators. Location was fantastic, close to the train station, and right next door to the Cadillac theater where we went to a show.

Text: Boutique hotel in Chicago's theater district. Well appointed albeit smallish rooms. Definetely a somewhat glamorous retro vibe. Nice meeting and conference spaces and services. All gender rest room in common or public areas. Free coffee and tea in the mornings and a wine reception in the late afternoon. Many amenities done tastefully. Very helpful staff.
