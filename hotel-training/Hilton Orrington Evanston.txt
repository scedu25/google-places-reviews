Hilton Orrington/Evanston
Rating: 5
Text: This is a truly wonderful and civilized hotel with incredibly friendly and understanding staff. The facilities are all very well-maintained and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. 

It's located in the heart of downtown Evanston so everything is within walking distance.

A shout out to the front desk supervisor, Michael B. He's as professional and wonderful as it gets!

Text: This is a nice hotel in a great location, but the room we got was really really small. Like, it was comical that they even crammed a king size bed in there. I've stayed in tiny hotel rooms in NYC before, but this room was shaped on an angle, making it even tighter and more awkward to move around. The room had quality furnishings though and the staff was friendly.

Text: I only visited and not staid here. The lobby looks nice, the room I saw seemed small with the tiniest sink I have ever seen in a Hilton.
