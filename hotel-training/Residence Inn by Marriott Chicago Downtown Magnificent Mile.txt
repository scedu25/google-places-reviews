Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile
Rating: 5
Text: Location: right on the Magnificent Mile. It's at one far end of the mile so it's a bit of a jog to get around. Room: great overall. Clean, with a really nice kitchen. Service: amazing! Great staff and the very best breakfast buffet I've ever had!

Text: The friendliest staff, and very clean hotel. I have stayed with this hotel 15 times in the last 12 months for a total of over 25 nights, and have enjoyed every single night. My son looks forward to seeing the familiar faces as well. I would recommend this hotel to anybody.

Text: Nice location but very few outlets worked in our bedroom and breakfast was a disaster.  A sold out  hotel and they only have 1 person cooking and 2 people trying to clear tables and stock good.  There was no eggs, bacon, waffle mix, water,  bread/pastries, forks, etc.  The breakfast area was full and 20 people waiting 20-25 minutes for food to be restocked.  I would not stay here again.  The front desk was very nice and helpful when we checked in but when I sent them a. Chat about breakfast, no response, and then when I told them the issues in our room and breakfast when we checked out, there was zero interest.  Pretty sad.

Text: Clean, spacious rooms. Very accommodating to all of our requests. Easy to get to with convienant valet parking (we have a toddler and a lot of luggage). Overall, a great stay so far.

Text: Fantastic Service, clean and very spacious rooms, fairly quiet area. Good deal using Priceline. A few blocks walk from the north part of the "Magnificent Mile" which was very nice. Definitely would stay here again.
