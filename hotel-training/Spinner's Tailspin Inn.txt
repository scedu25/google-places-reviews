Text: Three fourths of the patrons were smoking  leaving an impression of nasty  (Non smoking municipality.). Bartender greeted me with her cigarette in hand, and did not know the types of beer on draft. 
My clothes reeked after a single beer And I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 
Felt I was imposing & intruding rather than enjoying a new place. 
There are several cleaner friendlier places a few seconds down the road.
