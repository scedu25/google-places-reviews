Red carpet inn

Text: This was the worst motel we have ever stayed at. Zero stars.  The beds were sagging a full foot, roaches were running around, and the tub/shower hot water had no handle.  The shower head was shot and the tub drain cover was not attached and floated away from the drain. Additionally the shower walls were stained and had what looked like mold in the corners. The tub was also stained with rust color.  We would have taken a different room,  had one been available. Someone was supposed to come over and fix the shower handle,  but never showed up. Luckily I had a pair of vice grips in my car. The bottom line is that I will never stay at another Red carpet inn. And will recommend the same to anyone else. I rated one star, only because this post would not allow me to pick zero.

Text: Overall it was decent for the price paid. I wish I could say it was good but essentially you get what you pay for. That said, the manager was very friendly and helpful.

Text: Disgusting but it was 2 am I was driving with my kids and it was raining. I hydroplaned a couple times so had to stop somewhere. Sign says $28 conveniently they didn't have a non smoking single so instead of offering a smoking one he did a double and charged $50. There's bugs crawling in the tub. TV remote doesn't work. Room smells. But like I said had to stop
