The Westin Chicago River North

Text: Rooms are nice. Location is great. Just don't expect courtesy after you leave. I left a device in my room. Contacted them 4 times trying to get someone to retrieve it for me. No response. A month later, they said they would check the room. OF COURSE, after a month, my device was gone. An apology in their much delayed response sure would've been nice!

Text: Fantastic hotel, fantastic view, fantastic room!! Love it, I got a corner unit that give me a great view of the river, super cool! The check in staff was friendly. Hotel even has an executive lounge for platinum members which is rare in Westin. Convenient to a lot of local stuff and close to the business district as well. Will definitely recommend and come back.

Text: Checked in for our one year anniversary. Staff was very courteous. Hotel was clean and we'll maintained. River view is at an angle, but nice. Pillows are all very soft and none were even close to firm. Valet is $62 per night, but there isn't too much parking around there.

Text: I don't know how a hotel that charges more offers less. No complimentary wifi. Happy hour drink prices are double what a restaurant charges for top shelf drinks. Room was clean and spacious. Toilet ran all night.
