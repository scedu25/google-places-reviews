Text: Great hospitality! Which is hard to find these days. We stayed at Super 8 the night prior and paid what we had paid for two nights there very affordable. And after staying at Super 8 we were worried about the environment from our experience at Super 8 but it was terrific nice quiet no complaints we actually felt safer there than we did at Super 8 thank you for the terrific stay

Text: If you come to the Family Inn expecting the stereotypical hotel feel of today's society this is not the place for you. But if you want a vintage experience that takes you back to the family road trip vacations of the past then you are in luck with this place. The owners are a wonderful couple that accommodated us when we had to come to the tiny town of Watseka unexpectedly for a family funeral with a tight budget. They even called the morning after our first night to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed. While the rest of my family set up at the run of the mill Super 8 just down the street for $80 a night,  my kids and I got to experience the historical, old time feel of real hospitality at the bargain price of a two night stay for $100. I have a lot of family in this area and this will be our home away from home every time we have to come into town. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I don't want to give people unrealistic expectations because of some of the conditions of this historical building, but we were comfortable and felt very safe here.

Text: If you are looking for old time courtesy and customer service then FAMILY INN, Watseka must be the choice. The property is old no doubt but the manager couple surpassed our expectation of good service with flying colors.

Our room was basic but very clean with nice soft linens. Bed was firm and comfortable.

With room rates so low - 70is and 80is era! - there is nothing to write bad about our experience. Will recommend them in a heart beat!
