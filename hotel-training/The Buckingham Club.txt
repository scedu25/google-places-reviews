Text: Very upscale. Gorgeous room's with huge windows. They got us a reception room for our family reunion to have pizza. The room was unreal wide open and very relaxing.

Text: The hotel was very hard to find and even when we did we couldn't tell until talking to front desk. Once we got to the room and understood the layout, everything was great! The room was clean and the view was phenomenal! The view is worth the stay and the club is just bonus. The mini bar was not over priced and the water pressure is good with warm water. Room is somewhat dated but bed is comfortable. We will definitely stay here again if we stay in Chicago!!

Text: Everything was excellent. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms clean and comfortable. Really my only complaint was that the remote didn't control the tv, only the cable box. We will definately stay here next time we are in Chicago.

Text: It was a little confusing at first to navigate your way around but once you've done it twice it becomes easy. Rooms are spacious and clean nice view of the city. Staff was friendly and courteous.

Text: I stayed here for 4 nights and would absolutely recommend it. The rooms are on the 40th floor and I believe all the rooms have amazing views as mine sure did. The location was perfect for getting to all the major tourist attractions. Subway station is literally around the corner. Bed was comfy and apparently they have an awesome gym available for guests.
