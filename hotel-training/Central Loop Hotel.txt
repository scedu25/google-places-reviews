Central Loop Hotel

Text: Mostly good. Room was pretty small but wasn't too cramped. We had to wait over 10 minutes for them to get us another pillow. When I asked for ear plugs at night they said they would send some up but when the guy came he only had a "sleep kit" which had a face mask, some tea, and a smelly oil, no ear plugs. Otherwise service was very good everyone was nice and professional.

Text: The room was nice and clean. Lots of little details that made our stay comfortable, like silverware and plates in room, microwave, as well as the free bottled water. The attached restaurant was delicious and room service attentive.  Definitely worth what we paid

Text: If you're on a business trip, this would be an ideal hotel for affordable prices. For a short weekend getaway this may not be the best option as everything around it is the financial district area. So weekend everything is closed. No fridge in the hotel room is a deal breaker for young families with babies

Text: Location is really great, close to everything you'll need. You can easily take the subway, rent a bike or even go walking to whatever place you want to visit. Our room was clean, the size was acceptable and there was a pretty complete kitchen in there. The Wi-Fi was not good though, there was no safe box in the room, the hotel does not offer breakfast and the lady who told us this was not kind. Fortunately, you’ll find a Corner Bakery pretty close to the hotel, which offers great stuff for your breakfast for a pretty decent price. Despite the mentioned lady, the hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is good.

Text: The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Check in was super fast. Room was a little outdated, but very clean. Bathroom was very clean as well. Bed was comfy, room was a good size. Would definitely recommend this place to stay. A quick walk to different shops and restaurants. Will for sure be staying here again.
