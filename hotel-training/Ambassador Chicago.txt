Ambassador Chicago
Rating: 5
Text: This was a great location for a weekend trip to Chicago.  Nice area for walking.  Friendly staff. The pump room bar was a nice landing spot after a long drive.  Lots of people hanging around and chatting. The room was great and quiet.  Valet parking deals with your car.

Text: From the perspective of a first-time Chicago visitor, this place was pretty great. It's clean, well-maintained, and reasonably affordable. It's a couple blocks from the L which will take you downtown. It's a slight jog over to the lake, which has access under the highway to a running trail. It is also a moderate walk (just being honest) or short Uber to some really popular restaurants and shopping. The concierge was great, there's a bar on the first floor that serves GOOD coffee in the morning (no, not complimentary). A good time was had by all.

Text: What a great place! The area of the location (Gold Coast) is so nice, clean, and safe! Given our first visit to Chicago, we were impressed. You can walk to all the popular places in 20-30 min. The room in the hotel was small but enjoyable. The inside is glamorous and very welcoming. Overnight parking is around $60 a night so beware!

Text: This hotel is so overhyped and overpriced! The rooms are dark and small and the view to the back is hideous. The wall-to-wall carpeting is disgusting. The only thing fancy is the accent lighting and the bath products. The bed is only ok level comfortable. Also, the shower is impossible to figure out. Would not recommend.

Text: I was in town for the Chicago marathon. The Ambassador is positioned in an attractive area North of downtown with access to numerous transit options. The lobby had an interesting decor: modern amenities juxtaposed with classic architecture.
