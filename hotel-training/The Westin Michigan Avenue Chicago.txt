The Westin Michigan Avenue Chicago
Rating: 4
Text: A nice, clean, hotel in the heart of Michigan Avenue. The nicest most professional staff you could ask for. They were able accommodate our request for a conjoined room, however we were not able to check-in at the posted check-in time. The bellhop staff was incredibly kind and helpful with a baby needing constant entertainment. The sheets were a little rough. The coffee shop staff in the lobby needs some training.

Text: Location central to shops and eateries. Staff very friendly and accommodated my early check in request. Room was modern but bathroom seemed a bit small...though the rain shower head was awesome!

Text: The room was nice, bed was very comfy, and everything appeared to be clean and in good shape. There's not much more you can ask for. I also appreciated the 3pm checkout time and Starbucks voucher for eschewing housekeeping.

Text: We had a beautiful room with a view of the lake. Rain shower and Starbucks coffee in the room, and a full service Starbucks in the lobby. The concierge was helpful and and bellhops willing.
