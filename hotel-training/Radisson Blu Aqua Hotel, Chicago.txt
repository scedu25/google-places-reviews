Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel, Chicago

Text: This is a great hotel in the middle of everything! There's a nice sitting area downstairs off the lobby, a fun and modern bar/restaurant, and a nice outdoor pool with a running track around it! We stayed in a king bedroom with a balcony which was great. The floor in our room was pretty! The bed was comfortable, ample enough TV channels, a nice desk, a comfortable chair, and an ottoman. The bathroom was interesting, there were two sliding doors - one to enter the bathroom and one to enter either the shower or the toilet (it rolled back and forth between the two). 

I highly recommend asking the concierge any questions you have about the area. They were so helpful! The front desk was also helpful in anything we needed for our room!

We were celebrating my birthday in Chicago, so my boyfriend called down to ask if they had a slice of cake with a candle for a birthday...they said they didn't have a slice of cake but had something similar. Within 5 minutes, they came up with this beautiful small dessert with a candle and a happy birthday message on the plate. It was delicious!

I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely look forward to another stay. Thanks for making my birthday fun, exciting, and comfortable!

Text: All of the staff members are delightful and helpful. The rooms are pretty and spacious. I love the shower head that's pointed straight down so it's similar to rain. The rates are incredibly fair considering the quality. I didn't use the indoor pool and hot tub but the outdoor pool, child pool, and hot tub are amazing. I recommend staying here if you ever need a hotel in this area!

Text: Great location, excellent service. Attended a conference and chose this hotel as the home-base. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff is kind. Would definitely recommend to others and would like to return.

Text: I really enjoyed my time at the Radisson Blu. I was attending as a speaker at a conference at the hotel and was very impressed with every staff member that I encountered from the bellboys at the taxi stand all the way to the waiters and waitresses serving dinner at the event. I was also impressed with the catering around the event and the restaurant in the hotel which I believe is called Fellini's. On top of it all the architecture of the hotel is spectacular and the location perfect.

Text: This was a super nice hotel in a great spot. We walked from millennium station, checked it, and the walked to get dinner. The staff was very nice and even though we were not dressed for such a fancy hotel (we were in hoodies and jeans) they treated us no different than any one else.
