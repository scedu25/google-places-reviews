Raffaello Hotel

Text: The location was great. Only 1 block off of Michigan ave. The room was very spacious. I would stay here again. The only cons were the room could use some updating and the elevators are tiny (not really that big of a deal though, in my opinion).

Text: Would recommend only if interested in history of hotel. The lobby is very small and in a constant state of chaos. You do receive help with your bags when you arrive. Only one doorman assisted with cabs. The bed is wonderful and the bath is beautiful. If you have bad knees you won't be comfortable with the rest of the furniture as it sits very low. The air conditioner sounds like a jet taking off. The kitchen light fell down and 3 days later when we left it was still down. Too many quality hotels in Chicago to stay here.

Text: Fantastic location with a lovely rooftop bar. The room was large, clean, and quiet. Also, for you tall travelers, they had a very tall shower and it. Was. Glorious.

Text: I have stayed in many hotels from California to New York ... this hotel was endearing and had personality but I would like to say for the 360 some dollars I spent to stay here for 1 evening (while working ) I was not happy nor was I comfortable! I was greeted by a pile of ants in the bathroom and after my shower I almost fell down because the entire bathroom was so slick , no exhaust fan no shower curtain so there was water flowing over the entire floor and the bed was seriously the most uncomfortable bed I have EVER slept in in my entire life !!!! I have worked in places all over the entire United States and this was seriously close to the worst ?. I NEVER write reviews but I cannot believe the amount of money I spent on this hotel and the serious lack of convenience or cleanliness was horrific.
