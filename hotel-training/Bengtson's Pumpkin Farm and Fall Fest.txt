Bengtson's Pumpkin Farm and Fall Fest
Rating: 5
Text: As a family of 5, we go to Bengtson's every year, and every year we fall more in love with it! It's so fun, not only for the kids, but the adults as well. Do everything they have to offer, it's completely worth the money! This year we went on a day that had a little rain, and it was 2 hours before closing. There was practically No one there, which is AWESOME for us because no long lines to wait in for rides!!! So much fun! So glad we have this family tradition!!! Thanks Bengtson's!

Text: The first time I visited Bengtson’s Pumpkin Farm, I was 11 years old and visiting with my Girl Scout troop. I still remember the hayride to the pumpkin patch; which has since evolved to a much longer, more leisurely hayride. Now more than 15 years later, I have enjoyed visiting the farm annually with my own children. I live for the moments of pure joy my children feel while at the farm and am so blessed to have captured many of those moments in pictures. I swear you can hear the laughter coming straight out of the pictures. Bengtson’s is so well kept and maintained; it offers plenty of fun for all ages and needs. The staff members are truly the cream of the crop! If you have not been, it is definitely a place you’ll need to add to your list BUT BEWARE...you’ll never be able to just go once. It is sure to become a family favorite and like ours, a tradition. ??

Text: This place is awesome! I was here for like 3 hours and wasn't bored at all. There's so much to do here it was like six flags all over again! I would definitely come again. Everything is free except the food and drinks of course and that only $2-$5. They also had tacos pizza and BBQ. Not sure how much that was because we had ate earlier but it's nice to have a bunch of options. It was my first time and I had a blast. Also I'm 24 and brought my 2 friends, there was no kids with us and we still had a fun time.

Text: We are the ultimate Pumpkin Farm Junkies, we had gone to all the Wisconsin pumpkin farms and just wanted something different so after some google searching, we discovered Bengtson's and decided to try it out! After driving 2 hrs, we loved every second! The drive from WI was great too different scenery! My kids (5&10) both enjoyed it! Worth every penny- pictures are simply amazing with the background and such a great family friendly environment! Tons to do: animated characters, races, hay ride, corn pit rides, etc! 
Food prices are very reasonable for a family budget! Rides are unlimited, with  your entry ticket! We are def going to make this trip again!  I 100% recommend this farm, if you haven't gone- don't miss out, you wont regret it! 

(p.s. they have the cleanest potter johns I've ever seen- always a plus in my book! ?)

Text: I took my girls here on opening day of this year, my daughter's had such a blast! It wasn't busy and we got to go on the rides many times and the employees were so friendly and because it wasn't so busy of lines they let the children stay on the ride to go on again! Very kind! The new cow ride omg it was a blast, I even loved it and I'm 30 :-) we went on that many times. The corn pit is so nice! I loved the lights inside, and the fact they had stairs to go inside of it, so much safer in my opinion. I love also, how you can sit on the edge if you want with your feet in the corn pit as you watch the kids. The food and drinks are at a good reasonable price! Medium size drink was like 2.50 that's a good price I'm my opinion. Their are many many things you can so their. For sure an all day thing! I'm totally taking them back again soon. Also it was nice having two train rides Now, especially when usually the train one is always long. So yeah I am so happy and excited for new things they did! So much fun!!!! ???
