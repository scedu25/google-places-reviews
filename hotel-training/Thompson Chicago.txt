Text: Beautiful hotel. Location was good, but I was most impressed with my corner room. Gorgeous views of downtown and the lake, tastefully furnished with an amazing bathroom-I was definitely happy. My only complaint would the price of overnight valet-$68! If I hadn't arrived at 11PM in a rain storm i would have figured out self parking, but I bit the bullet and paid the price. Overall though, I was very happy and will stay there again when I get the chance to come back to Chicago

Text: Went for a wedding. Absolutely beautiful venue, delicious food. Cash bar and drinks were $14, even beer, which was outrageous. Wedding block rooms were $250 after taxes, which was also pricey but more expected I'd say. We heard rooms normally are around $370, which is too much.

Text: “Great Location, beautiful hotel”
This hotel is in a great location surrounded by restaurants with outdoor seating that are open late on a warm summer night. Also at the end of the Magnificent Mile and a short drive to other sights. The hotel itself feels intimate and classy. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Service was great. I highly recommend.
