BEST WESTERN Grant Park Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: This is a nice, no frills hotel. It's a 15 minute walk to Soldier Field , Field Museum and Sheds Aquarium. It's also walking distance to lots of good restaurants. Rooms are clean. My bed was comfy. With 2 double beds the room the room felt a little cramped but it is by no means a deal breaker. The room prices were the best I could find for a decent hotel downtown. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. There is a small coffee maker in the bathroom which I did not use. There is a small bar and cafe downstairs. There is a Starbucks a block or two away. The staff was really friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: We enjoyed a lake view room for one night at the Best Western, and had a great stay. Our lake view was truly that, overlooking Grant Park and the lake. The staff were friendly during check in, the room was clean, and the hotel looks recently remodeled. Comfy bed, big bathroom, great water pressure, etc. Comfortable and got a good night's rest. Did not use their parking or restaurant.

Text: This hotel has an incredible price for the location. Finding close parking was a bit of an issue, but that's to be expected with downtown Chicago. The front desk staff were always super friendly. The building and rooms where pretty standard, nothing special.
