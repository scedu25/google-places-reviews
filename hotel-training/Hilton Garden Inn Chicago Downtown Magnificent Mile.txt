Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is updated and clean. Our room was a suite and it was very spacious and had a mini fridge (no freezer), coffee maker, and plenty of counter space. The living area was very nice, too, with a couch and chair and a couple of benches. We had a great experience except for the fact that, despite us making a conscious effort to keep it down during later hours, we got several noise complaints, including one while we we're sleeping at 6am!!?! I felt as if we were targeted because they knew we were with a group. One time they threatened us with a $2000 fine, which I felt was unprofessional especially since several of the noise complaints may have actually been caused by another room but blamed on us. I'm guessing the walls here are just paper thin. Despite these complaints we liked the hotel based on the room itself and its proximity to downtown locations.

Text: Prime location in the middle of downtown Chicago: a 5 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile, 20 minute walk to the Bean, and there's an L station right down the block. Room was clean, and had good amenities (mini-fridge, microwave, safe, USB charging ports on the lamp, in-room wifi). The shower heated up quickly, which helped to thaw my frozen toes after doing all kinds of touristy things in November in Chicago. The wall unit heater worked quite well, heating up the room quickly. Front desk staff was super helpful with food recommendations and directions, and responded quickly when I needed extra blankets in the room (I wasn't quite prepared for the Chicago cold!). Overall, I'd happily stay here again if I'm ever back in the Chicago area.

Text: Nice room, clean and quiet. We had issue with our heater which was quickly fixed-staff was very helpful and apologetic. Very convenient to Subway. Would stay here again.

Text: Overall, we had a pleasant and comfortable stay at this hotel. The location is good, downtown, just a street off the Magnificent Mile. The room was clean and with a modern decor. The kids enjoyed the pool. I knocked off and star for the staff at the reception when we arrived; very rude and not welcoming. Oh, our room was equipped with a fridge and microwave, which was convenient for keeping a few snacks.

Text: Stay was pretty great overall. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, but I had a few problems. The beds were hard and the pillows disappeared when you laid your head down. The hot tub was also cold for one of the nights I was there.
