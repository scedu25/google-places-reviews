The Drake, a Hilton Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: I recently visited the Drake Hotel for a professional networking event, and from the moment I walked in, I knew that they had selected the perfect place. As soon as I approached the doors I was welcomed by the people at the front, and they guided me to the direction of the event. Upon entering the room, I noticed the immense detail and quality of the hotel. The cleanliness was incredible, the carpet was soft and comfortable, and the chairs and upholstery matched very well. At the same time, the air was cool and relaxing. At the event, the hosts were very friendly and willing to go out of their way to make us feel welcome.

Text: Very nice and fancy hotel. Lots of crown molding and carpeted floors. Flowers in vases in the lobby with plenty of bellhops and front desk assistance. Rooms were elegant and very nice. A great hotel with the feeling of the 60s or 70s. Not a modern hotel but very nice.

Text: We stayed at the Drake for three days in Sep 2017. The room is big, clean and cozy. The decoration is really classic. The bathroom is clean. The bed is really soft and comfortable. The house keeping service and persons were nice and welcoming. We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea at the palm court. Except that I hope there is more room in the fridge within the room for the customers to store food and having microwave in the room, the overall experience is excellent.

Text: I visited the Drake for a friend's wedding. The interior of the hotel is gorgeous, and its ballrooms are stunning! A perfect venue for a grand wedding. It also has the most adorable gift shop with unique seasonal decorations. Highly recommend this place for locals and for visitors.
