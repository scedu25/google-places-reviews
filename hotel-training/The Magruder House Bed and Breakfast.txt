The Magruder House Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The Magruder House and Burr Oak Bed and Breakfast are two very nice, relaxing bed and breakfasts in a historical area of Kankakee.

The hosts Kyle and Scott could not have been more nice and provided numerous ideas for sights to see in the area. 

Both of the properties (next door to each other) were well decorated, very clean and the breakfast was wonderful.

We stayed in the Burr Oak which has a slightly more contemporary feel than the Magruder House which is more victorian / traditional. Both properties pay attention to details with a great selection of bath items, bottle water, sodas and snacks including microwave popcorn were provided. 

Within a short walk of the bed and breakfast are two original Frank Lloyd Wright homes, a nice park and a great retro rootbeer stand. Downtown Kankakee with a great, small railroad museum is a short five minute drive. If you have a boat their is a launch nearby on the Kankakee River. 

I would highly recommend this bed and breakfast when traveling to Kankakee or looking for a weekend escape only about an hour from Chicago.
