Silversmith Hotel

Text: The rooms are nice and full of accommodations. We're talking a fridge, a safe, the simplest a/c. Things have been real quiet especially considering that it's so close to the El railway. People are cool behind the desk. I saw someone withhold a star because the people at the check in desk didn't wave to them everytime they came and went. I get it, but the desk isn't that close to the elevator that it required that level of acknowledgement so frequently. The location is good. Its safe and has so many places to eat. It's also a small block or two away from the best and cheapest parking in the area. It's also close to many hotels like the wit, and some other places.

Text: Spent five nights here while attending a conference. The property was very nice, with a modern, but slightly art deco vibe. Staff was friendly and helpful. AC and plumbing were new and worked great. There are no views from room windows.  EL train runs above Wabash Street in front of the hotel, but once inside the hotel you would not know it. This is Chicago.!! Good food just down the street in either direction.

Text: This hotel is quite nice with a lot of space and two televisions. Great service at the front desk. I stayed here with my wife who had it for work.  I think they cater to corporate clients and search. Very nice bar but nobody there usually.

Text: Had a very nice stay this week. Big comfortable.room. Great location. Upscale without being too pretentious. 
Would give it 5 stars but one of the front desk women we had to deal with a couple of times was unneceasaruly short when we checked in and seemed unhappy every time we walked by her and said hello. The rest of the staff were friendly and attentive.
