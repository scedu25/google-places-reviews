Cambria hotel & suites Chicago Magnificent Mile

Text: Stayed here 2 nights. I was very happy to be given a room really early on the day of my check-in. The room was nice and clean, very comfortable and well lit. The bathroom was kind of small but very functional. Perhaps the best parts of this hotel are its location and the terrific people who work for it! I'm definitely hoping to be back here if I'm in the area. Thanks so much for an awesome stay.

Text: My wife and I stayed here for a conference she was attending. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean, but curiously designed, as we had to step up a couple stairs to go from the sleeping area to the closet and bathroom area. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast was good for hotel food, but the location, only a short walk from the stores and restaurants of Michigan Ave., was perfect.

I stayed here after attending a friend's wedding. I was very happy with my stay. The beds are super comfy! They are currently renovating rooms. We were in a room that wasn't renovated, but it was still very nice. Great water pressure, good toiletries, nice windows, and again super comfy bed! The rooftop is really nice too so I recommend checking it out!
