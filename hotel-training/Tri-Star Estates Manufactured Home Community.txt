Text: I’ve lived at Tri-Star in the past and made a lot of memories there. Since moving back here a year and a half ago and I've noticed Tri-Star added the basketball courts and upgraded the parks and is a great addition for the kids here. Tri-Star Estates is a very family friendly environment with a lot fun activities for the whole family to enjoy year-round at the clubhouse. I am very happy with living here and would recommend moving here!

Text: I would give it 5 stars if the home we are renting was fully done, but they are keeping us informed about everything. The process was very easy and quick. The maintenance response is great too. We are loving our new home and neighborhood. The neighborhood is very friendly and welcoming.

Text: My wife and I came into Tri-Stars Estates on September 5 , 2016 to look at some homes they had on line and the sales people where VERY knowledgeable and we're very understanding of our needs.  We did buy a home for ourselves and our 8 and 10 year old and have been here for 3 months now and are very pleased with ALL the office personal, management. The kids love in here.

Text: Rude staff, & The absolute most in organized office/ administration I've ever seen. Constantly miss informed. Haven't even been here a year, and plan to move as soon as lease is up! I've never known a leasing company to be so unorganized and apparently according to management, the front office and back office were telling people two different stories about our lease agreement and miss informed us. Now we're stuck here until December. Terrible. If you read other reviews, you will see this has been an ongoing issue. Don't waste your money and time to be scammed!

Text: Properties are to small.  Neighbors can see in your window if the blinds are open.  There is no privacy.  It is clean and? neat also a park and pool.  Also offers a place for private parties.
