Text: Could not be more happy with this place. It's clean and neat. They handed me a free newspaper,hot coffee, fruits,waffles and bottled water. They gave me an extra oversized towel and free snacks. They gave me a great deal. I felt safe and comfortable. All the help were so polite and sweet. I would live here if they let me.  Out right perfect stay and I have stayed at many different places and these guys understand hospitality

Text: The reason why I gave it a 2/5 is because, all of the hotel doors would not shut, we had to pull the door as hard as we could to shut it. #2 is, we had to get a new key every day, and on one of our last days we got locked out of our room and the whole 3rd floor was friends of ours and they were locked out as well. We got front desk and they had to get a wire to open the door from the inside. Another thing is that the pool and workout room is tiny. One of the many other things is that the room is tiny and I have a family of 4 and we could just barely fit. Breakfast was delicious though! The staff members were nice ?!
