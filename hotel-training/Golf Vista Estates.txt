Text: The rent keeps going up,and up.They do nothing for you. You take care of your lawn. They DON'T shovel snow, or put salt down. Many empty lots. They brag about activities but that is not done by them. It is provided by the great people who live here. If you want to use the clubhouse. You have to provide your own insurance. What a joke. The golf carts stop on the course. The battery's are ancient. Think twice about golf vista
