Text: Sybil working the front desk on Sept 18 was amazing.  Kind, polite, cheerful and welcoming.   This woman is a shining example of perfect customer facing personality.  Next time I come back here she better be running this place or at the very least have a giant raise to show for her hard work and incredible efforts at flawless service.

Text: Really felt like I wasn't in joliet with how nice this place was inside. Super clean and extremely friendly staff. Rooms were spacious with a lot to offer. Hidden gem in such a crumby city.
