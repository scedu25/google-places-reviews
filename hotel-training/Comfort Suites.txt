Text: It was really nice! I had my son's birthday party there. It was a pool party. They were under construction or remodel but they were super great I couldn't use the breakfast room for cake and pizza so they let us use the pool room as long as we cleaned up after ourselves and one of the guys doing the remodel gave my son five bucks for his birthday which was really nice of him. Super great stay and I'd do it again! Awesome!

Text: Concerned at first because of the carpet debris thrown into parking lot and in front of building, but they are just remodeling and making effort to improve the place. Kids enjoyed clean pool, breakfast was fully stocked even with a lot of guest checked in, quiet rooms BUT THERE IS A TRAIN TRACK so be prepared for train noise. We would stay here again.

Text: Comfort Suites was perfect for my needs. The rooms were large (had 2 queen beds and a pullout couch) and clean. It was close to the casino and just off the highway. I was helped in a very friendly manner and they were very hospitable. They also have a very nice pool and hot tub.

Text: Nice rooms, decent pool area. We stayed in a double bed suite and it was clean and comfortable. Friendly, accommodating staff. Good selection for the free hot breakfast. Workout room was cramped, but did have a treadmill, elliptical, and free weights.
