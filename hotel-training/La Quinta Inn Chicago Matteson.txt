Text: Was in town for business.  Stayed at this place for a week.  Nice new rooms, clean beds, towels etc.  From what I am being told, they have renovated this place inside out and lobby reno is in progress. Would definitely recommend this place if someone is looking for clean new rooms and a friendly staff.  Gerry was amazing and helped us with local food options and places to go nearby.

Text: Staying here for a couple of nights for work.  Lots of construction,  1st room I went too had not been cleaned, 2nd room AC not functioning, finally got into a room after 1/2 hour run around.  Staff are good.  We have a corporate account and direct billing,  and this is the first time we required a credit card for a $100 damage deposit at a La Quinta.   Guy sleeping in parking lot in his car all afternoon and night is interesting.
