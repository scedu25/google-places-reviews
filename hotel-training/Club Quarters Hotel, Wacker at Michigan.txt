Club Quarters Hotel, Wacker at Michigan
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. It was easy to find. The staff was very accommodating. The first night there was a slight buzzing noise in our room that we determined was the mini fridge. Since we didn't need the fridge they sent maintenance up to unplug it for us. We did not at first have enough wash cloths for two people in the room, but they brought us up some upon request. There was coffee in our room, but each morning we took advantage of the lounge's coffee, tea, fruit and granola bars. In the afternoon there was soda, candy and various trail mixes available. The bed in our room wasn't the most comfortable but was fine for two nights. We also really appreciated the complimentary bottled water stations on each floor. Overall, especially considering the price, we were extremely happy with out stay here and would definitely return.
