Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago-Downtown
Rating: 4
Text: Great location. There are so many things to do right outside the hotel. The staff was great with no issues with the room. The room itself didn't have a fridge and the water pressure was kinda light. Other than that is a good room.

Text: Nice, comfy and clean. Guest services was professional and polite. Good spread for comp breakfast. Easy access to shopping, dining, etc. Just bring your earplugs if you're not used to sleeping in the city- some nights can be a little loud outside!

Text: We traveled to Chicago for a mini getaway from 8/09/17 - 8/11/17.  Although we've stayed in many luxurious 5 star hotels, Hampton Inn never disappoints and Chicago-Downtown was no exception. The front desk and housekeeping staff were amazing and our king suite was lovely.  If you're willing to sacrifice a skyline or water view, then I highly recommend this hotel. The amenities and comfort make up for the view.

Text: Location was right around everything. Uber in and out or walked with my kids. Service was friendly and the breakfast was good. They have a decent workout room and a nice pool with sauna. We would stay again.
