Text: Disgustingly messed up drug/bug infested. Stayed here while waiting for my house to be ready worst mistake of my life. Kmeg and DCFS need to kick doors down. The office doesn't give a damn what goes on rooms are horrible of your not hearing people fighting you here them having sex weirdos hanging out outside banging on your door all night long. Lord don't smoke cigarettes they will come at you like roaches for one.... This place needs to be shut down how can this place remain open... BBB needs to do something asap
