Chicago Parthenon Hostel
Rating: 3
Text: This hostel is ok. It's cheap and is located near the Willis Tower. You can easily reach downtown Chicago by foot. The staff is friendly, too and the breakfast which is included in the price is totally fine. The cutlery and coffee cups could be cleaner. It is also not very cool that it isn't possible to lock the toilet doors and that the toilets and showers are in one room. But if you only stay there at night it's ok.

Text: Not very clean. Super thin walls. I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the bar three floors below. No individual control over air conditioning. Over-priced and they charge for everything. They even charged $2 to watch my bag for a couple hours. I'm glad it was only two nights.

Text: Good location and price. However, the two single bed room I booked had a couple Maintanence issues, including 2 electrical sockets with exposed wiring, the walls and ceiling are looking a little worse for wear, with some water and physical damage. The first floor women's showers did appear to have a mold issue. That said, I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.

Text: Worst hostel ever. Unfriendly staffs and misleading room sizes from description. On top of that, they have only one Men's toilet for an entire floor. There is always a queue in front of the toilet. What an horrible experience for a group! Breakfast is so poor as well. You can get a cheap hotel with more amenities at the same price. Feeling so regretful
