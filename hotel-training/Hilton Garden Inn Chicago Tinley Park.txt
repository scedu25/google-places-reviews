Text: Bad bed. Cannot believe what lousy mattresses this hotel has. Very disappointed.  Also a great deal of noise and commotion from other rooms during the night. Cancelled rest of our reservation.

Text: When we first checked in with the wedding party the hotel stated they had a zero noise policy. At first I laughed and thought we will see about that. They explained that the lobby and courtyard can be used and that noise was acceptable in these areas. This policy actually made the time spent there more enjoyable for everyone who went.

The breakfast was amazing!!

There was a guest in our party that checked into the room for 2 nights but ended up leaving 2 hours after check-in because she was going into labor. The hotel allowed the guest to checkout and comped the entire cost of the room with no hassle. Great customer service.
