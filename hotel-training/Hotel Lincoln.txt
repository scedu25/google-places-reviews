Hotel Lincoln

Text: Location fantastic! Room overlooked Lincoln park. Close to great eats and bars. Fantastic check-in staff, personable and full of life. Not your typical boring fake nice. Valet quick and easy. Room neat and clean. 10 out of five stars!

Text: Had a very nice overnight stay. Room was cute: very nicely decorated, contemporary, clean, everything you needed, nothing you didn't. The heating unit, however, was very loud and squeaky in our room. We weren't able to run it at night because it was so loud. That aside, I really liked it. The hotel was located right next to the zoo and waterfront. Great restaurants nearby. I would go back again

Text: Clean and comforting. Staff members were welcoming, conversational, and hooked us up with an upgrade without being asked! The rooftop bar is a great place to have a few adult beverages with some amazing views of the city and lake to bask in.

Text: The front desk people were just very lovely & the cleaning staff are very sweet & helpful. The beds however, are not the comfiest. Plus when we were done for the night & going to bed the tv kept cutting out, remote wouldn't work. Plus didn't even have half the stations listed. You can hear the toilets from other rooms as well whole you try to sleep. Other than that pretty nice.

Text: Valet service at the door, front desk is extremely friendly. The hotel itself is dated but charming. Rooms could be a little bigger but not a problem, watch the shins on the bed as the mattress doesn't fit the platform bed.
