Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile
Rating: 5
Text: Six of us stayed there for our annual girls’ weekend and we are not easy to please.  The rooms were comfortable, spacious and the view of Lake Michigan was terrific.  The service was top notch.  A special thank you to Renee at the front desk who sent us a nice note with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese.  The location was excellent too.  We would all highly recommend this hotel.

Text: We stayed in room 1015. It was exceptionally quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. Parking is confusing at first, but once you locate the Embassy entrance coming and going is easy. The pool was nice as well. The staff at the desk was helpful and friendly. We will stay here again. I would have preferred more water pressure in the shower, but it would not keep me from staying here. The pull out bed was comfortable for our son. We also loved the extra sink in the bedroom.

Text: The location is excellent. It is within walking distance to shops on Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park area. The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were very clean. They have a great happy hour where you get 4 free drinks each night from 5 to 7pm and they have snacks out. They lost a star because they have satellite tv... which means when it's too windy or raining then you can't get any TV. Considering thus is Chicago and they are right by the river, that doesn't seem very smart.

Text: Very convenient location, couple blocks from Michigan Ave shopping one way, about half mile from Navy Pier the other direction. Nice parking ramp and Whole Foods store across the street. Rooms are very spacious and clean. Great free breakfast. Stayed 2 nights with my family of 6. Just what we needed. My only tiny complaint was that while at breakfast, we were approached by someone trying to sell Hilton Honors program for discounted future stay rates. Maybe a good deal, but felt awkward.
