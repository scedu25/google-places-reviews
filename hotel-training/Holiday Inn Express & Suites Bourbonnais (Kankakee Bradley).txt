Text: Came here to swim with the kids. Usually have good luck with holiday inns. The pool had mold or some kind of organic material growing in it. Very gross.

Text: Nice, clean.  Soft mattresses.  Polite staff.
Blinds/curtains don't close fully - makes it difficult to get a good night's sleep

Text: Location was great, close to all the food choices and away from the highway. Rooms are dated but my king suite was quite spacious. Service at check in and check out was great. Breakfast was great as always. Some usb hubs by the bed would be great

Text: I booked a non smoking room online. When we got there the room smelled overwhelmingly of smoke. I talked to the lady at the front desk and she claimed to not know anything about it. The other rooms that were nonsmoking had a sign on the door. Ours did not so i knew it wasnt a nonsmoking room. She gave us febreeze. She said housekeeping would use a machine to draw out the smoky air. It didnt work. When we checked out we mentioned it to another staff member. He told use the rooms used to be smoking and were recently converted to nonsmoking. He even took a little off our bill for the inconvenience. But I was disappointed that the first employee basically lied to us and wouldn't admit those were smoking rooms up until recently.
