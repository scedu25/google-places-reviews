Text: I had the skirt steak. It was presented very well and had good flavor.. A couple of suggestions. I would slice the steak before serving and suggest it be cooked medium for maximum tenderness. Also the Third Star sign should be more elegant. With these suggestions and a small candle for each four top I would give it 5 stars!

Text: Staff was friendly, professional and quick. Gym was nice, full of machines, and clean. Wish the rooms had refrigerators instead of coolers although there is an option to call and have the service provided for a refrigerator, but i did not want to put forth the effort. Walking bridge to the convention center is perfect. Room service always came earlier than estimated (a plus when you're hungry). Enjoyed my stay.

Text: Average hotel, annoying that doors don't close behind you all the way when you leave the room, have to pull them shut, house keeping did a poor job cleaning up and 2 days in a row couldn't think to remember bringing more shampoo and body wash. Lastly the third star restaurant has good food but service in both of our tries there was slow and sloppy with the staff forgetting our requests

Text: Nice hotel if staying near the conference center. The room was clean and had nice amenities. Great shower. Hotel restaurant had good food but was expensive and not much else around the hotel. Not close to the city center.

Text: This is a great hotel if you're in town for a conference at the McCormick center. The hotel is directly across the street from the center. The rooms are spacious and the staff is very accommodating. You're a short ride from downtown and there are many options for food in the area. I would definitely stay here again.
