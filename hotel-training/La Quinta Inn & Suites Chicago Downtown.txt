La Quinta Inn & Suites Chicago Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed one weekend night in the fall. The room appeared to be either new or it was recently renovated. Plenty of power outlets and charging ports in the room for our numeral mobil devices. The shower is hot and strong. Breakfast is included. I don't mind that they checked everyone against their list to make sure only registered guests get to enjoy the breakfast for free. The hotel does not own any parking facility, but there is a public parking garage next door. Due to the garage and hotel are on an one way street, you will need to drive around two blocks from hotel to the garage. Walking from hotel to garage however only takes a few steps.

Text: Location was great. 15 minute walk to millennium park. The rooms were in great shape very clean. Really appreciated the free WiFi. Also had free breakfast, which was quite good. Staff was very friendly. Self parking was very close but pretty price. The great price we got on the room made up for it!

Text: Amazing experience. The room is was fantastic, modern fixtures and vibes. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, bringing bags to the room, giving directions, etc. came here with our cats and had no issues. The price was amazing as well! Perfect location. I would come back in an instant!!

Text: Good rates for Chicago. They remodeled and there is no longer a hot tub or pool. This changed since I booked and was a surprise to me when I checked in. I booked here for the price and hot tub. Otherwise, remodeling does look good. Breakfast is smaller now, too. Very limited compared to before.

Text: This was a great hotel to stay at for our weekend in Chicago. It was very nice, the street it is on was really quiet - something I wouldn't have expected in Chicago! The staff were great. Breakfast was really good. We would certainly stay here again!
