Text: My husband and I went here for the first time for our fifth anniversary in 1994.  It was wonderful.  We were unable to return for 20 years.  For our 25th anniversary we returned and were absolutely delighted to see it was exactly as we remembered.  A third cabin had been added and the owners had built a new home for themselves but we stayed in the same cabin we stayed in for our fifth anniversary and while we have grown up and changed it was so much fun to compare the two trips.  We were able to return one more time for my husbands birthday for a total of three trips to this wonderful place.  Unfortunately, my husband passed away two weeks ago at the tender age of 50.  I will treasure the memories.  If you have a chance, come to this charming, private, memory making place for two.

Text: From the moment I walked in I was breathless..... My finance led me to believe we were taking back roads to bypass I-65 to head to Indianapolis for an overnight stay.  Never in my dreams did I think she had this planned.  What a beautiful resort.  Your own pool, hot tub and sauna, and water bed with a mirrored canopy right in the private of your own room.  Very spotless and if you forgot anything at home it was provided for you.  Very nice and polite owners 'Terri and Lou' ...Couldn't ask for nicer people.... thanks Lou for the door to door directions.... We will definitely be back.

Text: I went here on my wedding night. It's beautiful and the owner was happy and friendly. I just wish the waterfall in our cabin wasn't set on a timer. Since our reception didn't end until 3, we didn't get to enjoy it. I would LOVE to go again sometime. :)
