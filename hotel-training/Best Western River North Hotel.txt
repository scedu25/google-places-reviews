Best Western River North Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: Fantastic value for a prime location in Chicago. Walking distance to many major attractions and the inside was recently renovated. Nice clean carpets, new paint and comfy beds. Exterior still looks old and is in early stages on updates. Was not disturbed by noise and the staff especially the concierge were very nice. If you want a clean comfy spot in the heart of the city and don't want to bust your budget I would recommend a stay.

Text: This hotel was wonderful. The rooms were clean and spacious, staff was friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for exploring the shops and going to the Chicago Theater (all walking distance). We traveled with our children (ages 7 and 11) and they loved the pool.  The staff went out of their way to make them feel welcome and gave us great tips for planning our weekend.  We would definitely stay here again.

Text: Excellent property in the heart of Chicago. Just a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and the heart of Chicago river.  There is a Chicago Trolley/Big Bus stop right by the hotel. Many great restaurants and local markets nearby.  If you want to hear authentic Chicago blues, Blue Chicago is literally right next door to the hotel!  Great music!!  Hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating!  Plan on staying here again during next visit to Chicago.

Text: Love this hotel.  Will stay no where else in Chicago. Check in and check out was so easy.  Price for in the city was great.  Staff is awesome.  Allowed early check in and held our bags after check out so we could enjoy almost two full extra days in the city.  Pool was great.  View from pool was awesome.  Room service available, quick and fast and good.  Staff is willing to help and give directions to where ever you needed to go. Suite was huge, bed was comfy.  Housekeeping was great.  Just an overall great experience.  A++
