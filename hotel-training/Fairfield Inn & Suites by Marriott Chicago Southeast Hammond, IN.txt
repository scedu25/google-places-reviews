Rating: 4
Text: This is a very nice hotel for an overnight stay. The rooms are clean and what you would expect from a Marriott. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast area was large and there was a good variety of items. Would definitely return.

Text: Room was clean and tidy. Bed was comfy and the shower better than expected. Staff were all friendly and courteous. Even with brewing convention attendees staying in the hotel, it being by a highway and railway line it was quiet and peaceful. Would happily stay again if in the area.

Text: Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Convenience of being right off the interstate however be aware that you can somewhat hear the interstate traffic. But not really much the hotel can do about that, to be fair. I would recommend this hotel. Close to the casinos and they have a shuttle.

Text: Bed was comfortable but the room had an unusual smell to it. Wasn't overpowering but noticeable. Staff was friendly and pricing was reasonable.

Text: My room was not initially provided with a spare sheet and blanket for the futon, but the staff quickly provided me with the items when asked. The blanket did have a hair on it that did not resemble mine. The room and complimentary breakfast were both very nice.
