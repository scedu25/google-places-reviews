Text: After a full day of work and a 20 hour drive, we had the pleasure of sleeping next door to a room full of children. The second night, we were awoken by two people fighting in the hallway all night. Then awoken again by the cops beating on the doors. Then awoken AGAIN by the front desk person. The bed was seriously uncomfortable and the people throwing each other into our door, WORST hotel i have stayed at. Management was aware of the fighting and the cops, but still refused to give any sort of credit for the inconvenience of spending the weekend there and having to drive the 20 hours home to Florida with NO sleep. I will NEVER let anyone i know stay there.  If you are down for midnight drunken fights and dealing with cops, go ahead, but never again will i stay in this nightmare of a hotel.

Text: This hotel is cozy and the management nice, I would stay at it again if I have to.
The gym is not really a gym, but is better than nothing. Nice indoor pool and a decent breakfast. My room was clean and very comfy..

Text: Stayed here for a couple nights for work. Overall I really like the place. The beds are incredibly comfy and the staff are friendly. The breakfast is the same breakfast you'll find in most hotels. And the WiFi isn't the best, but it gets the job done.
