Comfort Inn
Rating: 5
Text: One of the nicest and well-constructed Comfort Inns that we have stayed in recently. Notice the seal on the door in the picture to help make the place quiet. In addition to the standard eggs and sausage this location also had biscuits and gravy.

Text: Comfortable and clean room. Good hot breakfast. Friendly staff. Be careful if you use the pool area as the tile there is VERY slippery. Not sure why it's not textured... it seems like it would be a liability.

Text: The hotel was sleek and modern. The rooms were big and spacious with modern decor. The beds are super comfy. Has a clean feeling environment. I would definitely recommend. Only thing was the town surrounding smelled like cow ploppies.

Text: Fantastic and cheap place to stay if you are driving through this place. During our countrywide roadtrip this turned out to be one of the nicest places. Clean cozy rooms and good breakfast !
