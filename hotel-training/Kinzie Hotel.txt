Text: This place was very nice, friendly helpful, and clean.  When me and my family went to have dinner at the Sullivan's steakhouse around the corner, they called and told the restaurant a heads that we were coming and gave us priority seat and a free appetizer ?? the Staff was always helpful and available. They have a nice gym area. I love the art that's in the building. Overall I enjoyed my stay?

P.S.
For all those people who just wipe the seat down and then sit on public toilets,  please stop that!!!! Even the cleanest looking toilets will welcome the dirtiest guest and all of their bugs and nastiness!!!!

Text: This is by far the best Hotel experience I have ever had in my life. From the moment I arrived to check out, I could not have asked for better experience. Spencer from the front desk was very charming and made me feel welcome. The ambiance of the hotel is very modern and hip, great happy hour, location is amazing and the rooms were clean and spacious. I was having a horrible trip to Chicago and would have never guessed that  hotel stay could have completely turned my trip to be great.

Text: Came here for theater with friends. Hotel is wonderful, great location, great food at happy hour and super bartenders.  Gerry Medina went above and beyond to assist us with all of our needs the entire stay. Ravi the doorman was always helpful, smiling, and of great assistance. Highly recommend this hotel. Quiet and classy with excellent service.

Text: Very accommodating and helpful. Close to shopping, sites, amd restaurants. Easy check in and check out/valet for business. The view was literally into a business about twenty feet from me with the curtains broken on my end. I got to see how a design firm runs quite intimately. It wasn't a big deal to me but it was the only negative.
