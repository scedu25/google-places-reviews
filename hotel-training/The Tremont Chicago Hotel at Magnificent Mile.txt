The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile
Rating: 4
Text: Very centrally located with good amenities and a nice lobby. Rooms were fine, but could use some updates - and there was a leak in the shower faucet. Gym on the third floor was nice and had good equipment. Valet parking is $67 a night - which is kinda outrageous, but not more expensive than other places and it does include in and out. Breakfast was good - scrambled eggs and hash browns, yogurt, bagels, and some kind sweet rolls - but I was surprised by the lack of proteins (ham, bacon, sausage etc). Service was professional and good, but a bit impersonal.

Text: We upgraded to a king size bed in our room. There were doors slamming all night. The alarm at he front door went off for 2 days straight. It needs a remodel. Staff was accommodating and helpful. It is centrally locates so it was easy to get to most places by walking. It’s just a little cheaper than the other hotels in the area. We will most likely not stay there again.

Text: This hotels in an amazing location easily walkable to many of Chicago's downtown destinations.  The rooms are okay meeting base expectations. The lighting in the room could be dramatically improved. While the hotel recently renovated its rooms, the bathroom and shower remain in need of attention. Finally while the hotel has a lack of amenities , it's location makes up for that as you can get almost anything you need within walking distance

Text: Shower water waa not hot enough also the lowest water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at. I paid for a queen bed and got a full bed. Air vents in my room we're filthy. TV speakers were blown. Audio on all channels we're popping. Good location that's about it. Would not stay there again. Oh I asked for an extra room key card and it seemed I ruined the receptionists day.

Text: Cute and cozy hotel for those budget friendly travellers. The staff are very nice and friendly. The location is also is the magnificent mile so it competes with the bigger hotels but with a much friendly price
