Kimpton Hotel Palomar Chicago
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is gorgeous!! My favorite Kimpton property in Chicago. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms feature a stunning bar wood door with a mirror, huge showers, plenty of space to move about. 

The gym is really nice and fully functional for business travelers and there is a pool as well! Both are located on the top floor with expansive views of the city. 

Meeting space is lovely and flexible. The wrap around terrace makes such a difference. The chandeliers are my favorite feature.

Text: Love Kimpton hotels and this one did not disappoint. Friendly and professional staff. Start off with the valet welcoming us as though we were old friends. Next, we meet up with the desk clerk and she was super friendly and totally excited for why we were visiting Chicago. 
Our room was wonderful. Great style, very spacious and awesome floor to ceiling windows. 
Location is great too. We were a short walk or Uber ride from where we wanted to go. 
Will definitely stay here again!

Text: Great location.    Staff was super friendly.    The drinks at the bar attached to the hotel were excellent and were better than lots of other places around the hotel.   2 min walk to shopping.   Would definitely stay again.
