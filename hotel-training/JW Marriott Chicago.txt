Text: One of the best hotels available. Very helpful staff. Great in room variety of alcohol, beverages, and snacks. The pool and exercise room hours aren't abbreviated. I loved the comfortable bed. Quiet rooms.

Text: Love this hotel because of it's location and how close it is to everything. You can walk to Navy Pier to the East or walk to the river to the West and North. So many great restaurants in the area as well. Rooms are a nice size and are updated and the beds are comfortable. Staff is wicked helpful and the lounge area is a welcome perk after a long day. No views from the rooms as it's pinned between two buildings but that doesn't stop it from being a great hotel that I try to stay at every time I'm in town.

Text: Rooms are great. Spacious, nice decor, bathroom is huge! Check-in was a bit frustrating as they didnt have a chip card reader yet so issues with payment. Location is pretty central. Valet is way too expensive. For $300/night room valet should not cost $69.
