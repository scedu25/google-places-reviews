Text: Great place. They people that work there will go above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable. Be good to them.  They deserve it. Especially the manager. Great people. I've stayed there more times than I can remember and I have never been disappointed.

Text: Buyer Beware!!!! If you make a reservation with this Hotel and choose to cancel make sure you receive and save your conformation number. You will be charged and forced to dispute the charges. I am out over eighty dollars for services I never received with absolutely no understanding or compassion.
