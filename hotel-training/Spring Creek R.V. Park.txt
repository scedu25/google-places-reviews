Spring Creek R.V. Park
Rating: 5
Text: A very nice RV park. It has its own fishing pond. There is also creek that goes along the west side and north side of the park. Park office gate security at the entrance. Some people have park model units there year round,other bring their campers when they come down. It's been kind of a hidden jewel in the area. Can't see it from the main hwy.
