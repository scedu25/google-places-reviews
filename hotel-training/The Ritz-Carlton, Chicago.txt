The Ritz-Carlton, Chicago
Rating: 5
Text: The Ritz Carlton Chicago is in a prime location for visiting the city, a block off of the Magnificent Mile and connected to the water tower place. The Hancock Center is right next door and you are steps to the lake. If you have children (the will offer you a complimentary crib on check-in!) the park next door is one of my favorites in the city.

The interior was renovated in 2017 and features an incredible art deco lobby. The staff is incredibly helpful, in a very noticeable way in this day and age, everyone you meet will offer to exceed your expectations.

Not every guest room has received an upgrade yet, so ask the desk if you can have a renovated room when you check in.

Text: Having stayed in most hotels in Chicago, this is still my favorite. Some extraordinary water views, service that is impeccable and always ahead of the curve. Hate cannot go wrong place to stay. Get one of the executive suites on the corner and you will be thrilled to pieces and may never leave your room!

Text: Check in is terrible. They make you wait wait and wait. Plus, they try to give you the worst room they have with nothing like they advertise. Call them and ask for another room. They have much better rooms. They just try fool you. Plus, the food is terrible. Not worth it at all.

Text: I had brunch at the Ritz-Carlton. Try the baked eggs they're pretty awesome! The service was amazing and every need or consideration was taken care of immediately. It is of course, a little pricey, but that's the Ritz.

Text: The beauty of this hotel and level of pride of service is definitely breathtaking. I had the opportunity of a life time to have a 3 hour tour of this beautiful hotel from Tia, an HR Manager, as well as Joe, the Director of Security. We were also able to meet the General Manager along with many of the professionals that run the day to day operations. They are currently undergoing a major renovation in their hotel and it is definitely something no one should miss one it is complete. Book your hotel rooms now because the Ritz Carlton of Chicago, if not already, will be the best place to stay while traveling.
