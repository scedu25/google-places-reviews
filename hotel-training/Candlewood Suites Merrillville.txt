Rating: 4
Text: Room was mostly clean and in order. Coffee machine in room looked greasy and was left full of water from the previous Tennant. Coke zero in pantry had expired 6mi ago.
Bed was comfortable. Location is great. TV is good.

Text: This is a nice place to stay. I love the kitchenette in the rooms and the gazebo with gas grills. It is a good place for socializing with other guests. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Not a bad place to stay for an extended time.

Text: The baseboards in the room were never cleaned, and our room smelled of mildew. Wasn't too bad once your nose adjusted to it though. Staff was nice and friendly which is always a plus.

Text: Here on reservations made by a friend of the family. Fairly nice hotel, but one issue. Our air conditioning unit has mildewed. Aside from that, not bad

Text: I recently stayed at the Candlewood in Merrillville, IN. Sadly, I was traveling for my father's funeral. They knew this (as I was probably crying when I made the reservation), they actually called me while I was on my way driving out of state to find out my estimated time of arrival. They wanted to make sure my room was available and ready prior to my arrival. The manager and staff were so kind and considerate. Even one of the cleaning ladies gave her condolences as I was getting onto the elevator one day.  Thank you for all of your efforts to make my stay enjoyable given the circumstances.

I also need to point out that they gave me a free upgrade to a full suite since the hotel was sold out due to outside events in the area. The rooms were very clean, well kept, and very well up-to-date. 

If given the opportunity, I will most certainly stay here again and will refer friends and family to you.  

Thank you again!
