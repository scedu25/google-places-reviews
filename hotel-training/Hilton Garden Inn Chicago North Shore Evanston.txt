Text: Nice clean hotel. Very helpful and friendly front desk and dining room staff. Was very disappointed that cleaning staff completely ignore do not disturb signs and barged into room.

Text: Room was clean, service was friendly, and neighborhood was quaint.  Pool was small, as was the exercise facilities.  Continental breakfast cost $9, and the extended buffet was $13 food was alright, but I wouldn't recommend it for the cost.  Good stay of your looking for something right outside Chicago.
