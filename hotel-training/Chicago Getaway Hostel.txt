Chicago Getaway Hostel
Rating: 5
Text: The issue people might have with this place is their expectations. This is a hostel, not a hotel. For a hostel, it is fine. A nice neighborhood but with plenty of food options within walking distance. The rooms aren't anything too special but they do the job! I paid $66 a night for a private room with a bunk bed in it and that's all I needed, no more, no less. Free breakfast was appreciated too. The only issue is that the bathrooms are shared but they weren't particularly disgusting or anything. Keep in mind that this place always has lots of guests who are all using the facilities throughout the day. Honestly the place is great for the price. Just understand what you're getting into. Maybe bring an extra pillow if you need more than 1 since my room only came with 1 pillow per bed.

Text: The hostel is located in a very nice upscale residential neighborhood. Free breakfast is included which consists of waffles, cereal, coffee and fruit. Lobby and dining room has modern furniture. Free computer use and printing by the main desk. Pool table costs $1. The community kitchen is quite large and includes all the cookware and supplies you could possibly need. There is community shelving for food and large fridges and freezers for guest storage. A few vending machines are located behind the kitchen. The patio looked great, spacious. Bike rentals are available for $15 for 3 hours or $20 for the day. Popcorn was available in the lobby. Laundry machines in the basement. Room was basic and clean. Shared bathroom included stalls and locked showers inside private stalls. One hairdryer in the bathroom.

Text: Nice place, historical, cozy, multicultural. You can bring your own food and cooking there. Nice seating and relaxing area. The beds can be improved. More blankets in the rooms and a deep clean in the bathrooms. Close to everything in town, you can walk and they have a parking available.   Going back again...

Text: I am here now and I will definitely return. It is home away from home. People are friendly, personnel is experienced and good. Bathrooms are located a little bit far from our room, but they are clean and spact enough. There were toilet stuff to share like shampoo etc. In the evenings you can share a room with others and chat and play guitar or pool, or you can work with the computer. Bikes are available for rent at a good cost. Breakfast is good and we walked to Cloud gate by foot, so it is not far. I strongly recommend it!
