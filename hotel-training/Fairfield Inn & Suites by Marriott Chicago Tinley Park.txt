Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Chicago Tinley Park

Text: I took  about 10 black girls (my daughter and her friends) to the Fairfield Inn Tinley Park, IL Marriott Hotels.... We were there for about ten minutes when management came to the room. They asked us at what time did we plan on not making any noise.  I was a little confused.. because the girls were not making any noise.  I asked management did they ask everybody who came in that question or if it was just us.  Mind you I had 3 rooms more that enough to accommodate us.  Needless to say I left the hotel to take the kids to the mall only to receive a call that I had to checked out and come get my stuff and that police had been called.  They also informed me that I would still be charged for the rooms in which I had only checked in and been put out.  

It was discrimination at its finest....

Text: Loved the rooms and loved the breakfast and also loved the staff. My only complaint is one that I know doesn't effect a lot of people but I really wish there was a better fitness center. I understand this isn't a popular topic but for someone like me this is a big deal. There were two treadmills that didn't incline, an old elliptical, and a few dumbbells. Would have five starred if there was even two more pieces of equipment.
