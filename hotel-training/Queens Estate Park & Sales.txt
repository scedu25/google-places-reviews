Text: Amazing how the only people with time to review are the troublemakers that were recently evicted. This place is great and the only known drug dealer was a guy named Jason who was recently evicted. What a coincidence!
I have family and friends who live there and they love it, nice playground and the roads are better than most streets in town. It's amazing how little my friends pay to live there.
