Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District

Text: We got here and the front desk staff was incredibly friendly, allowing us an early check in so that we wouldn't have to carry our luggage around with us while waiting. The hotel is very clean, quiet, and the AC works very well at keeping the room incredibly cold. My only complaint, and this is really reaching, is that the windows have some sort of old leftover adhesive or maybe dirt stuck to them which clouds the view of outside.

Text: I took a trip to Chicago for a few days to take in some sight seeing. I have been to Chicago several times and have always stayed in major brand hotels and have never received the treatment that I received at the Hampton Inn Majestic Theater. Make sure you are actively looking for this hotel, because it is a small door within a large theater. The hotel loby is very inviting and clean. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Upon checking in they provided me a water and a list of nearby restaurants that they recommend. I went to 4 of those restaurants and all were very good. The lobby also offers cookies in the afternoon and they are delicious (butterscotch chocolate chip). I was surprised at the quality of these cookies being that they are from a hotel and free. I was always able to ask for a bottle of water and they always happily gave me one with a smile. I have been to Chicago twice before once at a similar branded hotel and another at a higher class hotel and both rooms were the size of a closet. This hotel room was very large and very spacious. Which is nice, it was like staying in an airport hotel, but in the heart of the city. The hotel has good access to State Street, so if you need quick shopping it is within minutes, red and blue lines are within a block and most major Chicago attractions are within 5-15 minutes walking (Any sporting event you need to take the subway or cab/Lyft). Where they knock it out of the park is with their maid service, I never saw the maid, but my room was never cleaner and had more attention at any hotel. There was nothing dirty, sheets were in good shape, and the maid always left a note wishing us a nice day. The maid also always made figurines with the towels so we had a place for our toiletries. There were a lot of small touches this hotel had  that made me feel special as a customer. The downfalls are minimal, the continental breakfast is like all of them, stick to the cereal, yogurt, and fruit and also this hotel is in the middle of the Chicago, there is no parking lot, if you rent a car be prepared to pay big bucks to have it parked. All in all I would recommend this hotel, especially at this price point. You could spend a lot more and have a smaller room and not have good cookies.

Text: We stayed here because we were going to Hamilton at the Private Bank Theater and the hotel is right upstairs. Great hotel, clean rooms, nice breakfast buffet. It wouldn't have killed them to have a few more pillows that actually had some substance to them, but I can deal.

Text: Great location except kind of hard to get parked without getting hit or clipped on the street. Tons of place to eat/see within walking distance. Rooms were great and there was plenty of food at breakfast.
