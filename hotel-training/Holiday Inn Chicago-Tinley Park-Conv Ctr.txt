Holiday Inn Chicago-Tinley Park-Conv Ctr
Rating: 4
Text: Holiday Inn Chicago Tinley Park Convention Center was very easy to find from Interstate 80. Holiday Inn had attractive comfortable rooms. The rooms were a very quick walk to the Convention Center. The Convention Center itself was laid out very sensibly and individual rooms were easy to locate. Parking was free and convenient. I would definitely attend a conference here again.

Text: A wonderful time for  sure. This particular Holiday Inn is more upscale than what you might be expecting from a Holiday Inn. The food for breakfast and in the lounge was fabulous, housekeeping was on point & everyone was very polite. It's a very nice place to stay we'll stay every time we're anywhere near.

Text: Not bad, staff are friendly and accommodating. Your only real option for anything at the convention center. Restaurant us unimpressive.

Text: The hotel was adequate with a restaurant called Bananas. We tried to get a drink at the bar at 11:45 p.m. but was told it was last call so had to drink quickly. Bartender told another patron that it was closed and it was only 11:55. Close to Hollywood casino amphitheater. Did not use their restaurant.

Text: Beautiful place to stay with awesome food and breakfast. Staff is very attentive to needs and if by chance something is amiss, they go out of their way to compensate.
