Text: Shame this is now a Red Roof Inn. Was formerly the magnificent Richmont Hotel, and the excellent Rue Saint Clair restaurant. Was my go to place to bring dates to dinner back in the mid-late 80s and early 90s. Shame the Rue is closed  :(

Text: The location is amazing! Just a few minutes walk from amazing food, navy pier, and great sights to see. For the price, it's good. Some things that were a problem: the elevator is a little on the small side and it scrapes as it goes up and down. It also broke down at one point. The rooms are also very small. Overall, a good hotel and cheap.. Just obviously not premium.

Text: This was the best Inn I've ever been too.The Bed Bugs were monsters,and 5here cousins the cock a roach were hanging out too.very dirty and just not a safe place to be especially with kids,bare wires everywhere  and huge garbage can in hallway very noisy.,The mattress was very comfortable though and the people that worked there were very friendly other than that two thumbs down..sorry RRI that renovation your doing is far overdue, but because of the staff and look Arion knowing it's doing a 2nd floor renovation on the red roof inn here in Vernon,CT.This Inn is very clean prior to any work but needs sinks and carpets  pulled  and new floors  installed.  Make red roof inn great again !!! being renovated,6 month project ,I'd check it out again when I come to the windy city.Im from CT and actua

Text: The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Great location for tourists wanting to see all Chicago has to offer. The rooms on the other hand were found wanting, definitely could be updated with fresher bathrooms and a whole new look in the room decor. But if you're looking for a place to crash for a night this will do just fine.
