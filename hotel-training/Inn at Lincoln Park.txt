Inn at Lincoln Park
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms were nice enough. Shower took a very long time to get warm. The front desk was extremely helpful and the location was great. Overall we had a positive experience and would recommend this hotel to others.

Text: Room was so hot unbearable.  Window opened but no screen. To get in to bathroom had to step up.  Bath doors hit toilet. Not good for 93 year old. Small small  room. Coffee maker in room did not work. Not worth the price paid.

Text: Tiny room, entire hotel smells musty & the “free wi-fi” is spotty at best & requires one to log in repeatedly. The “breakfast” is pathetic, fortunately there are many good meal options within walking distance in this charming area of Chicago. Also be forewarned, do not let your roommate flush the toilet while you are in the shower for fear of becoming scalded!

Text: Great costumer service David was such a great help but have to say the place kind of old fashion. Parking is a bit pricey too

Text: Our room was large and comfortable. The desk staff was helpful and professional. We requested a fridge brought into our room and they accommodated. The location was convenient for seeing Blue Man Group, Lincoln Park, and Wrigley Field.
