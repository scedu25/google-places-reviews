Text: Michael at the front desk was great!  I am an early riser for exercise, and he was quite helpful and I felt quite safe in entering/exiting the hotel.  Additionally, when I asked in advance to have my vehicle at 6:15 a.m., it was there waiting for me when I checked out.  The only thing I think I had a little trouble with (and I am quite a clean freak) is that when I went to plug in my laptop and phone to work from the room, the outlets were not real convenient to the work desk and I noticed build-up of dust in those areas where you don't readily see.  All in all, the cleanliness and location were great!  There's a great little coffee/sandwich shop on the next block called Hero, and it's convenient to State Street, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop.  There's also a Gino's East right across the street. The weight room is sufficient for a quick workout while traveling and does fine as long as you aren't expecting your franchised big gym.  Especially if you're traveling for business, this was a great place to stay.

Text: Hotel Blake is a Chicago destination smack in the best part of downtown. It is classy, upscale, yet personable in the best way possible. Come her, stay here, and be sure to ask for "Showtime" at the door for the best advice about directions, restaurants, deals, and transportation. The service is fantastic plus toy can reach the best destinations in Chicago on foot or via public transportation. Definately come here.

Hotel Blake is conveniently located to all the popular tourist attractions . Would definitely stay here again!

Text: it honestly was such a great place to stay. a gentlemen greeted me at the door, and was very polite. the rooms had really high ceilings and the view wasn’t all that great, it was a brick wall. but hey, it was still really good. the streets were really loud, but we were on like the 2nd or 3rd floor. i enjoyed my stay.
