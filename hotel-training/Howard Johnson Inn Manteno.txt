Howard Johnson Inn Manteno
Rating: 2
Text: The rooms are adequate, but small. The hotel is in need of an upgrade and their is no elevator. The swimming pool was clean and tidy. The breakfast definitely left something to be desired, there were very few choices which made accommodating allergies difficult. My family and I visit this area several times a year and most likely will not return to this hotel.

Text: Beds were stiff. Sheets were stained. Room had a strong chemical smell from the cheap cleaner. But overall it was fine. Hot shower, AC worked, continental breakfast was decent. Cheap hotel.

Text: The room'a heat was on when I arrived. It's August. Took quite awhile to cool off, but slept well when it finally was cool. The free Continental breakfast was underwhelming.

Text: Staff was unfriendly except for james. The room smelled of mildew, the sink did not work and the tv was an old model that looked like it was going to blink off at any minute.  I have been here many times but never had an awful experience like this.
