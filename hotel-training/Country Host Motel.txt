Text: This motel is exactly what you would expect at the price and location. It's mostly to serve the truck stop next door. But, the sheets, toilet, and tub were clean. That's about all you can ask for at these joints. Also, front desk clerk was very nice. Lots of TV channels to drown out the sex from next door, which would be louder if the walls weren't cinder blocks.

Text: Everything is disgusting,  I was actually glad I had my own blanket because I refused to sleep on those blankets!   The office style chair is absolutely atrocious and stain riddled.   Most of the switches in the room don't work.   The vent in the bathroom didn't work.   Refused to shower without flip flops on due to the mold riddled tub and needed to shower with the curtain open because the curtain was stained everywhere.
