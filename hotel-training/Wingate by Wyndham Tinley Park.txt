Wingate by Wyndham Tinley Park

Text: The hotel is nice enough. Breakfast was really good. However, the beds are very hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom also wasn't very clean. My biggest problem though was the streetlights in the parking lot outside my room. They were like stadium strength spotlights! And there were so many of them! Even with the blinds closed, it looked like it was daytime outside. And they are pointed right at the windows of the rooms. It just seemed so excessive and made sleeping there less enjoyable.

Text: I was in for a family wedding this past weekend. By the time I finished work on Friday, caught my flight, landed in Chicago, got my rental vehicle and got to the hotel I was exhausted. Ms. Amy Quinn checked me in and noticed I hadn't used my Wyndham club # when making my reservation, so she added it so I could get the points. The next morning she helped me as I was having trouble logging onto the computer to to secure my outbound seat. She also noticed I was about an hour early trying to check in. That's when I realized I was still on east coast time. We both laughed about my internal clock error. Over the course of the weekend she was kind and helpful more than a few times due to my east coast setting. It became something of a joke between us. She added to an all-ready pleasurable  weekend with her sense of humor. I'll stay here again later this summer during another family event, just so I can thank her personally for making this trip so wonderful!!

Text: Nice staff, great room, and comfortable bed. Nice hot breakfast in the morning, including made to order automatic pancake machine ?! Lunch and dinner have no fear there is a great grill restaurant 50ft from the parking lot. Definitely will stay there when I'm in the area again!
