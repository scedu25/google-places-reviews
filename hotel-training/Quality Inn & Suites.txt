Quality Inn & Suites
Rating: 3
Text: I had never stayed at a Quality Inn & Suites before but the name did not hold up. The room was fine, clean and neat. The bathroom was closet-sized. Beds were decently comfortable. Our TV was not set up right, and when we finally got it working, the signal was so bad it looked like a 16 bit video game. Treadmill also did not operate above a walking speed. However, breakfast was well stocked and the staff were friendly. If this experience is characteristic of the Quality Inn & Suites brand then I will certainly find a different hotel next time.

Text: We were right across the highway from Werner Park. the parking lot was kind of crowded and tight. the staff there was very friendly and courteous. The pool and hot tub were very nice. The biggest complaint that I would have was that it was supposed to be entirely non-smoking and the first smell I had in when I walked in the room was smoke. The morning breakfast was good but crowded also due to tight space. For the money it wasn't a bad place to stay but it wasn't the greatest either.

Text: My sister stays here whenever she comes to Omaha to visit. This last time the hotel made a booking mistake and upgraded her room for free. Room looked really nice. Front desk staff seemed really nice. Lobby was a little shabby.

Text: It's worn, but the bed was comfortable,the breakfast was great and the staff was super friendly. We did have a minor issue with the toilet and the electric outlets being scarce, but for the price it served out needs and we were comfortable.

Text: We stayed overnight as a rest on a road trip, and this hotel was great for that purpose. Priced well, it was definitely not a high-end hotel, but was comfortable and clean. The bedding and furnishings were modern, though the pant and carpet could probably use a refresh. Staff was very friendly (Corey, on check in was about the best I've encountered at a hotel, very helpful and genuine). Breakfast was good. Overall it was a good value and I'd stay again.
