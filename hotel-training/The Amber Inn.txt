The Amber Inn
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms I've booked were clean on my visits, it's 4 blocks south of Sox pk green line is 2 blocks south of here. An ample parking lot a great soul food restaurant Pearls located on the premises a decent rib/burger joint across the street and a Rothchilds liquor store on the corner. There is a 20 dollar returnable fee for smoking on my last visit though. There are cheaper alternatives if one has flexibility.

Text: I loved my stay at the Amber Inn! It was closed in a court-yard like area that made me feel safe.

Text: Price is good because of the location to downtown; it should be the cheapest motel/hotels from downtown overpriced ones.
It does not have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel, which you might never use, despite be charged, there are at least no bedbugs_ something I fear the most from cheap motels.
It has free parking in the courtyard, close to Marianos, and Michigan ave buses. Overnight parking downtown $57.. It has security cameras too.
So if you want to save money, I guess it's a good deal to stay here.Thanks for reading.
