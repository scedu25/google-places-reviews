Super 8 Hebron Lowell Area

Text: Nice hotel there almost through remodeling the place, the staff is friendly well at least the individuals I have talked to Nikki, and Rebecca and they will greet  you when your coming or going which is nice. It’s hard enough working out of town away from your family so its nice to get a friendly smile so if you need a comfortable place to sleep I suggest you stay at the Super 8. The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is there is no washer n dryer.

Text: Wifi cuts out every 5 minutes. Rooms are ok at best. Bring your own hot spot if you can cuz you cannot get internet here.

Text: The staff is really nice. It was a quiet stay. The room was clean for the most part with the exception of spider webs in multiple corners in the room completely visible and easy to access. The motel is under renovation at this time so there is less room for them to accomodate the guests with breakfast and no microwave as they claim they dont have the room. The grounds have a lot of garbage around it and junky furniture for outdoor seating. Looks rundown outside to be honest but the reason for me staying here is that they allow dogs. I would not have stayed here otherwise.

Text: Its a motel. It served its purpose and there is a Denny's close by. Easy access to the Highway and everything is on par for the price. Good stay!
