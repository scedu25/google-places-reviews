Sleep Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Had to travel to Iowa for business, wound up getting a room at the Sleep Inn in North Liberty.  It looks like it was built not too long ago, has a pool and the rooms are in good condition.  All of the toiletries were sandalwood-scented (soap, shampoo, conditioner and hand lotion).  Not a deal-breaker at all, just unusual.  If I'm ever back in the area and need a decent room at a decent price, I'll will go here.  Breakfast was an 8/10 (on a free hotel breakfast scale).

Text: Very nice and new, good price, under $100 a night. Kind of in the middle of nowhere but only 15 minutes to shopping and university of Iowa. Small pool and nowhere outside to hang out. Breakfast was kind of small as well. Rooms were very large, easily sleep 6 with pullout couch. Would definitely stay again for the price.

Text: Overall, we had a pleasant stay here. The breakfast is consistent - every time - we've stayed here. The gal kept the breakfast filled for the guest.  We had a hot tub suite and it was great!  Hot tub was decently sized and my girlfriend and I were able to be in there with comfort.  Along with a decent/clean room, the A/C worked nicely too :)  The only downside was the bed was hard so for those that don't like firm beds, you may want to look elsewhere for a good nights sleep.

Text: Very nice hotel extremely clean and well-kept outside and in. I would sleep here above the Quality Inn even though it's the same chain. The breakfast was good and friendly staff very quiet rooms. Would definitely come back

Text: It was clean and the bed was comfortable.  There is a pool which is fun.  And a hit breakfast was provided in the morning.  The hotel didn't have extra pillows available.
