Text: Had to switch rooms because they didnt have the cleaning done by check-in time. Room was clean, but pics look better than real life. Room was hot. There’s no temp control in room, you have to call front desk. Called front desk to see if they could turn temp down. They reluctantly said they would, but room felt more hot after a while. Husband woke up in the middle of the night overheated so he opened a window to cool down the room, but then couldn’t sleep because of the sounds from the busy street. Just pay the extra $50-$100 to stay somewhere nicer and up to date.

Text: This hotel seems very old looking from the outside. When you go into your room, it is not the newest furniture, but, the bed is very comfortable, the desk and chair are comfortable to work at with a colleague working from the big comfy chair. It is in a very good location of a Chicago with lots of places to visit within walking distance. I would stay here again on my next business trip.

Text: What a great little place to stay! Is older, but easy to get to, rooms are reasonable, very clean, quite & Free Parking! If you're not looking for anything fancy, but just clean & comfortable, I certainly recommend this place!?

Text: First, it's a MOTEL (easy to forget) so expect motel confort. It's cheap, clean, relatively quiet, free parking and in the city center. A good deal for the price.
There's no breakfast but they have a coffee/tea machine and some basic fruits. We had a good stay.
