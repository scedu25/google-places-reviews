Nice hotel in the middle of magnificent mile. The hotel itself is a bit dated compared to some of the other five star hotels in Chicago, but you won't be able to tell the difference. The views are spectacular, make sure you get a room facing the lake!

Text: $7.00 for a glass of milk, because my wife felt ill and needed to take a pill. Took the nearly full glass of milk back to the bar, and the bartender told me he couldn't change the prices. A nice guy would have just given me a glass of milk. There's such a thing called manners and friendliness. You have none....
