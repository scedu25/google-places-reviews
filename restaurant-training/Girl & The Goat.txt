Girl & The Goat

Text: Everything about this place was amazing. We sat at the bar and the experience was incredible. We had a very attentive bartender/server that explained everything to us and asked questions as we went. I’m a vegan and I thought finding options here would be difficult. But they have set vegetarian options that can be made vegan. Sometimes when you get the vegan alternative, it’s just bad, but all of the vegan dishes I was served did not disappoint! Can’t wait to go back!

Text: Everything was so amazing! There were 3 of us so we got to taste a lot. We had the beets, the chickpea fritter (probably my favorite), the goat empanadas, pig face (don't pass this up just because of the name), the crispy pork shank, and the goat belly. I recommend every single one. The ring of fire is also an amazing drink if you like something a touch sweet and spicy. Definitely plan to make reservations a few months ahead of time if you want to come here while visiting Chicago.

Text: The food here is rich and savory, if that's what you're looking for on date night then this will be the perfect place. If instead you're looking for small plates or something lighter I would say maybe hold of for another time. We were lucky enough to get a 10pm reservation and I was extremely impressed with the empanadas and the green beans. Nothing we ate disappointed us but I did find myself wanting something light to balance the meal better.

Text: What can I say that hasn't already been said… I don't know. The food is fun, the atmosphere is inviting and the service was great. Could not ask for more. We let the waitress pick the dinner for us and not only did she have fun doing it, but she picked some great items for us to try. I have already recommended to my friends

Text: While it was an interesting experience and great service, I didn't feel like the taste fully justified the price. For two people, the bill was $130 before tip. We each had one cocktail and ordered average priced items. 

The atmosphere was upscale and fun. The hosts and servers were friendly.
