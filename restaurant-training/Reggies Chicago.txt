Text: Our bartender Nichole was awesome!!! There   was a ticketed event going on downstairs but the rest of the bar was open to the public which was a surprise because most places are normally closed when things like this happens which I thought was great. My first time there, my experience was awesome I will be back!!!

Text: Great place fun especially for groups.  Drinks and food are good.  Music is eclectic great roof top bar.  Awesome party spot.  Can get crowded  but if you like a crowed and good drinks and great music this place is a must!

Text: They reserve tables for people whether they show up or not. It’s really dumb for them to have empty tables for hours at a time. My whole party of 20 left for this very reason. A few people tried to sit down in the reserved section and were told to move. Seriously? I guess this place doesn’t care about making money. :)

Text: I liked the rooftop. First floor was a little noisy but that could have just been the band. They wanted $20 to see the band on the 1st floor. Other than that it was decent atmosphere.
