Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant

Text: The service was great! Get the single glass of white sangria vs the carafe, its stronger and prettier. I also wish they would've warned us off just how large the rigatoni is because it couldve fed 8 people and there were only a couple of us.  The food was pretty good. The mozzarella garlic bread was amazing though!!

Text: I ordered using a delivery service so I can't speak for the service or atmosphere, however my order had no eating utensils or seasonings. I ordered spaghetti & meatballs w/ bread, but everything was pretty bland & tasteless. Very disappointing for $20, or any price for that matter, so I don't recommend.

Text: this is my favorite buca! there's always something fun to look at, and  the food is great. For lunch there's an option other than family style,  which is good!

Text: We made reservations for our son's graduation party with the family. We needed a place with a variety of food items and space to contain our chaos. We found both. The food, from the salad to the chocolate cake, was amazing. They packed up our leftovers for us and we celebrated again the next day. The waitstaff were attentive and did a great job with our party. This is the second time we have met here for a celebration and both times have been great experiences.

Text: One of our favorites. Great food, hard working employees that seem to really care. Some of the very best food you can get, home style Italian is where it's at. The best ambiance you can have at a chain restaurant
