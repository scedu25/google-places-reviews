Text: I walked in and was greeted immediately with a big smile by Wendy. She signed me up for the rewards program while I was there as well. It was one of her first days on the job and she was so patient with me. I wasn't able to get the other co workers name that helped us out that day, but you guys are always sooo nice. Thank you for making my experience seem less stressful. I don't usually carry credit cards with me, so we were having issues processing my rewards. But we go it to go through and I'm happy that I will be able to enjoy my free bottle of wine each month! Thanks Wendy!

Text: A great wine selection and honestly the food is really good. It's a chain atmosphere, but still enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to be less pushy on selling the wine. However I do understand that is the job of the restaurant.

Text: Good selection of food and reasonably priced, good value wines. Not exceptional, but good value. Especially for a resteraunt.
