Text: I come here for pick up 1-2 a week and always have to good experience even if it’s slammed packed busy. The general manager, Phil is always helping his staff and treats each customer very well. Coming from a server background it’s so nice to see a GM get his hands dirty and help!!!

Text: The server told me that something was too new, shouldn't have been on the menu, and cannot be made because there's no button for it. After I explained that there are 2 ingredients and if you have those, a monkey could make it...she then said "well I'll go ask if they can". Why didn't she do that to begin with? "There's no button for it" is a terrible reason not to at least ask if something can be made that is on the menu.

Text: Food was okay nothing special. I was expecting more flavor from the screaming nacho burger. All you could really taste was onion and an unflavored meat patty. I have to give them the service was quick.

Text: Have had great service every time I've eaten here, which has been for lunch during the week. The fried pickles are amazing, as are the boneless wings in Wild sauce.
