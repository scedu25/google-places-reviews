Filini Bar and Restaurant

Text: DO NOT EAT HERE! I took my husband here for his birthday and it was not a great experience. Yes, we were seated right away. The decor and modern feel makes this place look like it has potential to knock your party out of this world, but that's the best part. It took 20 minutes for our table to be waited on and we were the only group in the place. We ordered our food and waited from 45-60 minutes before food was served. When the food came, some of it was cold others over cooked. Everyone was upset. They attempted to provide us Champagne for a toast, but the champagne tasted bad as well. Most of the glasses we left completely full on the table. Overall, it was a bad experience. DO NOT GO HERE.

Text: Today we had a horrible experience at Filini.  We were seated right away (which is the best part of the story), the waitress took our order which consisted of an appetizer and two lunch entrees.  We waited eternally for the appetizer, which we had to ask a busboy to get for us.  Then one entree came out alone, so we complained.  The waitress said  "so sorry our kitchen is backed up."  About 20 minutes later my pasta came out, all limp and overcooked.  They did comp the entire meal, but what a horrible lunch.  One family of 4 sat for 45 minutes without even a single waiter/waitress stopping by.  If I could give it zero stars I would.

Text: The pizza was excellent--most likely because of the amazing oven they have on full display in the bar. Service was mediocre and somewhat on the slow side. 

The burgers were passably adequate but definitely did not live up to the expectations from the description and price.
