Text: Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the BEST scramble I've ever had!!! I'm an out- of-towner and I highly recommend The Egg and I to anyone. It's family friendly and wheelchair accessible. Wish we had this place back in Council Bluffs,Iowa!!!?

Text: Tasted great. However I asked for over easy and got scrambled. The tables that came in 5 min after us got served a good 15 min before us   the topper was when I found a part of a sugar packet at the bottom of the cream meaning it had been on someone else's table. When i showed the server he shrugged his shoulders. Not impressed and the last time I will come to this location.

Text: It was good and fast.  The potatoes were a little soggy and the prices were a little high for breakfast but on par with Perkins.  The service was very good (friendly and responsive to your needs).  I had the Hiker Benedict, my only compliant with it was one of my eggs were over done, but the flavor was excellent.
