Text: I went there for the chicken wings. The wings are available  in different flavors and are crispy on the outside while juicy inside. I also ordered the artichoke dip...which had spinach and was creamy. I liked the dip because it was served warm!  The ambience is very nice with pool tables, large tv screens,  and high stools to sit on. The service is also quite fast. Atmosphere a bit noisy but overall a neat place in the middle of Chicago's downtown.

Text: I love their garlic Parmesan wings! So so yummy! I only come here for that! I had a burger once and it was pretty good but the wings are my go to! I got them to go this time! The fries are yummy too! I'm super picky on my ranch also and this place's ranch is on point!

Text: Very crowded for Monday Night Football, tough to find a seat, be careful of the prices for single malt, 15 year Balvenie cost $30 per glass. Tuesday night was much less crowded and we had dinner there, pub food at its best. If you're looking for a quiet comfortable place for a business meeting this place can work just don't go during a football game. Extra large selection of beers was a plus.

Text: Had a blast at this little bar after the Chicago Marathon. Great bar eats and such a cool place to hang out. Glad a friend told us to stop by here.
