Bottom Lounge
Rating: 5
Text: Bottom Lounge was the venue for our recent wedding (September 2017) and it was perfect for our 80 guests. We had the ceremony and reception on site, utilizing both the indoor and outdoor space on the second floor. Natalie is their wedding coordinator and is absolutely wonderful to work with. She's very efficient, knows what she's doing, and makes sure that everything looks amazing on the big day. She has an inventory of items, such as dessert platters and cut wood discs for display that she's happy to let couples utilize. The space already has nice lighting, a Chicago feel, a permanent bar, and a DJ booth, so it saves the time of trying to plan the room from a completely "blank canvas." The optional photo booth and pinball machines are a fun touch. The food was delicious and was served family style. It was an overall great planning experience and perfect wedding day. Thank you to Natalie and everyone at Bottom Lounge!!

Text: This is a great small venue where you can be close to the performers from anywhere in the room. Though it can be a bit cramped in the hallway where merch is usually sold, you can see the stage from most of the tables. The staff is helpful and they have a great food & alcohol selection. They were even very accommodating to my gluten allergy, which is not always the case at concert venues. Even though it's a small place, it's one of my favourites. And as an added bonus, the bathrooms are reasonably clean for a concert venue!

Text: Fantastic venue for sound, anywhere you stand has a great view so you can still see the performer if you want to stay out of the madness in the front. Most importantly the drinks are very reasonable priced and bartenders give a good pour. Make sure to tip well. They deserve it.

Text: Truly friendly and accommodating staff. The beer selection is second to none. My only gripe is pricing, but it seems within reason for this town, so yeah..

Text: Was there for an event for TechWeek. We were upstairs in that space which was nice. It was small for the group that was there. The service was excellent all the bartender were attentive to however stepped up to the bar even with all the people that were there. That is one reason I would come back. Also since I didn't have a change to have any food there. I have to see what it's like.
