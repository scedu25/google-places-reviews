Gilt Bar

Text: The food and ambience have always been outstanding.  The general manager, Riley, she went above and beyond to make our experience great.  She went out of her way and made a not so good situation into one that will bring us back multiple times over.  Can't wait to eat here again!

Text: One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. The tartare, bone marrow, and mussels are enough to travel back to Chicago for. Don't skip the cocktails - they're perfect. I definitely recommend this place, just ensure you get there early to avoid a wait!

Text: Really the only down side was the main course portions are a bit less than what I expected. The pot roast was excellent, but the menu said it came with root vegetables. Root vegetables consisted of maybe 4 or 5 bits size chunks of carrots and 6 whole mini onions. The pot roast just fell apart so easy, tender and delicious with a great sauce! 

Beef tartare was excellent, black Manhattan cocktail was perfect.
meatball appetizer was good, carrot cake was good but not phenomenal.

Couldn't ask for anything more regarding service.

Text: Many reasons that I love this place... I usually travel to Chicago alone but always manage to find a bar spot here, my longest wait for someone to get up was about 5 min, even on a busy weekend night. Bartenders are pros and do justice to classics, Martinis, Manhattans, Cosmo, whatever. Food is always outstanding, although a la carte is not my favorite... It's not about cost, I'd just rather leave pairing of sides to the professionals. I wish they'd correct that. But the attraction is the ambiance... dark, hip, cool, and even a bit romantic making me regret traveling alone. So many great restaurants in Chicago but Gilt is always a must for me. Always leave wanting to tell someone about it, so... there you have it.
