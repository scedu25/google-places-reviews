Text: Awesome stay! Hotel staff were amazing. Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)! Trusted him with making me whatever drink he wanted and I didn't regret it. Prompt service. Housekeeping did an excellent job. Laura at the front desk was always so helpful. Will definitely stay here again!

Text: Really nice hotel—heard they recently did some renovations. If this is true, it paid off! Within walking distance of many great restaurants and the staff is very nice! Can't go wrong here.

Text: Wonderful hotel and even better location.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  We had a  king room with fold out couch.  The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   Pool was small but nice.  I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!

Text: I was there for a training for work.  The customer service is wonderful.  They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. I will definitely be staying there again soon.

Text: This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. We will definitely be staying here again.
