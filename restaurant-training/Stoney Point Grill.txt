Text: Pretty good food but VERY noisy!
The cheese soup is excellent but they only have it certain days so definitely call ahead if that's what you're interested in having.

Text: I have been coming here for a few months. Service is great, the menu is awesome, no complaints. If you want to play the ponies or just enjoy some cocktails while watching your favorite sports this is the place to come.
