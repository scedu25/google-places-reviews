Taco Bell

Text: Went through Drive-Thru on this particular occasion and loved it. Wasn't stuck waiting too long, and my order was ready almost as soon as I ordered it. I even had custom changes and everything was correct when I got it. They didn't forget to ask me what sauces I wanted, and they suggested something new I went in for and liked.  The reason for 1 less star: During actual lunch time, it would seem that this restaurant is VERY inundated and things don't move so quickly at all inside or out. This is an ongoing struggle for this particular place.

Text: Worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. We ordered through the drive thru and was hoping to get some Chicken Chips. We were told they were out. Okay, fine, whatever. Instead, we ordered 5 Doritos Locos Tacos (3 Supreme, 2 Regular) and 1 soft shell taco. One of the DLTs barely had anything in it; I may as well have been eating a damn taco shell by itself. None of the tacos had a great quantity of meat, it was like eating a salad. Absolutely ridiculous. Oh, let's not forget the crappy customer service. The guy handed us the food and closed the window. No "have a good day" or "thank you". Seriously? This location is terrible at just about anything and everything. When the employees are not doing anything with orders, you can see them in the back on their phones... While the lobby is a damn mess with trays piled high on the trash. I would recommend going in for lunch and not go after 2 P.M. when the idiots come in for their shifts.
