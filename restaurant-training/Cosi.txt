Text: You should visit Illinois center location. People working there treat you real well. I buy lunch a couple of times every week and I am very happy with each and everyone working there.Thank you

Text: Only came here because I had a free entree coupon but I was pleasantly surprised by the superb taste of the rustic food. Love the bread they use and I would definitely recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner stop. Try the pesto chicken! It's delicious!

Text: Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh. It gets busy on weekdays during lunch, but the line moves quickly.

Text: I've been to this Cosi a few times now, both during lunch rushes and without and once for breakfast. Each time I've felt that the lines were a bit disorganized and the staff was a little behind, even the one time that they weren't all that busy. Everyone was friendly but it felt rushed and not the level of service I've had at other Cosi's. 
That being said, if you've eaten the food here it is the same as the other locations, good cafe food. I think with some of the other options in the immediate area that it isn't my top choice for sandwiches but the soups have always tasted pretty decent.
