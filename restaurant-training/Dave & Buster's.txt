Text: We walked in to Dave and Busters October 20th for lunch and was thinking the lady in front of us was wearing way to much perfume, so bad that my eyes started to burn and tear up when she walked away the smell was still there we decided it was an air freshener and I ask one of the people working was this smell through out the entire restaurant and he replied yes it was. We lost our appetite at that point from the smell and left.  I have never been in a restaurant that smothered there food aromas from the kitchen with perfumed air fresheners. The aromas from he kitchen actually enhances the taste buds and makes people hungry therefore increasing your sale potential from orders. Bad idea from the manager at this site. After we recovered from our nausea and burning sensation to our nostrils  we to Cheddars and had a wonderful lunch.

Text: We just went here for the first time and it was absolutely phenomenal. The food was so delicious and our waitress was super cool. Not to mention after we got done eating our delicious food we got to go right over and play games. Great experience. Can't wait to go back.

Text: Games are all that this location has going for it. The food is terrible and overpriced for the quality served. Short staffed waited 20 min for drinks the waitress was rushing talking so fast we didn't know what she said. We have been to many Dave and Busters on the east coast but this location is a joke.
