Text: I came with a group of 8. Derek served us without hesitation. I asked for an old fashioned, and it did not disappointment. Derek took care of us.  He made the best old fashioned I have ever had. If I ever come back to Chicago,  I will absolutely come back to this bar.

Text: Awful service.  No assistance or apology offered from manager.  Spent over $500 on lunch for 7 people, never received part of the order.  Were told 30 minutes after we ordered that they were out of mussels.  So, like fools, we ordered the Benjamin burher($100) instead.  This was not brought to the table for 40 minutes.  Overall terrible experience.  Would not recommend.

Text: This place is a joke
Cocktails are terrible 
The table was dirty wet and sticky
We had 3 different type cocktails  and all 3 were just disgusting 
Food: fries for 18$, server brought spoon for dessert without napkin and put it on the dirty table.
Also ordered grilled octopus, it actually tasted pretty good but it was cold
So if you are looking for a place to make a couple nice pictures u can go here
If you are looking for a restaurant don't ever go here, you will just wasted your time and money
