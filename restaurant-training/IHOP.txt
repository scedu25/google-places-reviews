IHOP
Rating: 3
Text: I have come to this location for awhile.  It seemed to be taking a down turn. They remodeled it and changed staff and it has been delightful to stop and eat. The food has improved and the staff has been kind and attentive.  The floor and bathrooms are clean and new  I will probably upgrade my review next time.

Text: Our waiter Brent was super nice and very friendly. He immediately took care of any needs we had and was very prompt in his serving. The food was fantastic and the restaurant was super clean. Best doing experience I've had in a while.

Text: We waited 5mins to be seated, 3 employees saw us standing there waiting. It took another 10mins for our server to come to the table. We ordered our drinks and my orange juice was pretty much warm and I had to ask twice for a glass of water. Then had to ask another 2 times for our sides, my stuffed French toast didn't have the icing or whipped topping on it, my husband's cheesecake pancakes didn't have the whip topping on it either. All this and it wasn't even busy.

Text: So far this IHOP has been the best IHOP my family and I? have eaten at, from NC to NE. Staff was awesome.
Food was really good, comparable to Denny’s and CrackerBarrel.

Text: Always a wait on Sunday, but usually only 10-15 minutes.  Service is fast.  Nights (after 11pm) are usually slower service, but still friendly.
