Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles
Rating: 5
Text: A friend who lives in Chicago took us there after discovering that my daughter loves chicken and waffles. At 10a, I am eating some of the best mac and cheese, collard greens and fried chicken that I have had in a long time. I’m from the south, and I can’t find a restaurant with food this good at home. This is the caliber of food that your parents and grandparents cooked. Service was good. Even had real sweet tea! No complaints. If I lived there, I would be a regular, for sure!

Text: My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast recently.  We ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of grits.  The chicken was seasoned really well, but the waffles were just alright.  We loved the grits and the music was great!  A very comfortable setting to eat in.  Our waiter was very nice as well.

Text: My wife introduced me to this gem. The chicken is seasoned well. The best side is the mac n cheese. I always ordered the smothered chicken and waffles. To me the gravy is awesome.

Text: Amazing food all around. The greens are fabulous, which is always a good sign they're doing it right. Service was fast and friendly. Portions are big, and prices are reasonable. The interior is really nice and great music. There were lots of groups of people all eating and laughing and having a great time. A very fun experience.
