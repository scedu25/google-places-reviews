Text: The service and management what a joke. The server we had took for ever to come to our table that we had to order our drinks at the bar. Then when we told the gerneral manager what had happened didn't care nor did he wanna compensate for what we had to go thru. I was like wow this is a joke right and he said no next time go somewhere else

Text: No frills sports bar with a casual vibe. Came here for the p popular Sunday brunch which includes unlimited Mimosas and beer and includes an unlimited brunch buffet. The food ok, nothing to mouth-watering but for 25 bucks, it's definitely worth it. If gets packed and loud during the time which gives it a lively feel.
