Paddy Long's Beer & Bacon Pub

Text: I went to Paddy Long's with a crew of 5 guys to get the Paddy Bomb. What is it? It's 6lbs of meat wrapped in bacon, served with buns and french fries. We went around 1pm on a Sunday and the place was nearly empty (maybe 2 other tables) which was fine since the waitress/bartender was really nice and attentive anyways. The bomb looked as formidable as it sounds, and while cooked thoroughly, it was a little cold. It was good, in the sense that it's meat and bacon, but at the same time tasted a bit bland without the BBQ sauce. It's definitely a fun thing to do with a crew, but eh wouldn't have to do it again.

Text: Really good staff. Solid beer choices. The everything-is-bacon thing is gimmicky, but there's really nothing wrong with the food. I like this place.

Text: I get seduced by the front patio into coming in here every time. Every time! And yet i forgot to take a picture of it! They have an excellent better selection, but it's kind of pricey. Good was good and interesting. Crowd was cool and so was the staff. Come here!
