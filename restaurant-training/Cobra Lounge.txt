Text: Went for the Halloween event. Paid 12 bucks at the door and felt like we were part of an intimate 90s rock concert. Bands were great, people were friendly and everyone had a great time. Best time at Halloween in a long time.

Text: I eat lunch here fairly often, had everything on the menu at least once. I have my preferences, but have never been disappointed. Usually some good rock/metal playing, though I've heard a lot of things playing. Great patio, and delicious beers. Just go.

Text: We we're in town for the Frozen 4 and stopped by because of the closeness to the train stop. Really wasn't expecting much but boy were we surprised. The beer was outstanding and even better was the food. Our waitress Joey was great, her recommendations for food were spot on! The pork sliders, apple fritter hush puppies, and green beans were some of the best dishes I have ever had. Highly recommend this place! Keep up the good work.

Text: Great outdoor seating area, friendly service and good food. I had the cobra club sandwich with tots. Three types of bbq sauce on the table along with ketchup made for great flavors on the tots! No drinking this visit, but they have a plethora of beers to choose from. Will definitely be back.
