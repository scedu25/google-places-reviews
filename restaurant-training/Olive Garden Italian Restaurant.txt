Text: Our food was really good!  Our waitress did an amazing job!  I wish I remembered her name, because she deserves more praise.  The bread-sticks were not as good as they normally are - but they were still good!  The building is very nice as well, and clean!

Text: Can't go wrong here! Bring your wife and take a break! Friendly service, open and inviting atmosphere. The food is amazing. If you leave here hungry your in trouble. Lunch prices are great. The manager even took the time to visit with us and make sure everything was to our satisfaction!  Great job at the Olive Garden guys. Keep up the awesome work.

Text: The food here is really good!  The service was some of the best in town that I have found anyway!  With the endless basket of bread sticks and endless bowls of pasta, I don't see anyone could here hungry!  So, bring your appetite, you won't be disappointed!

Text: Smallest steak ever! Pasta wasnt the greatest ...endless  bread sticks!? They bring one per person about every 15 min why not just put a bread basket on the table. Only good thing was the salad but not for $55  and my margarita glass was a sticky mess
