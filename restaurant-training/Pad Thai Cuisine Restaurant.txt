Text: Husband, daughter & I stopped in late Tuesday night. We live 5 hours away, all of us were craving Thai. We had the chef to ourselves and he was an absolute delight visiting with us and his Pad Thai was most excellent! He did not disappoint us! Thank you for your hospitality!!

Text: I had the basil chicken lunch special. Pretty good, standard Thai meal, although there was no heat even though it had 1 chili in the menu. Waitress complained about carryout customers, but whatever.

Text: Very good Thai food. Got busy while there so service slowed down with only 1 cook and 1 server. Help wanted sign on door.
