Text: Francesca's is consistently great and, while not cheap, it's generally reasonably priced. The staff are friendly and efficient. The food is great. The atmosphere is very pleasant.  There are other Francesca's locations and in my experience they aren't nearly as good, but Francesca's on Taylor has been a consistent winner for me for years.
