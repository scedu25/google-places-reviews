Honky Tonk BBQ

Text: Stopped in before a show at the concert hall next door.  Just wanted a quick bite.  We had a pork sandwich and a brisket sandwich with a side of Mac N Cheese.  They were all amazing!  Cannot wait to come back and try more items on the menu!

Text: Great food. But, the patrons can either enhance or kill the vibe, depending on when you go. It's a hip little spot that nails the BBQ and music though. I'd recommend giving it a try, if you're ever in the area.

Text: Great food. Very helpful staff with great service. They have $3 PBR tall boys which is great, and I’d recommend the platter to share between 2 people.

Text: They booked this band called 'The Westerlees' and this was one of the most fun times I had. They really had a great energy with the crowd swing dancing. I will definitely be back here again!

Text: Sorry. Not impressed. No smoke ring seen on ribs. Meat didn't fall off bones. Tasted like it came from the steamer. Too much pepper in dry rub. Serving photos show ceramic plates presentation. Actual service plates look like metal pans from yard sale. Empanadas good. Prices good.
