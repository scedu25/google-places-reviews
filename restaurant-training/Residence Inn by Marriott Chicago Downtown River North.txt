Text: Very nice hotel. Room was comfortable, clean and a great place to relax after walking and visiting the sites of Chicago. Nicely located with great places around. The breakfast was pretty decent. The lady who helps there was very nice. She made breakfast extra pleasant.

Text: This was the forth time I have stayed here. This is another great part of the Marriott collection. The staff was supportive and provided me with every level of comfort. Centrally located and easy to get around. I will always recommend this location to family and friends.

Text: The hotel is nice enough. Pricey....way pricey, but probably because of the MLB playoffs...no problems with the room. There is a workout room and a pool/hot tub. Breakfast is pretty standard and does  not vary from day to day. The staff is nice. All in all though, a pleasant experience.

Text: Good City Hotel when you want some extra room.  Entrance is on the 4th floor.  Remodeled lobby and breakfast area.  A couple of blocks away from Michigan, a little more quiet. Breakfast included. Parking is $65 per day.Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.
