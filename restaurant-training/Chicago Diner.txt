Text: I was very skeptical about how the food was going to taste. Mind. Blown. So so good!! The staff was awesome! Loved the decor! Wish there was a place like this on the south side,  will definitely return!

Text: My wife and I had lunch today at the Chicago Diner and it was fabulous.  I had the hash with biscuits and gravy, and she had the country fried veggie steak.  It was delicious.  Our server was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.  The diner reminded me of a small town cafe, but with great visuals on the walls.  We'll come back next time we are in town!

Text: My partner and I were visiting the city and just happened to walk in about 9:45pm. We had no idea we were so close to closing time, the staff were so welcoming. We also had no idea we had walked into a vegetarian restaurant, so that was a pleasant surprise as well! The food was maybe the best vegetarian food either of us ever had. Our server was hilarious, too. Highly recommended!

Text: Finally visited this diner with an old friend who was in town. The restaurant is so crowded that you feel like your neighbors are at your table, and it's loud. The food was good, but not allergy friendly. My friend had one of the lunch specials and was very impressed, saying that despite being vegan the sandwich was really awesome. I had a veggie omelette that was good, but apparently contaminated with gluten. :(

Text: I knew going in it was suppose to be some crazy good food, they did not dissapoint. Good to know meat free doesn't just mean salad! Get dessert...no seriously get it!
