Stardust Bowl 2 of Merrillville
Rating: 5
Text: A family fun entertainment place to go and enjoy yourself with friends and family. If you enjoy bowling they have many leagues that you can join if you're interested. They also offer children leaves on Saturday morning. Some leads play for money at the end of the season some play just for fun.

Text: My friend and I went here to bowl two rounds and asked the girl at the counter to split the cost of two whole rounds, not split the price of one game. When the first round ended I went to bowl and the manager yelled at us for bowling because she said that what we paid for was over. The manager ran over somewhere else before I could come up and talk to her. I know it wasn't the young girls'fault for misunderstanding, but the manager had no need to be so rude. Won't come back here. Happy Birthday to me I guess!

Text: Fun place with plenty of lanes and good deals on bowling. The snack shop is good, the bartender is very friendly and helpful, and the pro shop is great. The front desk personnel are great too.

Text: It's a fun place to bowl but a lot of their games are either broken, out-dated, just swallow the coins. Other then that you'll have a blast and get full off of there amazing Pizza

Text: Went there to drink a few and play pool and drink a few. Got there at 10:50
They close at 12:00 figured I should have enough time to play a game and get a bucket with my buddy. 11:20 rolls around and they say we got 10 minutes. So we have to finish our game and slam our beers..... not to mention all of their pool cues suck. Wish I would have brought my own ,but didn't have it with me. Next time I'll just go to a place that closes when they say not when they want.
