Text: Let me start off first with the fact that I grew up in Alma and had been to this restaurant often back even back when it was called the Depot. I loved this place. Best restaurant in town...now skip forward many years, I moved away and came back to visit family for the 4th of July. My in laws and husband have NEVER been to this restaurant and we're eager to try it. So we go and order steak. We all ordered medium rare and my husband and I ordered sweet tea to drink. We got unsweetened tea, undercooked steak that was luke warm..like it sat on the plate for 20minutes before they served us our plates...we paid 85$ for our food only to be disappointed. I was very disappointed bc this place used to have great food and awesome staff. What happened?
Side note: glad to see they still had money on the ceiling!
