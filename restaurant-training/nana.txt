Text: Okay, our server looked soooooooo similar to the lady in the painting. She also had a tattoo where the lady had a glowing jewel. And then we'd be looking at it, and she'd walk through our field of view and then turn and look at us with her face exactly superimposed over the lady's from the painting! Once, she stopped in front of us and turned sideways, taking the same pose! I'm pretty sure it was intentional, it made the experience a lot of fun ^_^ Oh, yeah, the food was good, too ?

Text: An interesting upscale diner that blends American and Latin cuisine. Only open for breakfast and lunch. Has outdoor seating in the summer and the inside is covered in beautiful paintings. It can be a little loud inside so it's not ideal for conversations but it's all over of my favorite brunch places. 
There are lots of healthy and how free options and they source most of their food locally.  They also serve great coffee and offer cocktails and beer.

Text: I had the plantain sandwich. It was good. I like the atmosphere and the service was excellent. I think we went at the wrong time. Brunch was only available. I'll be back soon and will update my review accordingly.
