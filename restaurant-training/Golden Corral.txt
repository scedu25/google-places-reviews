Golden Corral

Text: Great selection of food and tons of deserts. I wish the salad section was a bit bigger but it's adequate. They have cooked ham sliced just for you at lunch, classic comfort food such as chicken and potroast. Lots of great sides to pick from, and oh yeah, lots of deserts including a chocolate fondue fountain. Everything tasted really great for buffet food. I will go back, I love the variety.

Text: Decent buffet for what it is. Meets expectations. Extensive choices. Some are hits some are misses. Most are acceptable. This isn't fine dinning. Worthwhile with the right expectations.

Text: The golden coral in Coleraine Oh was terrible. We got there at 9:30 pm. We asked the girl at the counter what time they closed because we saw them taking food away she said I don't know and yelled for I think her name was Chalice. She said 10pm and website said 11pm. It was my son birthday and that is where he wanted to eat. I asked her since you don't have a full menu will it be full price?  Very rudely said yes and that it was 17 dollars per person even for my son who is 8 and the website has price for 13 dollars.  So we left I heard her say I don't want those people in HERE!  Not sure what she meant by that but I felt insulted.  Then people walked in after us and they served them. So not sure what type of people and place you are running I work in customer service and have never been treated so rudely especially as soon as you walk in the door.  On my son birthday no less. I used to eat there often but not anymore.  Train your staff in customer service also the parking lot had dirty diapers I almost stepped on one. It is sad really how poor customer service is at your facility.  9/15
