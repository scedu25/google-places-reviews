Text: The food is amazing here.  If you want really good homemade Cole slaw, then this is the place you're looking for.  I had the grilled pork tenderloin sandwich (aka the Naked Pygmy) and my husband had the smoked chicken breast sandwich (sorry, don't remember the name of it) and both were amazing!  Also, the bartender is very friendly - even to newbies like us!  Come and enjoy an afternoon or evening out here!  You'll enjoy it!

Text: It doesn't look like much on the outside but the ambiance on the inside is awesome. A lot of items are smoked..tasty. Definitely a place you can kick back and relax.  The help are friendly and don't rush you. At one time this was a bank and you can go into what was once the vault.

Text: EVERY entre features smoked meat. Smoked meat is NOT a favorite of mine, though it was ok here,  I"d have preferred something NOT smoked! I was with other people and had no choice of dining. Please offer something for those of us who don't like smoked meat!
