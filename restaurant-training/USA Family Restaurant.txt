Text: USA Family Restaurant is everything a small town diner should be: Lots of menu selections, very friendly service, and good food. There are no gimmicks here, and I've never seen this place without customers. The chefs are quick and get orders right every time.

Text: Nice small town restaurant that has soups that go great with the dinner rolls they also serve (I usually ask for extra). It's a perfect place for a family meal. I'm a fan of their burgers, but they make so much more. My only warning is to make sure you save some room for dessert.

Text: This restaurant would've gotten a 4- or 5-star review, because the Reuben sandwich and potato salad was really yummy, but we were displeased with the steak fajitas. The meat was tough, and the meal came with only three tortillas, which was significantly disproportionate to the amount of fajitas on the plate. We asked for more and the waitress brought them, but neglected to mention that there was a charge for extra tortillas. We have never dined at a restaurant that not only doesn't provide all that you need for the entree, but also charges extra when you ask for it. Furthermore, this meal comes with chips and salsa, which we declined, so they saved money there. While the charge was only $1.69, the principle of the matter is that a meal should include all the necessary side items that accompany it. If you eat here, be sure to ask about hidden charges before you order.
