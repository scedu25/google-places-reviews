Text: Went for half-priced maki on a Sunday. No waiting, quick service. The rolls were so delicious, perfect proportions. Service was friendly and kind. I'd definitely come back. Recommend.

Text: Horrible sushi, you can tell it is frozen, the texture is terrible. Didn't even finish the dish I got.
