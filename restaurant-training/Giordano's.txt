Text: I have been here or ordered from here multiple times and have always had great food and service.  However, I ordered takeout last night and my stuffed pizza was not up to par.  Half of the pizza was under cooked or something and I called in about it.  The manager was super nice and offered us another pizza even though we were able to eat half and the issue may have even been caused by excess water from a poor topping choice (no more spinach for take out). Anyway, great establishment and they really do care if you enjoyed your experience or not.

Text: One of the best dining experiences I've ever had was here. I was visiting from CA and decided to try out this place. The service was excellent. The waitress was so kind and helpful. We got service you would expect at a 5 star restaurant .

Text: We had a party of forty-five, sixteen of which were very hungry soccer players. Made reservations earlier in the week and they were very accommodating.  Had it all set up for us when we got there and the service was great even though they had another huge party right before ours. Food was excellent. Only reason I gave it only four stars was because it was very hot in the back where we were seated. I know there were a lot of people but the air didn't seem to be working.

Text: Would have LOVED to have had a deep dish tonight...but after being seated in a section right away and then IGNORED for twenty minutes, we walked out. It would have been different if the server hadnt walked into our section FIVE times to help the other customers there without even acknowledging we were there. To make matters worse as we were pointing this out to the manager who seated us, he was so busy helping the other people waiting to be seated, all he had was a rushed 'Sorry'. Really very dissatisfied and of course, hungry.....?
