Text: Stopped by late for a quick snack to share. Tuna Melt was surprisingly good and fries were pretty good. Overall, service was great and food tasty — and priced right. I’d definitely visit again!

Text: The existence of vegetarian chili cheese fries on their menu is enough to recommend them alone! But the atmosphere at Medici's is great, the staff super friendly, and their food is in general great. Their fries don't travel well, so definitely recommend eating there rather than delivery, but their delivery service is generally fast and reliable. Also recommend their strawberry lemonade, which I'm pretty sure is made with seltzer water and is totally amazing.

Text: Don't eat here as often as I used to, but used to eat in restaurant as well as order pizza here when I was a student. The food is solid, quality, casual dining fare. I think their pizza is underrated and one of the best options in Hyde Park.

Text: Comfortable casual atmosphere with great service. The air is filled with the smells of great home-cooked bread perfectly cooked burgers and other treats like pastries and special items on the menu. Visiting Chicago for a while and really looking forward to going back

Text: I love how they can split the cheapest bill. And the service is great too. But the food is even better and the price range is great for the portion size amen.
