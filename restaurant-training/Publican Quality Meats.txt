Text: Simply amazing.. the sandwich I has was very good! And the charcuterie board we had was also just simply amazing.. from the house mustards to the sourdough bread. Everything about this place is on point!

Text: Wait staff pleasant, soup was good but the take out market salad mediocre. I've had better for half the price. Music was very loud, this is not senior friendly. Counter person not friendly, wouldn't suggest it to friends. Wish them well. The bread is good.

Text: Food tasted decent, but expensive. The entire outside stank of sewer. The kitchen and freezer was right next to restroom without any walls in between... I'm talking hygenic!
