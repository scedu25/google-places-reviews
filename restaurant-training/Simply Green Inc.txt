Text: Gross.
I've been there a couple times and i thought that it was actually not bad.

Today, I had a nice surprise in my salad.
I started eating my salad when suddenly something felt wrong in my mouth.
Something was not right, really crunchy for a salad.
I spit it out and there was lying on my salad a 2 inches long grasshopper.
Grossssss.

I took it back, did not make a scene, and before the guy gave me my money back, he asked me if i wanted another salad instead.....

H3LL no!!!!!!!

Ain't going back over there
