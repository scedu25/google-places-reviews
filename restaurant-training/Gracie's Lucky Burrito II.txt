Text: Went today on lunch--I do frequent the location as it's close to work.  Today my experience was so terrible, I took the time to write about it. While the food is ok, not many choices in the area, I usually go there for the quick service.  When I walked in, I stood in line behind someone who appeared to be paying for their order.  The young lady behind the counter walked away.  Didn't strike me as odd, then no one came to the window.  After standing there a couple minutes, another young lady comes to the window, stands there, says a couple words to her co-worker and closes the window.  I'm still standing there.  I open the window and asks where can I pay for a to go order.  She does not respond.  I assume she didn't understand me.  When another young lady assisted me, I explained what occurred.  Her response, "She does that all the time!"  She apologized profusely and really felt bad.  Food not bad, service from that particular person today, TERRIBLE enough for me not to give you any more of my money!!!!

Text: Food looks good and the amount of food is ok, the flavor still needs some love in it, as well as the temperature of it! But averall it is a good place for something fast to eat.

Text: Authentic Mexican food and friendly service. Though it seems they can only speak spanish, but I don't have trouble with that.
