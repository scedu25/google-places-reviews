Mancino's Pizza & Grinders
Rating: 5
Text: We love this place! Great grinders, and pretty good pizzas. I like the salads too, but rarely get them. They daily lunch specials wrote in their chalk board inside restaurant. They also have a "text club". Where on your first text u get free garlic cheesy bread. ? then after that about every two-three weeks they send you additional deals. They also have kids meals, and they are reasonably priced. I usually get the mancinos club. But there are enough options to make everyone in your party happy!

Text: Good pizza, better sandwiches (grinders).  Only get a half grinder unless you're buying for two.

Text: We placed a large order for work, sent an email with detailed list of each item for each person. When we received our food - we were missing a club, pizza sub, and also received a hair in one of the salads. 

I love Mancino's but if they can't build an order off a list then something needs changed. Very disappointing! 

To find a hair in our salad was also upsetting especially since it turned our appetite off! 

Don't let my One time experience affect your thinking! They are worth a shot!
