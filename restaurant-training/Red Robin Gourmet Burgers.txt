Text: Been going here for a long time. The food is good and the bottomless fries are truly wonderful. Do yourself a favor and get a side of campfire sauce to dip things in, you won't regret it. Went here this past Monday night with a large group of guys and the restaurant and they handled it without any delay! 
Our server Sam was fantastic! Always courteous, a bit sarcastic and charming. She was swift and accurate.

Text: I did a review about 4 yrs ago. The burgers still taste great. The only difference is the portion size. Just my guess, but I'd say the burger size has been reduced by at least 30% since my original 5-star review. I had my expectations set & now I feel like I'm getting less than that expectation. I used to take the family there about once every 2 months. Now, maybe once per year. Corporate-wise, smaller portions at the same price = greater ROI for the investors. Family-wise, smaller portions = not enough ROI for me to make the investment.

Text: 5 stars because this is the only franchise I enjoy eating at besides Chipotle, so I'm grateful it was here while I was traveling.  Reliable place for a good burger.  Trisha F was an exceptional waitress who made the experience a lot nicer than it might have been and brought fries to supplement the dismal fruit salad.

Text: Attentive And Quick Service, Awesome Food, And Pleasant Atmosphere. Husband had burger with mac 'n cheese which he said was very good -- had a bit of a spicy taste and liked it. Myself, the Alaskan Cod Fish and chips. Smaller pieces than I expected but very filling!!!  Definitely will be back!
