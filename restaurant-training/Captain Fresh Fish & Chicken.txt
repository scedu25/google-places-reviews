Captain Fresh Fish & Chicken

Text: The best chicken around!  The owner tells me the chicken is all delivered fresh in the morning and never frozen.  The skin melts in your mouth and you cannot beat the prices.  Way better than the chains and the hyped boutique fried chicken places in the City.

Text: I'm giving them ONE star because the workers tried to play me for a foul. Noticed that there were fries sitting in the basket that appeared to be old, pointed over to the basket, told them I didnt want those fries, and asked for fresh fries. Saw them drop fresh fries BUT then noticed the OLD fries from the other basket were gone. Get my food and here I got some light fresh looking fries and some that looked like they were cooked longer which is impossible UNLESS you put the OLD fries back in so they appear to be fresh too. REALLY! After I specifically said i didn't want the old fries you give them to me anyway thinking I wouldn't notice. Had my business up to this point.

Text: If you are looking for a great dine-in experience....this is not the place. If you are looking for something greasy after a night at the bar, LOOK NO FURTHER! 

Their Chitterlings, fried fish, fried chicken, gyros, Italian beef, and philly are all excellent. I love the mild sauce! 

Even better -- you can place your order and walk to the liquor store next door. ;P 

For this neighborhood, they are the best option and are open late!

Text: Y'all just suck.. Why can't you ever get a simple Italian beef right? And god forbid you call and ask for it to be fixed it ain't happening... Plus it takes 40 mins at least for the damn food even when u call ahead y'all ain't that damn busy.. Ugh
