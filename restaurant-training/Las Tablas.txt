Text: Very good food.  We go here often.  It can be very crowded and loud in the dining room,  but I guess that's pretty much every restaurant in the city.  This most recent time we had a bad experience with the wait staff.  Had a super drunk table next to us that smashed a bottle and got into a fight while using the bathroom, but was allowed to carry on until they decided to leave.  Also had a bad interaction with a pregnant member of the waitstaff who tried to power past my wife's chair and then failing to achieve that goal yelled at my wife about not being considerate of pregnant people.  I find this accusation unlikely to be true as we were seated with our 3 year old, 2 year old, and 2 MONTH old.

We will be back for the food but if service and the atmosphere are this bad again, we will cross this place off the list and im sure many others will too.
