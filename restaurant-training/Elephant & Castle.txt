Text: Really a nice place to visit. The waiter who served us had very good knowledge about everything in the menu. Everything was nice and tidy. Food was delicious, especially the british beer was amazing! Definitely a go go!

Text: Usually have several really good beers on tap.  From what I recall they also have a decent scotch selection.   Its got a nice interesting atmosphere as well.

Text: One of the better and cheaper casual dining restaurants in the loop. It's not haute cuisine, but there are a variety of British and American themed comfort foods available with a little something for everybody. Good appetizers, soup and salad variety in addition to main courses, all good food at good value. A great stop when you're travel-weary and need a warm meal late in the evening.

Text: The food was good, if not a bit over priced for the quality.  Standard British menu items.  The beer selection was adequate but not outstanding.  They had all of the standard beers to be sure, but their "craft selection was limited to the standard stuff.  I didn't notice and unique beers from the UK.

Text: Went for breakfast service was good, typical breakfast. though the banger tasted as if they spilled a jar of pepper in it.  Pricing is about average for the city ( higher than normal for everywhere else)
