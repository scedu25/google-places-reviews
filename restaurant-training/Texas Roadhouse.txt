Texas Roadhouse

Text: The Texas Road house is a great restaurant. There is no shortage of peanuts to snack on,   there is fresh warm bread with cinnamon sugar butter to dip into at the table when you are seated. Servers are quick and courteous.  The food is delicious, my steak was tender, juicy and properly cooked as requested. My wife's slab of ribs was also tender and juicy, the meat fell apart like good ribs should. The restaurant is a great place for groups or individuals, with a bar and tv's strategically placed around the establishment. We even seen two kids have a birthday party here and the restaurant went out of their way to make it special for the two boys. All and all a great restaurant!

Text: Went on a "Father Daughter Date" with my six year old. Service was fantastic. Food was great as always. Our server was Kara. She was great at having a conversation and interacting with us at a table, but  didn't feel like she hovered all night. We had cheesy fries. Cooked perfectly. Kid had ribs and mashed potatoes and they were as always excellent. I had a 16 oz. Ribeye by recommendation of Kara. Everything was done exactly as we ordered it. If I could give a 6 out of 5 I would. Great job overall and we will be back again.

Text: Service is good and your food is prepared fast. The price is reasonable if not cheap so don't expect to have an excellent meal. It's just a good meal for the price I believe the chain accomplished what they want to be to the public.

Text: First, the food is top notch. Second they happily cook your second, any way you want without judging a well done request (which they get right the first tine). Last, the value can't be beat even in a steak town like Omaha
