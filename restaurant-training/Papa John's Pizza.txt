Papa John's Pizza
Rating: 1
Text: Well where to begin. Ordered my food online $10 Cheddar Cheese Burger pizza for $10 with $6 bacon cheese sticks with a ranch cup and Brownie to boot, total $25.60. After placing order I called them to add on a 2 liter soda which then ran it up to $33+ O.o What the hell! After explaining that I order it online they finally lowered the price to $29. Driver showed up with no soda and after opening the box for the cheese sticks there is no Ranch cup either. I normal love Papa John's but this is WAY BELOW their standards! I use to work for them and I should know.
