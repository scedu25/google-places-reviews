Gino's Steak House
Rating: 5
Text: Went there for my birthday celebration. They were able to accommodate my party which was 15 people without any issues. We had plenty of room. The food was excellent, so worth the steak house price. I had the rack of lamb. It was prepared perfectly and tasted awesome! The service was also excellent. Definitely recommend this place for a dinner party or a quiet dinner for two.

Text: I called to make a reservation and they told me they could not accommodate for that many people. The funniest thing is I been making a reservation there for the last three years for my company. The manager was very rude to me and needs to go back to school on how to talk to people and learn how to run a business. The place must be going down hill if you let anyone in there without a reservation. And please stop serving old crab legs my wife got sick there and nothing was done.

Text: I took my boyfriend out for his birthday and we would have been happier at Wendy's. The service was horrible. Not only was our waitress uninformed of the specials but uncaring we were celebrating his special day! The cocktails we ordered were either pumped up with sugar or drowning in sour lemon juice. Our steaks we orderer were still walking/ raw when we asked for med. raw. The potatoes were from a box with powed garlic mixed in.  We didnt stay for dessert and it wasn't even asked. 
We had to wait for our food to come out then our waitress was ready to box it up in 3 minuted. Can't believe they are still in business
