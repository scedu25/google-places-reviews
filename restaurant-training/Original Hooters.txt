Original Hooters

Text: Yesterday I went to hooters for my first time. And let me tell you, it was clean, very good welcome. Didn't have to wait to be seated. Food was so good. Never had chicken like that before. Our waitress made sure we were okay. None of the workers were rude.

Text: Ok, so I never believed it when people told me they went to Hooters for the wings but good lord was I wrong. Those wings and those fried pickles are absolute heaven! I've never had fried pickles I liked until we went here.

Definitely ask your waitress to bring you samples of the sauce before you order. I wound up getting the mild. Nice and crispy on the outside. Crunchy on the inside. My husband loves spicy stuff and said the spicier wings were really good too.
I'd say the only downside here is the dress code. Being a heterosexual female, I found the abundance of butt cheeks a bit unsavory.

The place was pretty darn crowded and the wait was longish but worth it.

Text: Best wings ever. Get all drum sticks hot and double dip. You won't regret it. Blue cheese is on point as well as the ranch. Shrimp hot is amazing as well.
