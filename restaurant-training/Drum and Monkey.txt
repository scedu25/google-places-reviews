Text: I've been here a couple of times. The music is always loud but the second time it was just too loud. Not a fan of that. 

Ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries, both were great with a nice mayo dip. Would have liked more dip as there were lots of fries. 

Will update review once I actually eat something there.

Text: This place was great. Just a nice casual neighborhood bath with good prices and specials. Ben the bartender was great to meet and talk to. They had a pretty great playlist playing (lots of indie rock) before the dj showed up, who switched to remixes of top 40 as the crowd shifted. Would have preferred the indie rock but not a big deal, later night crowd probably doesn't. All in all though I had a great experience here.

Text: Just a bar. Nothing more, nothing less. With Three Aces gone, this could be one of the better ones on Taylor Street. Pretty random crowd when I was there (early-mid evening) - some old regulars, some super young college kids, which is pretty cool. On the other hand, there was a DJ setting up at around 11 when I was heading out, so it likely flips heavy college crowd late night.
