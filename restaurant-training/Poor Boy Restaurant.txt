Text: Super tasty food, great service, and awesome value. I ordered a half barbecue chicken dinner and usually restaurants give you really small chickens but this place doesn't mess around. It was a pretty solid portion and I'm really satisfied with everything. You get your food, you sit down and eat. Simple and great

Text: Great food, great service, great price! No complaints, it wasn't a mind blasting meal, but it was good food and filling. Perfect for the price range

Text: Didn't like the fountain soda had unpleasant after taste, fish sandwich was tasty. Love the fries had a nice amount.

Text: At first I was a little nervous about going to get an intalian beef from the area, I read the reviews, & gave it a try.. It was so delicious, I got mine dipped w/mozzarella cheese, hot & sweet peppers& cup of cheese for the fries. My pop was kind of flat though, &its not even expensive.

Text: Worst philly I have ever had in my entire life. Like who the flip makes a Philly with Italian beef meat. It was a wretched experience. The staff wasn’t even that nice they didn’t talk to their customers. Never coming here again!
