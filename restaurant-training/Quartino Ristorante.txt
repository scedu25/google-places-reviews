Text: Awesome restaurant!! Food was phenomenal!! Atmosphere was upscale but cozy. The service was fantastic. Our server was nice, attentive but not overly so. She also was very knowledgeable of the menu if I could've given more stars I would've.

Text: Amazing food. Really great crust on the pizza, light and crispy with just enough cheese. Risotto was okay but the pasta was very well made. The seasonal beetroot salad with cheese was really nicely marinated, I added a bit of vinaigrette that was on the table to get some additional taste. Overall a great experience! Bookable online :)

Text: We came to Quartino on a Thursday night for a private event in the Wine Room. The whole night was a great experience. Our event was for a post-proposal dinner between two families. The service was great, not rushed. We got to use the TV to display a slideshow. Before the event, I called the restaurant several times to coordinate the use of the TV and they always answered my questions. I highly recommend using the Wine Room for private events.

Text: I dine here at least once a month and the food is consistently amazing, and I love the small plate/sharing style of dining. Service can be a bit hit or miss, but generally friendly and smooth. It would also be nice for us regulars if the menu changed occasionally. Its kinda loud and fun, so maybe not a great place for a romantic date, or business meeting. Great for a group though, plenty of variety for everyone, and sharing is always fun.

Text: The food is so good here. I just love they're small plates and sharing menu items. It's really one of the best places to go and have a quick bite and a glass of wine when you're in between things downtown. The service so friendly and so on top of their game, it's really a pleasure to spend time in this restaurant.
