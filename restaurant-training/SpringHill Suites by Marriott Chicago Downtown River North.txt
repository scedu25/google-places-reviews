SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Downtown/River North
Rating: 5
Text: Awesome hotel! Extremely hospitable staff. If you can, stay on one of the higher floors for a nice view. Spacious rooms with nice amenities. We visit the city fairly often so this will definitely become one of our staple stays. And there's free breakfast!!

Text: This hotel is great! My spouse stays here often for work. The rooms are clean and the beds comfy. The staff at breakfast make the whole stay worth it, they're so friendly! It's nice and centrally located in Chicago, close to lots of things. My only complaint is the amount of chlorine in the pool/whirlpool, but that seems pretty standard.

Text: We were in Chicago for a wedding and SpringHills Suites was a great place to stay. The facilities were nice, the location is central, and the staff was very nice and accommodating. They helped us out so we can be on the same floor as the rest of our family, and even provided items we forgot to pack like a toothbrush and razor. The breakfast was good but what made our stay great was the friendly service. I would definitely recommend the SpringHill Suites if you're in Chicago.

Text: This was a wonderful location for our family weekend in Chicago.  Near all of the downtown attractions, and the breakfast was wonderful.  Only 2 things prevented me from giving 5 stars...they do not have ice makers on the floors, so you have to go to the lobby for ice or call the front desk...and there were no rooms available when we wanted to go back in October.
