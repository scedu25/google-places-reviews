Text: Wonderful coffee shop and cafe located in downtown Valpo one block east of the square.  Large menu for both breakfast and lunch with wonderful food and some of the best coffee in town.   Great bakery selection of homemade pies, cookies, pastries, and more.  Comfortable atmosphere makes it welcoming for families as well.

Text: Great coffee and food!  Staff is friendly.  Expect to possibly encounter a wait. Not fast food, a place to sit and enjoy your food outside of the rat race

Text: Big fan. On a soup bender and they keep a great rotation of homemade soups daily to keep it "fresh" for me.

Text: Coffee is great and reasonably priced! Staff could be a bit more friendly. Maybe not much experience in the restaurant business.

Text: One of the best cafes in Valpo. They have good food and an incredible loose lead tea collection. Being a tea enthusiast I love this place! Very chill atmosphere too.
