Domino's Pizza
Rating: 5
Text: Ordered pizza for our late night cravings on the Dominos app. Super freaking easy to use. I made special instructions to not ring the doorbell because I've got kids sleeping, and the delivery guy, Matthew, was awesome enough to call us when he was coming up the street to make sure he didn't wake the kids. Freaking awesome. ?? Chatted with him about his night, and he's honestly the nicest delivery guy my friend and I have ever met. His wife and kids should be proud ?????? Good job Matthew . OH AND THE PIZZA IS GREAT ?

Text: Ordered from here 5 or 6 times and it has always been good. Your not going to get a $20+ pizza for $8 but you will get a very good $8 pizza.

Text: So far, my boy ceaser that's supposed to be delivering this pizza and garlic knots isn't here from a 2.2 mile destination after like 20 minutes of saying he was on the way. Wth Ceaser, we really counted on you. ** UPDATE** so freaking Ceaser just cancelled our dang order. Dang Ceaser. We are so disappointed. And to think I almost had faith and gave you three stars.
