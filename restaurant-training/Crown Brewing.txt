Text: Easy growler and howler fills off I65 - less than 10 min detour.  Inside a pizza parlor.  Smelled good.  Good service.  Easy parking.

Text: This place is perfect.  Good beer.  Good food.  Excellent staff.  It is small, which adds to the appeal.  Nice outdoor seating for the warm months.

Text: One of my favorites in NWI.  Quiet lounge area with lots of room.  Beers are delicious and so is the pizza.  Sunday you get a XL for the price of a large pizza.  Nice place and I will be going back!
