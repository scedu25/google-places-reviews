Text: They have one line for pick up and ordering...i ordered ahead to avoid waiting in line behind mofos who havent even made up their mind of what they want just holing up the line. They have one cashier taking phone calls and taking care of the guests in the place and this one guy also serves the drinks. Not a good spot, never parking i also had to park in double lane, horrible just horrible i waited in line for 10mins just to pick up and order i placed 15mins prior to arriving for pick up smh never again i mean i only paid like $27 something for food mind you when i called to order i was put on hold by this one cashier doing everything! Give the guy a break, get him some help!
