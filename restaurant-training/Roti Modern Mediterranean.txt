Text: Go to this restaurant if you like being herded like cattle and treated like a 1st graded to get your food. Terrible Experience...The food was actually pretty good, but the quality of service was on another level of bad. The attitude of the employees when I made a simple request was very poor. When I asked to purchase an extra pita, they immediately threw my bowl back to the start of the line, 10 orders behind me, and made me walk back to the start and repeat my request. At that point, I got a roll of the eyes and was told I already got one and the girl shoved my order forward and ignored me. Yes, I knew I had already gotten one, I wanted an extra... Never going back if this is what I can expect.

Text: Great food. I recommend the chicken kabob rice plate. You can pick and choose the extra ingredients such as cucumbers and tomatoes and Dill yogurt sauce.

Text: I've eaten here several times. The food seems fresh and the staff have always been efficient but friendly. I feel like I'm eating a healthy option while getting a decent value.

Text: This place is amazing! I brought one of my close girl friends here for her birthday. The atmosphere was very dark and romantic but my friend and I still had a great time. They even gave us a free dessert because of her birthday! The service was great except it took a while for them to bring us our beer & wine. We already finished our basket of bread so I think our server probably forgot? Oh well.. I would love to come back on a date night sometime :)
