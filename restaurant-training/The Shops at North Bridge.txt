The Shops at North Bridge
Rating: 4
Text: A very nice downtown Chicago mall. Well designed and visually appealing. No one is rushing but seems to be moving fast. Good store offerings but not much of a selection of food variety. Remember they have Downtown prices that includes excellent service. Great Place For Selfie.

Text: Nice place. Perfect place for the slow day, "take your time" shopping. Prices aren't too bad, when one considers where one's shopping, and by that I mean not only the store, but downtown Chicago on Michigan Avenue. For the prices, however, I truly do wish I could find ANYTHING made in the U.S., or at an ally, but good luck with that anywhere I guess.

Text: I walked the area a couple time and saw lots the second time I hadn't seen. The place is packed with shops, stores, and restaurants. There seemed to be a lot of construction going on and the sidewalks were really messy. You have to watch out for the road material slung down with the intention of helping transition from places under construction and those not or the road. You could end up with tar all over your shoes. If you plan to use GPS to find a place you could have difficulty. It has difficulty because of all the tall building and multiple levels. It might be wise to get a map from the hotel too.

Text: It's a very beautiful shopping complex although the general attitudes of the staff could be better. Very metropolitan and a great selection of stores. A great general area for Chicago city shopping.

Text: I liked how this mall was built up instead of out.

Visiting from Texas, it was different how this mall was elevated. I would prefer all malls be this way. Less walking and I am more inclined to spend money if I'm not tired ...
