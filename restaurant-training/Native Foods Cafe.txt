Native Foods Cafe

Text: My wife and I were in Chicago for our anniversary, and we stopped in here twice. The food is amazing, the staff is very friendly, and the atmosphere is wonderful. We were particularly impressed with the Native Chicken Wings (crispy), both naked and buffalo. I also really enjoyed the meatball sub and we both thought the oatmeal creme pie tasted just like you would expect from one in a box (in a good way). We were very happy with our experience and look forward to stopping in again whenever we are in the city.

Text: The best Native Foods location in my opinion. The staff is awesome and super nice even when you come in 15 minutes before closing. The food is to die for! You NEED to try the buffalo chicken wings!! Or anything chicken there is really above and beyond anything!

Text: When it comes to your favorite chains, consistency is key. I tried the Native Foods Cafe in San Diego as well at this location; and the bistro steak sandwich is just as delectable. Great place to catch up with friends and people watch. The lavender lemonade is fantastic! ?

Text: Came to the restaurant well out of my way, excited to enjoy a proper Vegan meal.  After a long wait, the Macro Bowl was disappointing: undercooked crunchy rice, tired looking kale, soggy tempeh.  Sauce was nice.   A piece of random cauliflower in there, telling me something is amiss in the kitchen.  I give stars for courteous counter service and the enjoyment I see in other patrons.

Text: LOVE this all plant-based restaurant chain! Seasonal menu features in addition to mainstays. Be sure to get your frequent customer card and get a free meal. Love animals, eat plants. #vegan
