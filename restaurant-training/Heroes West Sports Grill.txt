Text: Great drink selection for a sports bar. One of the few places to get gumball head on tap! Food is also pretty good as well, I recommend the burgers.

Text: Really horrible experience. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. But everything you get here you have to ask for. Get a burger well if you want any toppings you have to be the one to bring it up otherwise you will get a plain burger. The biggest problem here was my waitress, Taylor. She came by my table probably 3 times the whole visit. One to take my order. One to drop off my food. One to collect her money. I needed a fork the entire meal but she was nowhere to be found. It was obvious The check was supposed to be split but wasn't. When we needed her to split it we had to wait for 20 minutes. Just the way she talked to us was horrible. I felt discriminated. I would understand if they were busy, But they were not! Horrible visit will never be back

Text: Delicious food but the bar needs help.  I ordered the same drink 3 times and everyone tasted different.  The final onne was juice because they ran out of cherries.  Instead of charging me $9 for juice how bout ask me if i would like to try something else.  My husband order a martini and it was less than half way filled.  We asked our server where the rest of it was with no response.  Come fornthe food wine and beer skip the cocktails
