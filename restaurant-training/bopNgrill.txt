Text: I ordered the Loco Burger and kimchi fries. Overall, I liked the food and the place had a good atmosphere for a quick bite. However, I found the food quite salty and had to drink a lot of water to get through it all. Additionally, Restaurant cleanliness could be improved, I noticed quite a food crumbs on our table and around the floor.

Text: Tried an unique and delicious BNG burger with bacon, onion, and egg.  Homestyle fries are amazing and worth the visit by themselves.  Service was quick and although I ordered carry out, the ambience inside seemed really nice.

Text: Their bNg is a great tasting burger! All the ingredients make it great. Even the fries are good. Not overly salted and/or seasoned. Even the location is great. Close to the beach so you can go for a walk on the beach after you're done eating. And let all that food digest with a calm listening of the waves afterwards. We certainly did. I'd for sure recommend.

Text: Amazing fusion Korean restaurant near Loyola. I love this place. The atmosphere is very casual. I love eating outside during the summer. Favorite things: kimchi fries, bi bim bop with barbecue chicken added, and chicken katsu.
