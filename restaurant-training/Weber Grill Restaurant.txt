Text: This was a great place to eat with a 2 year old. It's upscale but not stuffy. Our waiter, Richard, was great and so was everyone else. The kid's meal was one of the best. It came with veges, fruit, tater tots, meat and a cookie. My son loved it. Our meal was very delicious. We had the brisket, lamb chops and prime rib. All of it was juicy, well seasoned, and very tender!!! I wish they were in NYC. I would definitely come back again!!!

Not my first visit nor will it be my last.

Text: Another great experience at a Weber Grill. Andres was our server and did a fantastic job.  He knew the menu inside and out, was attentive and creates a wonderful experience.  The 15th Anniversary burger was amazing.  My husband had a half rack of ribs and they were tender and flavorful.

Text: This was sadly my worst Weber Grill experience. I went several times in Indiana and loved it. I was assuming the quality would be the same especially considering the area. The mac and cheese seemed to be powered. I was very disappointed, but thankful that it wasn't my first experience with the company. The gentleman taking my order was nice but seemed a bit over the place. I would love a chance to speak with the manager regarding my food. I will update if I recieve a call
