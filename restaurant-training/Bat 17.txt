Text: Great casual sandwich place in Evanston. Huge portions and large list of craft beers. The bar seating area is quite cramped so those that don't like getting cozy may prefer a table. The prices are on the higher end hence 4 star rating. 33 dollars for a chicken sandwich and 2 beers is a bit much.

Text: Amazing beer selection, generous sized burgers and sandwiches. Beer towers. Salads. Sides. Nachos! Also serves brunch. Bat 17 also has a pool bar next door. Definitely an Evanston establishment!

Text: I would have gave this place 5 stars because the food is amazing! But we drove all the way here for the food and pool hall and they do not have pool tables like advertised! They should change their website and let people know that they no longer have pool tables available

Text: Came hungry, left full.  Burger was above average, sweet potato fries good, and local IPA beer good as well.  No shortage of sports on TV.  Both White Sox and Cubs on at the same time.  Nice!

Text: Pretty decent.  Not the most amazing. They need to quit bragging about a "best of" ranking that is several years old.
