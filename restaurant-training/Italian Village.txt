Text: What a wonderful Chicago restaurant! I'm so glad to have experienced this to its fullest! From the time you walk in, get seated, order, refills, receive your foods, through to the end of getting out the front the door, the customer service is the best along with the food. The food is prepared with intention for your taste buds to have an experience on their own. Go there. You won't be disappointed.

Text: Great date Spot. Best Shirley temple you’ll ever have.  Amazing service.  Delicious food.  Atmosphere is stunning. I’ve been coming here with my family for New Years dinner for years and it’s become one of my favorite family traditions!

Text: Amazing atmosphere! We celebrated an anniversary and they surprised us with a slice of cake to share for free. Very nice! Food is amazing! Expect higher prices when entering but it is worth it! Service is incredible!

Text: Peter is the best server! Very kind and made sure our food came out perfectly. Super good food and great atmosphere however the rest of the servers/staff were running around a lot, looked to be very stressed and in a hurry. everyone should be a little bit calmer to give the restaurant a relaxed, more "take your time" vibe.

Text: Visited in 2014.  My wife and I ate here on our vacation to Chicago. The Italian Village is one of three restaurants in one building and this is the one is in the TOP floor. The service is great and Italian! The ambiance and decor is great and Italian! The food is great and Italian! Point is that this is a genuine Italian fine dining experience for a reasonable price.
