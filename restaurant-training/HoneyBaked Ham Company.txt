Text: I always get a boxed lunch with the ham classic on a croissant. It is literally the perfect lunch.   They give you the option of your sandwich,  a sml side, a cookie, a spear pickle, and a drink.    It's a beyond  delicious sandwich.  If you haven't been in there before the staff is really nice about helping you out.

Text: Absolutely the best ham ever! The employees and owners are the nicest. They may have a higher price than Walmart but you will not have the owners of Walmart deliver to you or walk your products to the car for you either. I can not say enough about this place and I will order my hams from them for every holiday.
