Text: Fantastic popcorn. Got the one with caramel and cashews which was delicious. Reasonably priced as well, about $5 for a bag of popcorn.

Text: They seems to be a bit busier than others I have been to.  While that means a little extra wait at times it also means fresh popcorn. 

The staff I have had is always very pleasant and the service is quick.

Text: Standard example of a Garrett's.  Popcorn is fresh.   Why I'd go here vs. the ones on Michigan Ave?  NO LINES.  EVER.

Text: Chicago just isn't Chicago without a visit to Garrett's! Love the cheese popcorn but you will need the moist towelettes you will find in the bottom of your bag!
