Text: I read the reviews online and made my reservation before seeing Hamilton. My reservation was complete with my remarks we were seeing Hamilton. The restaurant atmosphere was lovely and the food was divine. Our reservation was for 5:45 and we were promptly seated on time. I expected to be in there easily and hour. I thought we'd have enough time to get outside and take a few pictures before we got in line for the show. I read this elsewhere and I have to agree, it was a little too slow. The waiter was fantastic and kind but I didn't think our dessert would ever get to us. Of course you want to be seated in the theater in plenty of time to freshen up, use the restroom, whatever... before you get your seats. Dessert finally arrived at 7:00 p.m. and we had to eat fast even though the theater was across the street so we could get in line and get settled. We didn't get into our seats until 7:20. If the service was't quite so slow, I would easily give 5 stars and two thumbs up but it just shouldn't take 20 min. to get dessert and then not have the time to enjoy it. I would definitely go back but arrange my time better so I don't stress.

Text: Went here for dinner after seeing Hamilton at the Private Bank Theater directly across the street. We arrived at 4:30......very early but had great service and a delicious meal. Had the sea bass and it was outstanding! My friend had the roasted chicken and enjoyed it. Good service, kind waiter!

Text: One of the most tender steaks I've had. We got reservations for dinner before a show. (I was in the room where it happened) and they timed our meal perfectly. 

The decor is dark wood and very cozy. We didn't drive so I don't know about parking, sorry. It was a pricy meal but worth it.

Text: We came here since it was right across from Hamilton & we were looking for a good steakhouse. It did not disappoint! We got the 8oz filets with a side of giant baked potato & it was so delicious!! A great cut with very good flavor, it practically melted in your mouth. An added bonus were their cocktails we're Hamilton themed so of course I had to order one (or three). If you're looking for a great steakhouse look no further, though I'd recommend a reservation as a lot of people seemed to pick this place as a place to grab a bite before the play.
