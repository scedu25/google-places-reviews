Text: Went here a year ago on mothers day with my sister and her kids. The waitress was abominable. She was acting like she was waiting tables against her will. I didn't complain at first because I thought perhaps I was misinterpreting the situation however by the time the appetizers arrived she had walked away from us twice while we were still talking to her and one time I think she rolled her eyes at us. She was extremely cold towards us and rarely checked in with our table. At this point I couldn't complain about it for fear of upsetting my sister on mother's day. This situation was the absolute worst dining experience I ever sat through, and our bill was over $300. It was so uncomfortable, when that check arrived I was eager to get out of there. Maybe we were dressed too casually, or the waitress was having a horrible day. Whatever the case, I would avoid this place, just on the chance you might get seated with this server.

Text: Went here with a large group of people just the other night. Firstly, you can barely read the menu because it's too dark in there. Ambiance is one thing, but I realized that it was dark so that you couldn't quite see how dirty the silverware was.  

Our server was rather rude and forgetful. Jimmy was his name. Just hearing how he talked to other tables, making excuses, forgetting drinks or bread...things like that. He should have asked others for help.

The food. Steaks were cooked correctly.  The French onion soup was mediocre, at best. There wasn't near enough onions. I think I had maybe one spoon full of onions in my entire bowl. The bread was just a slice of bread and wasn't toasted at all. It's supposed to have a crunch.  Dionne's had the best French onion soup in the area. The oysters that our table had, on the other hand, caused me to vomit up my entire meal.  I know about not eating oysters in months that don't have "r's", but this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

I grew up in Momence and had never been here...although I had heard good things. I will not return.  It's over priced, ineptly staffed, and some folks need training on how to interact with customers.
