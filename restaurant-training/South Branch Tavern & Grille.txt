Text: This was a nice experience. The food was good and unique.  The drinks were tasty and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The only downside would be the location. It is located right at the end of a bridge which makes getting picked up a little more difficult than a typical occasion, but it was worth it.

Text: Too expensive and overcrowded. Sitting inside it's hardly possible to talk without shouting to each other. Service fully fulfilled my expectation of American restaurant service.

Text: This place is a staple location for happy hour but fills up very fast and gets very loud, even around the tables. Definitely make reservations if you can plan ahead. I've also attended a small catered corporate event here. They provide some standing tables and cater apps, and the food was fine. The waitress did a great job delivering drinks accurately and quickly for a large group of people.

Text: Delicious and inexpensive food! I normally get a bacon,egg,cheese sandwich on wheat with the eggs scrambled softly. After a few mis steps with over cooked eggs, now my sandwich is perfect. Friendly staff who know your order as you step up to the counter, what could be any better in customer service?
