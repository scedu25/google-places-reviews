Text: Chicago is rich in culture. That is exemplified by one of it's premier  gems, a blues club known as Buddy Guy's Legend. When I stepped through the doors an electrifying  ambience embraced me. Guest from near and far enjoying the house delights literally were treated with a Monday Open Mike that included a Buddy Guy moment backed by the Jimmy Burns Group (house band of the evening). The night featured  riveting appearances by Mr G. Guy (Buddy's son), Mr Wes, Ms Holley Maxwell, and Ms Queen. The evening was rounded out with a rotation of sign in jam musicians who were not short on talent themselves ... Also, a shout out to my new friends from St. Louis, glad you had fun .... Nice spot Buddy

Text: The Mike Dangerous Band was incredible. They played 2 hours nonstop. Buddy Guy sat in with the band to make it that much better. It was a wonderful experience.

Text: Rated 5 stars for the overall experience.  Food is a solid 4 - wonderful homestyle Cajun/Creole. I was delighted to find that the new location, while a little bit bigger and cleaner, retains a bit of the "dive bar" feel and has a similar intimate layout like the original location.  It's all about the music here. Pure and true blues at it's finest. Every table close to the stage. Even if you don't like or know the blues when you go in, you will love it by the time you leave.
