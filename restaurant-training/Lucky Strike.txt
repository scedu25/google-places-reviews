Text: We came here for a night of drinks and fun and we got exactly that! They were insanely busy and took a while to get drinks and food, but the  superb customer service made up for it. Our server, as busy as he was, was very attentive and made sure we were having a good time. I look forward to coming here again!

Text: I left my card at the bar with a tab open. When we were ready to leave I asked bartender to close out the tab and get my card back. She said she couldn't find it and insisted my tab was already closed. Turned out she returned my card to someone else, and kept denying and responsibility for it. Manager promised to contact me with the update after they try to locate the person that ended up with my card. I never heard from them...

Text: Fun. Bowling and arcade next door. Yes it's loud but its a bowling alley. The burger selection was decent.

Text: Great place to go with the kids or a night out with your friends. The bar tender James is a fun friendly guy and the rest of the staff are really nice as well. And they have good food. I love it here.

Text: I was on business trip to Chicago from Milwaukee. We decided to spend saturday night in a bowling Alley. We came across a rude staff. Though we arrived there at 4th Nov 11:30 PM on saturday and the place was promised to be open till 2AM, we were denied to play anything after 1AM. Reason being - Staff was racist,  she allowed all the other members to continue their game except us, second she wanted to leave early.  I paid $140 for my bowling but i ended up stopping my game in mid way just because she denied to extend my game. I will never visit this place again and i will tell all my friends in Chicago to refrain.  Learn from Wisconsin people how to be friendly Lucky Strike.
