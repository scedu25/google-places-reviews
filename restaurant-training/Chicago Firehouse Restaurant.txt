Text: Absolutely delicious food!  Oh my gosh, we will definitely go back there to eat again.  Appetizers, lobster bisque, seafood, steaks, were all ordered at our table.  Everyone was very satisfied.  Love the ambiance, our waiter Phillip was outstanding!  His passion clearly showed as he explained each of the menu items.  You must go!!!

Text: Chicago Firehouse, having reopened after a devastating fire in 2014 is an awesome place for both lunch and dinner. It has a very open feeling with the tall ceilings and great decor, and the food is fantastic. Their steaks, burgers and Amish brick chicken are all must trys. They have a variety of meeting and banquet rooms upstairs along with a veranda.

Text: This place has a very different atmosphere comparing to other restaurant in South Loop. The food are good but I didn't think it was outstanding. I was impressed with their own Firehouse red wine blend though. It's a nice change of the restaurant type in the area.
