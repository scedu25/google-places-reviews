Text: This place has decent food, but the service is s-l-o-w.  Everytime I'm here our service is slower and slower and slower.  If you have a couple hours to enjoy a long meal service, this is your place.  Anyone else who expects dinner service to be shorter than a theatrical movie should steer clear.

Text: I love this place great local beer selection and the service is also always good. And the food is fantastic do yourself a favor and come here instead of where you were intending on going.  Me and my girl favorite waitress is Jessica she is awesome ask for her!

Text: Came on Saturday, Nov 3rd.  Horrendous service.   1 waitress attempted to serve a whole room of lunch patrons.   Waited forever just to get our drinks...... Uhgggg... Never again

Text: Not only do they have great beer on tap, they also have great food!  A little loud at times but you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. It is a little challenging to hear everyone if you're with a group of people.
