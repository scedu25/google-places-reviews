Text: We had a really good time here. The band was really good. It's a nice place to relax and listen to live music with a drink or two.

Text: The tromboner alone is enough of a reason to come here (pun intended). But for real; the Bad Ass Company Band is phenomenal. The trombone player astounded me. After seeng several shows from Austin, TX to NYC I have never heard a trombone player rock like this guy. Keep it up. Cool place. Cover was a little surprising but as long as it goes to the band it's well worth it.

Text: Found this place by accident and glad we did.  Great music and such a wonderful and welcoming staff.   Ask Maurice for his signature drink, Spicy boat of love.

Text: Drink prices before 9pm were great for downtown!! Saw a few comedians performing downstairs and there was a stage upstairs. Couldn't tell if it was amateure or not but live performance regardless upstairs. Have to go again

Text: We stayed at the hotel across the street so this place was very convenient.
We walked over and asked what time they closed, they told us 4am! Lol
They also wanted to charge us $5 to get in, i said no thanks we'll be back later....
We tried the place on the next block which was chill.
After we had 2 drinks there we decided to go back to the underground.
All of a sudden they didn't have a cover charge.

Friendly bartenders
Awesome band.
It's an original bar, apparently there's a hand full of bars that are allowed to stay open until 4am if they had a liquor license before a certain date. This place has history.
