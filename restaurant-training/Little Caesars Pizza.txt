Little Caesars Pizza

Text: I liked it. Your normal little Caeser. Sometimes it seems like they let their pizzas over cook in the warmer, but maybe that's just because I caught bad timing. Otherwise, seems decent.

Text: Easy dinner night.... hot & ready except not always hot. No seating inside or out. No restroom.  Not really for kids as there's no seating; just waiting.

Text: They don't understand the meaning of hot and ready. They advertise having their food premade and ready to grab and go but on several occasions even when we called ahead for a larger order we had to wait for food. Great price but you will have to wait.

Text: What can you say about Little Caesars? It's the "$5 holla". Ok pizza for a great price. Great for a quick cheap lunch. Between the small lobby, and the parking things can can get pretty interesting on Friday nights.
