Chipotle Mexican Grill

Text: This Chipotle used to be great. But now it's filthy and the staff is pretty rude. We've had to wipe off a table to sit and eat the last 3 times we have visited. The food was good, but they don't keep the line clean so as they push your bowl across the line, it will collect plenty of smushed toppings. I think one of the cashiers is racist. He will only greet/talk to African American people that come through the line. If you are white he will not respond to "hello" "how are you" "thank you" or "have a nice day" or even make eye contact with you. Just a very unpleasant and odd Chipotle. If you know of another, I would say it is worth the extra mileage.

Text: Went there at 8:30 on a Tuesday and a line out the door the whole time we were there. The staff was quick to get orders out. Orders were correct and portions were fine. They seem short staffed but it was probably unexpected for a Tuesday. A few things lacking napkin holders empty and there was a wait on chips. Ours were stale probably from a lull before the rush but wasn't willing to sit around just for some chips.

Text: Always a pleasure at this Chipotle. Food always in large portions, and very tasty. Restaurant clean. Staff friendly. Even though line long, it moves at a steady pace. I will definitely be back.
