Text: Was not pleased with the speed of service. By the time we got our food, mine was getting cold. That being said, it was still very good. Atmosphere is good and staff that puts it all together at the counter will keep you smiling.

Text: Love love love Portillo’s. We make a point of stopping at one whenever we are in the Chicago area or driving through. This one is great because it is right off the highway and easy to get to. The food is amazing!

Text: This is the second location I've been to now. This location is just as clean and fun. Excellent food, clean bathrooms, lots of parking. Deducted one star due to the excessive wait for the food and the other ten people waiting at the same time as myself, but it's worth it once you get it.
