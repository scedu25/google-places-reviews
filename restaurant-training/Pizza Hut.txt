Text: Traveling through the area, craved pizza instead of another road burger. Walked in, prompt service, personal pan pizza was perfectly cooked, service was friendly and fast. Heads up that the location is carry out only, wasn't a problem for me because I was eating in the road, but may be to others.

Text: Bone in chicken wings were to hard on edges and just tossed into a little bit of BBQ sauce in the bottom of bowl. Could not even offer any napkins as I was on my lunch break. Also the chicken was dry, I could only eat two out of an eight piece. Sorry, what's going on with Pizza hut.

Text: Waited 2 hours for our pizza then ended up having food posing. My little sister and I both got sick from it. Will never eat  here or at pizza hut again.

Text: I ordered online for an delivery, the delivery never came to my house. I waited thirty minutes to call to see about my order, and the employee tells me it should be on the way(It wasn't). Fourty five minutes later I call to see about my order again, the same employee tells me I didn't place a order, then puts his manager on phone who say "The delivery person came to your house but didn't get an answer" which is a total lie. I've been sitting in my front window about fourty five minutes and not one person has knock on my door, or walk on my porch. THIS IS THE WORST PIZZA HUT AND PIZZA HUT EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!!! VERY UPSET.
