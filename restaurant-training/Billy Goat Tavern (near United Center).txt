Text: The cook recommends the double cheese burger. Once you've got burger in hand add condiments, pickles are there, along with the standard offerings one would put on a burger. They also have hot dogs, Italian beef, and some other selections. There's a fully stocked bar. United Center, formerly Chicago Stadium, is a couple of blocks away.

Text: Very friendly staff. Place is a little odd. Some areas feel like it's a partial storage area. Getting food to go might be best.

Text: If you're looking for a good burger.. Do not go here! Pickles are thicker than my burger patty and its tasteless. The bun was massive and dry. We ate in and they have a stuffed dead Goat in corner that is falling apart. Very unappetizing. Beware.

Text: Decent place to watch a game. Layout is odd, not a ton of seating and it's extremely busy before and after Hawks game. 
Did not have food.

Text: $6 for a double cheese burger is too much when you make me put my own toppings on it. I got to choose between onions and pickles. That's it. All I tasted was bread. The meat is small and thin.
