Text: Amazing meal and atmosphere. For our special occasion, we were treated to a special seat in the kitchen. We at our food only a few feet away from where it was made. The chef and staff made our experience unforgettable.

Text: Always have great meals at Balena! Particularly if you go with a large enough group (8-10) -- there's an awesome table in the back. It's like you're in a home (with some top notch food!)

Text: Good food and nice place. I enjoyed the drinks. Went her for the gf birthday. It was well lit with very good food options. I think that's the best part is the menu and the wait staff. The orchietta spaghetti and steak were excellent. Portions are on the smaller side, so if you like a lot of food I recommend a side

Text: My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner at Balena and it was a wonderful experience. We heard nothing but positive feedback from our guests about how fantastic the venue, the drinks, and the food were. Everyone  loved the homemade pasta and especially the chicken (heard several compliments about how delicious the chicken was as well as the rest of the food). Additionally, the waiters and staff were extremely friendly and helpful with assisting our guests with their questions and needs, they went the extra mile to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.

The Balena team was very easy to communicate with and made it easy to ask questions to get things organized for the rehearsal dinner. We truly appreciate the hard work the Balena team put into making our rehearsal dinner happen and making it flawless.
