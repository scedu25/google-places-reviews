Text: Great secret little spot right in the middle of the mag mile. It's warm, cozy, Sumptuous and stylish. The food is top quality and the service is very attentive. I love their cornbread, do not miss it. All their salads are phenomenal as well.

Text: I loved the food and the ambience, it was fantastic.  The live jazz band was great.  The one thing that was hard to do was find it.  It is not located facing Michigan Avenue, you enter on the Grand Avenue side of the building.  The cornbread there is some of the best I ever had, and I know food.  The appetizers were great, especially the spinach dip.  It had great servers who took their time and explained everything to our group.  We are the Unlimbited Potential Amputee Support Group all of our wheelchairs fit in the place at our table.  Food was served hot and fresh and was good to the last drop.  Drinks were a bit pricey, but worth it.  I would recommend this place to visitors easily, including the elderly in wheelchairs.

Text: This place is pretty swank and the burger was excellent. Service was good. Prices reflect their location (pricey) and everything was just too dark for no reason. The band was pretty good though, and that was a neat experience. Bring someone here if they're a date that likes nice things; don't come here with a buddy.

Text: The first thing caught our attention was the server. He was a mid-age super professional and charismatic server I have ever seen in my life.
We had burger and the lamb sandwich. Both of then are absolutely awesome in terms of taste, quality, and presentation. 
My only suggestion: I expect the lamb to be more flavorful as the nature of the lamb is little bit smelly compared to beef as many people don't like it.

Text: Though there was a bit of a wait to get started (due to a shift change mixup), once it did the experience was lovely.  The service was then on point and the food was damn tasty. I'm a Southerner who does not like sweet cornbread but from what I could tell, those who do will love Bandera's version. The house smoked salmon was fantastic as were all the dishes that my party ordered. The banana cream pie is well worth it, too. Excellent live jazz was an expert touch. This place is great for dates, business meetings and/or nights out with your friends if you're 30+. This was an awesome, random find in downtown Chicago.
