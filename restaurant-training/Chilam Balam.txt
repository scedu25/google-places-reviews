Text: Great food and service, has Byob (1 wine bottle for 2). We shared food, so I tried steak, pork ribs and stuffed pepper and it was really delicious!!!! The chocolate desert was great too!! Just don't be scared it's in basement and bit crowded, but worth it!!!!

Text: Ingredients were well balanced out in a very playful way.  Lots of depth in flavor and surprising elements.  Everything makes sense.  
Nice ambiance and good music.  
Friendly staff.
We were so hungry, we ate all the foods before remembering to take pictures

Text: One of our favorite restaurants in Chicago. They definitely won't seat you until your party is all there, but once you are seated the food is fantastic. Menu changes regularly and food is always fresh and inventive. BYOB and mostly gluten free. (Not middle eastern as other reviews as mentioned), it's Mexican with an inventive menu. Would highly recommend, a great local spot!

Text: No frills, BYOB, but so yummy. Expect a loud, crowded atmosphere with a fun menu. Perfect place to bring a few friends and a bucket of beers.
