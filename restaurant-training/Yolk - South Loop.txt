Text: One of the first breakfast spots where I finally had a decent dish of crepes! The set up is a bit interesting since you pay at the counter after your meal. The wait can get long but if you show up Close to opening it is not much of an issue. Staff and quick and nice. I would just recommend taking care of the silverware and glasses a bit better, I wasn’t all that confident when I initially saw them, it’s all in the details. Otherwise, great place for breakfast or brunch!

Text: We had breakfast here today, wait time, food and service were fantastic! We mistakenly got in the line where you pay but a waiter quickly noticed and took us directly to a table. As we left, there was a wait but they are fast so I'm sure it wasn't long. Selections were great! My daughter had the bacon waffles and they looked as good as they taste!

Text: It's a good staple brunch place in Chicago. Pretty good food, not spectacular. Not overly priced. Expect a wait on nice weekends. Closes early so check hours before coming!

Text: Delicious breakfast and lunch food. A wide variety of breakfast options, with a Southwest flavor. Everything seemed fresh, and the portions were generous. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we never felt rushed even though the place was packed.

Text: Wow! Love the store baked challa bread for french toast. Crowds and lines let you know the food is top notched. Potato pancakes just right! Smiling happy service means happy employees which translates into awesome service experience. Permanent marked on my google map.
