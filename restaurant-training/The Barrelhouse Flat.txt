The Barrelhouse Flat

Text: This place is rock solid. So it's a little tricky to find, which made the whole experience even better. We see a bouncer who tells us to head to the back and up the stairs. Only second level is open tonight. We clamber up an old, but tidy, backstair. Soon we're seated at a small with comfy bar.  The place is sort of plush and feels like a gastropub.  The drinks were awesome and the bartenders were friendly and helpful.

Text: They are going for the cozy speakeasy atmosphere and yet the music was ridiculously loud and the staff was incredibly uptight.. Dim, warm lights, old electric bulbs, and chic upholstery paired with blaring crappy house music... an unfortunate contradiction. I had to shout in order to have a conversation with my companion. We sat at the bar. The service was slow, inattentive, and abrupt. There are too many great bars in this city, do not waste your time at this one.

Text: Monday night happy hour upstairs is great. Awesome speakeasy type historic like vibe to the place. Good deals, and good drinks. Very cozy with lots of lounge areas. Perfect for a date.

Text: Low key, dimly-lit cocktail bar with a speakeasy atmosphere. There's a piano and pool table upstairs. There was a small group of flapper girls when I went in one evening and it really played up to the 20's vibe. Loved it!

Text: Very weird bouncer - tried to kick me out after saying goodnight to my Mom and Sister, as I was visiting from out of town. I had one cocktail there in the span of an hour, but the bouncer told me "I've been watching you all night, and you're not the type of person we want in here." So I spend $15 on a cocktail, sit at a bar with a couple mid-30's friends, my mom and sister, and were literally the only ones in there on a Friday night, but I guess I'm not what they want in there. Best of luck Barrelhouse! Guess your bouncer thinks its a better vibe when there are zero people in there.
