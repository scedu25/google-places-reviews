Cracker Barrel Old Country Store
Rating: 4
Text: We love Cracker Barrel, but our waitress here needs to go, at least get a stern talking to.  I know she forgot to put our order in.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but waited over half an hour for our food.  The people who came right awhile after us got their food right after we got ours. AND she wrote "over medium" when we both ordered "over hard." Time was important because we're traveling 500 or so miles today.

Text: Food was fine. Service was slow.  She didn't clear the plates when we were done. I'm glad there is more than just this store locally.

Text: There were 4 of us. Place was pretty full. However our service was above top shelf.  Thank you Billy Jo. Food was pretty good as well. Stop and see her. She's that good.

Text: Sandra, the waitress, was a gem and Peggy, the hostess, was so kind and nice. Great people and consistently delicious food. Couldn't want better. Even picked up a nice winter cape on sale in the gifts department. Whooppee!

Text: Always a great place to eat. Nothing fancy but good basic breakfast foods. I really enjoy the eggs in a hole. And they have a good sweet tea.
