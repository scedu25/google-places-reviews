Text: Great atmosphere for Michigan State football games ?. Be sure to try and get there early for a booth with a personal TV in it for you and 5 other friends. 

Affordable drinks and good pub selections to snack on during the game.

Text: Four stars is for trivia night only - I have never been otherwise and I understand the bar is a pretty different vibe otherwise. Four stars instead of 5 because their food menu just changed and is significantly worse - it wasn't amazing or anything to begin with, but they removed some of the interesting options on the menu. Trivia night is a blast and moves pretty quickly. I don't feel like the group I go with are trivia geniuses and we do pretty well. The rewards are alright and match the skill level needed, so it's just a nice place to spend some time doing something with friends.

Text: On a Monday it can be calm. But any other day it is great vibes and great food specials . For a bar I’d say B+ food

Text: This is the second time I came around 1:10 and he didn't let me in because he said it's late.  I just wanted to go in there and grab a drink with my friends.  It shouldn't say last call at 1:30 but they didn't let me go in at 1:10.
