Text: This place is fantabulous! Mango margarita was off the chain, the sampler was big enough for two people to get full. (My husband & I shared it), decent atmosphere.  We will definitely be making frequent trips!

Text: This place sucks! 
I told my waiter that my strawberry margarita tasted very salty and that it was discussing. He said he would have to talk to the manager. That jerk (the manager) never came to our table to see what the issue was. The waiter came back and said that I waited to long to complain that there was nothing he could do.
I guess while I am at it, my taco salad wasn't that good either. It was supposed to be chicken with no bean, they definitely got the no beans right. There was hardly any chicken and it was flavorless. It tasted like I was eating lettuce and sour cream.
The quaccamoli wasn't anything to write home about either. The shell wasn't  good, stale and had no flavor.
Needless to say we wont be back, which is sad cuz my husband enjoyed his dinner.
