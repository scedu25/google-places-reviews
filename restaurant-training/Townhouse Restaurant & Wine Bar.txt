Text: I had the Burger and Fries it was excellent. The establishment had an indoor and outdoor seating area. The lighting was gentle and it was truly an amazing restaurant!

Text: Good food, but the vibe was totally dead, food was slow to arrive and the wait staff were slow to serve.

Text: It's okay food and service.  Nothing really stands out or is memorable.  A good "normal food" type of place.
