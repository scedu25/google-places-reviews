Text: This spot will hit your pizza spot! Deep dish Pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook and sometimes there's a long wait depending on the day and time. Call first.

Solid Pizza and the atmosphere is really unique. This spot is pretty legendary and is definitely a crowd favorite. If you go to Chicago I definitely recommend checking it out. You won't be disappointed.

The parking is really limited due to it being in the city, but they do offer $17 valet service. So why not.

Text: Amazing food (not sure how they made such great hummus for a pizza place). Pizza obviously awesome. Great wines. All were friendly other than the host who didn't like that we asked to sit in the other section.

Text: My daughter and I got a Lg sausage & pepperoni deep dish. It tasted good but was served way too hot - our hands got burned from scalding hot grease. The server never voluntarily refilled our drinks and rarely even came around after we ordered. Our drinks went dry FOUR times - unsat! 3 of those times we had to ask other employees for refills. Did not feel the love.

Text: Went there with a large group and we're very accommodated. A bit pricey - and the deep dish takes about 45 minutes to cook, but the staff was smart, kind, and pro-active in the way they prepared you for the experience.

It was super tasty, deep dish was good and the hand tossed was also tasty.  Bread sticks were nothing special but good.

The serving staff was above average - and promptly kept us all full of waters without getting snarky about ALL the water we were drinking.  We'd been walking a ton from the navy pier.

Highly recommend!

Text: We enjoy Chicago deep dish pizza so we stopped in here. Fun place with  grafitti everywhere. Pizza did not disappoint! (Wasn't our first time eating Gino's.) Great server, too, for a busy night, he stayed on top of everything!
