Text: Tasty lunch spot, great burgers.  Also good for an after work drink.  Not the most cost effective but the quality justifies the cost.

Text: Had a farewell lunch here with my coworkers, complete with rum and cokes, plural. Had a tasty burger and some fries as well. Took a while for the food to come out, would not have worked if this was my typical 1 hr break lunch.

Text: Super friendly server, but he seemed to be the only server on the floor making service a little slow. Great food! We enjoyed everything we got!

Text: Good bar food. Lively atmosphere.  Dinner menu pretty common. Food well prepared but not outstanding or remarkable.  If you're going to the opera, it's right across the street. This is the only reason we return.
