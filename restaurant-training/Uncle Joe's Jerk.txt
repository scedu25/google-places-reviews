Text: If you open @ 11am....OPEN @ 11AM!!! I have had this issue with black owned businesses only. They just don't get the concept of CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Be ready to serve at the time YOU ASSIGNED or change it...period. But don't have your lips poked out when it's time to serve and you're not prepared. Not my fault. #Unprofessional

Text: I've only been for lunch and the food is great, but you definitely should call in to order if you're going for lunch. Otherwise you'll wait a bit. Sometimes they don't have certain items prepared or run out, but overall haven't had a bad experience here.

Text: The Sauce is nasty and didnt taste like the regular uncle joes sauce and they didn't have anything.  No shrimp,  no wings,  etc.

Text: Jerk chicken, fried cabbage & plantains for me! My aunt loves the fried catfish here. Always freshly prepared and I don't mind the wait.

Text: Great fresh food I always go at night. The woman at the window has a very sweet attitude. The only thing is they almost always get my order wrong in the back even though it's right on the receipt. As long as u check your food u will be good
