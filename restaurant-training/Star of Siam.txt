Text: Amazing food, cool family restaurant. The stuff is super friendly, and they are always looking around and checking if you need something else.
I did Thai food before, but never like this one. If you like spice curry, noodles or just wanna try something different... Go here!
Prices are not bad neither.

Text: Great service.  You can tell that the restaurant is thoughtful towards the customer.  Received two empty soup bowls to go along with soup (we order out a lot and never experienced such thoughtfulness).  Also they added a large Perrier for free - as a way of thanking us for our large order I think?  The red curry chicken (Chicken Pad Ped) was awesome.  Will definitely be adding this place as a "go-to" for Thai!

Text: great food here! I personally really like their crab rangoons. Also love the location, there's tons of different kinds of people who come in. The place is also really good for people watching, thanks to its location and huge window which I like sitting by. 

The food is good- I would say that although its kind of stereotypical, its fresh and well prepared.  Best to go there when you want to grab a quick lunch. $15 each for 2 people, with 2 entrees and an appetizer. Oh and there's plenty of food to take home as well.

Text: Amazing Food, large portions!!! It was busy and we did have to wait in line for 10 minutes for a table for 2, it was a busy Saturday night! However once seated, servers were very attentive and food was served quickly. The restaurant is very nice inside, great decor! Loved it and would highly recommend :)

Text: Ate lunch here after viewing the solar eclipse at the Adler Planetarium.  Found items on the menu that two adults and three kids 13 and under all enjoyed. Large portion sizes. Could have ordered one Pad Thai to feed three kids. Enjoyed Chicken Satay appetizer. Did not like the spring rolls as much. Pot stickers were very good, large portion size for an appetizer.  Got Chicken curry with potatoes and peas, really liked it. Had enough left over for two more meals. Free refills on kid's soft drinks. Down side was having to purchase rice to go with the entrees. Waitress was very friendly, but very hard to understand/communicate with. Pricey.
