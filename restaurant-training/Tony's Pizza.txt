Tony's Pizza

Text: I eat there every once in a while for lunch. The food is ok, with exception to the pizza. The pizza is really good. The service is good, and they are very friendly. Though for what you get is way to over priced. I would like to see what ever I order to come with a side and a drink included. Instead of ordering sides and a drink separate.  For the price I paid here I could of gotten a better meal at a bigger restaurant.  Still I have to say it is a better experience then going fast food.

Text: Customer for 10 years. On any given day until 2015 I would have given Tony's either 4 or 5 stars for their pizza. Starting sometime in 2016 their pizza dough changed. I don't know if it's their ingredients or preparation, but it's gone to hell. It is often as dry as dirt, and has about the same consistency. I had slices where the edge is separated from the underside of the crust, as well big dry bubbles cooked into the crust. Stick to the burgers, sandwich menu and pasta when you come here.

Text: I loved this place. Great food. I talked my husband into getting Tonys instead of aurelios pizza because they always forget something or screw up our order. And guess what so did Tonys today. Smh. I only placed 2 orders. And they forget the ranch dressing for the salad and my buffalo sauce for my chicken strips. They gave me credit because I was not going to wait another hour for the sauces. VERY DISAPPOINTING!
