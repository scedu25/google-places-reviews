Text: Nothing wrong with the restaurant but the only problem I have is with the Google reviews. They have it marked in the $$ price range and the appetizers were 20$ and some entrees were in the 50$ range. It should be more appropriately labeled. Even the cheaper entrees were between 20 and 30$.

Text: Nice restaurant on the Ave.  I wasn't too keen on eating a venison burger..but sure glad I did, it was awesome.  Sat at the bar, the bartenders were very friendly and served awesome drinks. Hint..they are Cub fans!  :9)

Text: Great service & vibe. Food was tasty, brought out as asked with all modifications made properly & was hot!  Fish and chips were nicely battered with thick chips! Elk rack was smaller in portion than anticipated but, still glad we tried it. Mussels, great twist with the vindaloo sauce! Venison burger, cooked to the right temp, not dry and very flavorful. Would definitely go back!
