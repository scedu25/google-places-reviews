Text: I would give lower if I could. I really wish the employees would change their gloves when working with a different flavor, it would be beneficial to people with allergies. Nice coffee, though.

Text: Wide variety of chocolates and candy that's cheaper than going to South Bend, great drinks and it's a good place to stop in for a bite to eat while shopping at the outlet mall

Text: The woman working tonight argued with he co-worker right in front of us. It was so unprofessional. I can't believe she works dealing with customers. The employee was very sweet and tried to cover it up. He is someone to have run the place.
