Hamburger Mary's
Rating: 3
Text: Came in a little before 1pm on a weekday for lunch. Party of three. Walked in and saw there were four other small parties. Then realized there seemed to be only one server for the indoor parties and one server for the outdoor parties. That's it.

We waited for a few minutes to even be acknowledged. After we were seated, our server took our drink orders (2 waters and 1 coffee). Took quite a while. Took long enough that we felt like we should've timed how long it took.

This kind of delay remained pretty consistent. Our server was very polite, though. He was definitely doing the best he could on his own.

The food was also tasty. I wouldn't go back, though.

Text: I haven't been to a show here, but have been here for food and cocktails with my lover. The food is good as are the drinks, although it's louder and more crowded than I usually like - - my hearing is poor, and it was difficult to have a conversation, but I think most (gay or at least non-homophobic) people would be able to have an enjoyable date here. Upstairs is a Mary's Attic where we went to a Sunday tea dance one afternoon and had a lovely time. I would definitely come back.

Text: A very quirky hamburger jiont/bar.  From karaoke to charity bingo to Friday night drag queen performances  If you like great burgers and non traditional entertainment, this is the place for you.
