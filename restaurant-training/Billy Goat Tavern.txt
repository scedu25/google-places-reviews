Text: I just returned from eating at this place. While seated there, I kept on checking the name and reading the reviews because I was certain I got confused and I had gone to the wrong place. To make it quick: worst burger ever! I ordered a regular cheeseburger, the patty was so think I thought they were kidding. The bread was ok, but I didnt mean to eat a bun for dinner. No lettuce, no tomato, no mayo. Nothing. Just a dry, thin patty inside a toasted bun. You gotta be kidding me! How could anyone thing their burgers are good is beyond me.

Text: Iconic dive bar, which has since spawned a local chain. I highly recommend hitting up this original location if you're in town or looking for something touristy to do. Also, if you love retro places this is a spot for you. Walking in you're immediately transported back to the 70s and earlier. Made nationally famous by SNL's cheezeborger skit. Beer prices are a little higher then normal. Staff was very nice. You could probably look at the memorabilia all day. Don't forget this place is below street level so you've got to go down to the tunnel streets to find it. Don't let that intimidate you though.

Text: I went here because of John Belushi. It was a fun atmosphere, but they move you along, so don't expect to be staring at a menu too long. And the guy that was pestering me to get a double cheeseburger was right - a single wasn't enough. Don't make the same mistake I did.

Text: Nothing like walking down into a parking garage and finding an old bar.  The burgers were great and the service didn't disappoint. Sat at the bar and had a beer.  Bartender was chatty as well as the other patrons.

Text: It is the thing you think it is: Decent value dive bar doing a running reenactment of that SNL skit. A lot less pricey than other tourist-targeting spots, though. Bring out of town visitors in for a beer.
