Maggiano's Little Italy

Text: Awesome Food and Service:  Came here with my girlfriends to celebrate my sister’s birthday.  Our wait staff was superb, though the place was packed.  Our food (apps, salads, main course, dessert) were all great.  We went with the family style menu, and let me say,  everything was simply delicious.  I highly recommend Maggiano in Chicago.

Text: This is place was wonderful, even when dining alone on a business trip.  I sat at a high top in the bar area and received outstanding service and recommendations from the bartender.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere almost took me back in time; Sinatra softly playing in the background of a dimly lit restaurant with leather booths and exposed brick walls.  Highly recommend this place.

Text: Maggiano's pulled out all the stops for my two girlfriends and I celebrating an engagement last night! The staff was incredibly kind and made sure we had a great experience. The food and drink were also great, as always. Thanks for such a fun night!

Text: Great service and great food. We were visiting with family and the server took great care of us, there are limited vegetarian options but the offerings were very tasty. Some of us got a complimentary pasta dish to take home too which was just as good the next day.

Text: Great food and service, and a nice atmosphere too. We received some complimentary dishes too, which tasted just as good when reheated the following day. My only complaint is that there is a serious lack of vegetarian and vegan options.
