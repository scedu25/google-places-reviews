Text: Waited 20 minutes and totally worth the wait. Accommodating and informative staff, lovely people. Huge breakfast food. Egg white omelet was delicious and huge. Real maple syrup on the tables. Eggs Benedict-incredible. Fresh donut holes from a wicker basket, served by a cute little lady,  while you wait. The hostess was wonderful. Chased us out the door to ask why we left so quickly...we told her we saw the line and didnâ€™t want to stay at the table. That made her smile.

Text: Best waffle I've ever had. Both the pecan waffle and the bacon pecan waffle are great but I'd say just pecan is better. Super friendly and efficient. Crowded but not uncomfortably so. I would recommend this place for breakfast and I will for sure be back. The two times I was there I had two of the friendliest waitresses.

Text: 2 egg breakfast is actually 4 eggs so unless you are super hungry '1 egg' breakfast will be plenty. Everything I've had has been great and the staff is friendly and helpful. I am usually by myself so I sit at the counter. Somehow a box of donut holes finds its way home with me nearly every time I visit. Oh! And they sell bread if you find you like the toast and want to take some home too.
