Text: We love the Bongo Room up north. This one has the same great food. But for me, the downside is just how tiny and cramped the space is. It gets really packed here and the space is just incredibly tight with little elbow room.

Other than that, I can't fault the food. It's really good. So if you don't mind small spaces or don't have a large party, it's a solid choice.

Text: The food at this bongo room is great!! Coffee and tea selections are really good. They would do well if they sold coffee to go. I just hate they donâ€™t have alcohol.

Text: Eggs benedict were fantastic. The house potatoes were over seasoned though.
 Also  they charged 3.5 for tea/coffee without showing the price anywhere

Text: Very cute place, small menu but very delicious items and large items.  Really great place. This is a breakfast/brunch place so fair warning. Loved it though. I got the lemon brioche French toast so yummy

Text: Delicious! Portions were big especially for the price! Price range was about $8-15 but well worth it. I had the tomatillo egg white scramble. It has a generous amount of avocado which impressed me. Staff was friendly. Probably not the best place for a large group because it's a small restaurant but our party of 4 was fine. I would definitely go again.
