Fast seating, fast, friendly service. 
Servers were all fun and talkative. 
It was Sweetest Day and they were giving single long stemmed roses in various colors to all ladies, even little girls got roses! 
The food was fresh, good quality and came out nice and hot. 
The only issue was each course came out quickly, so we didn't have time to enjoy our appetizer before our salads arrived and again with our entr�es. 
Everything was clean, including the ladies room.The best Cajun food ever!  
Red beans and rice delicious! 
Huge screens to watch games on.  
Several bars within this huge place. 
Luv the patio seating and great service.Haven't been there in about 8 years give or take... 
Although much has changed inside the memories and amazing fun are still there. 
They could use some nicer bartenders though I'll tell you that but other than that I recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun night out.I want to thank KAYLA, our waitress, so much for making my mom�s retirement party one of the best parties we ever had yesterday! 
Kayla knew exactly when to come over and check on us, and what to recommend when we asked for some specialty drinks or cocktails that weren�t exactly on the menu. 
They didn�t have any banana liquor for BBC, but the vanilla liquor worked out perfect instead, and it was a hit among several guests, including my mom! 
She and the other gentleman were on point with making sure everything was going okay so far while the time passed by waiting for more guests, and then making sure everyone was taken care of after all of the guests had arrived and the clock struck 3.I don�t recall ever having service quite like what we had for a long time around here! 
Kayla definitely deserves a promotion for her outstanding work, her professionalism, and how personal she was with everyone. 
Thank you Bourbon Street, and thank you Kayla! 
We will return for any parties we host in the future, and recommend 115 Bourbon Street to all of our friends, guaranteed!
Nice place.. 
Just always to crowded for my liking. 
All though I do always have a good time here! 
Seen OAR here and the sound was pretty good for a bar. 
Great place to see a band up close and personal.Arrived at Three Floyds with low expectations due to some of the recent reviews. 
However, my party and I had a decent evening with quick friendly service. 
Our food was delicious and our server was happy to bring us samples of the many beers we wanted to try.Music is loud so be aware Food menu is great.Only issue was wait we arrived on a rainy day were asked to wait outside "in the rain".Appeared to have open tablesWas told  45 min wait turned into 10.????
Almost seemed that they wanted us to go elsewhere NOTHung around and had an enjoyable experienceLove this place.  
Service has always been excellent with passionate waiters and waitresses.  
Food is really good,  if the menu is small.  
Take home some jerky!
Tucked away in an industrial park, three floyds is probably the best/most interesting food in the area.  
Food gets high marks for creativity but execution is sometimes lacking, but that doesn't matter because you're in northwest Indiana.  
Obviously the beers are great and they have many offerings from other microbreweries as well.  
For some reason I don't want you to bring your kids here....Walked up to eat in the tap room.  14 groups deep. 
No problem, we�ll get a beer at the bar. 
Woops. 
We were promptly told to GO WAIT IN OUR CAR because they don�t allow that.  
What? 
Never coming here again.Amazing sushi, fantastic service! 
Everything is at a great price and you get plenty of food. 
Ask for Roy - he's a wonderful server and is great to chat with!
good chine food happy people .. just fish tank litte by more clean up ...Our dishes and utensils were dirty. 
The food wasn't as good as expected. 
Maybe we went on a bad day.Never had a bad experience. 
I have had delivery and dine in. 
It's generally a good experience and the food is always good.Great food with impeccable service! 
I have been to this place multiple times and was never disappointed. 
And their price is reasonable.This is a review for the bar menu. 
We arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday and had no trouble getting a seat. 
The two standout dishes of the evening were the Connecticut-style Lobster Roll and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
We tried the bar tasting menu, which included canapes, egg yolk ravioli with truffles, roast quail with savory bread pudding, and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
We also ordered the cauliflower dish and the famous Acadia hamburger.I would come back in a heartbeat for the buttery and delicious lobster roll, and we also left with the impression that the pastry chef is very talented. 
Outside of those dishes, however, we were disappointed by the execution and felt a little surprised that Acadia has two Michelin stars. 
Many of the hot dishes arrived cold and tasted like they weren't seasoned carefully.The service overall was excellent. 
Our waiter did forget to light our candle after we asked him about it, but of course that was a minor detail. 
I think the Michelin stars carry so much mystique that we noticed those little details more than we usually would.Excellent service and great food! 
Honestly this restaurant met my expectations but did not exceed them. 
It is what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant but does not go beyond to really revolutionize the art of food. 
Overall, if you want to eat great (Michelin starred) food then it is a good place to get started (given the strong/bold flavors are very subtle), but that is it. 
There are other amazing places where the food can really 'blow' your mind. 
Great service, presentations and delicate food but not the best taste. 
We did 9 course plus 3 supplement courses. 
We spent close to 400 per person and with this kind of money I expect the best from every aspect. 
During this trip I visited 3 Michelin starred restaurant and Acadia was not the best one. 
I wish they can work on the flavor so it can match up with their presentation. 
Good experience in overall but won't go back for a while.Sat at the bar. 
The burger was very good. 
The environment is nice and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.One of the best restaurants in Chicago (Michelin starred). 
Terrific chef and great service. 
Very inventive tasting menu. 
The bar serves light food that comes from an amazing kitchen - worth trying. 
A must try in Chicago as it is a foodie destinationGreat experience, pleasant employees. 
Clean eating area.  
The new turkey sandwiches are great.Deep fat fryed turkey not as good as original beef or rubenPlaced sucked food not warm and not cooked good at all. 
Well never go back.Excellent service today. 
Good very good.There's absolutely no consistency here onetime you go there it's awesome the next time you go there you swear they just went and bought the roast beef from Walmart. 
No offense to Wal-MartWhen is a burger better than the sum of its parts? 
That's the question I've been asking ever since I ate at Au Cheval. 
Nothing extraordinary stands out when you first see the burger. 
Simple patties, cheese, sauce, without the bacon and egg it's really pretty standard. 
Even so, once you take your first bite you realize that the flavors all compliment each other so perfectly that you can't find any faults. 
Nothing leaves you thinking "that could have been a little better". 
You'll find yourself eating slower as your realize the inevitability that this burger you've now grown attached to will run out. 
You take smaller bites, trying to procrastinate  further by ordering another beer or another round of fries but still the burger gets smaller. 
As that last bite sits on your plate, gleaming below the harsh light in an otherwise dark restaurant, you have to make a choice. 
Eat it and accept that it's over, or leave it as the ultimate display of respect. 
I chose to leave it; my way of saying "see you later" rather than "goodbye". 
What an amazing burger.The burger was truly the best cheeseburger I�ve ever had. 
Just so full of fatty flavor. 
The bacon on top is a must - and the fried egg, too. 
French fries were thick and salty, and the aioli was flavorful. 
We also split the porterhouse four ways and it was so so good. 
The sauce was �Thanksgiving-y� as someone put it, but the meat was really fatty and fell off the bone. 
Drinks were refreshing and tasty (favorites were the pink vodka lemonade and the secret brew). 
Waitress was super friendly and very helpful.Basically everything was made of high quality, fatty ingredients. 
Best American food I�ve had.Came here for a post Marathon meal and was not disappointed. 
If you�re a couple or flying solo would recommend sitting at the bar. 
You�re able to watch this very talented crew create burger after burger brilliantly.Even though they have an extensive beer and wine list we focused on the cocktails. 
Began with a pickle back (whiskey and a shot of pickle juice) followed by a Hemingway Daiquiri, Bees Knees and Old Fashioned. 
The list is their take on classics which all went down perfectly with our food.If it�s your first time here and you�re hungry, highly recommend the double. 
It�s three patties, cheese, minced red onions and a delicious sauce. 
It comes with a knife in it which I promptly used to saw this beast of a burger in half. 
The bread and butter pickles are fantastic and their fries are not to be missed. 
You will walk out of here completely satisfied.Delicious burger, amazing fries, but over hyped.I really wanted Au Cheval to be my favorite burger place. 
I wanted to have a religious experience that would force me to drag my out of town friends here. 
However what I found was a delicious burger (get the egg and bacon) and awesome fries.It was incredibly difficult to get a table. 
They have one line which forms for both people that have a table ready and for people looking to add themselves to the wait list. 
This causes confusion and would be better setup as two lines, perhaps add people to the wait list outside and people that have a table ready go inside?
Our wait ended up being about an hour which wasn't the worst I've seen, but it's still a long wait considering you can get excellent burgers elsewhere in the city without waiting.Overall I'll come back someday. 
However this isn't going to be a regular spot for me.Best burger in the USA IMHO. 
It's a heavy burger, add get the egg and pork belly and you are in burger heaven. 
I bring everybody who visits me there and so far everybody agrees. 
There is always a wait, but if you go alone or as a pair you can get in a lot faster otherwise around a 45 min wait. 
The small Au Cheval does not compare. 
They don't even have their signature pork belly and egg option.This review is for the Chicago location. 
The Ambiance is nice but modern. 
The pizza is excellent, with a sweet sauce and a salty cheese. 
It is the best thin crust pizza that you can get. 
I have been eating it for 35 years. 
I was a busboy and their Homewood location in the early 1990s.Had the super six the works. 
Definitely among the top 5 pizzas I have ever tasted. 
Can't remember any that were better. 
Ask for the old oven. 
It is a brick oven about 75 years old so the pizza taste is baked into every brick. 
DELICIOUS!!!!!
We were a group of 16+ and 4 high chairs on a Sunday at 1230pm( we reconfirmed the advance notice 2 times earlier in the week) and although the restaurant was mostly empty, we were put at 2 cramped tables in a corner with 4 completely empty tables next to us. 
After waiting to be acknowledged by a server then waiting again for pitchers of water, we had to flag down the waitress for beverage service. 
While waiting on our beverages, the hostess approaches our group to request that we remove our items from the empty table next to us as they need the tables -reiterating that we were assigned 2 tables,  not 3- this is long before we were even given the opportunity to place a food order. 90 minutes later the empty tables next to us that were so urgently needed were still not occupied. 
Aurelios pizza is the best in the area, but the customer service definitely needs improvement. 
I plan several events in the area but unfortunately would not recommend this Aurelio's for group events.Most people think of big deep dish pizza when they think of Chicago Style.  
Not me, this is home, this is Chicago style pizza for me.  
The best crust, sauce toppings in the area.  
The Homewood location has the best atmosphere and is truly the home of sit down family pizza.  
It is pricey but worth it.Server Was the rudest woman that I have ever come across and she snatches things from your hands and don't allow you to ask a question without saying that lunch specials were over. 
Wasn't offered anything regarding lunch and when the order was ready to be placed could not find her. 
Poor time management skills and customer service consideration too. 
First time visiting and will be the last. 
No One had any manners or consideration for other people then themselves. 
Too much time spent on personal conversation.We've always loved Aurelios. 
I grew up going to the original one in Homewood and now so very happy to have one basically in my backyard.As usual the food was good, but we stopped at 1230 for the buffet,  we are vegetarian, and to wait 30 minutes for a cheese pizza. 
We could have just ordered our own at that rate. 
Our lunch time over before you can eatBuffet was excellent. 
I wanted some salad and a couple of pieces of pizza with no leftovers, so this was awesome. 
Nicely priced, too. 
Friendly staff. 
Great food and great options. 
Great place to hold parties for large groups. 
Gluten free crust options. 
Great tasting Pizza, try their super 6. 
Will not be disappointed. 
Their buffalo wings are very tasty also.Was really disappointed this evening with the way the food was prepared, I sat there and watched it being cooked and it seemed like everyone was having a great time in the kitchen, I trusted the order to be right, I got home and was missing chips and salsa, missing the extra hot sauce, missing the fact I ordered flour tortillas with my chicken tacos and i received corn tortillas, I am glad the staff was having a great ol time talking dancing and singing in the kitchen, they need to pay more attention to what people order rather than sit and have a coffee shop conversation. 
I called the restaurant and it took 45 min for a chips and salsa to arrive, let alone I had to call twice, then they didn't even seem to care to replace the order that was incorrect. 
Get your stuff together, I order from here once a week and they always get it right, because it may be an off night doesn't mean screw around and get the order wrong. 
I am to say VERY disappointed in the way I was treated as a regular customer. 
I will find other places to go unless this place corrects the order accordingly. 
Unacceptable!
The food was good and fresh.No minimum order to get delivery. 
The delivery was fast.First off this place is located in wrigleyville aka party town so it's drunk people food which means it's nasty when you're sober I got a suzio chimichanga and rice and beans and an horcahata and it was $20 the rice wasn't Spanish the beans were from the can the meat was nasty and overpriced as hell for nasty foodWeb page menu deceiving. 
It shows  carne asada  a plate in a photo but it's not served. 
I had the chicken taco dinner which the meat was dried out. 
Other people in our party had steak burritos which they said were good. 
BYOB. 
Very average food.5 of us landed on a gold mine last night Everything was delicious. 
I ate the shrimp taco dinner with black beans and rice. 
Oh it's so good! 
Everyone was very pleased with their meals.Amazing meal and atmosphere. 
For our special occasion, we were treated to a special seat in the kitchen. 
We at our food only a few feet away from where it was made. 
The chef and staff made our experience unforgettable.Always have great meals at Balena! 
Particularly if you go with a large enough group (8-10) -- there's an awesome table in the back. 
It's like you're in a home (with some top notch food!)
Good food and nice place. 
I enjoyed the drinks. 
Went her for the gf birthday. 
It was well lit with very good food options. 
I think that's the best part is the menu and the wait staff. 
The orchietta spaghetti and steak were excellent. 
Portions are on the smaller side, so if you like a lot of food I recommend a sideI've dined here twice and loved it! 
A little pricey but the food is worth it. 
The pizza is the best!
My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner at Balena and it was a wonderful experience. 
We heard nothing but positive feedback from our guests about how fantastic the venue, the drinks, and the food were. 
Everyone  loved the homemade pasta and especially the chicken (heard several compliments about how delicious the chicken was as well as the rest of the food). 
Additionally, the waiters and staff were extremely friendly and helpful with assisting our guests with their questions and needs, they went the extra mile to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.The Balena team was very easy to communicate with and made it easy to ask questions to get things organized for the rehearsal dinner. 
We truly appreciate the hard work the Balena team put into making our rehearsal dinner happen and making it flawless.Great secret little spot right in the middle of the mag mile. 
It's warm, cozy, Sumptuous and stylish. 
The food is top quality and the service is very attentive. 
I love their cornbread, do not miss it. 
All their salads are phenomenal as well.I loved the food and the ambience, it was fantastic.  
The live jazz band was great.  
The one thing that was hard to do was find it.  
It is not located facing Michigan Avenue, you enter on the Grand Avenue side of the building.  
The cornbread there is some of the best I ever had, and I know food.  
The appetizers were great, especially the spinach dip.  
It had great servers who took their time and explained everything to our group.  
We are the Unlimbited Potential Amputee Support Group all of our wheelchairs fit in the place at our table.  
Food was served hot and fresh and was good to the last drop.  
Drinks were a bit pricey, but worth it.  
I would recommend this place to visitors easily, including the elderly in wheelchairs.This place is pretty swank and the burger was excellent. 
Service was good. 
Prices reflect their location (pricey) and everything was just too dark for no reason. 
The band was pretty good though, and that was a neat experience. 
Bring someone here if they're a date that likes nice things; don't come here with a buddy.The first thing caught our attention was the server. 
He was a mid-age super professional and charismatic server I have ever seen in my life.We had burger and the lamb sandwich. 
Both of then are absolutely awesome in terms of taste, quality, and presentation. 
My only suggestion: I expect the lamb to be more flavorful as the nature of the lamb is little bit smelly compared to beef as many people don't like it.Though there was a bit of a wait to get started (due to a shift change mixup), once it did the experience was lovely.  
The service was then on point and the food was damn tasty. 
I'm a Southerner who does not like sweet cornbread but from what I could tell, those who do will love Bandera's version. 
The house smoked salmon was fantastic as were all the dishes that my party ordered. 
The banana cream pie is well worth it, too. 
Excellent live jazz was an expert touch. 
This place is great for dates, business meetings and/or nights out with your friends if you're 30+. 
This was an awesome, random find in downtown Chicago.This is my neighborhood spot when I want to watch a game or get a decent happy hour special. 
I come here very often on Wednesdays for the $1.25 beer / half priced martini special. 
And of course they have half priced appetizers every day from 4-7pm.  
There is almost always a place to sit since the space is large, although the top area is blocked off pretty often. 
I usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders do a great job of serving everyone quickly. 
The drinks are always made correctly, but I do think they could have a bigger selection of whiskeys.The food here is also great. 
I usually get the boneless wings, which come out on a cute little cast iron pan. 
The chips and dips appetizer is also good for sharing. 
I will keep coming here as long as they have their great happy hour specials and fun environment for watching sports.Phenomenal service! 
I hosted an engagement party at this location and they went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. 
The event coordinator, Amanda, was super professional and answered all my questions and was super helpful especially since I was trying to plan this event from out of town. 
We had a large party of 30 plus and we were in the upstairs private loft and our waitress made countless trips up and down the stairs to make sure all of our orders were taken care of. 10/10 Service. 
Would highly recommend.I really enjoy Bar Louie! 
Cheap drinks, and really cheap burgers on Tuesdays. 
For being a dollar, also, the burgers are pretty good, though of course, the specialty burgers are much better. 
My boyfriend and I come here whenever we can just for a night out. 
We love the food, and we also love the ambiance of the bar: not too crowded, not too sports bar-ish, just a fun and cozy place for food and drinks.Cozy atmosphere with interesting locals and tourists having various beers and cocktails. 
Friendly staff and your choice of bar seating or sitting next to the windows.We originally went here for the outdoor patio and craft beer, but ended up staying inside for lunch and multiple drinks once we saw the great food selection and interior design. 
Good food, good service, and amazing atmosphere.  
Highly recommended.Great casual sandwich place in Evanston. 
Huge portions and large list of craft beers. 
The bar seating area is quite cramped so those that don't like getting cozy may prefer a table. 
The prices are on the higher end hence 4 star rating. 33 dollars for a chicken sandwich and 2 beers is a bit much.Amazing beer selection, generous sized burgers and sandwiches. 
Beer towers. 
Salads. 
Sides. 
Nachos! 
Also serves brunch. 
Bat 17 also has a pool bar next door. 
Definitely an Evanston establishment!
I would have gave this place 5 stars because the food is amazing! 
But we drove all the way here for the food and pool hall and they do not have pool tables like advertised! 
They should change their website and let people know that they no longer have pool tables availableCame hungry, left full.  
Burger was above average, sweet potato fries good, and local IPA beer good as well.  
No shortage of sports on TV.  
Both White Sox and Cubs on at the same time.  
Nice!
Pretty decent.  
Not the most amazing. 
They need to quit bragging about a "best of" ranking that is several years old.Great service. 
Really friendly staff. 
And the food was perfect. 
I haven't been on the Southside in awhile. 
And I was so glad I stopped there to eat. 
It was great. 
Thanks you guys, you made my night.Excellent service from the bartender that took care of a full bar and tables. 
He did an amazing job! 
Food is hot, delicious and timely.My server Kate, short hair, was the best server I've ever had! 
She was so polite and took care of our table so well! 
The manager of the night, Aham is also fantastic!
Waitress was nice food was delivered on time places nice and welcomingGreat food but lazy staff I get my order messed up all the time and have to argue for compensation like it's the least you can do charging those prices, ruining a customers meal experience is unacceptable with no compensation not that is even with compensation but atleast then the company would be decentFirst off, the service here is bad. 
It took forever for them to make an omelette. 
The waitress kept coming back to the table to make sure she had the order correct. 
It was very quiet and the two waitresses were running around clueless. 
It may be hard to believe, but it actually seemed like the waitresses were helping cook in the kitchen. 
They would disappear into the back and come out frantic serving food. 
The icing on the cake was when our waitress messed up our bill and acted as if she was doing us a favor by not charging us the coffee, but it is included in the breakfast. 
The food here is incredibly bland and on the verge of tasting just plain bad. 
How do you get an omelette wrong? 
We are talking eggs here. 
Avoid this place at all costs.Cute little restaurant that has some very tasty food but even better service. 
Francisco, the manager went above and beyond to make sure our first time there was memorable. 
Also, the owner, bartender and even one of the cooks stopped by our table on the patio and checked in on us! 
We felt at home and will definitely be back. 
Great view and reasonable prices!!!
This is a "gem" of a spot hidden beside trump tower in Chicago. 
Great staff and met the owner.  
It's a family business so  cool it's not a chain.  
Best pizza I ever had!!
We were looking forward to a great meal due to overall great reviews, however, had quite a poor experience. 
The restaurant was not very busy, but it took us a while to be served by our waiter, and he was fairly rude throughout our service. 
We ordered the mushroom rigatoni and it was so acidic it tasted like stomach acid or vomit- no exaggeration. 
Also, we ordered the lasagna of the day, which we were told was 4 meat, and there was absolutely no meat and just mushrooms. 
We attempted to tell our server, but he didn't give us the time of day. 
We ended up each taking a few bites of our food, paying, and leaving. 
Maybe they were just having an off day, but we will certainly not be returning. 
Pros: great location downtown.The tacked-on �Italian Bistro & Pizzeria� is the first clue that this location of Bacino�s goes well beyond the �heart healthy� thin and stuffed pies that put this Chicago chain on the map. 
The decent breakfast selection includes waffles and omelettes, but we�d recommend going in the afternoon or evening for one of the nine pasta plates and, yes, the pizza. 
John Robbins 1504755563The cook recommends the double cheese burger. 
Once you've got burger in hand add condiments, pickles are there, along with the standard offerings one would put on a burger. 
They also have hot dogs, Italian beef, and some other selections. 
There's a fully stocked bar. 
United Center, formerly Chicago Stadium, is a couple of blocks away. 
Glenn Russell 1505963786Very friendly staff. 
Place is a little odd. 
Some areas feel like it's a partial storage area. 
Getting food to go might be best. 
Sean Dennis 1504374309If you're looking for a good burger.. 
Do not go here! 
Pickles are thicker than my burger patty and its tasteless. 
The bun was massive and dry. 
We ate in and they have a stuffed dead Goat in corner that is falling apart. 
Very unappetizing. 
Beware.  
Emily A 1508178250Decent place to watch a game. 
Layout is odd, not a ton of seating and it's extremely busy before and after Hawks game. 
Did not have food. 
Guillermo Balandra 1501608006$6 for a double cheese burger is too much when you make me put my own toppings on it. 
I got to choose between onions and pickles. 
That's it. 
All I tasted was bread. 
The meat is small and thin.I just returned from eating at this place. 
While seated there, I kept on checking the name and reading the reviews because I was certain I got confused and I had gone to the wrong place. 
To make it quick: worst burger ever! 
I ordered a regular cheeseburger, the patty was so think I thought they were kidding. 
The bread was ok, but I didnt mean to eat a bun for dinner. 
No lettuce, no tomato, no mayo. 
Nothing. 
Just a dry, thin patty inside a toasted bun. 
You gotta be kidding me! 
How could anyone thing their burgers are good is beyond me.Iconic dive bar, which has since spawned a local chain. 
I highly recommend hitting up this original location if you're in town or looking for something touristy to do. 
Also, if you love retro places this is a spot for you. 
Walking in you're immediately transported back to the 70s and earlier. 
Made nationally famous by SNL's cheezeborger skit. 
Beer prices are a little higher then normal. 
Staff was very nice. 
You could probably look at the memorabilia all day. 
Don't forget this place is below street level so you've got to go down to the tunnel streets to find it. 
Don't let that intimidate you though.I went here because of John Belushi. 
It was a fun atmosphere, but they move you along, so don't expect to be staring at a menu too long. 
And the guy that was pestering me to get a double cheeseburger was right - a single wasn't enough. 
Don't make the same mistake I did.Nothing like walking down into a parking garage and finding an old bar.  
The burgers were great and the service didn't disappoint. 
Sat at the bar and had a beer.  
Bartender was chatty as well as the other patrons.It is the thing you think it is: Decent value dive bar doing a running reenactment of that SNL skit. 
A lot less pricey than other tourist-targeting spots, though. 
Bring out of town visitors in for a beer. 
Aiman Zayed 1505337384I’ve been coming to BIN 36 for the last eight months roughly once a month. 
Service is great, the manager or owner (not exactly sure) is always there making sure everything is running smoothly. 
Today, at lunch the manager/owner noticed that my table was a little wobbly and took it upon himself to fix it without me bringing it up. 
A+ service in my book, exemplary  service. 
Mrs. 
Stewart 1508170367The atmosphere is pleasant and light. 
The brunch options were unique and well  prepared. 
Its worth a try. 
Pamela Kramer 1497912531Don't miss lunch or dinner at this lovely restaurant. 
The food is fabulous -- make sure to order the Brussels sprout appetizer. 
We loved the meatball appetizer as well. 
The burger was great, the salads are good, and the fish sandwich was terrific. 
We were there for lunch, but with the excellent wine selection, dinner would be fabulous as well! 
The owner, Enoch, is there a lot and makes sure that everything goes well. 
I'll be back! 
Cory Straim 1506019448Great food, smallish portions and the food took a long time to come out.  
They gave us free drinks to accommodate the wait.  
Hopefully it was just a glitch Shayna Atkins 1503347461Organized a private event at Bin36 and truly had a phenomenal experience. 
The service was excellent, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and we truly has a phenomenal time. 
Would love to do it again.Wonderful coffee shop and cafe located in downtown Valpo one block east of the square.  
Large menu for both breakfast and lunch with wonderful food and some of the best coffee in town.   
Great bakery selection of homemade pies, cookies, pastries, and more.  
Comfortable atmosphere makes it welcoming for families as well.Great coffee and food!  
Staff is friendly.  
Expect to possibly encounter a wait. 
Not fast food, a place to sit and enjoy your food outside of the rat raceBig fan. 
On a soup bender and they keep a great rotation of homemade soups daily to keep it "fresh" for me.Coffee is great and reasonably priced! 
Staff could be a bit more friendly. 
Maybe not much experience in the restaurant business.One of the best cafes in Valpo. 
They have good food and an incredible loose lead tea collection. 
Being a tea enthusiast I love this place! 
Very chill atmosphere too.  
David Shih 1506972615We love the Bongo Room up north. 
This one has the same great food. 
But for me, the downside is just how tiny and cramped the space is. 
It gets really packed here and the space is just incredibly tight with little elbow room.Other than that, I can't fault the food. 
It's really good. 
So if you don't mind small spaces or don't have a large party, it's a solid choice. 
Rachel P 1508716159The food at this bongo room is great!! 
Coffee and tea selections are really good. 
They would do well if they sold coffee to go. 
I just hate they don’t have alcohol. 
Gregory Heller 1507602708Eggs benedict were fantastic. 
The house potatoes were over seasoned though. 
Also  they charged 3.5 for tea/coffee without showing the price anywhere Catina Moreno 1500835983Very cute place, small menu but very delicious items and large items.  
Really great place. 
This is a breakfast/brunch place so fair warning. 
Loved it though. 
I got the lemon brioche French toast so yummy Cassie 1497795598Delicious! 
Portions were big especially for the price! 
Price range was about $8-15 but well worth it. 
I had the tomatillo egg white scramble. 
It has a generous amount of avocado which impressed me. 
Staff was friendly. 
Probably not the best place for a large group because it's a small restaurant but our party of 4 was fine. 
I would definitely go again. 
Kitchen closes early on Sundays. 
No dark beers. 
The staff was friendly and the locals were more than happy to chat with us while we were there.Alot of good food for the price! 
We will be back next trip up that way! 
Nice sized beef patties not some thin strip of meat! 
Food and service was very goodAnother great time. ..  
I love it. 
Reminds me of the good old fashioned bars that use to be around.  
Dawn the bar tend and the staff, people in the bar very friendly happy go lucky people. ?
Enjoyed this bar in the past when I use to live in Crescent City , IL . 
A lot of us bike riders stopped here because it is a great friendly place . 
Music on the weekends, good food, good people. 
I ordered the Loco Burger and kimchi fries. 
Overall, I liked the food and the place had a good atmosphere for a quick bite. 
However, I found the food quite salty and had to drink a lot of water to get through it all. 
Additionally, Restaurant cleanliness could be improved, I noticed quite a food crumbs on our table and around the floor.I love their burgers! 
Great tasting burger not over seasoned. 
I recommend place!
Tried an unique and delicious BNG burger with bacon, onion, and egg.  
Homestyle fries are amazing and worth the visit by themselves.  
Service was quick and although I ordered carry out, the ambience inside seemed really nice.Their bNg is a great tasting burger! 
All the ingredients make it great. 
Even the fries are good. 
Not overly salted and/or seasoned. 
Even the location is great. 
Close to the beach so you can go for a walk on the beach after you're done eating. 
And let all that food digest with a calm listening of the waves afterwards. 
We certainly did. 
I'd for sure recommend. 
Amazing fusion Korean restaurant near Loyola. 
I love this place. 
The atmosphere is very casual. 
I love eating outside during the summer. 
Favorite things: kimchi fries, bi bim bop with barbecue chicken added, and chicken katsu.I highly recommend this to everyone. 
Really great food. 
The burgers are huge and taste fabulous, the chicken is the best, fries are perfect, and the employees are amazing. 
Great craft beers, food was good for a bar and service was excellentGood food, great service, nice environment Great fried chicken and good friendly people Order was wrong, fries were overcooked.  
Better off eating beforehand. 
Bottom Lounge was the venue for our recent wedding (September 2017) and it was perfect for our 80 guests. 
We had the ceremony and reception on site, utilizing both the indoor and outdoor space on the second floor. 
Natalie is their wedding coordinator and is absolutely wonderful to work with. 
She's very efficient, knows what she's doing, and makes sure that everything looks amazing on the big day. 
She has an inventory of items, such as dessert platters and cut wood discs for display that she's happy to let couples utilize. 
The space already has nice lighting, a Chicago feel, a permanent bar, and a DJ booth, so it saves the time of trying to plan the room from a completely "blank canvas." 
The optional photo booth and pinball machines are a fun touch. 
The food was delicious and was served family style. 
It was an overall great planning experience and perfect wedding day. 
Thank you to Natalie and everyone at Bottom Lounge!!
This is a great small venue where you can be close to the performers from anywhere in the room. 
Though it can be a bit cramped in the hallway where merch is usually sold, you can see the stage from most of the tables. 
The staff is helpful and they have a great food & alcohol selection. 
They were even very accommodating to my gluten allergy, which is not always the case at concert venues. 
Even though it's a small place, it's one of my favourites. 
And as an added bonus, the bathrooms are reasonably clean for a concert venue!
Fantastic venue for sound, anywhere you stand has a great view so you can still see the performer if you want to stay out of the madness in the front. 
Most importantly the drinks are very reasonable priced and bartenders give a good pour. 
Make sure to tip well. 
They deserve it.Truly friendly and accommodating staff. 
The beer selection is second to none. 
My only gripe is pricing, but it seems within reason for this town, so yeah..Was there for an event for TechWeek. 
We were upstairs in that space which was nice. 
It was small for the group that was there. 
The service was excellent all the bartender were attentive to however stepped up to the bar even with all the people that were there. 
That is one reason I would come back. 
Also since I didn't have a change to have any food there. 
I have to see what it's like.The Mexican restaurant Fiesta Brava is very good you must give it a try!
Good place to get fuelBrick Stone is one of those micro-breweries / restaurants that really has done that mix well.  
The atmosphere is warm with a touch of elegance.  
The staff is friendly and the food is top-notch!   
The price is a bit on the high side, but you get your money's worth.  
The in-house beers are good and they always have deals going on.  
Another side note: they focus on American style burgers, steak, and chicken, but they do some other types of cuisine very well.  
The pork flautas my wife and I had were delicious and just enough for two!
They also have larger tables available for larger parties.  
With all those things, it's little wonder why they have been around for years!
Wonderful place to go with friends or family. 
Very good food and drink Selection. will be back soon.Always a great meal;  Love the beer sampler; Jambalaya was huge, tasty and just the right spice; Shrimp & Grits was good as well.Excellent beer, good food, and great service. 
They accommodated our last minute family reunion party of 24 on Saturday night by opening their back room for us. 
Highly recommended!
Brick Stone is great. 
They have a wonderful burger that is put between two Grilled Cheese. 
Everything I have had on the menu has been fantastic.The service was great! 
Get the single glass of white sangria vs the carafe, its stronger and prettier. 
I also wish they would've warned us off just how large the rigatoni is because it couldve fed 8 people and there were only a couple of us.  
The food was pretty good. 
The mozzarella garlic bread was amazing though!!
I ordered using a delivery service so I can't speak for the service or atmosphere, however my order had no eating utensils or seasonings. 
I ordered spaghetti & meatballs w/ bread, but everything was pretty bland & tasteless. 
Very disappointing for $20, or any price for that matter, so I don't recommend.this is my favorite buca! 
there's always something fun to look at, and  the food is great. 
For lunch there's an option other than family style,  which is good!
We made reservations for our son's graduation party with the family. 
We needed a place with a variety of food items and space to contain our chaos. 
We found both. 
The food, from the salad to the chocolate cake, was amazing. 
They packed up our leftovers for us and we celebrated again the next day. 
The waitstaff were attentive and did a great job with our party. 
This is the second time we have met here for a celebration and both times have been great experiences.One of our favorites. 
Great food, hard working employees that seem to really care. 
Some of the very best food you can get, home style Italian is where it's at. 
The best ambiance you can have at a chain restaurant  W Ray Jack 1502303740Chicago is rich in culture. 
That is exemplified by one of it's premier  gems, a blues club known as Buddy Guy's Legend. 
When I stepped through the doors an electrifying  ambience embraced me. 
Guest from near and far enjoying the house delights literally were treated with a Monday Open Mike that included a Buddy Guy moment backed by the Jimmy Burns Group (house band of the evening). 
The night featured  riveting appearances by Mr G. Guy (Buddy's son), Mr Wes, Ms Holley Maxwell, and Ms Queen.
