The evening was rounded out with a rotation of sign in jam musicians who were not short on talent themselves ... 
Also, a shout out to my new friends from St. Louis, glad you had fun .... 
Nice spot Buddy
Had an amazing time. 
Prices were reasonable. 
Service was great. 
Louisiana Al was fabulous. 
Highly recommend Legend's. 
The Mike Dangerous Band was incredible. 
They played 2 hours nonstop. 
Buddy Guy sat in with the band to make it that much better. 
It was a wonderful experience. 
Rated 5 stars for the overall experience.  
Food is a solid 4 - wonderful homestyle Cajun/Creole. 
I was delighted to find that the new location, while a little bit bigger and cleaner, retains a bit of the "dive bar" feel and has a similar intimate layout like the original location.  
It's all about the music here. 
Pure and true blues at it's finest. 
Every table close to the stage. 
Even if you don't like or know the blues when you go in, you will love it by the time you leave. 
Great music...great atmosphere....great food. 
What more can you want?
I come here for pick up 1-2 a week and always have to good experience even if it�s slammed packed busy. 
The general manager, Phil is always helping his staff and treats each customer very well. 
Coming from a server background it�s so nice to see a GM get his hands dirty and help!!!
The server told me that something was too new, shouldn't have been on the menu, and cannot be made because there's no button for it. 
After I explained that there are 2 ingredients and if you have those, a monkey could make it...she then said "well I'll go ask if they can". 
Why didn't she do that to begin with? 
"There's no button for it" is a terrible reason not to at least ask if something can be made that is on the menu.Luke was amazing... he helped my daughter when she got the wrong (to spicy) wings...amd it was great.. very up beat and a joy to be around..kist all around fun...Food was okay nothing special. 
I was expecting more flavor from the screaming nacho burger. 
All you could really taste was onion and an unflavored meat patty. 
I have to give them the service was quick.Have had great service every time I've eaten here, which has been for lunch during the week. 
The fried pickles are amazing, as are the boneless wings in Wild sauce.Love this local fondue restaurant!  
The owner was so wonderful- really made it a great experience.  
Our server Parker was attentive and friendly.   
Portions were a bit small, but we still left feeling full.  
Desert was delicious- we scraped the pot clean!
I did my daughter's Sweet 16 party here and the children loved it!! 
The staff were AWESOME and the food too! 
I would most definetly come again and again.It does cost a pretty penny, but you also get a lot for the money. 
It's a fun time and the food is delicious, great to go with a small group of friends. 
Me and my boyfriend went to try Caf� Fondue for my birthday and it wasn't a good experience for us at all. 
When we went inside there was about 2 tables with people and it was fairly empty for a Friday night. 
The waiter was very kind but the food was awful. 
They brought out salad for us and it was clearly store bought bagged salad that was clearly old because the edges of the lettuce were brown. 
The meat they brought out was not clean. 
They served my chicken and it was coated with flower instead of being clean and fresh. 
Seemed as if they coated the chicken with flower and put it away. 
The desert was maybe the best thing they served. 
I expected a nice experience, to be able to go to a fondue spot that was closer but I could I have went to Gejas in Chicago instead and spent the extra money for the better quality. 
Caf� fondue was cheaper but it was a rip off.  
It was not worth the money or time.Amazing!!! 
Love the food and awesome customer service.The best chicken around!  
The owner tells me the chicken is all delivered fresh in the morning and never frozen.  
The skin melts in your mouth and you cannot beat the prices.  
Way better than the chains and the hyped boutique fried chicken places in the City.I'm giving them ONE star because the workers tried to play me for a foul. 
Noticed that there were fries sitting in the basket that appeared to be old, pointed over to the basket, told them I didnt want those fries, and asked for fresh fries. 
Saw them drop fresh fries BUT then noticed the OLD fries from the other basket were gone. 
Get my food and here I got some light fresh looking fries and some that looked like they were cooked longer which is impossible UNLESS you put the OLD fries back in so they appear to be fresh too. 
REALLY! 
After I specifically said i didn't want the old fries you give them to me anyway thinking I wouldn't notice. 
Had my business up to this point.If you are looking for a great dine-in experience....this is not the place. 
If you are looking for something greasy after a night at the bar, LOOK NO FURTHER! 
Their Chitterlings, fried fish, fried chicken, gyros, Italian beef, and philly are all excellent. 
I love the mild sauce! 
Even better -- you can place your order and walk to the liquor store next door. 
;P For this neighborhood, they are the best option and are open late!
Y'all just suck.. 
Why can't you ever get a simple Italian beef right? 
And god forbid you call and ask for it to be fixed it ain't happening... 
Plus it takes 40 mins at least for the damn food even when u call ahead y'all ain't that damn busy.. 
UghThe chicken here is always fresh and very well seasoned. 
Recommend it to anyone looking for some good quality chicken love and miss this place..Had a 6:30 reservation for a group of 18. 7:30. 
Still waiting. 8:30. 
Still waiting. 
Offered a round of free drinks. 9:00 finally seated - at two tables instead of the one large table we reserved. 
Took forever for the food to arrive and we were not even offered menus.  
The food was great, but not worth waiting over three hours for.  
We watched several groups of 2, 6 and 8 get seated while we waited and waited. 
Entertainment was fantastic.We were visiting friends in the area and we wanted to get some lunch before we left town to go home. 
We travel a lot and we really like eating at "local" places that have some character,  and this place has it in spades! 
As my wife and I both have lived in Germany, our hosts suggested Chef Klaus's and we were very glad they did. 
My wife had her standard Jaeger Schnitzel and I had a German beef sandwich. 
They were both very good, and we would love to go back the next time we are in town.Authentic German and great live music. 
My whole family loves this place (even the kids). 
If the Nazi�s won the war, this would be every restaurant in America... you�ll see what I? 
mean when you get there. :)No offense to the readers, as a former chef I very rarely give 4 stars and know very few restaurants that deserve 5. 
Though, this is a very good restaurant. 
I have only been here twice, but nothing was disappointing about the meal. 
For whatever reason we started with the raw oysters. 4 of the 6 were fresh and good blue point oysters. 2 of them were on their way to turning. 
Still, that's our fault, who the hell orders oysters at a German restaurant? 
Aside from that the schnitzel and Goulash dishes we got were very good. 
We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and humorous. 
Prices are a little high for the eats, but all in all, you can enjoy a nice atmosphere, nice beers and good food!
Horrible service. 
Waited 25 min for waitress to take our order. 
Never got our salad, never got drink refills, sides were cold. 
Had to ask twice for bread. 
Hardly ever saw our waitress. 
Been eating at the Bier Stube for the past 25 yrs including the one in Frankfort and in Peotone never had service this bad. 
Check was $130.00 and I'm not sure I'll go back. 
So disappointed.I was very skeptical about how the food was going to taste. 
Mind. 
Blown. 
So so good!! 
The staff was awesome! 
Loved the decor! 
Wish there was a place like this on the south side,  will definitely return!
My wife and I had lunch today at the Chicago Diner and it was fabulous.  
I had the hash with biscuits and gravy, and she had the country fried veggie steak.  
It was delicious.  
Our server was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.  
The diner reminded me of a small town cafe, but with great visuals on the walls.  
We'll come back next time we are in town!
My partner and I were visiting the city and just happened to walk in about 9:45pm. 
We had no idea we were so close to closing time, the staff were so welcoming. 
We also had no idea we had walked into a vegetarian restaurant, so that was a pleasant surprise as well! 
The food was maybe the best vegetarian food either of us ever had. 
Our server was hilarious, too. 
Highly recommended!
Finally visited this diner with an old friend who was in town. 
The restaurant is so crowded that you feel like your neighbors are at your table, and it's loud. 
The food was good, but not allergy friendly. 
My friend had one of the lunch specials and was very impressed, saying that despite being vegan the sandwich was really awesome. 
I had a veggie omelette that was good, but apparently contaminated with gluten. 
:(I knew going in it was suppose to be some crazy good food, they did not dissapoint. 
Good to know meat free doesn't just mean salad! 
Get dessert...no seriously get it! 
Absolutely delicious food!  
Oh my gosh, we will definitely go back there to eat again.  
Appetizers, lobster bisque, seafood, steaks, were all ordered at our table.  
Everyone was very satisfied.  
Love the ambiance, our waiter Phillip was outstanding!  
His passion clearly showed as he explained each of the menu items.  
You must go!!! 
This place is very impressive. 
The decor and atmosphere is wonderful. 
The food is tasty and well done especially the steak and oysters. 
Chicago Firehouse, having reopened after a devastating fire in 2014 is an awesome place for both lunch and dinner. 
It has a very open feeling with the tall ceilings and great decor, and the food is fantastic. 
Their steaks, burgers and Amish brick chicken are all must trys. 
They have a variety of meeting and banquet rooms upstairs along with a veranda. 
This place has a very different atmosphere comparing to other restaurant in South Loop. 
The food are good but I didn't think it was outstanding. 
I was impressed with their own Firehouse red wine blend though. 
It's a nice change of the restaurant type in the area.  
The food and staff are amazing. 
The ambiance inside is relaxing and elegant. 
It is a great place for a casual date or a special celebration.My cousin recently had a wedding here, there was almost nothing good about the place except the decorations and the manager. 
The food was awful. 
The wedding cake was cut and served when it was not suppose to be. 
The bartenders were not friendly at all and service overall was very mediocre. 
Worst of all, many decorations and valuables for the wedding were seemingly stolen by the employees and days later have still not been found. 
I would not recommend this place for anybody, especially if you are going for something special like a wedding.I work for Comcast and we have had a few employee meetings there. 
We love there banquet hall.Great for banquets. 
And their live music night are good too. 
Just get to an event early so you don't have to park in their overflow lotI have been here twice for a funeral luncheon and a baby shower. 
Both times the room was great, service was good and the venue itself is such a nice open place to hold events. 
The rooms all break down to the perfect size for your event including a great outside area.Great staff. 
Very friendly and accommodating.A friend who lives in Chicago took us there after discovering that my daughter loves chicken and waffles. 
At 10a, I am eating some of the best mac and cheese, collard greens and fried chicken that I have had in a long time. 
I�m from the south, and I can�t find a restaurant with food this good at home. 
This is the caliber of food that your parents and grandparents cooked. 
Service was good. 
Even had real sweet tea! 
No complaints. 
If I lived there, I would be a regular, for sure!
My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast recently.  
We ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of grits.  
The chicken was seasoned really well, but the waffles were just alright.  
We loved the grits and the music was great!  
A very comfortable setting to eat in.  
Our waiter was very nice as well.My wife introduced me to this gem. 
The chicken is seasoned well. 
The best side is the mac n cheese. 
I always ordered the smothered chicken and waffles. 
To me the gravy is awesome.Amazing food all around. 
The greens are fabulous, which is always a good sign they're doing it right. 
Service was fast and friendly. 
Portions are big, and prices are reasonable. 
The interior is really nice and great music. 
There were lots of groups of people all eating and laughing and having a great time. 
A very fun experience.Such welcoming staff! 
Something sooo magical about the atmosphere, feels like home. 
And the food has me in a food coma!
Great food and service, has Byob (1 wine bottle for 2). 
We shared food, so I tried steak, pork ribs and stuffed pepper and it was really delicious!!!! 
The chocolate desert was great too!! 
Just don't be scared it's in basement and bit crowded, but worth it!!!!
Ingredients were well balanced out in a very playful way.  
Lots of depth in flavor and surprising elements.  
Everything makes sense.  
Nice ambiance and good music.  
Friendly staff.We were so hungry, we ate all the foods before remembering to take picturesOne of our favorite restaurants in Chicago. 
They definitely won't seat you until your party is all there, but once you are seated the food is fantastic. 
Menu changes regularly and food is always fresh and inventive. 
BYOB and mostly gluten free. 
(Not middle eastern as other reviews as mentioned), it's Mexican with an inventive menu. 
Would highly recommend, a great local spot!
No frills, BYOB, but so yummy. 
Expect a loud, crowded atmosphere with a fun menu. 
Perfect place to bring a few friends and a bucket of beers.Great food with just enough spice. 
Small and cozy. 
Great for date night.Great place for local Chinese food and good pricesWe eat here at least once every month.  
Their food is fantastic and the servers are great.Always friendly service. 
Enjoyed the Curry chicken today, with Crab Rangoon, and 2intin soup. 
All Delicious.The interior is showing its age, but the food is very well made and time is taken to make it. 
There is no buffet like most Chinese restaurants do.Good food, friendly service, a will drop in again. 
Thank you.This Chipotle used to be great. 
But now it's filthy and the staff is pretty rude. 
We've had to wipe off a table to sit and eat the last 3 times we have visited. 
The food was good, but they don't keep the line clean so as they push your bowl across the line, it will collect plenty of smushed toppings. 
I think one of the cashiers is racist. 
He will only greet/talk to African American people that come through the line. 
If you are white he will not respond to "hello" "how are you" "thank you" or "have a nice day" or even make eye contact with you. 
Just a very unpleasant and odd Chipotle. 
If you know of another, I would say it is worth the extra mileage.Went there at 8:30 on a Tuesday and a line out the door the whole time we were there. 
The staff was quick to get orders out. 
Orders were correct and portions were fine. 
They seem short staffed but it was probably unexpected for a Tuesday. 
A few things lacking napkin holders empty and there was a wait on chips. 
Ours were stale probably from a lull before the rush but wasn't willing to sit around just for some chips.Consistly good. 
I order with the app and it is always ready. 
Portions are good and people treat you well. 
Definitely will continue to visit!
This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. 
Try the Steak Mexicans. 
Yummy?
Always a pleasure at this Chipotle. 
Food always in large portions, and very tasty. 
Restaurant clean. 
Staff friendly. 
Even though line long, it moves at a steady pace. 
I will definitely be back.Food was great! 
Much to my surprise. 
I didn't know what to expect from looking at the place from the outside but inside was pretty nice and the food and service made it even better.What can I say, I love the service the food and the atmosphere... 
You feel so at home when you enter, the owner greets everyone with a smile and a hand shake... 
Great place all around !!!!!!!!
We had dinner there last night, specials were superb.  
All the food items were perfectly prepared without being preciously presented.  
The chefs are amazing.  
The waitstaff, including our server Roxy, also completely charming, professional, attentive without hovering and never pushy, qualities that I as a former waiter from college days can totally appreciate.  
And this was reflected in our tip.Tuna amazing! 
Salmon not so much. 
Service and atmosphere great!
Ok food service was great, small portions. $7 for a salad with your meal I thought was a bit pricey.This club is becoming the worst Club in Chicago!!! 
And trust me I've been there from the beginning, when they're was pool tables and the girls were friendly, polite and Hot!!! 
And Nick didn't have a limp!!! 
And Chris, Tom and Dino used to shake my hand and thank me for coming in, And champagne room were reasonable priced, and the pictures of the girls on the walls actually work there, some of those girls haven't worked there in over 10 years!!!!
Plus when you actually went there on a Wednesday night and it was jam-packed!!!! 
Now the place is dead, the girls are rude, ignorant and 25 pounds overweight!!!!  
Me and my buddy we're there for over 2 hours and none of the girls came up to us at all!!! 
But there was 3-4 girls sitting next to us stuffing their face and bitching and moaning about how money they weren't making!!!! 
So after about 45 minutes of listening to this we decided to leave and go to polekatz where the girls they're treated us like royalty and we ended up getting great back rubs and lots of dances and talk to some wonderful girls. 
That's the way it used to be here!!!!!
This club gets worse every year! 
and I think it's because of management, all they care about is whoring the girls out and  selling champagne rooms!!!!! 
Plus They need to give some props to the wait staff instead of beating them up all the time threatening the fire them. 
If it wasn't for them this place would already be close just like Allure Gentlemen's Club which they owned!
Here is my advice stop remodeling the place because every time you do you make it worse!!!! 
Nobody likes this new design feels like we're sitting on school bus you, might as well put seat belts in the chairs if that's the look you were going for!!!! 
And remodeled the management, security and the girls!!!! 
Customers could care less how the place looks, we care about the entertainment and the service we receive not how the establishment looks!!!! 
If that was the case Jimmy's would have been closed 20 years ago!!!
Wow this place is awesome, Gracie and Asia are the most friendliest, best dancers around. 
My husband and I went with a group of friends and we all love this place. 
My husband and I recommend Gracie, she's awesome and very friendly. 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER FOR SURE AND ASIA. 
THEY'RE THE BEST!!!!!!!!?????????????????????
Went with a group of seven ordered two bottles and as I was playing the slot machines a stripper walks up to me and I told her watch my machine and I'll give you $20 as I go to the washroom she clears my machine of 175+ dollars and walks off... when I bring it to management they get mad at me and kick me and my group out before the second bottle was even touched and as I have made several attempts to resolve this issue there has been no response back from management nor the owner Dino.... 
Been going with friends for years but after this this I will no longer....  
The worst part is I now have a group of 10 people ready to leave 10 more reviews!!!!
Nora is definitely one of the cutest girls there. 
She�s your girl next door type and is extremely talkative and will certainly make your heart race!
Girls suck, "security/bouncers" assholes, overall experience was terrible. 
The girls extend dances with out telling you. 
Ended up paying for 2 dances when I only wanted one. 
Shady place, stay away from here and spend your money elsewhere. 
P.s. 
Girls here look like my big toe.Went for the Halloween event. 
Paid 12 bucks at the door and felt like we were part of an intimate 90s rock concert. 
Bands were great, people were friendly and everyone had a great time. 
Best time at Halloween in a long time.I eat lunch here fairly often, had everything on the menu at least once. 
I have my preferences, but have never been disappointed. 
Usually some good rock/metal playing, though I've heard a lot of things playing. 
Great patio, and delicious beers. 
Just go.We we're in town for the Frozen 4 and stopped by because of the closeness to the train stop. 
Really wasn't expecting much but boy were we surprised. 
The beer was outstanding and even better was the food. 
Our waitress Joey was great, her recommendations for food were spot on! 
The pork sliders, apple fritter hush puppies, and green beans were some of the best dishes I have ever had. 
Highly recommend this place! 
Keep up the good work.I always love coming here. 
Staff is cool. 
And the drinks, food are not priced bad at all. 
And the live music is always phenomenal. ?
Great outdoor seating area, friendly service and good food. 
I had the cobra club sandwich with tots. 
Three types of bbq sauce on the table along with ketchup made for great flavors on the tots! 
No drinking this visit, but they have a plethora of beers to choose from. 
Will definitely be back.Love the go-carts. 
Golf coarse needs new carpeting.I walked in and was greeted immediately with a big smile by Wendy. 
She signed me up for the rewards program while I was there as well. 
It was one of her first days on the job and she was so patient with me. 
I wasn't able to get the other co workers name that helped us out that day, but you guys are always sooo nice. 
Thank you for making my experience seem less stressful. 
I don't usually carry credit cards with me, so we were having issues processing my rewards. 
But we go it to go through and I'm happy that I will be able to enjoy my free bottle of wine each month! 
Thanks Wendy!
Always fantastic food and service. 
Michelle was so sweet and attentive. 
Hostesses are all friendly when you walk in, great atmosphere!
The best bread, service, food, and soda/tea!!!!!
Come here for any special occasion or just because, this is the best food ever they are so friendly here and if you have kids they give you a free chocolate covered strawberry the burgers are the bomb and the pretzel bread is the best bread I've ever had!!!!! 
Come here I promise you won't regret itA great wine selection and honestly the food is really good. 
It's a chain atmosphere, but still enjoyable. 
My only suggestion would be to be less pushy on selling the wine. 
However I do understand that is the job of the restaurant. 
Good selection of food and reasonably priced, good value wines. 
Not exceptional, but good value. 
Especially for a resteraunt.You should visit Illinois center location. 
People working there treat you real well. 
I buy lunch a couple of times every week and I am very happy with each and everyone working there.Thank youOnly came here because I had a free entree coupon but I was pleasantly surprised by the superb taste of the rustic food. 
Love the bread they use and I would definitely recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner stop. 
Try the pesto chicken! 
It's delicious! 
Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. 
Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh. 
It gets busy on weekdays during lunch, but the line moves quickly.I've been to this Cosi a few times now, both during lunch rushes and without and once for breakfast. 
Each time I've felt that the lines were a bit disorganized and the staff was a little behind, even the one time that they weren't all that busy. 
Everyone was friendly but it felt rushed and not the level of service I've had at other Cosi's. 
That being said, if you've eaten the food here it is the same as the other locations, good cafe food. 
I think with some of the other options in the immediate area that it isn't my top choice for sandwiches but the soups have always tasted pretty decent.The service here is very quick and the food is pretty good. 
So many healthy options to choosr from (salads, samdwiches, soup). 
Popular spot at my workAwesome stay! 
Hotel staff were amazing. 
Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)! 
Trusted him with making me whatever drink he wanted and I didn't regret it. 
Prompt service. 
Housekeeping did an excellent job. 
Laura at the front desk was always so helpful. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Really nice hotel�heard they recently did some renovations. 
If this is true, it paid off! 
Within walking distance of many great restaurants and the staff is very nice! 
Can't go wrong here.Wonderful hotel and even better location.  
The staff was very helpful and friendly.  
We had a  king room with fold out couch.  
The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  
My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   
Pool was small but nice.  
I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  
Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. 
Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  
I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  
The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  
Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  
Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!
I was there for a training for work.  
The customer service is wonderful.  
They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. 
The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. 
I will definitely be staying there again soon. 
This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. 
This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. 
The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. 
It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. 
There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. 
The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. 
Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. 
Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. 
The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. 
It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. 
We will definitely be staying here again.Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
Hotel was clean and check in was a breeze. 
Beds were super comfortable. 
Would definitely return again.I had a wonderful stay for nine nights. 
This place is a great secret. 
Great people. 
I have been to a lot of hotels and I have to say this is my favorite. 
They are there to help 24 hours.Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  
Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  
Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.  
Great location and friendly staff. 
Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. 
The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. 
It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.This is a beautiful hotel. 
Beautiful water views, patio, sofa sleeper in the suite, comfortable beds, and on top of that a friendly staff that meet you with the smile, and even bring you up at toothpaste and toothbrush when you need one. 
An indoor swimming pool, bistro, and Starbucks are a few amenities in this beautiful modern decorated hotel. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area.I'm only giving four stars because I have a concern regarding service. 
On Sept 3rd I came in to eat your buffet. 
I remembered. there  was a format for customers that said when they were finished eating to turn over their paid receipt. 
Well I had a plate of salad that I finished and headed back to get more food. 
When I got back I found my glass of water and a clear table. 
I said "What the"? 
and the server told me where the table I was sitting at. 
She apologized and brought me another glass of water. 
Later she told me that some of the staff doesn't comply with that policy of a turned over receipt. 
Do customers have to inform the server that they are finished and not returning from now on? 
Or is this something the server has to make the call on? 
I'm just glad I didn't have to get up and didn't leave a plate full of food! 
Also I'm glad that the section I was in wasn't crowded or I would be out of a table also. 
I just want to know what to expect if I ever come back to eat there again! 
It would be interesting to know!
Because it is a good buffet and I been eating there for years. 
Surprisingly awesome breakfast! 
I haven't been here in a while.  
The manager was super friendly, and knowledgeable.  
Very clean, neat, and organized.  
Can't wait to come back.Been going here a long long time, best deal , best food, best people and the buffet items are always fresh,  the restaurant is always very clean and the staff very friendly. .and it's all you can eat!!!!!  
I have eaten all over this country and Coyote Canyon is the Best Buffet there is...Trust Me.....I LOVE THIS PLACE.Food was good and a decent variety. 
Busy place. 
Being this busy, it's hard for staff to keep up... 
Both drink stations were out of ice and ladies room wasn't clean (according to my wife). 
But overall, was good. 
Better than we expected for a buffet. 
Lots of families here. 
If you're looking for intimate dining, this is not it. 
But if you're wanting to feed a lot of people a lot of decently good food quickly, we'd recommend it. 
The food isn't wow-great, but everything we had was pretty good.I love this place and they have the best food. 
Super clean everywhere in here. 
I was impressed by how quick the team moves to clean up. 
Everyone working had a smile and greeted us right away. 
We had a chance to meet the owner Jim, who seems to be an amazing guy and we could tell he treats his staff awesome. 
If you like food.... 
You need to come here!!!!
We love Cracker Barrel, but our waitress here needs to go, at least get a stern talking to.  
I know she forgot to put our order in.  
We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but waited over half an hour for our food.  
The people who came right awhile after us got their food right after we got ours. 
AND she wrote "over medium" when we both ordered "over hard." 
Time was important because we're traveling 500 or so miles today.Food was fine. 
Service was slow.  
She didn't clear the plates when we were done. 
I'm glad there is more than just this store locally.There were 4 of us. 
Place was pretty full. 
However our service was above top shelf.  
Thank you Billy Jo. 
Food was pretty good as well. 
Stop and see her. 
She's that good.Sandra, the waitress, was a gem and Peggy, the hostess, was so kind and nice. 
Great people and consistently delicious food. 
Couldn't want better. 
Even picked up a nice winter cape on sale in the gifts department. 
Whooppee!
Always a great place to eat. 
Nothing fancy but good basic breakfast foods. 
I really enjoy the eggs in a hole. 
And they have a good sweet tea. 
Easy growler and howler fills off I65 - less than 10 min detour.  
Inside a pizza parlor.  
Smelled good.  
Good service.  
Easy parking. 
This place is perfect.  
Good beer.  
Good food.  
Excellent staff.  
It is small, which adds to the appeal.  
Nice outdoor seating for the warm months. 
One of my favorites in NWI.  
Quiet lounge area with lots of room.  
Beers are delicious and so is the pizza.  
Sunday you get a XL for the price of a large pizza.  
Nice place and I will be going back! 
Great beers, mediocre service, pretty good food. 
Comfortable surroundings and good beer. 
Got good beer recommendations from Raven. 
Food is okay. 
Still a five star.We walked in to Dave and Busters October 20th for lunch and was thinking the lady in front of us was wearing way to much perfume, so bad that my eyes started to burn and tear up when she walked away the smell was still there we decided it was an air freshener and I ask one of the people working was this smell through out the entire restaurant and he replied yes it was. 
We lost our appetite at that point from the smell and left.  
I have never been in a restaurant that smothered there food aromas from the kitchen with perfumed air fresheners. 
The aromas from he kitchen actually enhances the taste buds and makes people hungry therefore increasing your sale potential from orders. 
Bad idea from the manager at this site. 
After we recovered from our nausea and burning sensation to our nostrils  we to Cheddars and had a wonderful lunch.We just went here for the first time and it was absolutely phenomenal. 
The food was so delicious and our waitress was super cool. 
Not to mention after we got done eating our delicious food we got to go right over and play games. 
Great experience. 
Can't wait to go back.Games are all that this location has going for it. 
The food is terrible and overpriced for the quality served. 
Short staffed waited 20 min for drinks the waitress was rushing talking so fast we didn't know what she said. 
We have been to many Dave and Busters on the east coast but this location is a joke.First time going here with my family it was awesome our server was the best we spent about $200-250 a little pricey but it was worth it, definitely beats chuckee  cheese ? 
will come back soon!
I celebrated a birthday here and everyone had a great time!  
We got the Eat and Play combos and our server was excellent!  
All of the arcades were working and the prizes were affordable, had a fun time!
My wife and I have eaten here a few times.... 
The food has always been good, well-cooked and promptly delivered to our table.  
Refill service and table seating can be slow with no apparent relationship to how busy or staffed they are.  
If they could work on their service/staffing issues this would be a first rate Dennys.Driving cross-country, we were tired of fast food and waited to find a Denny's, looking forward to sitting down and to the usual good service.  
However, while the food was typical good Denny's food (when we finally got it), the service at this Denny's was the worst we've ever experienced, virtually nonexistent.  
Upon entering the restaurant we stood at the front desk for five minutes, totally ignored, and saw only one waitress running around handling everything in the restaurant.  
We saw no other staff.  
Finally a hostess (manager?) 
came out from the back to deliver a check to a table.  
She made eye contact with us ... and then headed toward the back again, ignoring us.  
We waved our arms and she came over.  
We were shown a booth ... and then proceeded to sit ignored for twenty more minutes.  
By that time several other staff members had appeared, mostly walking in and out from the back and standing around talking while that one waitress continued to do most of the work.  
We couldn't tell who was supposed to be doing what because when the other staff members did do anything, there didn't seem to be any clear division of labor: at different times different people seated customers, bussed tables, rang up checks, etc. -- all while ignoring us.  
We were on the verge of walking out in disgust when finally we caught the waitress' eye and waved her over.
