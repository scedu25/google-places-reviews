I strongly recommend it!
$50/night valet mandated parking or $40/trip at the nearest lot...so we were told (didn't confirm) was a bit steep imo. 
The valet were prompt, cordial, and available 24hrs.The room was clean and comfortable. 
The bathroom was a nice size and clean as well. 
We had a corner room which overlooked the parking lot and forced us to keep our blinds closed or give the neighbors an easy view. 
The business room was quaint, but easily accessible and quiet. 
They have a shuttle service and the driver was great. 
Very personable and altered his route to bring us closer to our location (it was raining). 
Ultimately, I would book this location again, although I would probably skip bringing my car there.First and foremost, my biggest piece of advice if you stay at this hotel is to call the local police if there is illegal drug activity and audible violent altercations on your floor.  
We called security 3 times to address this exact situation as we tried to get sleep for our sick loved one in the hospital across the street.  
Nothing happened, so if you'd like something done and you'd like to sleep, call the local police.Second, expect a lack of flexibility, empathy, and respect from most of the front desk employees/managers.  
If you'd interested in an absence of security for your physical safety but an abundance of security for your Marriotts rewards points, this is the place for you.  
One plus- the bartenders were very kind.Staff was friendly and helpful. 
Rooms were clean. 
Toilet ran until jiggling the handle, but otherwise everything was in working order. 
Location was great for our conference at the UIC Forum. 
Would recommend.If you are attending an event at the United Center this is the perfect place to stay. 
They offer free shuttle service to and from the event. 
The hotel was nice either a large bathroom. 
The breakfast was very good but a little pricy but that may be typical for the city I'm not sure. 
I would stay here again if going to the United Center.Expensive but very nice. 
The front desk staff was extremely helpful. 
The only weird thing was the restaurant. 
My husband went to get a Starbucks drink but it wasn't really a Starbucks drink. 
Something on the machine quit working and the drink ended up being half of whatever it was supposed to be but he was still charged the full amount. 
I will say, tho, they id try to make up for it the next day.This is a great hotel. 
It had one of the largest gyms I have seen in a hotel in awhile. 
Come on, they have battle ropes, in a hotel gym. 
The service is good and find are pretty big. 
Everything is clean and well maintained. 
You can't ask for more in a hotel, and if you did I'm sure they would oblige you.Friendly staff and fully renovated hotel. 
The amenities that include the club lounge to the gym were amazing based on the location and legacy of the hotel. 
The gym was about the size of one floor of the hotel which was great to see.I attended a conference here.  
The rooms were clean.  
The staff was quiet but friendly.  
The food was good.  
Water, tea, and coffee were always available.Rooms are nicely redecorated, but it's an old building and windows are not well sealed. 
So even on a high floor street noise is very evident (and there's a lot of it). 
Also, elevator noise could be clearly heard, even though I was three rooms away. 
Also, AC unit was noisy and rattled. 
Not a place for a light sleeper. 
First room I was given had no hot water. 
It seems incredible that the hotel would not be aware of this, did they think guests wouldn't notice? 
I called down and they said they would send maintenance up. 
Didn't happen for a while and I had a meeting, so had to take a cold shower. 
Then the maintenance guy showed up, confirmed the problem and left. 
Later when I came back, nothing had been done, so I called back down and finally was given another room. 
Staff were trying their best, I think. 
Every member of staff that I dealt with was friendly and helpful (except for that maintenance guy).No specific problems, but the room was in a state of needing some attention.  
The grout around the shower valve was gone so it was flapping off the wall and letting the water run inside.  
The fabric of the desk chair was ripped as well.  
There were very few accessible outlets and no USB connection.  
Not what I expect in 2017.  
However, things were clean.This hostel is ok. 
It's cheap and is located near the Willis Tower. 
You can easily reach downtown Chicago by foot. 
The staff is friendly, too and the breakfast which is included in the price is totally fine. 
The cutlery and coffee cups could be cleaner. 
It is also not very cool that it isn't possible to lock the toilet doors and that the toilets and showers are in one room. 
But if you only stay there at night it's ok.Not very clean. 
Super thin walls. 
I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the bar three floors below. 
No individual control over air conditioning. 
Over-priced and they charge for everything. 
They even charged $2 to watch my bag for a couple hours. 
I'm glad it was only two nights.Good location and price. 
However, the two single bed room I booked had a couple Maintanence issues, including 2 electrical sockets with exposed wiring, the walls and ceiling are looking a little worse for wear, with some water and physical damage. 
The first floor women's showers did appear to have a mold issue. 
That said, I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.The rooms are roomy! 
The breakfast is free! 
The showers are very nice! 
The Parthenon Hostel is the whole package. 
Highly satisfied.Worst hostel ever. 
Unfriendly staffs and misleading room sizes from description. 
On top of that, they have only one Men's toilet for an entire floor. 
There is always a queue in front of the toilet. 
What an horrible experience for a group! 
Breakfast is so poor as well. 
You can get a cheap hotel with more amenities at the same price. 
Feeling so regretfulPretty good stay. 
It's a 3 star hotel so there are some cosmetic and function flaws (dresser drawers and closet doors that don't slide open or closed smoothly and a room door on which the deadbolt requires a trick to work) but the staff was friendly and helpful. 
Bonnie (front desk) and Jesse (maintenance) were sweethearts, easily changing my room when I declined the one with the trick deadbolt. 
I loved the room they moved me to. 
Plenty of space. 
The hotel is within walking distance of McCormick Place where the conference I was attending was being held. 
Even better it had free parking!
My one major complaint is that the cleaning staff isn't terribly thorough or especially good. 
Nothing was left dirty just less than neat. 
They left one of my pillows on the floor after my first night there. 
I didn't realize I'd knocked it off and apparently neither did they. 
And on another day they didn't replace the towels until evening when I was back in the room and the lady was knocking as she used her key to come in the room. 
Just really glad I was fully clothed. 
I'd stay here again but it would be dependent on the price and how close it was to where I needed to be.Nice hotel, good beds, big bathroom and the tub is huge. 
Seems like a decent area, but I'm in town for an event, so I haven't gotten out much. 
Few blocks from an L stop that takes you to the north loop, so pretty convenient! 
There's a few parking areas, first come first serve. 
I checked in early, so there were plenty of available spots but it could fill up quickly.Awesome! 
Loved the large rooms with refrigerators included. 
Beautiful large bathrooms. 
Front desk people very nice!  
I liked it better than the Crown Plaza. 
Some in my group did not like the parking situation which is an open lot.  
Lobby nice too.Great hotel! 
Loved the remodel. 
Front desk was awesome and friendly. 
Perfect location for our visit. 
Free gated parking in back.The people who work here were nice. 
They were good with turn down service. 
The drinks at their bar were well priced. 
My only knock is having to ask for extra face rags. 
Two people should get more two rags a piece. 
That and their "private" lot gate wasn't properly functioning when I arrived (they have a gated and more open lot; must have their parking pass to park in either).All good other than.My friend and I visited Chicago to tour a film school, and when researching hotels before our trip we found Chinatown Hotel to meet all our requirements while still being quite cheap. 
When we arrived we were not disappointed, everything was what we expected or better and the location of the hotel was perfect too. 5/5 would recommend.Decent location. 
Easy access to trains and only a few stops from downtown. 
Rooms were outdated, had very few features (TV with a couple of channels and A/C) and far from cozy. 
The building is older so there is no elevator, which after a long day of walking was rough. 
I would stay there again if I couldn't find a deal downtown again.Great place to stay. 
The rooms are small. 
If you are looking to stay in your room for your entire visit them it might be a problem. 
Otherwise its close to lots of things. 
The room was clean and bathroom clean. 
There is no elevator so if you are on the 3 rd floor its 3 flights of stairs. 
The staff is very nice and helpful.Looks better than expected and the rooms are rather comfortable. 
Although the constant siren might be a slight annoyance at night. 
All in all, location was the key of my choice.Cheap and affordable. 
Great location in heart of Chinatown with close proximity to public transportation. 
Very basic amenities but helpful and friendly staff.We paid $250 for a Saturday night. 
Not worth it! 
The hotel was very noisy - sitting right next to the Train and with thin walls we could hear walking above and laughing and shouting into the night from next door. 
The decor is very plain - robot monkey and train theme. 
Drab grey. 
Bathroom door would not close. 
Worth the $78 for a week night but not worth over $100.PROS: Two rooms with a couch, historic building, proximity.Nice room, plenty of space. 
Staff seemed friendly. 
Bedding and towels were clean, as was the room. 
Beds were nice and comfy, pillows we're in good condition. 
In room refreshments seemed to be reasonably priced. 
Rooms had soaps, shampoos, and lotion included. 
Only downside was the enterance. 
It just didn't feel very classy - felt like it was underground. 
I would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.The worst night ever in a hotel! 
The air conditioners were very noisy. 
Every train stopping at the Belmont station was loud enough to wake me. 
And I was awoken in the middle of the night to discover that I had many (40-50 ) bug bites all over my body. 
The room apparently was infested. 
But don't worry, a brief visit to Urgent Care doctor and I am on the mend. 
Though at the moment I just was to rip my skin off.Pros: Cozy, comfortable, close to the L, tons of awesome food spots within walking distance, great neighborhood, nice people.Cons: noisy air conditioners (but actually probably not much of a con as they drown out the street, train and other guest noise) laggy TV, so it probably should be a pro.)Positives: Location is great -- easy walk to Wrigley, and right by a transit/train stop. 
The rooms are nicely sized, and the place definitely has a historic feel and some charming retro details. 
Nice afternoon snack setup and light breakfast offered free daily. 
Multiple excellent food options in the neighborhood. 
Negatives: The radiators are very loud, clanking, woke us up a lot. 
Ended up turning the dial to turn them all the way off, but that wouldn't be an option in the middle of winter. 
The floors are also very creaky and there seems to be virtually no soundproofing between floors. 
Our upstairs neighbors for the first two nights paced and paced and paced -- including in the middle of the night and very early in the morning (3-4am), making it difficult to get solid blocks of restful sleep. 
The final night we were there, a new couple moved in upstairs and while there could be no doubt when they were having sex, at least it was a reasonable time  and they went to sleep afterwards, so we got some sleep finally. 
Between the rads and the floors, we were pretty tired when we left. 
However, I did not hear noise from outside the building, nor from the very nearby train. 
I would probably stay here again, if I could be assured of a top-floor room. 
This hotel was clean, comfortable and had a kind and attentive staff.  
Go there.  
It's awesome!  
They care about their customers.We were a little skeptic at first...don't be! 
This is a super clean hotel with great service! 
Liz and Bryan were super nice! 
The breakfast was amazing! 
Not your regular (Holiday Inn, La Quinta...etc) out of a bag into the microwave breakfast. 
They had meat,(thick bacon, not thin and microwaved) eggs, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, pastries... 
The pool is simple and has a cute slide located in the somewhat center of the hotel. 
The pool could be right out your back door if you choose. 
The price is very reasonable! 
The restaurant definitely gets ***** as well! 
Hat's off to the chef! 
The only thing I could say that was a little inconvenient was the smaller bathrooms, but it doesn't stop us from coming back!! 
Great Job Clarion Inn owner/staff keep up the good work and lower prices!
The rooms were very clean. 
The restaurant has excellent. 
The breakfast they served is one of the best offered by a hotel.Good overall dining experience.. 
A little wait for service. 
But over all experience. 
GoodComfortable just didn't like the room service foodThis hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. 
It was easy to find. 
The staff was very accommodating. 
The first night there was a slight buzzing noise in our room that we determined was the mini fridge. 
Since we didn't need the fridge they sent maintenance up to unplug it for us. 
We did not at first have enough wash cloths for two people in the room, but they brought us up some upon request. 
There was coffee in our room, but each morning we took advantage of the lounge's coffee, tea, fruit and granola bars. 
In the afternoon there was soda, candy and various trail mixes available. 
The bed in our room wasn't the most comfortable but was fine for two nights. 
We also really appreciated the complimentary bottled water stations on each floor. 
Overall, especially considering the price, we were extremely happy with out stay here and would definitely return.Excellent hotel downtown on the river. 
It's conveniently located in downtown Chicago with great rooms and a great staff. 
There is a restaurant in the hotel and everything is nearby. 
You also have a view of the river in some rooms. 
Definitely recommend for anyone in Chicago.Great location. 
Rooms are relatively small, but is enough.  
Good service.  
Water filling stations on the floors for bottled water.  
Clean and comfortable beds.The staff here is the best!! 
Nice free snack bar. 
I will say don't love the beds there a little hard but other wise fabulousRooms were well furnished and comfortable, front desk was wonderful and helpful, restaurant service could have been better, valet was a bit understaffedAlthough I've stayed here before, this last visit was by far the best! 
The room we had was very spacious, including the bathroom. 
The bathrooms are usually just big enough to accommodate each guest. 
This one was big enough to sleep in if necessary. 
Plus it was not a handicap room!
Great staff who were accommodating, warm and not to mention the fastest check-in we�ve had at any hotel or motel. 
The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great with delicious and surprising additions to the standard Comfort Inn/SuitesIt was actually really good for the price even though we had four people and I ended up sleeping on a chair I still thought it was good. 
They had breakfast too Wich was pretty alright. 
Overall would recommend.Was in a good location. 
The breakfest in the am was very good. 
Pretty quiet at night and good customer service.Great location. 
Very clean. 
Breakfast bar always serviced. 
Staff very friendly and helpful. 
Room serviced daily.One of the nicest and well-constructed Comfort Inns that we have stayed in recently. 
Notice the seal on the door in the picture to help make the place quiet. 
In addition to the standard eggs and sausage this location also had biscuits and gravy.Comfortable and clean room. 
Good hot breakfast. 
Friendly staff. 
Be careful if you use the pool area as the tile there is VERY slippery. 
Not sure why it's not textured... it seems like it would be a liability. 
We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel. 
Clean. 
Helpful/Friendly. 
And a yummy breakfast tooThe hotel was sleek and modern. 
The rooms were big and spacious with modern decor. 
The beds are super comfy. 
Has a clean feeling environment. 
I would definitely recommend. 
Only thing was the town surrounding smelled like cow ploppies.Fantastic and cheap place to stay if you are driving through this place. 
During our countrywide roadtrip this turned out to be one of the nicest places. 
Clean cozy rooms and good breakfast !
It was really nice! 
I had my son's birthday party there. 
It was a pool party. 
They were under construction or remodel but they were super great I couldn't use the breakfast room for cake and pizza so they let us use the pool room as long as we cleaned up after ourselves and one of the guys doing the remodel gave my son five bucks for his birthday which was really nice of him. 
Super great stay and I'd do it again! 
Awesome!
Concerned at first because of the carpet debris thrown into parking lot and in front of building, but they are just remodeling and making effort to improve the place. 
Kids enjoyed clean pool, breakfast was fully stocked even with a lot of guest checked in, quiet rooms BUT THERE IS A TRAIN TRACK so be prepared for train noise. 
We would stay here again.Comfort Suites was perfect for my needs. 
The rooms were large (had 2 queen beds and a pullout couch) and clean. 
It was close to the casino and just off the highway. 
I was helped in a very friendly manner and they were very hospitable. 
They also have a very nice pool and hot tub.Easy location to get in and out to I-29.Good breakfast.Helpful and cheerful staff.Good value for the price.Nice rooms, decent pool area. 
We stayed in a double bed suite and it was clean and comfortable. 
Friendly, accommodating staff. 
Good selection for the free hot breakfast. 
Workout room was cramped, but did have a treadmill, elliptical, and free weights. 
Jennifer P 1505844122Nice motel, friendly owner. 
Reasonable price. 
Close to everything you would need!! 
Joseph Sherck 1497153853This motel is exactly what you would expect at the price and location. 
It's mostly to serve the truck stop next door. 
But, the sheets, toilet, and tub were clean. 
That's about all you can ask for at these joints. 
Also, front desk clerk was very nice. 
Lots of TV channels to drown out the sex from next door, which would be louder if the walls weren't cinder blocks. 
Jeff L 1502980727Nice Motel nice people reasonable prices close to anything you need Earl Paone 1500900427Everything is disgusting,  I was actually glad I had my own blanket because I refused to sleep on those blankets!   
The office style chair is absolutely atrocious and stain riddled.   
Most of the switches in the room don't work.   
The vent in the bathroom didn't work.   
Refused to shower without flip flops on due to the mold riddled tub and needed to shower with the curtain open because the curtain was stained everywhere. 
Paula Hall 1501187456They could clean the rooms a little better, check the faucets to maje sure that the hot water is working in the sinkGo here if you want to have the most stressful time you've ever had at a hotel. 
They steal your money, over charge and then lie about it. 
Watch out for the stuck up 2 faced lying hotel manager. 
They charge your card, take the money out and then tell you it's being "held".  
They accused me and my family (2 adults and a child in the room) of smoking marijuana multiple times even after being told it was not us. 
Stayed for 3 weeks and I have never seen so many disgruntled customers in my life. never staying again and I will always tell people not to go there.Super friendly staff. 
Very quiet, well appointed room.   
Nice, but very small pool. 
Good to splash in. 
Free breakfast - sausages, biscuits and gravy and waffles for hot food, assortment of cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins as well as a variety of drinks.Would definitely stay here again.I came into town to attend the last practice at the Bears' training camp. 
I chose this hotel for my weekend stay because of its proximity to the camp. 
I got in late (after 11 PM). 
I didn't particularly care for the employee that checked me in. 
When I asked a question, her answer was very snippy. 
Didn't sit right with me at first, but then I shrugged it off. 
However, the treatment I received from the two front desk employees the next day was nothing short of spectacular. 
The manager allowed me to extend my checkout by an hour, which I desperately needed. 
That was very much appreciated! 
Additionally, when my Uber was late to pick me up, I arrived 4-5 minutes past my checkout time. 
I was in freakout mode thinking the hotel was going to require me to pay for another night in order to retrieve my belongings from the room (that is how it is done at most hotels). 
This was not the case! 
The young man at the front desk said that was not necessary. 
He reprogrammed the key for me! 
I never leave reviews, but I just had to commend these two employees for accommodating me as much as possible! 
I would stay here again, for sure. 
I gave it 4/5 stars because of the first employee I interacted with. 
Wasn't a big fan.I can honestly say this has been one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.  
Would not recommend it to anyone, ever.  
Highly recommend not drinking anything they offer as every time myself and my friend that were there found stuff in our drinks especially the coffee with green fibers coming out of the pots.  
The manager refused to talk to us over several issues that we had the few days we were there, and the entire staff was very rude about anything that you would need to ask about.  
Cleaning staff didn't even attempt to clean the rooms as I found dirt in hair in the bathroom on the first night before using anything.  
I wanted them to come in the second night and the same thing didn't even add toilet paper.  
Myself and my friend ended up leaving early and switching to a different Hotel down in Bourbonnais. 
It was absolutely terrible.  
Twice a year about 30 of us use this hotel to stay at...we do a collection show at the will county fairgrounds.  
We got there Saturday late afternoon and went for supper around 5.  
Back at 8...we sat outside having coctails and enjoying each others company.   
At 915 the desk lady came out and said we had to go.    
We were all ok with it and started to move to our rooms.   
Nobody was out of hand or loud by any means.   15 min later a police car showed up then another and another.   
Told us the front desk lady had called and said we were loud and wild...my jaw about hit the floor.   
Well we went to our rooms but I went back to my vehicle about 10 min later.   
There was still a officer outside.   
We chatted some and he said he sat and wat he'd us for 15 min before they confronted us.   
He said he seen nothing wrong with what we were doing.   
UNREAL.       
Come to find out the people that were there the night before we're loud and crazy sitting in our same spots ....the guy slipped the lady $100 and another $100 to the lady who came in for the night shift.     
It was ok then.     
They thought we would do the same for them.   
NOT.         
We have been staying there 2 times a year for close to 10 years.   
Not any more.     
So next time u want to stay at this motel...make sure u don't sit outside and enjoy the evening without slipping them some cash.    
UNREAL.My family has stayed at this hotel many times over the last 2 or 3 years.  
It has become our go to hotel when we are in the area.  
We stayed there this past weekend and we were very disappointed to know that our favorite manager Ms. 
Tracey as we called her, was no longer working there.  
She always made my family feel welcomed.  
Our last visit may have been our last visit to this hotel because of some of the bad experiences that  occurred during our stay.   
The night manager was not very sympathetic  to our concerns about the plumbing issues, she offered to bring me up a plunger when the toilet overflowed!  
Really???  
once she came up with the plunger we still had to request that someone clean up the toilet water.  
her response "let me see if I can find someone"....shortly after that someone came up to clean up the water with towels....the floor was NEVER mopped! 
I know it was 2:00 am but I think they could have at least brought in some kind of sanitizer.
Nice staff but, the hotel needs updating. 
There were also stains on the drapes and one small stain on the bed spread. 
Other than that my stay was pleasant.
Initially, my husband and I were stressed because it was the only place with an available room and it was more than we intended to spend. 
However, the wonderful service provided to us by the front desk clerk, Desiree, made the whole occasion worthwhile. 
She was kind and friendly and she went above and beyond! 
The room was also delightful, very clean and nice. 
We forgot to mention non-smoking, so we did get out in the smoking section, but we really couldn't tell! 
There was little to no smell of smoke. 
It was incredibly comfortable, which is hard to find when travelling away from home. 
Overall, we were highly satisfied with our stay, and are likely to stay again in the future.I would give them a 1/2 star if possible. 
Only good thing was the coffee. 
They have dirty, disgusting rooms. 
I booked for a 3 week stay and this is what was in the room: dirty carpets(not vaccumed), hair in the bathroom on the floor and shower, coke or blood looking drips on the bathroom floor, trash on the floor between the beds and deodorant stick smashed on the floor next to bed, ac unit broken(ac stays on set at 64 degrees). 
I told the front desk and their solution is switch me room. 
Okay so I�m on my new room and still unvaccumed carpets, hair in the bathroom, and trash not dumped from previous occupants. 
Totally a dump here, they need to fire the cleaning people and hire someone who cares about their job. 
Very disappointing, also the lobby had a under construction sign which I�m sure is older than a year because there was NO construction going on and obviously everyone complains of dirty rooms, so maybe they just want to keep the sign out there so it�s a good excuse. 
Don�t stay here, spend the extra money for another hotel!!!
Staff and cleanliness was excellent !!! 
However the pool was way too high in chlorine and was burning our eyes just being in pool area. 
It reacted our sinuses as well. 
Other than fixing that everything else was fantastic. 
Just wish my kids and I were able to have some pool side fun.
Absolutely wonderful place to stay. 
We went down for our sons navy graduation. 
The staff is unbelievably kind and accommodating. 
They changed our room twice for us no extra charge, gave us extra blankets, made sure we were happy with the change, our son left his phone in the room when we're changing rooms and they called me when we were at lunch and told me they charged it up and that it would be at the front desk whenever we got back. 
Love, love this place and the staff. 
Oh yeah... the free chocolate chip cookies all day were awesome as well!!!! 
Thank you so much for the great experience.It was nice to stay there. 
Room was clean and  fresh.  
Indoor pool and hot tub was nice?. 
But no lights in either. 
The wasn't comfortable for me and my wife. 
I would have gave it four stars. 
Breakfast was ok. 
I expected some kind of meat for breakfast, sausages or bacon, but they did serve bacon and scrambled eggs the day we checked out. 
Free breakfast 6-9:30am. 
The area has lots of things to do. 
Mall, restaurants , stores, gas stations, pretty much everything within a 10 mile radius. 
We went to Steak and Shake and order Mindy's barbecue which was very good, brought it back to the room,  matter of fact we went to Texas Roadhouse which is on the same property. 
Its a nice place to stay for couple of days.Stayed here while in town for a wedding.  
The room was fine.  
Staff wasn't the best with passing along information or giving me the gift bag that was left for me by the wedding hosts.  
It's also weird and inconvenient that there's only vending/ice on the 1st floor.   
Inconvenient at check out b/c "system was down" and they couldn't print my receipt, but I did receive it by email.  
Management did contact promptly regarding my feedback.  
For the price, I would pay the extra $20 and stay next door at the Hilton :/Had my wedding block booked here. 
Had agreed on one price with contract then when guests called to reserve if 2 people were in a room they were being charged an additional $10 which was not agreed appon. 
Had to call and give each guests name affected individually to get fixed. 
Then another guest called and they said there were no rooms available. 
But when I called on there behalf they suddenly found one. 
Overall not the best experience for my wedding.This place sucks, was rated as a 3 star hotel on price line, lucky if it would rate as a 2 star.  
Shame on you Price Line, you have lost a 25 years loyal customer.  
Back to this crapy hotel, it seems like the gal at the front was more concerned about feeding her face and playing games one computer.  
I'm actually thinking about checking our now and going to a hotel that cares about their customers.  
Stay away from this dump.Awesome stay! 
Hotel staff were amazing. 
Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)! 
Trusted him with making me whatever drink he wanted and I didn't regret it. 
Prompt service. 
Housekeeping did an excellent job. 
Laura at the front desk was always so helpful. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Really nice hotel�heard they recently did some renovations. 
If this is true, it paid off! 
Within walking distance of many great restaurants and the staff is very nice! 
Can't go wrong here.Wonderful hotel and even better location.  
The staff was very helpful and friendly.  
We had a  king room with fold out couch.  
The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  
My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   
Pool was small but nice.  
I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  
Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. 
Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  
I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  
The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  
Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  
Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!
I was there for a training for work.  
The customer service is wonderful.  
They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. 
The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. 
I will definitely be staying there again soon. 
This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. 
This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. 
The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. 
It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. 
There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. 
The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. 
Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. 
Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. 
The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. 
It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. 
We will definitely be staying here again.Excellent location that is close to many bars and restaurants in River North. 
Valet service was a breeze, check in was easy. 
Rooms are clean, and quiet. 
Lots of city noise from outside, but the hotel is literally in the center of the city, so I used the complimentary ear buds and slept very well. 
Great stayI wouldn't go back to Chicago if you paid me, but this was a nice hotel. 
Very clean and professional. 
The sauna room was a bit of a mystery though. 
There was no way to put water on the coals and they appeared to be heated with electricity which is unnerving. 
Definitely need to fix that.They had a barbecue available and a great balcony near the pool if you wanted to use it for a birthday or something like that. 
I liked the pool even though it wasn't heated and i loved the hot tub which was freaking huge.All the hotels here are a rip off. 
Might as well go to one with a hot tub. 
That's what I think anyway. 
I was able to walk and uber to all the fun stuff.Staff was very nice and room was adequate as expected. 
Lost a star as we found a dirty diaper "under" one of the beds as we were checking out. 
Obviously didn't smell but if the room was cleaned before we got there plus between our stays, I can't help but question the thoroughness of basic cleaning. 
Other than that, was a good stay.Stayed here with two teenage boys while in town for a BULLS game.  
The staff was super friendly, the room was clean and comfortable.  
We didn't hear any city noise and we slept well. 
It is only two blocks from michigan ave and the street the hotel is on is full of restaurants and nightlife. 
I Would recommend!
My husband and I couldn't be more pleased with this Hotel. 
Great friendly service from the ladies at the check in desk, the house keepers,  the staff at the door, etc. 
They all made our staying great! 
When they knew that it was our anniversary all the staff around congratulated us and gave us a gift. 
Also, when we returned from the Rock and Roll Chicago half Marathon, we were received with a big Congratulation.The room was actually a good size for being Chicago and least but definitely not least... amazing location!
Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
Hotel was clean and check in was a breeze. 
Beds were super comfortable. 
Would definitely return again.I had a wonderful stay for nine nights. 
This place is a great secret. 
Great people. 
I have been to a lot of hotels and I have to say this is my favorite. 
They are there to help 24 hours.Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  
Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  
Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.  
Great location and friendly staff. 
Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. 
The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. 
It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.Friendly staff and conveniently located. 
My room was a little noisy and I had a large flying beatle in the room so not a great night of sleep.Had my reservation 3 weeks before my stay. 
Because of traffic I arrived an hour after my check in time only to find out that my room was not ready. 
Still needed to be cleaned, which was done right away however the room was itself still dirty. 
The venue I was going to, if I ever go back I'll find a nicer place a bit further away.Nice service. 
Rough roomIt is decent. 
It's not like best western or something.FIRST OF ALL THE MAN WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE WHEN U CALL DOES NOT LIVE IN THE STATE, that was the 1st sentence the Lady in the office told us.  
My husband and I needed a place for a week stay, we walked in with our 18 month old son, the lady said she had one room for someone with a child (the other ones had new carpet or was recently  remodeled) she gives us a key and points across the drive for us to check it out. 
My husband opens the door and wouldn't even let us walk in! 
The smell of cigarette and old dirty sex just BLEW out of the room! 
DISGUSTING! 
Obviously we drove away. 
Don't waste ur time driving out to that *H#%hole. 
Mrs. 
Margo makes it worth staying here.My number one requirement for a hotel is that it be spotlessly clean which this was. 
It had some oddities, though. 
Room decor is on the plain side and a little dated but it actually suited my tastes, calm and relaxing. 
In  the bathroom where you would expect to find a hair dryer, there is a telephone! 
No hair dryer at all. 
No in-room coffee maker or microwave. 
Lovely plush bath towels but no hand towels or wash cloths! 
(Note: we later discovered the hair dryer on the far end of the shelf in the closet.  
If we hadn't noticed it by accident, we would never have thought to look there for it. 
When I asked the front desk about hand towels and wash cloths, the clerk said sorry they were behind on laundry, but they'd get the towels to us soon. 
We never did get any.)Our balcony looks over a roof area with lots of noisy AC units, but if you look out instead of down, the view is nice. 
The street looked really pretty last night in the rain. 
Parking is a drawback. 
You either park quite a distance and walk blocks to the hotel or pay a whopping $49 per day for valet. $49!
Crazy. 
Overall it's a good place and I would stay here again. 
Excellent stay! 
My room was a little warm for my taste.  
But it was a great room. 
Erick checked me in and he is a great representative for your staff.  
After a long flight and a rough trip from the airport he made my day with his warm smile.  
The Crowne Plaza will be the go to for my trips to Chicago.  
And this is why in an UGH member.Honestly the best I've EVER slept in a hotel. 
Bed and pillow were very comfortable and it was quiet. 
I thought it would be really loud but you couldn't even hear the other guests in the hallway or rooms next door. 
Staff and valet were friendly and personable.The Crowne is still under construction, which means it's very difficult to get in and out of. 
The only option is valet parking and it's crazy busy. 
The staff also seemed a bit overwhelmed with how busy it was Saturday evening/night. 
Our first room we couldn't get into due to the key entry needing a new battery.
