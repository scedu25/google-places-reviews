Sand Hills Golf Club

Text: One of my favorite things about this place is the privacy. Just outside the small town Mullen, Nebraska you would never know a world class golf course existed. Driving on the winding country road is a small sign followed by a dirt road reading "sand hills." When you arrive you are welcomed by the friendliness of the staff making you feel at home. After a relaxing day on the wonderful golf course with the best greens in the world they treat you like a king with the best food in all of Nebraska, the  freshest steaks one can have. Over all 5/5 stars for Sand Hills and if you get the chance to come here, take it!

Text: by far..one of the most relaxing golf trips you will ever have. The course is first class...no trees , no water. Originally did not have rakes in the traps because the wind blew the few prints in them flat. Traps are severe. Greens are interesting and varied in size and undulations. The routing of the course is fabulous. The first time you play it you may question some holes...but as my dear friend said " the fan is not on" meaning the wind wasnt up...and that , like all true links, is what protects the course. Regarding the facilities...Oh my goodness..well designed and well maintained along the Dismal River, quiet and comfortable and you park your golf cart in front. The food is 1st class as is the service. And I still havent mentioned maybe the best thing about Sand Hills... the people ! As pleasant a host as you could ask for. Nebraskans are good people and it shows.
