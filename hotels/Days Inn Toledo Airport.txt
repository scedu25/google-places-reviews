Days Inn Toledo Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Days inn Toledo airport was just fine, clean, everyone was friendly, but could use a touch up, and all the hallways smelled like smoke. I had no problems while I stayed there, and the room itself didn't smell like smoke, so overall my experience was positive

Text: I am going to start out by saying that the one night I've stayed in this "hotel" has been the single most depressing night of my life filled with regret and sorrow. We have booked a room with double beds and the first room we arrived to had a bed with the duvet covered in three very large stain, there is no way this was missed by room service as the stain were facing up, so as I came into the room, the stains stared right back at me, there is no way somebody in room service can look at this "new" bed and say "yep, this is fine", but I guess in this Day's Inn, anything is possible. I was so surprised  to see how obvious these stain are I decided to search for more. As I took the duvet cover off the bed, I stumbled upon what looked like a bed filled with a very large amount hair clippings, all over the bed, evenly spread out... I went to the very dimly lit front desk to let them know of this issue before heading to Toledo and they were polite enough to apologize and have given us another room after we came back from the city.

Text: It was an ok experience. The motel had a person who was staying there as his house was being renovated. This temporary resident was creepy as all get out. He would listen in to your conversations, butt into and attempt to join in on  your conversation. I complained about him to several staff members who had said that they were aware of his creepiness. Other than this the hotel was adequate for staying. The pool was atrocious! Bed was comfortable. I would stay again.

Text: Breakfast was standard fare, but good. Pool was fun although small and the paint was peeling. The room was big and comfortable.
