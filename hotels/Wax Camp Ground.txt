Text: Site was clean and pleasant. Volunteer Campground Hosts were wonderful. Close to both Mammoth Cave and Bowling Green. Eat at K's Cafe and visit the Walter Kelley Factory if you have the time. Will return.

Text: It's a beautiful campground with nice shady sites. But the road is hilly and curvy which makes it harder for the kids to ride bikes. Plus people drive way to fast. Way faster than what they are supposed too. We wouldn't let the kids ride bikes after the first day.  The host was also grumpy and not very helpful.  Doubt we will go back.

Text: Nice campground. Camping spaces generously spaced, all gravel, level, and elevated for rain run-off. Picnic table and firepit @ each camp. Lots of shade. Clean restroom facilities with large private showers. Children's playground up on the hill. Lake with rocky shore is primarily a source for fishing and boating.
