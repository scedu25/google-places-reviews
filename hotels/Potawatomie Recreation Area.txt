Text: What a great way to spend a weekend! Family is a focus for us and the owners do everything they can to ensure that you can relax and have a great time with your family.  They even personally came out and helped us get our rather large travel trailer in and out of a tight campsite.  The facilities and sites are well kept and amazingly clean.  The general store has a great selection of anything you may have forgotten at home for a great price.

Text: Nice campground.  Has mature trees and large lots.  It's not the place it use to be as the owners have changed.  Rental of a lot only includes two adults, as our children are older than 6.  We have three children and they always want to bring a friend....this increases our cost greatly as they charge for each child.  Camping should be a family outing :(   There have been many updates and an attempt to improve the place.  I always find camping a relaxing way to vacation. There are many activities - swimming, fishing, kayaking, playground, arcade, and ice cream.  I love the location and visit at least once per year. I am hopeful that as the new owners settle in the place will improve.

Text: We love everything about this place from owners, managers and the rest of the crew. It's always clean, well maintained, safe and friendly. Family environment where even new friends feel like family. We have camped for over 40 years and are happy to call this place home for 6 months a year.

Text: Had a family reunion there. Small restrooms. No changing tables. Could use some upgrades. However, our over all experience was great???
