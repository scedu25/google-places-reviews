Text: At first glance, the motel appeared nice. Two days after I slept there, I start itching all over my body. Red spots popped up from head to toe. I have no proof, but I'm guessing room 225 has BED BUGS!!! Beware. Owners need to take action immediately.

Text: Crappy hotel! Needs torn down!! It stinks, it's dirty, the interior door jams has rust on them, the carpet is worn out, water stains on the ceiling, mold, it feels damp in the rooms... I can go on and on!  Gross place! I recommend driving a little further and stay in Evansville Indiana!

Text: Was told on phone that single bed was ~$67 for one night. I say thats fine and we will be there. Get here and only double bed available and charges me more without letting me know. We drove an extra hour because this price was better for a single bed stay. 
There were ants in the room that we found in the morning when i tried to make a bottle for my infant son. There were ants IN MY FORMULA. Had to go buy a new container. 
Wifi was mediocre at best. There were notices posted about the bad internet but they failed to tell us about it.
After we found ants we quickly packed up our stuff. Didnt take showers and definately did not eat the contential breakfast. Fruit was out when we checked in at 8p so who knows if anything else was fresh.
The complementary shampoo and conditioner was expired. Its june 2017 when i write this and it expired in JANUARY 2017
For ~80 bucks i expectes better. A super 8 would have been better!
Will definately not be back.

Text: Terrible place to stay. I found pubic hairs on the toilet and in shower and they never cleaned the room. I had to go find them and ask for clean towels and more toilet paper. Don't stay here it sucks!
