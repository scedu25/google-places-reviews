Sunset Acres Motel
Rating: 5
Text: This motel is cute and quaint. I loved the decorations. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. It's an older hotel so the rooms are small but was perfect for just my husband and myself.

The grounds have a home like feel with outdoor seating and a beautiful garden area .  Angie and Rick will assure your stay will be a great experience . If you are tired of the high cost commercial chain hotels give  Angie and Rick at Sunset Acres a try , you won't  be disappointed . Jim and Cindy Huseby , Minnesota

Text: Awesome.  The owners have invested there time and money into this place. It's clean ,quiet. It's great place on the oversize freight Lane on 127.  The most pleasant experience.  Down to earth and yet extremely professional.  Don't drive to Adrian unless they are sold out which happens on Weekends so I have been told.  

****************  note oversize drivers and Pilot car divers, if you stay there treat the property with respect. The owners are awesome.   Thanks.
