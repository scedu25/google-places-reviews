Holiday Inn Express & Suites Morton Peoria Area
Rating: 4
Text: This is first time staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Morton. As I have found with most H.I.E. hotels it is very clean, the rooms/bedding are comfortable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. This hotel is located right off the highway and I was concerned with the noise, but my room was on the opposite side and was not a problem. The breakfast is your standard H.I.E. options with a decent variety for a quick bite in the morning. There are other restaurants in the areas if you want something more. The only reason for the 4 star rating is that the internet access is very slow. I tried both in my room and in the lobby area with the same result. It was less than 1Mbps, so streaming any kind of video was troublesome and trying to connect to work network was impossible. I also tried at multiple time in case it was just congestion, but same result even early in the morning.

Overall of you are looking for a hotel to take a break I would highly recommend this H.I. Express.

Text: Made reservations two weeks prior under a reserved block for a wedding. Requested early check in as we were driving the morning of from 3 hours away. Arrived at 3pm and were told our room wasn't ready know that the wedding was occuring in about an hour. Terrible customer service and planning.

Text: The hotel is clean, good breakfast.  They saved us at the last second because we left another hotel in town because it was so filthy and we didn't feel safe.  Great service and will stay here again
