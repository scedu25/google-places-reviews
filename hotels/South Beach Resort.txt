South Beach Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Great place for couples and families. We loved watching the kids play games outside. Our room had a jetted tub that looked out at the lake. We had a very minor issue that was taken care of super quick. The resort offers two adult pools and a kids pool and pirate ship, shuffle board, volleyball, and an outdoor hot tub!!! Great place to rent a house with the family!!  We plan on visiting again next summer.

Text: Overall nice hotel and pretty good value for the price. Clean rooms, access to nice clean pools, hot tub and private beach. The breakfast was so-so (only foods that require no preparation - pastries, yogurt, toast, etc.) but it's included in the cost so I can't complain too much. Walls are a little thin as well, but not too much of an issue. Would definitely recommend and stay there again if I were to go back.

Text: I spent a few days here with my two kiddos. They loved it! The one pool was a family oriented pool with a zero entry great for my non-swimmer. They liked being able to go play on the playground and dig in the sand at the beach. We will be back next summer for sure.

Text: We spent 3 nights in the beautiful hotel. Our room was spotless each day and every staff member we interacted with was so friendly and helpful. The grounds were impeccable and we loved taking advantage of the pool closest to the water. We had such a lovely long weekend here and definitely plan on returning!

Text: Very accomodating. We did not have a reservation and was travelling on whim. We got a good room with a good view. However we didn't have enough towels and the breakfast was not desirable.
