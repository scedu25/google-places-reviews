Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Champaign North, IL

Text: Staff was friendly and the room was nice, clean, and comfortable. My only issue was with the shower. The water pressure was slightly less than desirable, and the rod for the shower curtain was oddly shaped in a way where the shower curtain would come to rest all bunched up in the middle, with no covering on either side. This led to water getting everywhere. No other complaints. Everything else was as I would expect from a hotel.

Text: Not too bad, but not great. Met expectations. Free breakfast is pretty decent, hot eggs, bacon, and potatoes. Rooms a little dated, carpet and furniture old but functional, beds not too good. Bathrooms are spatious, functional, but dated. Not a fan of the dated showerhead, but all drains worked well. Floors creaky, and hallway sounds are noticeable.

Text: The hotel was in a good location, located right off the interstate by several restaurants, etc. Inside it had many interesting amenities: a lending library, a pool (with showers in the area), cookies and coffee available, big breakfast available but only had one real hot option the morning we were there. Their elevator needed some work. It was very slow and made a long beep almost as soon as the doors opened. For anyone in the third floor (who needs to use the elevator all the time), that gets annoying in a hurry.
