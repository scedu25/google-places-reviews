Text: This is a stunning home.  Gwenn is a most gracious hostess.  She knows the area well, and helped us with dinner reservations.  Everything is lovingly cared for.  Bedding and towels are wonderful.  The room we had was comfortable and spacious.  There is a quick coffee maker in the hall with various kinds of coffee and also hot chocolate for guests to use whenever.  We also had cookies brought to our room that evening.  We are returning to do more exploring in Jacksonville.  There are so many lovely homes in that area, I could OD on driving around town.  The main town area has charming little shops and is also a great place to visit.  You will not be disappointed in your stay at Blessings on State.
