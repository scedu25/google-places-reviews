Camp Mi Casa on the Route
Rating: 5
Text: Had the privilege of attending an Adventure Cycling Association leadership program along Route 66 just outside of Carthage, MO. Camp Mi Casa and those who run this campground are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. Our stay was made comfortable with very clean bathroom and shower facilities. The entire rv/camping sites are maintained very well. Give em a try, you won't be disappointed!!!

Text: Daughter had a softball tournament in the area.  Instead of paying for a high priced motel room we stayed here in our a camper.  Great choice.  The staff are wonderful and so are the people.  Not to mention the shaved iced- Birthday Cake was our favorite.  Also have to mention I had a part break on my truck and Dale took me to a local parts store to hook me up.  We had a great weekend.  FYI - Kids favorite part was the pool and the bathrooms.

Text: Stephanie was an amazing host. Very well kept area. The bathhouse was spacious, clean and air conditioned. Even though she still doesn't have tent campsites set up, she let me camp out overnight and gave me full access to the facilities. There's a tiny pool but it's enough to cool off at the end of the day. 
Thank you Stephanie!

Text: Fairly new and very nice, clean park. Not junkie. Sites are gravel and level. Full hook ups at each. The owners are friendly, helpful and live close by. On Old Route 66, quiet a few permanent people.
