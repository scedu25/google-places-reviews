Holiday Inn Express & Suites Charleston-Southridge
Rating: 5
Text: I visit this hotel regularly, and words cannot express how great the staff is. They are so friendly, and always remember my name. I love the new pillows on the beds, and my room is always immaculately clean and dark enough for me to get a great nights rest. If your coming to the area, I strongly recommend this hotel. It is my first choice when visiting Charleston.

Text: Staff worked with me to find a room I could breathe in. As an asthmatic, this is not simple due to allergy issues complicating things. They did this last minute due to a water main break at another location I had already reserved a room at. Staff is top notch. Room is good quality and clean, but somewhat outdated, and the A.C. is loud (I don't personally care, but it may be an issue for some.) ... Will easily come back if an opportunity presents itself.

Text: Hotel is dated and obviously refurbished. Suites are not much more than a regular room with extra furniture stuffed in. Room was too warm when we arrived. Staff was consistently friendly and worked to be helpful. Standard Holiday Inn Express free breakfast. They need new luggage carts. The three we saw were very old and worn. We used our IHG app to get directions through Google maps and it led us 20 miles off course into a bad part of town. Inside was clean.  Our floor was missing the ice machine.  Poll was small and closed to use by guests. Spoke to manager Saturday September 23, 2017. He listened and did what he could. He's a veteran and we all owe him graditude for his service to our country.

Text: We stayed here for an overnight stop on a road trip. It was worth the price! We have young kids and the beds are comfortable, the room didn't smell, the room was clean and the breakfast was really great! The service staff at the breakfast was especially friendly and helpful! The walls are thin- we could hear our neighbor's conversation and water running, but luckily they went to sleep at the same time as we did. The hallways needed vaccummed, but we arrived late and left early so I'm assuming they don't do that during sleeping hours. We did have someone attempt to steal our bikes off our rack in the parking lot overnight, but they were secured- so be sure to bring in or lock up any valuables (as you always should).

Text: We stayed and visited this Holiday Inn for business purposes hosting an event in the conference rooms. It was a great experience all around. It was close to the local airport with easy directions to get here. Tim, whom I believe was the manager, was super friendly and accommodating the entire time of our stay. Him and his crew went above and beyond expectations. The crew was great, the rooms were well kept and clean, and over all a great stay. Thank you for everything!
