Text: Very nice , quiet, clean, place in a very good location !! Inexpensive, didn't see the gift shop but I don't think that was any big deal. Very friendly people in this place and in this town.

Text: I haven't stayed here my husband does he's working right now out of state don't  rely on they're phone to get in touch with your husband if for any reason it's an emergency on the account that his cell phone is not working someone picked up the call in the office and hung it back up I called for 20 minutes afterwards and they wouldn't not answer period ! So this place sucks in my opinion they need to do they're job that's what they get paid for when I go to visit I damn sure won't stay here zf
