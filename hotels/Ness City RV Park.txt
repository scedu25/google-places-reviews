Ness City RV Park
Rating: 3
Text: No pull throughs. All back-ins. Sewers way in the back of sites. Best have a 20 foot hose at least. Sites are where an old motel used to be.(3 rooms remain for your viewing pleasure). $25.00 per night in 2017 You park on the level foundations. You can see the spots where the toilets used to sit. Lots of noise from highway 96. The shade from the trees on the west is nice in the afternoon. Electricity is good. 50 amp. Right next to a city park. Our 34 foot travel trailer scraped the rear bumper as we pulled in the entrance. It is what it is. A place to spend the night.
