Text: Nice clean place. Currently being updated. Next to the railway but couldn't hear much when the train passed. Safe walking path nearby, restaurant next door. Dog fee 10$ would stay here again.

Text: It's well priced hotel, though it hasn't been redecorated in at least 25 years. First appearance made it look clean enough, but after letting my daughter walk around barefoot for an hour her feet were BLACK from The carpet. Needless to say we wore our shoes The rest of the time. The employees were nice.

Text: As clean as the room appears...I had to switch my room!! Bed bugs!!!! I caught it and had to show the lady at the desk what I found!! I can't give this place a higher rating because I know that I was not the first one bit! #210
