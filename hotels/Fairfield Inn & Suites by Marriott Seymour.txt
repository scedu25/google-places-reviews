Text: Stayed 3 nights for business but my room and hotel were very clean. That is compliment to all the hard work the staff has to do. Shannon the housekeeper on floor #2 does an amazing job and is very friendly and professional.....makes it an enjoyable experience when away from home.

Text: Amazing. We showed up at 10:30 at night and managed to grab the last remaining room available (apparently there was some big event happening nearby, but we were just passing through) Rick was on night shift and I can not say enough good things about this man. He immediately started typing away as fast as he could so nobody else could take it and he locked it in. The beds were great, much softer and more comfortable than other hotel chains I have stayed at and the hotel itself is very nice. Rick was very helpful, kind and seems to love his job, he even helped us find a parking spot for our huge SUV with a U-Haul attached in an almost full parking lot. Great stay, would definitely recommend. If anyone from from management or corporate is reading this, Rick seriously deserves an outstanding customer service award.
