The Broadway Columbia - a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: My friends and I had a great time on the roof at the Broadway. It was chilly outside but the heaters kept us warm anyway. The view of downtown Columbia is unique and never gets old. The drinks were good but expect to pay more than other bars downtown.

Text: The location is perfect, right on the edge of campus and allows for easy access to any part of the downtown as well as being no more than a mile walk to the stadium on the far south side of campus. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bar on the roof had a cool view of the city and campus. I recommend the espresso bar in the morning as it was really tasty. Over all I had no complaints at all.

Text: This is a very clean and nice venue. They really go the extra mile to make sure that you and your group have a very good time. The drinks are wonderful. The view from the roof is wonderful. They have plenty of space for guests. Really it's an excellent hotel and an excellent location in downtown Columbia. I would have to say hands down this is the hotel I would stay at. And this is the hotel that I would reserve for special functions. And it's definitely the bar that I would do something special at.

Text: I'll have to say that we were pleased in every aspect.  I would have given 5 stars but it's not that kind of ambience (I think of Tony's or Tavern on the Green when you say 5 star). But, each dish was carefully prepared and very, very tasty. We did small plates and salads and remarked how all four choices were great. Then came dessert. The cheesecake was home made and the tiramisu was a "creation" unlike you would expect in a hotel restaurant. Kudos to the chef and staff. We shall return!

Text: Check-in was stellar. Both the Bellman/Valet Attendant and the Front Desk Host were friendly with their greeting and professional in attending to my vehicle along with my check-in. Likely less than three minutes until I was presented my cookie, on my way to the elevators and my room. 

My room was precooled which was very nice on a warm humid day. The room itself was perfectly in order and looks brand new. Great first time experience for an Stephens Alumni returning to view the eclipse and a campus visit.
