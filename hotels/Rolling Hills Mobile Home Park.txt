Rolling Hills Mobile Home Park

Text: I have lived at rolling hills at two different times.  Feb 2007 to July 2007 under one management company and Aug 2011 to Sept 2016 under a second management company.  Both times I have lived there were great.  The land lord is always willing to work with my situation.  Anytime someone needed fixed they were right there to fix it(provided I remembered to call them) even if the damage was due to my family.  I have lived in 4 different trailers - at all stages of their "lives".  Updates were done when something needed to be repaired.  I would recommend the park to anyone who was asking.  The rent is reasonable and management is wonderful.

Text: My experience has been one of the best renting from them. They help me when my furnace breaks down, or have a question regarding general up keep. The staff is nice and professional. Keep it up Rolling Hills MHP.
