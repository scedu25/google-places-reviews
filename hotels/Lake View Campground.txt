Text: Absolutely amazing place to stay. We have been coming here for 3 years, at least 4 times per summer and every stay has been exceptional. Everything from fishing, camp sites and customer services is truly amazing!

Text: I all you want to do is fish this place is okay. But, if you expect it to be a nice camping experience, forget it. Sandy, dirty, tight sites.
