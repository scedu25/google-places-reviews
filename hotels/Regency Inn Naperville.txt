Text: Worst place ever. Bedbugs everywhere. If I could post the pictures of all the bed bugs I encountered this place would be shut down. Don't know how this place is still running. Management does not know what customer service or hospitality is.

Please avoid this place if you can. (you've been warned) travel at your own risk.

Text: Amazing stay, perfect pillows, not to soft and the air conditioner wasn't as noisey as other places I've stayed at.

Text: Look, you get what you pay for. This is pretty bare bones and there were some minor maintenance issues like my door sticking. But it was inexpensive and got the job done for a lot less than the other hotels around.

Text: I would not recomend this motel AT ALL. The first room I ordered smelled horrible, there appeared to be mold on the bathroom wall, and the front door wouldn't stop beeping along with the smoke detecter. I asked for a room change and nothing was greatly improved. The room smelled old and the tub didn't drain. The towels they provided were also stained.
