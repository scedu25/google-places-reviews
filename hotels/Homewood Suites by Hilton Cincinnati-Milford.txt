Text: Hotel is nice and clean for the most part. They say they have a fitness center.....4 medicine balls, a broken treadmill and an antiquated elliptical machine is not a fitness center, an a room the size of a closet no less. The breakfast and evening snacks were actually pretty good. I had a raucous crowd on the patio keeping me up til 3am a few nights and the management never stopped it, but all in all this place was nice. In fairness to the fitness room problems, i saw a small sign saying the hotel got you free access 24/7 to planet Fitness 5miles up the road. I just prefer on site. I don't need much but this was pathetic. Quiet area with eats and a walmart next door. Good work location. 

***in an update, the management actually had the treadmill repaired. So I bumped my rating up to a five as this place had everything I needed for work. It's not a vacation hotel but for what I needed and the staff's courtesy, it's about all I could need. Nice work.

Text: Best hotel I've stayed at in a long time! Free breakfast and free dinner, with a number of options! Also free beer and wine for happy hour! Staff made you feel like you were family, rooms were immaculate and very spacious. Local dining and shipping close by. 10 min from a huge nature preserve with awesome trails. Stay here if you get the chance!
