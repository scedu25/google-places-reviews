Text: Though they just became pet friendly, they aren't.  Their own staff will claim that you don't pick up after your pet when you do.  The front office lady has a huge attitude. They don't clean the rooms regularly, and you have to pay to get fresh towels or sheets. Not worth it!

Text: My husband has been here a few months, I come when my daughter is off... I think they should put families on one end , dopes in the middle, and workers at other end. We seem to get under people that's on something banging furniture on the floor all night, one side is a quite family, other side had people banging the wall through the night... been quiet lately on that side..
