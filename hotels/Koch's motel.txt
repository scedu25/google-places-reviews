Koch's motel
Rating: 2
Text: My friend and I stayed here for one night. We looked at the pictures and thought it would be okay. The screen door having a hole in it was the first bad sign. There were 3 beds. I checked each one for bed bugs and didn't find anything then or so far so that's a plus. The mattresses and sheets were stained and a bug went over my friend's bed. the bathroom was pretty lame with a pull chain light, a half used toilet paper roll, no exhaust fan, towels that could double as sand paper, and a leaky faucet. The walls and carpet were stained and scratched. There was 1 wall outlet with a power strip. Basically no effort to repair or replace.
