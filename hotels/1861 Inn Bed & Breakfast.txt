1861 Inn Bed & Breakfast

Text: I had a choice between another boring night at a Courtyard or HYATT Place. Instead, I tried this little B&B. What a great choice! Carole and Tom are wonderful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The pool and setting is a million times more relaxing than another business hotel. Tom brought beer out as I worked by the pool. Had a great run in the country. Breakfast was the best I've had in a long time. To top it off, I already miss Marley the dog. A charming place with charming owners. Go out of your way to pay them a visit.
