St Louis West/Historic Route 66 KOA Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This has been a great experience camping. Our site is a pull through 50 amp full hook and our fifth wheel is 42 feet long. No issues with length of site or getting in and out. Our site is right by the highway but noise hasn't been an issue with the air conditioner running. Lots of shade! So much that we couldn't pull a satellite signal but the cable they offer is fine. Pool is well maintained. Overall very good and friendly staff.

Text: My families new favorite KOA campground! Outdoor heated pool (mid October), jumping pillow, pedal cars and gem mining. We were never without something to do! The deluxe cabin couldn't have been any better! Fully furnished including your first few cups of coffee! And the staff were amazing!

Text: A very nice KOA.  Clean and well cared for.

My only complaint.. a cable system that doesn't carry ESPN!   Who doesn't carry a basic sports station?   I had to go find a bar to watch the baseball playoff game instead of relaxing in my coach after a long day.

Text: Great Location!  Super friendly staff!  We spent 4 days/3 nights here and will definitely return.  Lots of shade.  Super close to Six Flags, and not a long commute to St. Louis.  We were able to do tons in the area using the KOA as "homebase".  We got so into some of the things we did we didn't get to everything we wanted to do - so we are already planning a return here.  Lots of activities on-site and tons to do in the area off-site. 5 stars.

Text: Stayed overnight in a travel trailer. Nice long pull-throughs. There is a loud train that goes by I heard it twice during the night, only reason I knocked a star off. Otherwise very pretty and cute RV park. Perfect for an overnight KOA.
