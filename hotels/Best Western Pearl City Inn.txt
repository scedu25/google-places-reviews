Best Western Pearl City Inn

Text: Clean. Usual BW styling.  They have dedicated employee preparing made to order only for breakfast. Even more amazing, I called asking for 8am check-in time as I drove all night without sleep to meet a timetable.  They allowed this and declined my offer to pay a surcharge for this very early check-in.  Very classy.

Text: A very clean and modern hotel. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms were great and the beds were comfortable. The only issue I had was a very noisy AC unit that would wake me up. I let the front desk staff know and I'm sure they will deal with it.

Text: Service was on par. The location was decent as well, which wasn't directly off a major road. Rooms were as expected for an establishment of this type; in fair conditions. There is a pool and gym. Breakfast is offered during certain times. Some restaurants in near vicinity.
