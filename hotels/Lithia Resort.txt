Lithia Resort

Text: The website pictures don’t do this place justice. We stayed in cabin 6 and it was beautiful. We had everything we needed to prepare meals and it was all well kept and a nice quality. The grounds are beautiful. Although we didn’t have any luck, we saw some kids catching bass in the little pond.  It was a quiet, peaceful place to rest. The cabins are built well and we didn’t hear the “neighbors” at all once we were inside for the night. The staff was very friendly and more than accommodating from the time of reservation through the time we checked out. 
The mattress on the queen beds was a little firm for my liking, but I’m a little spoiled with a tempurpedic at home. 
The furniture is fairly rustic, but come on you’re camping not staying at a Hilton. It was definitely more than we expected and we will definitely recommend it and plan to stay again.

Text: Called Nancy on short notice, she gave us a great room.  Have stayed at Lithia Resort several times, it is my preference when staying at Shelbyville.  Always a clean room, friendly staff.
