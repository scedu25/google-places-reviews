Text: We have a group of 3 to 4 guys that go to Ravenwood Lodge every Fall for a few days of pheasant hunting, sport shooting and over the top hospitality and awesome food. We all catch ourselves looking forward to this annual trip as our favorite fun trip of the year. Everything they do is done with a love and appreciation of us, they're customers.  The Corbet family are all involved which just makes the whole experience feel like your visiting family and if you love pheasant hunting like we do, this is the best in the west. Thanks for another great time and see you next season. Stan, Ron and the 2 Richard Craniums.
