Hampton Inn Clinton
Rating: 4
Text: Great location right off the highway near restaurants and Wal*Mart. Nice, very friendly staff and nice rooms with adequate charging plug ins. I would like to see them add refrigerators to every room. The rooms currently do not have a refrigerator or a microwave. Another good Hampton!

Text: The staff were friendly, and the bed was comfortable. The only issue I had was there was no refrigerator in the room, which is handy for people who need insulin. Would still recommend.

Text: One of the best hotels, around the area, and Hampton is generally a great hotel period, I've stayed at almost a dozen locations,  and due to some staffing issues in the evening this is my least favorite, however because of the location I've stayed at this particular one close to a dozen times.
