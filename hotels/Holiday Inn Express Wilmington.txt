Holiday Inn Express Wilmington

Text: Our stay was nice. Front desk was courteous, rooms were extremely clean. We had a suite, 2 quien beds and a couch that made a bed too. The room was very spacious, A.C. worked great which is always a concern in a hotel room. Breakfast was free and good. We would stay here again if we were in Wilmington.

Text: The staff is friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is quiet and nice throughout the day and even on the weekend never got bad. The breakfast was good everyday, however around 9:30am there was very little seating left. Dollar General, taco bell, buffalo wild wings, Aldi, and a laundromat were all in walking distance. I enjoyed my stay there.
