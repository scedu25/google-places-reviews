HAYSVILLE EXPRESS INN

Text: Everything was clean and nothing was amiss. The breakfast was serviceable considering the venue. I mostly just wished that the sink was in the same room as the shower, so I could put my clean clothes somewhere other than on top of the toilet. (I put a towel on the toilet to keep my clothes sanitary)

Text: I honestly never really stayed at a hotel that wasn't a nationally know location like their competor down the road but when it was $40 cheaper and I was only staying for 6 hours I decide to try it out. Little to my surprise the room was very clean and offered the same service as any other hotel. I would recommend it over the national competor that's right next door charging $40 more a night for the same services.

Text: I spent 8 days there in June 2016, and it was the most relaxing comfortable stay I've ever had. Couldn't tell if anyone else was there because it was always very quiet. The room was nice, the bed was very comfortable. Enjoyed having a fridge and microwave, and a desk with a nice office desk chair. Had what seemed like 100 channels on the tv. The free WiFi was amazing and super fast. The a/c was extremely nice, especially for June. The staff were very nice. I had a disability room, which had an unusual bathroom, where the entire bathroom was like a shower room. No tub to worry about. Either just wheel your chair in, or walk in. Very nice arrangement, and easy to use. I can't think of one wrong thing about this place. They had vending machines and ice machine, and free breakfast too. Also had a laundry facility, or you could have your laundry done for you. Nice place, hated to leave!
