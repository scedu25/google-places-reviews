Lake Rudolph Campground & RV Resort
Rating: 5
Text: We came here a lot when I was younger and brought our own camper.  It was one of our favorite places to visit.  This past weekend we went for a Halloween weekend and stayed in the cabins.  It was so much fun!  There is something to do for all ages.  Although it is fun all of the time, going during a Halloween weekend is the best.  Just make sure to book way in advance as they fill up quickly!

Text: Lake Rudolph is a campground with  an abundance  of fun for all ages.  There are non stop activities for kids and adults.  Free Putt putt , fishing in the lake, transportation to Holiday World and Splashing Safari, movies under the pavilion , dance parties, karaoke , and swimming.   They also have  paid activities for a minimum fee.  Santa's splashdown water slide park, bingo, kayak /paddle boat rentals, crafts and seasonal activities.   This is truly a nonstop fun place!  You can rent a cabin or RV if you don't have your own.  They have laundry facilities, camp stores x 2, basketball courts,  food service that includes snacks, pizza, pretzels, and ice cream.  You can buzz around the campground in a golf cart rental to your hearts content.   If you like peace and quiet this is probably not the place for you.  Everyone will leave with a smile on their face.   We love it!

Text: We stay in the cabins here every year for Halloween which lasts from Sept to the end of Oct I believe. Many people dress up, decorate their trailers, cabins and the golf carts are all decked out, you cannot bring your own golf cart. If you enjoy Halloween this is the time for you to go. They have a trick or treat night and many festivities for the kids. They have spots for campers and their own campers and cabins that you can rent. If you're interested in going during the Halloween weekends you'll need to book really early so don't delay!

Text: We have talked about camping here & visiting Holiday World for 3-4 years, so when we were looking to get closer to a good viewing area for the eclipse, and discovered the weekday discount for fall, we decided to check out the campground as part of our eclipse excursion. This place is HUGE, with lots of things to do and enjoy. Although almost vacant the whole time we were there I suspect this place is a madhouse on weekends and high season. Which is great for families with kids looking to cram in lots of fun on their vacation. Staff members we interacted with were all courteous, friendly, and helpful. The camp store is well stocked. Some of the sites looked a little rugged, in fact we upgraded on arrival to get a more spacious and more level site. Huge sections of older rental travel trailers, and a lot of newer rental cabins that appear to be quite nice. Designated sites for tent campers interspersed with sites for pop-ups, travel trailers, fifth wheels and motorhomes. From the smallest tent to the big rigs, this campground has space for everyone with lots of fun, both onsite, and at Holiday World right next door.

Text: For what you have to pay for the Holiday Cabin, you would expect the beds to be soft. All these cabins are is a glorified RV w/ a deck. If i wanted to stay in an RV, we would of brought our own. The website is very misleading. The master bedroom had no A/C vent. The shower barely fit my 6'2" fiance'. My mother -in-law watched housekeeping go into the cabin next door, & she only spent 5 minutes in there cleaning & only took a toilet brush in with her. She had no sweeper or broom on her cart. So, what do they clean? Our gas grill looked like someone tried to cook with charcoal on it & charcoal ashes were all over the deck & picnic table. Overall, it was nice to be close to the park & have a shuttle, but if you don't have a golf cart, it's hard to get to the drop off. There's no place to park a car for the shuttle drop off & my mother in law is handicapped, so her walking was out of the question. So, another $60 a day for a golf cart.   We will probably stay in a hotel next time or bring our own RV & try again.
