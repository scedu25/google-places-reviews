Belvidere Motel
Rating: 2
Text: Called to check on price and the lady answers " Hello". No motel name. Asked if it was the motel and she replays "yea". I asked about price of a room with double beds. She replied" I don't have rooms with double bed" and hung up. Would not recommend this rude and unprofessional motel to anyone
