Holiday Inn Express & Suites Jasper
Rating: 3
Text: Hotel was adequate and staff were very friendly and welcoming. My room was clean and well-maintained in the air conditioning unit worked fine. I thought the price of the room was a little bit much considering the hotel with an older style that had been recently remodeled which is why I gave it three stars.

Text: Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable. Arcade, pool, and hot tub make it a great place for families and conveniently located just miles away from Holiday World. Staff was also very welcoming and accommodating.

Text: We stayed last night 9/23 gravy was better than most but the biscuits were hard all the way through. Seriously?? My dog couldn't eat those,  gravy didn't soften at all. How old are those things anyway?

Text: The staff was super nice. The room while clean had a good bit of dust bunnies and some pour painting issues around the window air conditioner. Other than that no complaints
