Text: I did not stay here but I was meeting my ride here and everyone got lost.  This place has the best customer service hands down even for non customers!  The gentleman working here helped my ride get to me by driving to show them the way even!    The workers are amazing here!

Text: It looks as if it were an old apartment building that has been converted. The suites are large with a loft. The room was average with Marriott standards. But, it seemed kind of run down on the grounds. So if your looking for upscale, this may not be the place for you. But, for us it was just fine for us. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Pool was nice outdoor pool. They had a trunk for pool toys.

Text: My suite had everything you could possibly want for an extended stay. The room was kept very clean, and it was very quiet. I used the exercise room, and it was well equipped. I did not use the pool. The included breakfast was awesome!
