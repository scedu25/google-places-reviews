Text: Had to take a test for work there. The lady was attentive and I got some coffee while I waited. Waited in the lobby area. It was very clean, the workers made sure of that. It had a nice breakfast area from what I could tell. Nice little conference room as well. Very close off of I69.

Text: A clean, relatively modern, hotel with amenities in line with it's price.  I got a good nights sleep and had a reasonable breakfast (included in the price).

No complaints, although nothing special.
