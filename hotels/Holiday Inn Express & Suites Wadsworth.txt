Holiday Inn Express & Suites Wadsworth

Text: It's a nice place. The fitness center is the best part. The website is a bit misleading. There is no swimming pool. It's an exercise pool and it is not big enough for multiple people to use like a traditional pool. The room was ok but a bit cramped. We booked a suite and expressed that is was for 5 adults and 1 child. They gave us a larger room with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch stuffed in with a desk tv and kitchen area. The pull out literally was against the fridge so while that person was using the bed you couldn't get drinks or use the microwave. Other holiday inns give a much larger room when you book a suite.

Text: It was a great stay. A little close to the highway so we could hear traffic all night, but it wasn't as bad as other hotels. Comfortable beds, choice of pillows, and the ability to keep the room as cold as I wanted. Nice room, too. Fridge, microwave, and TV. Breakfast was fine, not good or bad.

Text: Room was clean and affordable.   There is a good restaurant right next door.   Most importantly,  I left my watch in the hotel room, a special irreplaceable watch my cousin gave me and the hotel staff mailed it back to me!!!   Very impressive!

Text: Location, location, location! It's a bit pricey, but what would you expect from the Holiday Inn brand. Excellence restaurant Wine Bar / sports bar / outdoor Tiki Bar Next Door that I believe is also owned by the same owners of the Holiday Inn Express and the Comfort Inn on the other side.

Text: Excellent place to shake off the dust from the road, some truck parking but not a lot so call ahead if you're a truck driver.
