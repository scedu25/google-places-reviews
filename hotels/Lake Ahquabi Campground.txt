Lake Ahquabi Campground
Rating: 3
Text: The lake and the trails are really nice. However the camp sites are poorly planned. It's really tight and many sites have no shade at all.

Text: DNR were jerks amd seemed to harass people about the smallest things. Campsites are extremely tight with very little extra parking. Nice trail around the lake. Go for a day visit but I don't recommend staying at the campgrounds!
