Candlewood Suites Springfield South

Text: This is a review from two lovebirds who reconnected after 32 years.  We found  this gem of a hotel as our first getaway.  Our room was filled with great conveniences including a dishwasher, the hospitality was off the charts, the little store near the front desk had all things we needed and the cupboard in the TV room had lot of free things we could use if we got into a pinch   We plan to book this same room each time we get into town and look forward to being in our home away from home.  With great gratitude to the hotel staff, the Lovebirds
