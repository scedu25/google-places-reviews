Text: This is where my girlfriend (now my wife) and I had our starter home back in the day.  Affordable living for those on a lower or fixed income, and so much better than apartments where neighbors might be upstairs or downstairs.  From what little contacts I still have here, things have gone downhill after a change in management.  Might still be a place worth considering, but up to owners and management not to let this place get over run with problems.

Text: I've been living here going on 3 years. It might be a great place to live if skunks & stray cats weren't out of control.If you can't afford central air than you have a problem.  Window units air conditioner allows skunk odor all through your house when they decide to spray, which is quite frequently.  You have to shut down all your air conditioning to  keep it from contaminating your premises terribly. It's awful when it is hot out & shutting down your air to keep from getting real sick from their toxic odor. In the mean time  these nasty critters are multiplying & no is doing anything to stop this invasion!
