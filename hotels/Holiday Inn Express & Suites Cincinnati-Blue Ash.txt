Holiday Inn Express & Suites Cincinnati-Blue Ash
Rating: 1
Text: I calculated it at some point. Spire Elite is their highest classification in the Holiday Inn International Hotel Group chain. I've been at that level for years. I stay in Holiday Inn Expresses and Crowne Plaza's a lot. There are times when I'm in two holiday Inn at the same time somewhere in the country because of my travel schedule. My point is I know Holiday Inn Express inside and out. This particular property doesn't come anywhere near meeting the minimum standard. The room was dirty. The room and hallways were poorly lit and the lack of reception at the front desk was stunning. I would not stay here again.

Text: Everything was great except the breakfast. The breakfast was lacking variety, eggs were dry, and the turkey sausage was very spicy. All of the staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I'll stay here again of I'm ever in the area.

Text: Good hotel... First room (328) smelled really bad of cigarettes. Manager noted it and put is in 321 which was much better. Breakfast was pretty good. Had sausage gravy but no biscuits. Not sure if I missed them or they didn't have them to begin with.

Text: The hotel was ok for an overnight stay, but I wouldn't stay longer. The room was decent and the breakfast good, but the bathroom tub needed help. It looked like it had been patched after some one fell through.
