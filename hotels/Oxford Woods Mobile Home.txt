Text: We currently do not live here but are getting ready too.  First Impression of the park seemed very quite during my mid day mid week visit.  My drive thru the park I saw very little trash and all the homes seemed to be in good condition.  Most of the residents cars was in good shape.  Did not see any broken down or abandoned vehicles.  My second trip to scope out the place was on a weekend!   I saw many people grilling out or mowing their lawn.  I waved at some of them and they waved back.  I saw some younger kids out playing riding their bikes.  I did not see any teenage kids or groups out hanging around.  Noise was to a very minimal mostly kids playing or lawnmowers.    SO THIS TIME I STOPPED INTO THE PARK OFFICE!    Jessica the manager seemed very nice and polite.  She even lives in the community!  So that was a plus! So she would know first hand on what goes on there.  She told me the place is mostly pretty quite.  Every now and then you may here one of the parents arguing or yelling for their kids.  Theft is a very minimal and has been a while since anything had been reported to her.  SHE WAS VERY NICE AND PROFESSIONAL!
