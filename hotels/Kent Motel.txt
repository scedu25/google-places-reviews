Text: Ok we were a little worried to start this place has had a bad rep for years.  This is new owners and their cleaning it up. Owner was very honest and told us that the smoking rooms had not been done, there was some paint peeling in bathroom and the front entrance had cracks nothing serious. The thing is it is on a busy road so it was noisy  it did die down later at night. Room was big beds are very comfortable. The only reason for the lower rating was noise.  Keep at it you guys we will stay again. .

Text: This place is quiet, the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. I have heard horror stories from many people about this place but I have not seen any kind of negative here. The room is comfortable and not expensive

Text: This place is dirty. The floors are sticky to walk on, there are tiles missing in the bathroom wall, and the grout was stained and discolored like it might have mold. The room smelled.
