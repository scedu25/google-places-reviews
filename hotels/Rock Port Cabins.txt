Rock Port Cabins

Text: This place is amazing because if the wonderful people who run it. They will take care of you, no matter what! We had a weird issue where our reservation was cancelled and no one knew why because we did not cancel it. The manager not only found us a new room at a different motel, but payed for it in person to reserve it. This was during the 2017 solar eclipse so rooms were hard to come by. I recommend Rock Port Cabins to anyone needing to stay in the area.

Text: All the other motels in the area were booked for the night but I call that a string of good luck because we called Rock Port Cabins and they graciously left us a key and the whole experience was wonderful! Beautiful clean rooms and a real homey feel. I will definitely stop in Rock Port every time I am driving through. YOU WANT TO STAY HERE!  Great job to the owners.

Text: This is a cozy place very close to downtown. Rooms are small, but clean and cute. They have done quite a bit of remodling. Owners are super sweet and available.

Text: The owners are friendly and accommodating. We had a shower malfunction in the room they assigned us (older plumbing and fixtures throughout property) and they upgraded us immediately to a cabin.
This place is affordable, relatively quiet, convenient location, and features a great outdoor space! Barbeques, huge picnic tables, space for the kids to run around and fire pits with seating. Bring your drinks and relax before turning in for the night.
The beds and pillows are comfortable and the sheets and towels are soft. The mattresses are all in plastic wrapping that is really loud when moving in bed and kept me awake, but at least I didn't have  to worry about bugs or stains. 
A few minor upgrades to the rooms needed (bedside lamps, alarm clock, kitchen hand towels and dish cloths, sugar for coffee, new shower curtains) but overall a great experience.

Not only is the stay amazing, but there is an amazing BBQ put out back that is to die for. The outdoor hangout area is beautiful. They have done an amazing job here. I cannot wait to go back.
