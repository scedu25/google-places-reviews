Motel 6 Emporia
Rating: 1
Text: Check in experience was fine. Rooms are rooms. The rooms are gross. Initially they seem fine if a little cheap, but it's a super cheap motel. 

The shower curtain was spattered with... Mud? The bedsheets have hair in them. It's not mine, which I would normally assume since I shed. But my hair is a very distinct blue and these were not. There were shorter, curlier hairs present as well. 

There was a weird stain thing on the floor? It looked suspect. And some kind of spatter on the wall. 

Pro: no bedbugs as far as I can tell. 

I feel like my bar is low for a place of this price but come on. I'm writing this in the room and I'm fuming because I'm too exhausted after an 11 hour drive to go deal with it right now. I guess it's nice that the room doesn't contain super immediate biohazards so I can clean and just get some damn sleep.

Text: I have stayed at this Motel 6 many times.  Each time they make you feel like a welcome guest.  I locked my keys in my car and they invited me and my dogs to stay in the air conditioned lobby while we waited for AAA.  Even when I arrive late and wake up the owner he welcomes me and never mentions the lateness of the hour or being woken up in the middle of the night.

Text: It was a good deal. It is an older Motel 6 but had a nice flat screen and free wifi that worked fine. No complaints

Text: Good value for the buck. Clean, but a bit tired looking building /signage. Rooms were nice. Friendly reception.
