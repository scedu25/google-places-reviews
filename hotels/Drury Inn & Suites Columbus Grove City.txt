Drury Inn & Suites Columbus Grove City
Rating: 5
Text: I found The Drury Inn Columbus Grove City to be ideally located amongst great shopping and food venues, and very close to Interstate 71. The hotel is clean, contemporary in design and has friendly Staff. At the time of check-in, I was given free drink tickets for the hotel's social gathering area. All-in-all, it was a fine experience!

Text: I have stayed at this hotel before and not had a problem. However I will not stay there again as there is an employee there who is dishonest. I forgot to get some items out of the nightstand when I checked out. I called back later the same day and my possessions could not be found. Two days later and still nothing. As only an employee would have been able to enter the room I have to believe that an employee has taken my possessions.

Text: Beautiful hotel. We had a suite room and it was big and spacious. Room was clean and had a delicious breakfast. Would definitely recommend.

Text: We stayed here with our family in July 2017. I would definitely stay here again. The staff were friendly and very willing to make changes to our room reservation so that we could have an adjoining room with our son and his family. The hot breakfast each day was great as well as what they referred to as the pub fare menu for supper at 5:30 each day..... all of this included in the price. Within walking distance to shopping. When traveling this will now be my choice for overnight stays. To bad they are not in every state

Text: What's not to love about Drury Grove City?  The staff and management are attentive, accommodating and affable.  Drury offers the best hotel breakfast ever. The free pub style dinner is awesome.  The room is comfy & clean.  I am a do it yourselfer and Drury offers extra rewards points when I forego housekeeping.  Most importantly, I see allot of friendly dogs and want to pet each one.  It makes my heart happy Drury allows canine family members to accompany their humans during hotel stays.
