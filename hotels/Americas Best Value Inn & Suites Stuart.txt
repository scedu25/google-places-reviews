Text: The walls are thin and the appliances are noisy. That being said, this place was so clean, comfy and fresh that it deserves 5 stars. And I booked online and only paid 50 bucks. 
The woman at the front desk was super sweet also. She assured me my parked car was safe. She knew because she's been here 22 years and never had a break in. Highly recommend.

Text: RUDE NIGHT MANAGER! UNBELIEVABLE... I ASKED IF A ROOM WAS AVAILABLE AS GOOGLE SHOWS A RATE OF $58. SHE TELLS ME ITS $129 AND THAT IF I  WANT THE ONLINE RATE I HAVE TO CHECK IN AT 3PM... ITS 3AM NOW AND I JUST WANTED TO SLEEP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE GETTING BACK ON THE ROAD...WHY WOULD I COME BACK AT 3PM??? SERIOUSLY!?!?  WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME FROM??? KEEP YOUR EMPTY ROOMS AND YOUR DEAD END JOB!!! SIMPLY HORRIBLE PEOPLE.
