Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Wichita West

Text: The staff is SUPER NICE and willing to do anything to make your stay comfortable. But there is no hot water to shower with, No phone in the room to call the front desk, and the keys DON'T work so you have to keep going to the front desk to rekey. Breakfast is OKAY.....2 stars is being nice. But again the staff is super nice! We loved them!

Text: I was in a room with a king size bed and we needed a roll away bed and they brought it very quickly. The room was on the second floor but located very quickly and they have a decent breakfast in the morning

Text: Wonderful breakfast, the biscuits and gravy were Amazing, the beds were more comfortable than holiday inns and the view in the breakfast room overlooking the golf course was very pleasant. Moderately priced and staff was friendly...will be back to stay on our next visit to Wichita soon!!

Text: This place is wearing down. Bed was comfortable, but room was not clean, shower had stains and door was broken, difficult to find the hot water setting on the single shower knob. Carpet stains and open seams in hallways.
