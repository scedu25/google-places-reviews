Text: Hayden was our front desk attendant. He was super friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and user friendly. The fold out couch left something to be desired. Still a wonderful experience.

Text: The hotel was very clean and accommodating. We went on a college tour with two junior high school girls and needed to have a sweet so that we could separate ourselves. The girls slept on the pullout couch and my husband and I slept in the bedroom; it was perfect.

Text: We usually stay at residence inn when traveling and find them to be a great value. This location is unfortunately right on the highway, and we got road noise all night long, including Jake brakes. Not very restful.

Text: Staff was fantastic, area was near multiple restaurants although the only one in walking distance is Hooters. The nightly dinners are adequate and typical of a residence inn (as well as breakfast). I would definitely stay here again.

Text: I'm a Marriott guy and really like staying at The Residence Inn. It means all of the amenities that you need for a long term stay. I've stayed an awful at this particular one. It's very well run and they aim to please. Whenever there have been issues, they were always quick to fix it and always had a great customer focused attitude.
