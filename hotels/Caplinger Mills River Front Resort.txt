Text: Staff was very friendly, but I don't think the business is set up very well. It's a cash-only business that doesn't have an ATM. We had to drive 10 minutes to the closest town to withdrawal money before our float. It does not say anything about this on the website either. The equipment that we used was subpar, even for a small rural Outfitter. Half of us got kids paddles, and a kayak didn't even have a seat in it. I picked this place because it's the closest to Kansas City, but I don't think that we'll be back.
