Holiday Inn Express & Suites Lincoln Airport

Text: My family stayed here for the 'Great American Eclipse' in 2017. The hotel rooms were pretty nice! Clean and comfortable, so no complaints there! I took a star off because even though they show pictures of a hot tub, they filled it in so now they only have a pool. :( Also their exercise bike was broken and I feel that their breakfast ends too early. 9:30?!? Why!?!

Text: This was a wonderful hotel. The room was huge with nice comfortable beds.  I worried about airport noise but did not hear a thing. Great breakfast and the staff was so friendly and nice. It is also pet friendly.

Text: I used to dislike handicap accessible rooms, whenever I ended up in one by mistake.  But, now that we need them, I have become quite an educated consumer, and I can tell you that this hotel had a very nice one.  It is the first time I have seen a full size plastic shower chair in place of a pull-down shelf seat.  And there were two drains, with some serious slope to them.  We do travel with our own shower seat, because it makes showering more convenient, and this is another aid.  Thank you, HIE at Lincoln Airport!

Text: Had a wonderful stay. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable room, great breakfast. Some airplane noise, but not a big deal and only heard during the daytime hours. This is a favorite place for us and our family to stay on our trips to see each other. Would highly recommend.
