Grey Goose Inn

Text: This was the first time at a bed & breakfast. Not sure what to expect, my stay was great. The host was very helpful, finding bait & good clean restaurants. You can not beat the price of these rooms along with the breakfast. Not to mention the night snack of hot homemade cookies!! The rooms are very clean and comfortable. There is also electric for charging you boat. I will defiantly stay here again for sure. This place was great!

Text: Made a day trip down to Lake Rathbun, forgot to pack our tent and needed to find a place to stay.  We found Grey Goose Inn on Google and it surely didn't disappoint.  We called, got their last room for the night.  Check In was an easy process,  Jim was at the desk when we arrived.  You can enter your room through the common areas of the Inn, or each room has its own door to the outside.  The rooms were cozy, TV, your own AC unit and our bathroom had a shower  

The price was an excellent value for getting breakfast in the morning too, thanks Diane, she made an amazing meal that morning!  I have nothing but good things to say about Grey Goose Inn for the price and the comfort of it.  Overall it was great stay, it's nice having your door to come and go as you please and when you're at the lake, why spend all your time in the room, get out explore and enjoy the beautiful area.
