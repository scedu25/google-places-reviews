Text: We stayed one night in a 40ft fifth wheel on October 12, 2017. We were on our way to Arizona and needed a place for one night. We found it on passport America. This is a very clean and well kept campground. The washrooms were very well stocked and very clean. Sherry is the owner and you couldn't ask for better service from her. I don't know about activities or pools since we only stayed one night. Enjoyed our stay and plan on returning on our way home. Thank you for a lovely stay Sherry.

Text: Great RV Park. Close to town, golf course, fishing and swimming. Sherry was a superb host - assisted with parking our 40' motorhome. We would definitely stay here again!

Text: Cheryl met us when we arrived and was fantastic in helping us back into our space. Lots are level and power/sewer/water were all great. Quiet park behind a private home with a good woman running it. Military discount which was nice.

Text: The best campground in the Ozarks! This is a very friendly, family oriented place. The owner knows her campers by name and we always feel welcome here.

Text: Great stay! More shade than the big RV campground across the street. Nice little camp with full hookups at a reasonable price. The shower/rest rooms are showing their age but clean and well kept. Good tasting well water. Super owner Sherry was great helping us set up. She does pass on the  minor extra charge for credit card payment. No laundry. We will stay again!
