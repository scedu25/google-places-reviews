Baymont Inn & Suites Indianapolis South
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms are big, neat and clean. Front desk staff was very customer supportive. I enjoyed free fresh and hot breakfast every morning. For lunch and dinner, I had many options nearby within 5 minutes of drive. They have conference rooms available for business events to accommodate around 80 people. Overall, I was very satisfied with my decision to stay and would highly recommend this place.

Text: It's an older hotel but has had some renovations.  The staff were very pleasant.  Breakfast is ok, not a huge selection but it's free and got the job done.  No complaints.  We would definitely stay here again.

Text: The hotel is situated in a convenient location right off the highway. The beds are comfortable, but the room is showing its age. Staff are all friendly. Breakfast is available, mostly cold food+waffles and biscuits. Overall was an OK experience, not much to complain about but not much to rave about either.
