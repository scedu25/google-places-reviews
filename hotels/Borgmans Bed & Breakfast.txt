Borgmans Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 4
Text: Quaint and comfortable B&B in historical Arrow Rock. The owner, Kathy, is part of the Arrow Rock Historical Society and will be able to tell you neat stories of the town while eating her amazing home made cinnamon rolls. She even made them dairy free for our visit as I'm lactose intolerant. The house is walk-able to all the attractions but set off from the main road to keep it cozy and truly a great get away.
