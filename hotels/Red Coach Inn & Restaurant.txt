Text: There were lots of boxelder bugs in my room.  20 -30. I get that they come out more in the evening so I don't really blame housekeeping and I wish I could remember the front desk ladies name because she took care of as many as she could by hand.  It was disappointing that other people just sort of told me yeah there really bad but they usually stay by the window.  I get that and I don't complain much but with 20-30 bugs in my room weather they stay close to the window or not its still annoying.  Plus i just wanted a vacuum to take care of them myself. I'm not writing this to complain its more just to inform you that the bugs were really bad and I assume others may be less content about it.

Text: The first time I went, I thought the food was pretty good so I went again to see if that wasn't a fluke. Again, I was very pleased, so I highly recommend this restaurant!
