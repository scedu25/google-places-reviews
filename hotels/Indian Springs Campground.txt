Indian Springs Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Highly recommend. The place is very clean and well taken care of. The staff is friendly and very helpful. One of the best places I've stayed. An exceptional bonus that I didn't expect was their laundry facilities were equipped with commercial washers and dryers that are clean like the rest of the facility. The bath house was immaculate! Very reasonable for full hook-up site!

Text: Beautiful place. Big pond with canoes and paddle boats. And ducks...they are so pretty to watch; they love to be fed pieces of bread. Linda, who works in the office is so much fun to talk to! The price is a little steep, $500 for 2 weeks, but it is a new campground and we loved it there! Gravel sites with full hook-ups.
