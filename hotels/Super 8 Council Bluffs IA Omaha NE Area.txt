Text: The room was clean and sheets were fresh. Nothing extra or fancy. You definitely get more for the same price at other 'cheaper' hotels. Service was good, and breakfast was decent to good. Staff was very helpful. Stayed only one night.

Text: Gross! GROSS! Gross. First it smells as though someone died here and they have tried to clean with peroxide. The room was stained, moldy and mildewy. Swear bugs bit us all night. Shower was broken. Left in am with little sleep, dirty and bug bitten. Cannot believe Wyndham or super 8 endorse this place.

Text: Breakfast was good, attentive staff. The bed was a little hard as were the pillows. Washcloth was stained with makeup and there were some small holes and black spots on the shower curtain. Everything else great. Hallway decor is a little creepy also :)
