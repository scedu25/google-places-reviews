Text: This is a great place to stay! The staff is friendly - one even hums as she works! It's close to a highway. Breakfast and manager's reception are awesome.

Text: My mother has been here for 2 weeks doing radiation therapy and the Staff has treated her like Gold and from what I can tell it came from their Heart. That means a lot to me since I have not been able to be here the whole time. They have also been very accommodating to me as well. Thank you very much. Tom Lamb

Text: Clean, quiet hotel. Every member of the staff that we worked with was friendly and welcoming. Breakfast had lots of options and the person working made sure that everything was consistently full.

Text: Rude staff... Wouldn't stay here. I love Holiday Inn Express (95% of them across the USA) & tried to stay here a couple of times... They tried to price gouge, over a two-week stay and four rooms. Sadly for them... They lost our business to the Hampton next door. Who trumps them in customer service!!
