Text: Owners are very nice, Excellent WiFi, cable included in the very reasonable price, they loaned me the remote and explained out to set it up. They have a nice place to drink a beverage have some food. Water pressure and electric, great. Close to some GREAT attractions, spent 7 days here and enjoyed it.

Text: Easiest place to get propane in North Platte by far. Great place to refill! The park is nice, very spread out so there are a variety of spots available to choose from. The WiFi is great for streaming anything and there is cable TV available at every campsite.
