Cliff Manor Inn

Text: This was a fun experience.  Beautiful bed and breakfast in a old house.   Be sure to ask about the bathroom set up when you book, not all rooms have a private bath.  Great breakfast and we were surprised with on the trail warm bread just before leaving.

Text: Love this place. The innkeeper was super helpful and the chef in the morning was awesome. The breakfast was several courses and the attention to detail was great.

Text: I'm puzzled as to the "two-star hotel" rating on here.  The room I'm staying in is FAR nicer than any of the other hotels I've stayed at locally and they are all "three stars" or more.  

About the Manor: 
* The rooms are beautiful - clean and spacious and comfortable
* The Manor is also beautiful, inside and out
* The owners are incredibly invested in their guests having a great experience and have gone out of their way to make every one of my stays pleasant and convenient.  

I haven't tried the breakfast (not a breakfast eater) but I've not heard any complaints from other guests.  

The overall experience is one of lived-in comfort and elegance.  Instead of staying in a bland, cookie-cutter hotel room, I get the opportunity to relax in a stately, well-cared for historic mansion (something I'll never be able to afford to purchase).   There is a beautiful porch on both the first and second floors, where one an sit and enjoy the sunset or the view of the capitol or, in cold-weather, you can relax in front of a fire in the parlor. 

I'm so glad I found Cliff Manor Inn and I look forward to staying there every time i visit the area!
