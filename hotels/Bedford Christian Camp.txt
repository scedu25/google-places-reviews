Text: I attended this church camp as a kid in 1970, 71 & 72. My Uncle Don Tharp was the Pastor in Bedford at the time and it was the best of times! I loved the thick woods setting, isolation from the city, with the steep hill next to the river. It was beautiful then and from what I can see on Google maps it doesn't look like it has changed a lot other than major upgrades in buildings. I would love to revisit it someday.

Text: My daughter loves the friendliness of the staff and the "outdoorsiness" of the camp. She has went to this camp with our church for four years now. It is able to supply a nice pool, great, clean eating area, and yet have a true outdoor experience. She also loves the cats that frequent the area.
