Rockcliffe Mansion

Text: I feel like I will never be satisfied staying at another bed and breakfast after staying here. The house was gorgeous! It felt like an honor being able to stay here. The owners were inviting, accommodating,  and were lovely to be around. I stayed here six months ago and still cannot get over how much I loved the experience.

Text: This place is spectacular. My wife and I have stayed in a number of B&Bs over the years, but never anything quite like this. Built around 1900, virtually everything inside is original to the home - from Tiffany chandeliers and windows to furniture, rugs, books - even original hybrid electric/gas fixtures and original plumbing that works. Ever taken a shower with plumbing from 1900?  It’s like being in a time machine.  The tour was fascinating.  This was a unique experience.

Text: Debbie gave us a tour of the mansion. (Well, we bought a tour from Debbie.) It was definitely one of the best home tours we have done. The mansion has a remarkable history and unique, incredible features. Debbie was knowledgeable and informative. We did not stay at the mansion' s bed & breakfast, but wish we had.

Text: Very lovely! They did a great job restoring this mansion. Our tour guide Debbie was very knowledgeable and friendly! I hope someday we can afford to go back and stay at the b&b.
