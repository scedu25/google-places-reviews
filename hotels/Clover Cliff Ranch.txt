The setting is idyllic, the rooms are comfortable and Susie and Warren are amazing hosts. Our breakfasts could not be better. The food is absolutely fantastic! We look forward to many more years at the Clover Cliff!

Text: Clover Cliff Ranch is owned and operated by some of the nicest people that I have met. They also have a very challenging but beautiful disc golf course! Would highly recommend.
