Text: My husband and I have camped at this park for about 15 years. The Stagnaro's are always very helpful and there is always a chance of seeing wildlife meander through. We're excited this year because it's in the direct path of the coming eclipse! We also love that we can boat & fish about 5 min. drive. We'll be back!

Text: Have been coming here over 10 years. Friendly owners, very quiet and peaceful.  They keep it well maintained. Always see deer or turkeys and tons of songbirds. Will keep coming!

Text: Peaceful and quiet setting. Owners are friendly and helpful, and they have an adorable border collie Katie.Small town so not many amenities, but be sure to go into Sutherland to the old-time malt shop.
