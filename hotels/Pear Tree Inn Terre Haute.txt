Pear Tree Inn Terre Haute

Text: We thought the hotel was a nice place to stay and the price was decent, but the staff went above and beyond. They were friendly upon check-in and during our stay, but a few days later I realized I had left an item there..I called and they were going to have someone get back with me... I figured that was the end of it..but today they called and are sending my item. That is above and beyond in my book! Thank you all!

Text: Incredible stay!  Rooms are comfy and clean, friendly and helpful staff.  There's several hotels in close proximity that I looked at first, this is certainly one of the best options here!

Text: Very nice staff. Room was a  great value.  Coffee was not so hot with breakfast if that's important to you.

Text: The pear tree was a terrific value. It is by no means the nicest hotel in Terre Haute but it is a convenient location from the highway, affordable, and provided great service. The rooms were up to date with all amenities expected.
