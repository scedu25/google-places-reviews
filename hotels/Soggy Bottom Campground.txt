Soggy Bottom Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We love Soggy Bottoms and the owners are amazing. Very friendly and accommodating. We frequent this campground around 3 times a month, always stay in the same camp site and love every minute of it. One of the very few places in North Missouri that is avaialable for ATV'S & UTV'S to open trail ride. Have one large cabin rental available, csmp sites have electric and water or you can go primitive, RV'S welcome too. Hot showers and a cleaning station for your toys! Trails are maintained, park is super clean, prices are more than reasonable and the experience is priceless.

Text: I cannot recommend this place enough. The owners are the nicest people you will meet. The atv trails range In difficulty level with a lot of distance to travel. Well worth the drive.
