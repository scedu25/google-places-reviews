Augustus Chetlain Home and Log Cabin Guest Houses

Text: Very cozy cabin with nice features like a wood-burning fireplace. Fridge and microwave in the cabin were very useful. Shower is on the small side, though the bigger cabins might be different. A little drafty against the winter chill, but hey, it's a legit log cabin. I'd happily stay here again.
