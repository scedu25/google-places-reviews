Log Cabin Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We went to Log Cabin Inn for the second time a couple of weeks ago for my birthday and had a wonderful time. The rooms were clean and cool when we arrived and the only thing we had to do was unload and head to the river. The staff was kind and helpful when it came to anything we may have need for the weekend. The float trip and the staff that helped with that was fun and knowledgeable. We had a great time in a great clean and comfortable place to spend the night and one of the best things available was the grill for each cabin and the fire pits across the road where we enjoyed a Blue Moon and a roaring fire!!

Text: Wouldnt recommend this place at all and would never stay in these cabins again..they claim to have a private beach access we get there and the beach access we had to walk across a main highway bridge to get to. We went all weekend without showering bc the water smelt awful that came out of the faucet. Litterally used bottled water to even brush my teeth and wash my face.. we stayed two nights they left one roll of toliet paper and one small hotel sized trash bag for us...if I was wanting to rough it I wouldn't of paid cabin prices! There bon fire pit it community for all the cabins to share and they only have 2 grills w picnic tables which is also first cone first serve. All around i was very disappointed with this stay..DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! the way this place is set up and ran save ur money pay for tent camping or take ur money and stay somewhere that Actually has the cabin amenities.
