Comfort Inn Boonville - Columbia
Rating: 5
Text: Staff was friendly, seemed genuinely concerned for our well-being and even went out of their way to accommodate us.  Room was clean, roomy and up-to-date. Beds were extremely comfortable. Great place for a fairly decent price.
After two days of nonstop traveling and two nights of staying in seedy motels, that were hardly cheaper, this Comfort Inn went above and beyond. Bravo.

Text: Good breakfast. Bed sagged in the middle: wife and I woke up with sore backs. Toilet would not flush. Clean and neat. Courteous staff. Price was 2.3 times normal rate due to total eclipse. Easy access from highway, but minimal road noise, but could hear creaks with every step taken by those in the room above. Wife and daughter enjoyed pool.
