Text: The Carlisle inn, located in Carlisle indiana was fair at most. To start off, the town is run down and the peple that live there are meth addicted, opioid dependent scum of the earth. The "Inn" is just as bad. I went their with an escort that I got online and even she was disappointed. The room was nasty even I wouldn't partisipate in coitus on that bed, and was forced by my lady to go to my car. In conclusion that "inn" wasn't quite 2 star but it is still a building in which some one out there in grand delusion could stay in.
