Days Inn Jasper
Rating: 5
Text: Looks were deceiving from the outside as it looked a bit dated, but it was a nice hotel. The staff was nice. Check in was quick. It was very clean and comfortable. The outdoor pool was nice. They also were helpful in getting us adjoining rooms with just a call the night before. Very pleased.

Text: Hotel and room were very clean. Pretty wooden handrail for the staircase. Free breakfast. Convenient location. Nice employees. Our only negative was that the mattresses weren't very comfortable. Otherwise, it was a good visit.

Text: Stayed here for one night on my way down to Kentucky for the solar eclipse.  Room was exceptionally clean, included microwave/mini-fridge/small safe/hair dryer.  Breakfast was more extensive than I expected.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

Text: We stayed at the Days Inn Jasper for a night after going to Holiday World. The room was great! Clean and TV ready. There was a fridge and coffee maker in the room. We had dominoes delivered to the room. This was a great stay!
