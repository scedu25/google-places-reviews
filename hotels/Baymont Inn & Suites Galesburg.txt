Text: The hotel is very nice. It is clean with no damage that the eye can see. One thing is the breakfast is very small and could use more options. I would definitely go back to this hotel. Also they charge you 10% hold charge for using a credit card even though I used my rewards points. The reward program should not have to deal with that charge.
