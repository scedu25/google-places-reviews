Text: The royal treatment is what I received.  I was the only guest at the Inn the evening of my stay in the fall of 2016.  I was invited on a tour of the Inn and grounds before being shown my comfortable room with its oh, so very comfortable bed.  Everything about my stay reflected the Quiggs care and hospitality.  They must have a knack about making everyone feel at home. My review would be incomplete without raving about the incredible breakfast they served me.  I highly recommend you consider a stay at Scott Station Inn when you visit the Bluegrass.
