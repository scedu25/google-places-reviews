Red Bluff Campground

Text: We got campsite 28. The site was clean,bathroom was clean. The ground keeper Bud was very nice. But the creek and damage done by the last flood made it almost in possible to enjoy the park. It would help to update the pictures of the park so people know what to expect.Overall this will be the last time I go there.

Text: Nice place for adults and older kids. I wouldn't bring tots here. You must have a cot or good air mat to sleep decent here. I have camped here numerous times and never had any issues.

Text: Arrived at 10pm to find someone in our site. Campground was full so we drove back home. Spent 5 hours on the road that night with nothing to show for it. Turns out they let the previous occupants stay over. Checkout time is 2pm, we arrived at 10pm. They should have been long gone. Total waste of a weekend and vacation day. Horrid place.
