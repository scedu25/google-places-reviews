Red Roof Inn Columbia, MO
Rating: 2
Text: Room was great, in and of itself, clean and comfortable and cheap. Low rating because staff turned heat to full blast instead of off so it took an hour of having the door open to chill it enough to sleep. Lots of nighttime activity and the cops drove through, also a sign at the night desk in plain sight instructing the clerks on how to handle the media if there was a police incident on sight. Disquieting.

Text: My daughter went with her best friend and her best friends dad to Columbia, MO. They stayed at the Red Roof Inn, she returned home yesterday with her body full of bedbug bites. They were in room122. I would not recommend anybody staying there. When management was notified and asked to refund money, they said something about having to wait for Pest control to confirm. I was appalled, the proof was all over my daughter's body. REALLY?????
