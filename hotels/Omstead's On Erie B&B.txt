Text: Couldn't have been better!  Margo & Keith are the perfect hosts.  The cottage is lovingly restored and furnished with beautiful and interesting furnishings.  We enjoyed hearing the stories of some of the pieces, which made it all the more personal.  Weather denied us the opportunity to sit out by the lake in the evening, but we were well entertained with wine and good conversation. The bed and bath were comfortable and inviting, and the breakfast was outstanding: the best of our entire trip!  Would highly recommend!
