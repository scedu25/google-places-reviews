Text: Specifically asked if hot tub working & told yes (have been there in past when it was down & saw another review reporting it broken).  It was not in usable condition.  They were using a hose to fill it with hot water, thus no temp control, and so scalding water that you could even put your feet in.  They need to fix it properly & permanently or at least not misguide guests.  Otherwise nice stay but we would've stayed elsewhere had we known as we were specifically wanting the use of a hot tub.

Text: Building is clean and staff seems pretty nice. Both rooms we stayed in had a musty smell that didn't go away. The beds we're closer to gym floor mats in level of comfort than actual beds.
