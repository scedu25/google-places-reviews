Best Western Plus La Porte Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 4
Text: Location is convenient and easy to find. Rooms are clean and large enough to comfortably accommodate my family of 2 adults and 6 children. The decor has been recently updated and the earth tone color scheme flows throughout the entire hotel. The indoor pool side rooms include their own individual patio space complete with patio furniture. The open floor plan complete is complete with sky lights and game room, providing a fun family atmosphere. I recommend the pool side rooms if available but I have also stayed in other rooms, while the walk to the pool is obviously further away the rooms are just as clean and comfortable and the fun family atmosphere spills down every hallway.

Text: Price was more than fair for amenities. Pool area is great. Arcade is cute, fitness center was sufficient. The breakfast routine is pretty cool, even though the cook is average at best. The food sits and gets cold, but it's much better hot. Go at 6:30. Dinner is not reflective of breakfast at all. Staff is drab. They think a lot of themselves. Not management though, they are very nice. It's a great value, all in all!

Text: This was a very interesting hotel with a wonderful staff.  My stay was handled very well.  Dinner was good and the common area was very open for gathering.  The fitness room was wonderful, free weights at a hotel isn't real common...  Nicely done...

Text: When we first arrived, the clerk tried to bill us at a 94% tax rate. The room itself had a window into the hallway, and the curtains did not block out the light outside our door. The "king" bed was two twin beds pushed together, which was unexpected, but it was still a comfortable place to sleep. One elevator did not have working lights on the buttons/arrows. When we went to pay in the morning, the day clerk billed us at the appropriate amount. I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again, but I wouldn't actively avoid it either.
