SpringHill Suites by Marriott Louisville Downtown

Text: Overall the hotel is quite nice. However, there are some things that I wish could be improved upon. In my room the shower stall glass was not secured at the bottom like it should and it's sliding door looks like it's been pushed away at the bottom. Ice machines are only located on floors 4, 5, and 6 in the Fairfield section of the building. It's not readily communicated on all floors causing a scavenger hunt of sorts. And machines on 4 and 5 were not working causing the hunt to go longer. Besides that everything else was fine. Air conditioner worked beautifully, decor was pleasant to view, very clean. I like the modern look although some more light options may be nice in the rooms. A few flaws but worth a return stay.

Text: This is the best hotel I have stayed at for a long time.  Amazing!!!  Parking is an easy in--and-out (which is really helpful at this location). My number one reason is that my room was very clean ("NO bugs" is very important to me!!!)  Breakfast was very good too!  Very early check in made my trip much more convenient.

Text: Love the rooms, they are not!  Everything about the hotel is good. Friendly staff, friendly housekeeping. I enjoy that the rooms are always cleaned. I stay there with my family when we go to the North American International Livestock Exposition, and everyday, I come back to a clean room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Also, excellent prices and services. 

Great job Springhill Suites!  Keep it up!  Will always stay here.

Text: The room was nice and the staff was friendly. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice, but the showerhead did have pretty low water pressure. Everything else was great.

Text: Overall this was a very nice place for my husband, our 2 daughters (10 & 12) and I.  They  all said 4 stars.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms and common areas were all clean and tidy.  The beds and bedding were very comfy!  The kids felt the pool was a little small.  The adults liked being able to sit outside in the fresh air where we could keep watch through the window of our kids swimming.  We were at this hotel (2 nights) with another family and we all said we'd stay there again. The comolimentary breakfast was good - on Sunday it was extremely busy and some food, drinks, cups, bowls ran out but were always replenished.  Slow toasters!  Not surprising - the elevators were packed and hard to get on Sunday between 10-11am, but we weren't in a hurry anyway.  The mini-fridge barely kept our beverages cold, so don't expect a super-cooling fridge. Nice place!
