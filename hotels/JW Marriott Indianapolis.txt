Text: The hotel is nice. The staff are great. I was here for a conference and there were many mix ups with rooms with 2 beds. Several people booked those rooms and when they arrived were given a king bed and a cot. There also seems to be a lot of emergencies early in the morning on this part of town. Even on the 23rd floor the sirens are heard.

Text: Close to the convention center, River Walk, Lucas oil stadium, the base ball field and downtown. rooms we're comfortable, complimentary water bottles in room. Nice Fitness Center, indoor swimming pool. I loved how they go free apples in the fitness center. Service was great when we needed things they were prompt to bring up to our room.

Text: You can't go wrong with the JW Marriott brand.

This is a spectacular hotel for the price.  West side views of the Indy Zoo or east side for downtown...both are excellent.

Modern lobby, layout and decor.  Well appointed concierge lounge.

Highly recommend.

Text: Attended a luncheon here with my professional organization prior to a football game. Food was good. Everyone that attended was dismissed one table at a time during a presentation to get food, yet by the time my table was called, they ran out of the chicken. I was able to get more later but was surprised that I had to wait. Waitstaff was nice, building clean. Great location, convenient ability to remain inside the buildings and use skywalks to the convention center and then right into Lucas Oil.
