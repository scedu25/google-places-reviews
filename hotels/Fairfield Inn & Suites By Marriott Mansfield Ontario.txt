Fairfield Inn & Suites By Marriott Mansfield Ontario

Text: This is an average hotel that offers a small pool w/ hot tub - the pool is salt water filled.  The hotel has an acceptable breakfast spread, but not as extensive as others in the same chain.  Location is fine, within walking distance of a few restaurants.  Fine for a day or two stay.

Text: Breakfast always ends early. Housekeepers are rude. Parking lot always has double parked cars (usually housekeepers). Doors that our supposed to be locked are left propped open. One of our hotel room doors was even left propped open despite a "do not disturb" on the door. All around shady feeling from the place. Would not recommend.
