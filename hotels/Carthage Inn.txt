Carthage Inn
Rating: 5
Text: While it is a little dated, there have been numerous upgrades. Upon entering the room it had a fresh smell, and was very clean with clean linens, good pillows and comfortable mattresses. The owner was extremely friendly. It was well worth the money!

Text: We visit family in Carthage every year and we bring our 90lbs Black lab/Rottweiler mix dog.  The staff is accommodating to our needs and the stay is cost effective.  The location is great too because it is central to the South side of town near family, the High school, shops and also not too far from the town square should we decide to go that direction.

Text: I gave 5 stars because based on my expectations this little hotel was perfect.  Charming exterior and dated interior, this hotel was super clean and super friendly.  The beds were extremely comfortable and that is saying a ton since I have back pain which is aggravated by a bad mattress.   The price was on point.  The bathroom was clean and the WATER PRESSURE was perfect!  I would stay here over many higher priced places I have tried.  Thanks for having a vacancy!
