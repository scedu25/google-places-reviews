Days Inn Ogallala
Rating: 4
Text: This was a business trip. Stayed there overnight. Check-in was a breeze. Rooms were clean and comfy and right off the interstate. 
Will definitely be staying here when I come through this area again. Great job to the staff of this Day's Inn

Text: Hotel is very good. It is near to interstate and has multiple gas stations. Room is clean and comfortable. The 3 star rating is for the breakfast which is very regular. I would have given 4 or 5 if they had provided good breakfast and shampoo. But room stay and location is very good.

Text: I paid for two nights through expedia.  I claimed my dog at check in with Mike the manager and he took my card for the extra ten per night.  Day two a lady called me yelling that I didn't claim the dog.  I told her yes I did.  She preceded to yell at me that I didn't.  I came to the lobby and talked to Mike.  He shrugged and said maybe she didn't know.  I said well just credit me and I'll be on my way then.  He said he didn't care and said I had thirty minutes to leave the premises.  He then came out the side door and approached me like he wanted to fight lol.  Expedia took care of the problem.  Not sure Mike should be running anything.  Maybe people shouldn't be calling when they obviously have no clue what is going on.

Text: Got in at 10:30 pm. Turned air conditioner on high.  It is a very small air conditioner. Not like the nice big one in the lobby.  It never cooled the room at all. Talked to front desk and she said there was nothing she could do. Manager in at noon.  I believe she is the owner.  
If this is the new way Days Inn operates, after 30 years as a loyal customer, we will no longer stay with them.

Text: I always enjoy staying at this hotel. Management is very nice and as accommodating as possible. Prices are reasonable and there is a nice bench to view the river (bring bug spray)
