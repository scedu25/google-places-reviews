Text: While the suite had nice large main rooms the, the bathroom tub/shower was a little small (not big enough for two). The floor had several uneven areas which might create a tripping hazard. Neither TV remote had batteries (didn't check at front desk for any). The TV's had rather small screens for the size of the rooms, additionally the bedroom TV was at an odd angle to the bed and when turned on manually you couldn't change the channels. There was a burned out light in the bedroom. Several of the appliances were unplugged. You had to go all the way to the front door to turn the sitting area lights on and then wait another ten minutes for the lights to reach full intensity.

Text: There was hair in the shower. Also when we pulled into the parking lot a dude was just laying in the parking lot. Looking up at the sky. Just chillin'. (He was alive) There's a sketchy store across the road, uh, I don't want to say what it was.. We didn't have a refrigerator or microwave. We met only one worker and she was nice. Uh yea. That is all.

Text: I was very upset with my stay. The only good thing about my stay was the night staff lady who checked us in. She was very friendly. Unfortunately it went down hill from there. There were dried buggers in the shower, a molded filter in the coffee pot, my comforter was dirty, and blood splatter on my wall. When we went down to breakfast my children had to drink coffee because both the juices were out and the milk had been out too long and was spoiling. The lady at the counter was too busy on her phone and handed us a business card to call the manager on Monday. When we did he was very rude and disrespectful. He said there was nothing he could do and hung up on us. I Will NEVER stay here again.

Text: If I could do a 0 I would. Smelled like weed the entire stay, rooms were trashy, could hear everything literally from hallways and people in rooms, staff sucked, opened my door at 8 in the morning for "room service" I yelled no thank you and he still came in and slammed the door when he walked out. I know he could hear me yelling no and he came in anyway. Breakfast was small and none of it was even decent. Milk was warm. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. And I won't ever stay here again.
