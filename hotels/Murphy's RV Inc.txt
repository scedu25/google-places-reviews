Text: We stayed here in August of 2016 for only 1 night as we were passing through. It was one of the cleanest RV resorts we've ever stayed at & we've stayed at a lot. It's enough off the beaten path that you don't hear the Interstate,  but still close for easy access. Surrounding area is very nice looking & the campground has a nice calm relaxing feel. Very easy to understand the layout of the grounds. We would stay here again.
