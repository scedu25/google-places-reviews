Showers Inn Bed & Breakfast

Text: This place is great. I originally booked the wrong room type but they worked with me to get me in to the right room for the rest of my stay. I stayed in both the main house and the composer house and I definitely like the modern vibe of the composer over the quaintness of the main house. Breakfast was delicious and every one is crazy friendly. Definitely a great spot.

Text: Wow, this place is a slam dunk winner. Great price, great location to campus and the square, great room, and great breakfast. Our room had a fireplace that worked on a timer, a kitchenette area, a shower tub with jets, and an awesome bed. There is a private parking area and a courtyard. The breakfast was delicious, with a spinach and swiss strata as the feature. Everything was clean and functional. We stayed in the "Lazy River" room. We'd definitely stay here again.

Text: So comfortable and welcoming. Linda waited up for our late arrival (11 pm) and greeted us with a smile. The room was large, updated and very comfortable. We walked through a lovely courtyard to the main house for breakfast in the morning. The meal was outstanding! Truly gourmet fare. Loved the vegetable frittata and cherry scones. They picked the cherries right from their own cherry tree! So much better than the standard fare from chain hotels. Well worth the price!!

Text: Wonderful bed and breakfast. The bedroom was beautiful with plenty of natural light. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was delicious. They made great use of the cherries from the cherry tree outside. Will definitely come back and stay again.
