Super 8 Jerseyville
Rating: 3
Text: The Super 8 was located in a relatively remote location. The best feature of my stay was the low cost for one night. For being an overnight pit stop, it served its purpose! The room was okay for the cost. The beds were fine, nothing special. The service was minimal due to the late hours upon arrival, which is understandable. The free breakfast service in the morning was a wonderful perk! Thank you!

Text: Not a bad price for the time I stayed. Was here passing through for work. Room was a little small but clean. Carpet looked a little dated but not bad. Bathroom was tiny but I don't spend much time in there so it's not a big deal. There's not much nearby walking distance unless you walk through the cornfield to Wal-Mart. From there, you can go to some other fast food places nearby.

Text: We've stayed here at least 4 or 5 times over the past 18 years. It is showing it's age a little. It is a clean facility. Adequate breakfast.
