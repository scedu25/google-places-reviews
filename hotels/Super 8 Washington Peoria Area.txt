Super 8 Washington/Peoria Area

Text: Although the entrance and surroundings are not attractive, the room was well-maintained with large beautiful photos above each bed. Having a fridge and microwave was great for a several night stay. The breakfast would be much better with some scrambled eggs and meat. A good value for the budget traveler.

Text: Poorly maintained, poorly lit, and the entire hotel smells vaguely of tobacco. The breakfast selection was pretty sparse. Overall pretty sketchy--didn't even ask to see my ID when I checked in. The price is pretty low, but I'd still say you're getting slightly less than what you're paying for.

Text: You get what you pay for.  The blanket was dirty with something dried to it. When I told the front desk and said it comes off easily so it obviously wasn't washed. He handed me one out of the supply closet and told me to put the dirty one on the floor and housekeeping would get it in the morning. Why do I need to change the bedding? Aren't I paying for a clean MADE bed? He wasn't embarrassed at all and didn't apologize either.

Text: Room not cleaned. Someone's hair grease left all over mirror and fawcett. Someone else's towel on back of the door. Raw wires exposed from a bent cord on a power strip...mold on the ceiling in bathroom.. picture on TV wasn't full, it was a small box in the middle of the screen... In a word...filth...second room, had to go buy Lysol just feel semi safe. View is of construction pipes...heat very loud and stinky like burnt dust...table cloth like bedspreads would just slide of the bed so you had no blanket...will not recommend or return.

Text: Quite run down interiors, curtains falling off the rods and broken rods. The continental breakfast left much to be desired. Staff was pleasant.
