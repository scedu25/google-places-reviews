Super 8 St. Clair MO
Rating: 5
Text: Much better than I expected. The service here was great. The desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and well furnished. Located just off of the highway, it was very convenient. Breakfast was also provided. I would not hesitate to book a stay here again. Cell service here was way below par for LTE, but good enough to make a call.

Text: It's a nice, modern motel with wifi and breakfast. The room did have an initial mildew smell, but it was very modern, clean and comfortable. While there, we ordered a pizza and it only took ten minutes for it to arrive. The hotel has a comfortable and convenient proximity to Six Flags and STL. And I was pleased to see they allow pets. Good parking. No pool.

Text: For a super 8, this one was really quite nice!  The staff was courteous and the room was much cleaner and more up to date than other comperable motels.  Usually the A/C in these motels just have a couple of settings but this one actually had a temperature you could set.  It may not sound like much but it is something I usually find quite annoying in cheaper motels.  Plus they have a fridge and microwave in the room!  I'll be staying there again for sure.

Text: Would not recommend at all horrible place. Staff was unfriendly from the moment we arrived.  Had to ask for towels and washcloths and still weren't given enough. Bathroom reeked.  Room was barely clean.  The breakfast was and uninspired as the accomodations, tolerable would be generous.  Wished I had drove a bit further and spend a few dollars more for the Drury Inn we saw the next day.  Learn from my mistake do not stay here.
