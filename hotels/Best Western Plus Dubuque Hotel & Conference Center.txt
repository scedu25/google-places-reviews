Text: Very nice Best Western with a good location. Price was reasonable. Room was very comfortable. Very nice hotel for a family to stay. Attached restaurant was good and the buffet breakfast was better than continental. Good place to stay in Dubuque.

Text: Great hotel for the price. Comfortable, clean and the bed was exceptional.  Bath was deluxe sized. Beautiful vanity with surround lighting, large tub/shower with wide ledge for products or sitting. "Champs" Restaurant is attached and has room service. Food was good, arrived quickly, and reasonably priced.  Would recommend to anyone.

Text: Best hotel we've stayed at in a loooong time! CLEAN!!! Comfy beds & pillows!! TONS of outlets & charges in perfect locations! Amazing layout with HUGE CLEAN bathrooms!! Bathroom mirror had the best lighting I've seen in years!! Nice big TV. Great big room with big window overlooking the beautiful big pool & game area. Only disappointment was the mini fridge really wasn't keeping our things too cold.

Text: Mike Guthrie is the reason why we enjoyed our most recent stay and intend on returning for many future visits.  He is a great role model for people in the hospitality industry.  He knows how to make sure guests enjoy their stay.   Great facilities, great room and full breakfast.  Will definitely come back thanks to Mike.
