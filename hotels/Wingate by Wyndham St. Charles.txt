Text: The hotel itself was fine.  I was checking my bank account the day after the stay and saw I was charged $15.00.  I called them to inquire and they told me if the room is fine and nothing is taken or damaged, they'll refund my $15.00 within 7-10 business days.    Really?  This was charged to my Debit card which is how I paid for the room.  I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE, NOR DID I GIVE THEM PERMISSION TO DEDUCT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ROOM CHARGE TO MY ACCOUNT.   
To be honest, I don't know if I'll use them again......

Text: Rooms are very clean and comfortable. With a nice spacious bathroom. Hotel staff are very friendly and focused on making their guests comfortable. There is an indoor pool and indoor Jacuzzi, as well as a pool outside. The breakfasts are also pretty great. The only downsides I experienced were that my second key card had to be fixed twice and the 3rd floor ice machine did not work.

Text: It's a decent hotel, was staying on business. They have a pretty good breakfast with make-your-own waffles. Staff seems nice enough and the beds are comfortable. They do have Direct TV so that's a definite plus!!

Text: We had no problems at check in. The room was a 2 queen layout. They had a very small indoor pool and a whirlpool AS WELL as an average sized outdoor one. The breakfast was fairly laid out and included eggs and sausage as choices. The hotel was in a research park so there was little that I noticed in the immediate vicinity around it besides business buildings.

Text: Decent hotel with very good staff. They found a room for me at the last minute for a wedding they were booking. Unfortunately the room they had me in had peeling wallpaper in the bathroom. It hadn't progressed very far, so maybe they haven't noticed yet.
