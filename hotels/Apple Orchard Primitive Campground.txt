Apple Orchard Primitive Campground
Rating: 1
Text: DNR is overwhelmingly strict. We were one of three groups of campers in the entire primitive campground and DNR threatened to kick is out at 9pm if we didn't go to sleep by 11. They told us they kicked out a group the night prior even though it was weekend.
Rating: 4
Text: Plenty of sites to choose from.  Many shaded, many open grassy spots.  Easy access to a couple of trails.  Playground.
