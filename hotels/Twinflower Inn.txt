Text: The owners are incredibly friendly and accommodating. Breakfasts are great. Stayed two nights in the "Trumpeter Swan" room. Very clean, small fridge in the room, private bath, giant comfy bed. The grounds are beautiful, many native wildflowers around. Would highly recommend if just passing through or as a destination. While not officially a concierge, Brian and Kim will handle any need or request, and have great connections and recommendations in town and around the area. We'll be back.

Text: This Bed & Breakfast is just lovely.  The proprietors, Fox and Kim, did a wonderful job making you feel welcome and giving you your privacy when needed.  Fox was making a batch of maple syrup and we had it with French toast on Sunday...what a treat!  Also, Fox is a professional story teller and he told us a beautiful Irish tale.  The food was delicious, the company was great, Kim was an amazing hostess and Fox was the best.  I would highly recommend this B & B and will be going back in October!

Text: I was blessed with the opportunity to work out of this B&B for 2 months. Yes, 2 months. Fox and Kim are the warmest of souls who are very generous hosts. Their rooms maintain a very historic feel, harmonizing the colonial aspects from over 150 years ago (that's old) with some modern amenities and comforts. It was a peaceful place and town to work and live in.

I must admit. I hate a lot of small towns I work in because of all the zombified addicts and ignorant people. Bishop hill is uniquely different. Most of it's inhabitants were OLD, which was fine by me. I felt like I had the town to myself at times. Their central park, 1 block away from anything in town, is a treat. This is a midwestern gem I will never forget.
