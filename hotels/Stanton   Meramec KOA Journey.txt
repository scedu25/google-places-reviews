Stanton / Meramec KOA Journey
Rating: 5
Text: We were pleased with this KOA.  It was easy to navigate and our paperwork was easy to find in the night registration box.  Our directions to our site we're accurate and our site was clean and ready for hook-up.  The bathrooms were clean and the pet area had a fenced in area that we could let our dogs loose in if we wanted.   We would absolutely stay here again.

Text: If you are camping with tents, be aware that it is infested with all kinds ticks. Buy some Permethrin and spray it on all immediate areas. Other than that, everything is a little concentrated and it is close to roads, and trains; overall well kept. Decent amenities like: pool, bathrooms, fire pits, and showers. About 7 minutes on the highway to the closest markets. Looks like a better time for RVs. Overall a pleasant experience, may return.

Text: Very nice KOA campground. Super clean bath rooms! Shower was nice and clean with a decent shower head. Individual shower room with a 30 minute timer for the lights/exhaust fan. No tokens/$$ required.  Just stopped here for the night. The office even serves dinner that can be delivered to your site. Bbq food or pizza.

Text: Nice place to stay! Barb at the front desk was very friendly! The babque smelled so good but we not stay to eat. Easy pull through for our 5th wheel.
