Text: Owned by a lovely couple who take pride in running this campground. Ideally situated off the interstate. Perfect for an overnight pitstop or an extended stay. Separate men's and women's bath house. Small pool and little play area for the kiddos. Pet friendly too. Not luxury but a great place all the same.

Text: A fantastic RV campground. The owners are incredibly nice, the grounds are immaculate, the price is very reasonable. We drove in late and they waited for us to get here.
