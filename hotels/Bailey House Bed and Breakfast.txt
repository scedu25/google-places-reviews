Text: Very historic! I love the ambiance of an 1840s home. I believe it's on the National Register of Historic Places. This is my third visit! It is down the street from Ulysses Grant's boyhood home.

Text: Small town feel, hosts very hospitable. Always presenting local history and interesting area items to guests. Home cooking to kill for.

Text: This place is amazing. The house is gorgeous, and there are many stories surrounding most of the antiques inside. The hospitality of the hostess was exceptional. My stay was absolutely lovely. There was plenty to discover around town as well.

Text: What a wonderful place!  The Bailey House is great, it is full of history and run by some of the sweetest people I have had the pleasure of meeting.  Each room is well decorated and has everything you need to be comfortable.  I slept well and enjoyed my breakfast immensely each morning.  I travel frequently for work and I have never felt as at home while traveling as I felt at the Bailey house.  Thanks to Mr and Mrs Purdy weather work brings me back to Georgetown I will be returning.  Do yourself a favor and stay here.

Text: We always stay here when visiting family in the Cincinnati area. Beautiful, comfortable, quiet, and peaceful, plus it is in town, so fun to walk around. The host is wonderful and serves an amazing breakfast.
