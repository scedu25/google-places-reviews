Text: Very friendly staff and nice, clean rooms. My bed was very comfy! The lobby is also well maintained and includes lots of brochures for nearby attractions.

Text: I'm actually camping here. There are 5 full hookup sites. There is a swimming pool...was close to 100 today so that's going to feel good. Woman at the desk was very pleasant   needed a place to stop for the night and grateful to have found a place here. Not fancy but safe

Text: Very nice, clean room and super friendly staff working the desk. Mattress was well used (sank on the side with the night stand) on one side but still comfortable on the other side. Would recommend for anyone passing through Oakley looking for a good room at a fair price.

Text: Date was 2017 July 3rd:  Smelled smoking in lobby near breakfast area.  The hot water in room was lukewarm.  Curtains couldn't block light from window.  Only one plastic drinking cup in room.  Poor lighting in bedroom area.  Refrigerator was off in the room.  Entrance wall light wall switch operated the alarm clock.  Bathroom door was hard to close.  Very loose outlets in room.  At breakfast no waffle iron, low quality orange juice and coffee, and no oatmeal for last 20 minutes.

Text: The staff were very polite and accommodating. Breakfast wasn't spectacular, but was better than I have come to expect from hotel breakfasts. I loved that they offered chilled water and fresh fruit throughout the day in their lobby. The suites were $85 and their normal rooms were $75 on the random Wednesday night I stayed. Cheaper than the Sleep Inn on the East side of town. Overall, would go back again. Good small town. Good hotel.
