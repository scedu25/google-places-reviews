Text: This was a great stay. The manager was very friendly. The water pressure in the shower was amazing. Would given a 5 star but the laundry room was out of order and we needed uniforms washed. This was nice stay for the price and it was not too far from the softball complex. I will stay there again, when we go out. Highly recommended if you are in need of a room to stay.

Text:  very very friendly helpful people but that's where it ends. Nonsmoking room smelled like smoke,  door jamb and walls filthy,  bath mat had dirty footprint on it,  several flies flying around,  a dead bug on bathroom floor (decided not a roach).  Very tired bedspread and curtains. And that's only the surface. To top it off in the morning, some bug marched across the sheet. Bedbug or tick.  $200 spent on fresh paint and new bedspread would work wonders and maybe even rid the smell of smoke.

Text: The rooms are nasty. Theres bugs everywhere and in the microwave. The carpet is ripped and flys are attracted to the rooms. The towels are stained and if you move the bed there is weird white powder that if you sweep it up it stays in the air for a while and the heater doesnt work it sets off the fire alarm all in all bad experience just because its cheap i wouldn't stay here

Text: Dirty, bath drain slow, cigarette butt in bath sink drain. Not worth the $$$ I paid. A fair price would be like $$. Do not stay here.
