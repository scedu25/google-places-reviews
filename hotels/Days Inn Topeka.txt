Text: The gentleman at check in was very helpful. The hot tub was scalding and the jets wouldn't turn on. The pool was very warm. No towels in the pool area. Breakfast was okay. Couldn't find the milk for the cereal, finally found it in the back pump coffeepot, it wasn't labeled. The room could have been cleaner. The toilet runs all the time. The faucet in the shower drips. Beds were okay.

Text: Where do I start? First, pretty sure my room was a former crime scene. There was something reddish smeared on the wall and all over the bedspread. The floor slanted upwards...things kept sliding off of the table. There was a no smoking sign on the door, an ash tray on the desk and the smoke alarms were disabled. Pretty sure that's illegal. The breakfast was stale and there was stuff floating in the orange juice. Yeah...my bad for booking too late for the eclipse. Never again, man. Never again.

Text: Dirty, smells. showers not good, bed hard, and They put a hold on my Credit Card, and wont take it off! I have called multiple time, and from what I can understand is, he was going to call his card company to get it off, and didn't even ask my name. Go across the parking lot to Econo Lodge, Great price , great people, clean rooms, and a great breakfast!

Text: Stayed in Room 200. There was no smoke detector in the room, the AC unit had tape all over, the floor was not leveled, the sink was cracked and it as the counter was covered in cigarette burn stains. The nearby stairwell, the wall paper is peeling exposing possible mold. Killed numerous bugs in the room including a spider. Two stars is being modest.
