Holiday Inn Express Tiffin
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is convienently located next to the mall, just inside the west side of the city limits off of 224. The lobby was undergoing reconstruction during our stay (7/21/17) and our rate reflected the inconvenience but, presented no problem for us during our stay. The room was spacious, quiet, and clean. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water at the peak time of the morning for our showers. The staff was extremely courteous. We'd stay here again if in the area.
