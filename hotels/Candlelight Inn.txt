Candlelight Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Just about an hour from Nashville Indiana, Candlelight Inn is a sight for road-sore eyes!  Plush linens, fantastic meals and snacks, and good old-fashioned hospitality make Candlelight Inn into a five-star lodging! The owner, Elizabeth Grant, made us feel right at home in her beautifully decorated two story home that she painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up. 

My husband and I, along with our four children felt positively spoiled by all the attention we recieved upon our arrival. My 9 year old son made the comment that Elizabeth was "just like an aunt or a grandma to us!" Each room in this beautiful home is tastefully decorated with a collection of antiques and primitives, although there are many modern amenities as well, such as color televisions with dvd, wireless internet and more.  Breakfast is served in the diningroom at your convenience, and it is sumptious fare!  Both the upstairs rooms and the downstairs rooms have access to refreshments and snacks.  This is a place that will not be soon forgotten!  We look forward to our next visit! Such a great price for a wonderful experience!
