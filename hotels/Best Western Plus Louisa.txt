Best Western Plus Louisa
Rating: 5
Text: My children (ages 11 and 14) stayed at the Best Western Plus in Louisa, Ky. My husband unfortunately had to work so was unable to come with us to Kentucky (we live in Michigan) so I was a bit concerned about safety (being away from home with just the kids......) We felt very safe!!! We enjoyed our stay. The room was very clean and neat. The pool was very clean and actually we were the only ones in it. All of the staff were very nice and friendly. The bathroom in the pool area was very clean. Check in/out was very prompt. Breakfast was very good. Very clean environment. Would definitely stay again.....Oh, and the location is BEAUTIFUL! It's on a hill surrounded by wildlife...deer, rabbits and even an eagle!!!

Text: Very nice room! And it had the biggest bathroom I believe I have ever seen in a hotel. It was handicap accessible, but not specially noted as such and I didn't ask for one. This must be pretty new construction, no wear and tear of older ones. I will definitely go back there again.

Text: The Best Western Hotel in Louisa Kentucky is a great place to stay.  The staff was very friendly and eager to help with all your needs.  There is a nice indoor pool and a workout room so you can stay in shape while away from home.  The breakfast has a good variety of options and they have coffee and tea even when the kitchen is closed.  The hotel is in a convenient location and far enough away from the road so you are not disturbed by the road noise.  If you are in the Louisa, KY area you might want to give them a try.  They have free cancellation up to 6:00 p.m. the day of your arrival.

Text: Make sure you call to confirm your room.  We purchased the room through Expedia with a guarantee, but when we got there we did not get the room we purchased. We need a suite and got a two queen beds with a cot. one short of 6 beds.  The hotel was nice and clean and our kids did like the pool and breakfast.
