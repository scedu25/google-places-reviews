Hampton Inn Cincinnati-Eastgate
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was under renovation when we stayed but it did not interfere with the comfort. The staff were wonderful and going above and beyond for us. My sister-in-law was allergic to the feathered pillows the staff quickly made it right and even replace the blanket as well since it had feathers. The breakfast in the hotel was great this staff serving the breakfast was just as confident as a housekeeping staff they came out and quickly took any plates that were cleared and mentioned to us when they were closing so that I could get a plate for my husband who is still sleeping in his room.

Text: Perfect stay! Room smells like the newly milled wood on the floors. Plenty of pillows, nice and heavy white comforters, comfy beds. Cable TV, fridge, microwave, personal appliances. Plenty of towels, bright and clean shower. Best Continental breakfast I ever saw! DIY waffles, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cheese omelettes, home fries, turkey sausage, cereal, yogurt, and the usual beverages. Staff was courteous and efficient.

Text: Best value in the area. The hotel is going through renovations and what they have done so far has really improved the stay. Clean, large rooms with a very nice walk in shower in the bathroom. Friendly staff always very helpful. You couldn't ask for a better price, which is below the average going rate in the surrounding area.

Text: We had a great experience. The staff was friendly; the rooms were clean, comfortable, and nice quality; and there are a few restaurants in walking distance. We chose to drive a few minutes down the road and found several good local places for dinner.

Text: My room was clean, check in/out easy, and it was quiet. Bed was comfy and pillows were fluffy. Hotel is going thru renovation, but don’t let the outside deter you, it’s much nicer inside. Construction on the building starts at 8 and ends around 5. Nothing I couldn’t watch tv or relax with. The rooms air conditioning  was ice cold which was a big plus! Didn’t see the pool, I was too busy. Breakfast in the morning is excellent. Starbucks nearby and tons of restaurants. Convenient location to everything!
