Cambria hotel & suites Indianapolis Airport
Rating: 3
Text: Overall, the experience could have been better. The parking is oddly configured. The proper toiletries were not provided prior to out arrival: half the number of towels as our guest, no shampoo or body wash, and no additional pillows for use on the hide away bed. The breakfast may have been the best part of the experience, though it wasn't anything special. At least the eggs were cooked and not over cooked with the option of sausage, bacon, biscuits, sausage gravy, hash browns, yogurt, cereal, and bagels.

Text: Very clean, nice room. The shower is huge and the room is a good size. However the closet was in a really weird place. Difficult to get to. There were weird divots in the hall that are easy to trip on. No real food offered before bar open at 5 (aside from convenient style snacks).  Staff was polite, but not friendly.

Text: Wonderful hotel, very nice rooms, (mini suites) always clean, comfortable beds, nice work area, reliable internet.  Has restaurant that serves breakfast and dinner and bar that is open in the evening.  Family friendly and work friendly.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Work out area and pool are nice and maintained well.   I have stayed there many times for work and they are always consistent with rooms and staff.  I have never been disappointed.  I recommend to everyone I know.

Text: This place is beautiful! The staff and managers are friendly and answered our questions without hesitation. They also ensured that there was a carbon monoxide detector in the pool for us, which is a huge deal after having lost one of our youth to carbon monoxide poisoning at a hotel. Thank you Cambria for a great place to stay after a long day of traveling and playing at the zoo!
