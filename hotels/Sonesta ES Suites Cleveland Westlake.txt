Sonesta ES Suites Cleveland Westlake

Text: As always, the room was very clean and inviting.  Whenever I have an opportunity to stay at one of their complexes, I am thrilled. The bed is amazingly comfortable.  The units have a full kitchen.  Even though I primarily just sleep there, I took advantage of the stove.  I needed a cookie sheet and there wasn't one in the room.  They let me borrow one from the main kitchen as long as I brought it back before morning. They were very accommodating.  Can't wait for the next adventure!!!

Text: Wonderful customer service. We just relocated to the area and are staying here while looking for a home. This place is a perfect home away from home. The only complaint I have is the internet connection sucks. But other than that this place is great. Perfect for a one night stay or an extended stay.

Text: Second time staying at this brand in Cleveland and this location had the nicest staff of any hotel I've stayed at in recent memory! So helpful, and seemed genuinely interested in your stay being great--this was everyone encountered from desk to housekeeping. Pool was clean and nice, room clean and comfortable. Great location very near a big mall in Westlake, so there's nearby dining, grocery, even cinema options. It was a great three day getaway.

Text: We stayed here for just one night this time. As usual, the room was very clean and comfortable. Our stay was quiet, and we did not hear anything from the other guests while we were there. Breakfast was decent, but nothing outside of standard hotel breakfasts. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the entire stay.

Text: My biggest complaints are that our bathroom door was hard to shut and we were short a towel (quickly remidied, though). Seriously. This hotel is amazing. Beautiful, spacious, and modern rooms with new appliances (stunning TVs!) and overall a pleasing aesthetic. My family used the pool and said it was a great time, I personally stayed back and relaxed which was easy to do with the climate control keeping the room comfortable, the endless selection on the TVs, the fully equipped kitchen, and a comfy bed. The pull out bed was much better than most hotels too. And they actually included a full set of blankets for it! I know I'm rambling but I just loved this hotel so much. We had an 11 hour drive the day we arrived and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
