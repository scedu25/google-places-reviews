Arbor Suites At the Mall
Rating: 4
Text: Good location, convienant and close to everything but off the main road and quiet. Very spacious rooms as it clearly used to be apartments. Makes for a unique kind of setting for fishing rooms and feeling at home with a full kitchen in the cheapest of rooms. Great for long stays. However it appears as though most of the stuff from the apartments is still there and has not been updated yet giving some parts a very dated look. Also there sounded like there was very noisy construction or work going on in the room next to us as late as 8pm. Overall very pleased with the price and size of the room, would stay again if I was staying for extended periods.

Text: Don't waste your time. Rooms are spacious but very dirty, outdated, and odorous. Carpet is ripped in multiple places. Desk chair had large holes in several places. Looks like the room is straight from 1985. Very VERY musty and moldy smelling. Brought my 3 year old and 8 month old and was afraid to let them on the floor. Will never stay here again. 
Staff was friendly but took over 30 minutes to check in. (Note it's 10:30pm traveling with 2 small children!) 
Keep driving and find something CLEAN!

Update: 
Management was extremely helpful with my complain. Refunded my stay as well as credited a free room. From my understanding, they are renovating the hotel and my family was placed in a very old room. Will hopefully be able to raise the rating when we stay again!

Text: Cute little rooms... Full kitchen, nice pool, bbq area. TV setup is a little weird. Second time we stayed the night would stay again.
