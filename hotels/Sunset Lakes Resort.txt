Text: Should be 4 stars. Gonna have to enforce rules better when busy. Kids driving golf carts no adults in them.dogs off lead several places and anytime  even public areas. And quiet time Sat. Was a joke with engines reviving up after midnight..but campground is beautiful. Can say anything about bathhouse because hadn't opened them yet even though second week open for season

Text: We rented a 3 bedroom cabin and first off it was a trailer. The central a/c did not work and only window units were available. During the day the room was uncomfortably warm and sometimes at night. Once outside the room though the campgrounds had several activities to do. Paddleboating, fishing, minigolf, tennis, etc. Overall it was actually a better experience than my first couple of sentences made it sound. I was disappointed by the room but once outside (where everyone should be anyway) this place was pretty good.

Text: Very clean, super friendly. So much to do there & most of it's all free. The only issue everyone had was the millions of mosquitos that are VERY HUNGRY!
There's 5 fishing ponds that are breeding grounds for them. & They poke rite Thru the bug spray.
