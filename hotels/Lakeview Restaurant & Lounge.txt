Lakeview Restaurant & Lounge
Rating: 4
Text: This hotel was quite comfortable for an over night stay. We have stayed at other motels in the area, and were a little hesitant on first impression, but it proved to be a pleasant surprise. We had a lake facing room, it was quiet and clean. The service was accomodating and included a hot breakfast and a discount to the resteraunt for lunch and dinner.  We will likely stay here again when visiting the area.

Text: We gave it a try and this place is actually cool. The place was quiet and the staff were genuinely polite and caring of your needs. I enjoyed our trip to Trenton and giving this place a good review doesn't justify the perfectness of my travel to Trenton.
