Text: A very nice room. We were able to book a room on our way to The Isle. Felt very blessed because the hotel was booked full.
I was told to continue to call back that there may be a cancelation.
The Hairball Concert was a blast!
Awesome stay.
Thank you to all staff

Text: We stayed at the casino hotel for a wedding, and attended a reception at the event center there. But king room was awesome. Very clean, very comfortable bed. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: I wanted to take my husband for a birthday prime rib and crab leg buffet. The website simply states available during dinner hours Friday Saturday and Sunday's in October. So, I called to verify what the hours were for this buffet. I called the number from the website and was told 11:30 am until 9 pm. I asked, to verify the food I wanted was during those hours, and I was told yes. We drove an hour and a half to go eat a nice meal. Long story short, I was given the wrong information. Not only did they NOT have prime rib and crab legs at 2 pm when we got there... the entire buffet was SHUT DOWN for 2 hours. Tried calling to make a complaint and was told we called the wrong number. Will NEVER go here again.

Text: We had a great stay at Isle Casino. Check in was a breeze and rooms were nice and quite. We were in town for business in Davenport, and the location was super close and convenient, and we even got to try our hand on the Roulette table! (The casino employees were super helpful in explaining the rules to us newbies) Also the hotel is situated in a beautiful location overlooking a big river with a nice running & biking trail running all the way into Davenport. Would stay again!

Text: Just love this casino! Good mixture of older slots and newer slots - good choice of live table games. Comps are good the farther away you live from this place the better they seem to be!
