Ann Arbor Marriott Ypsilanti at Eagle Crest
Rating: 4
Text: I have stayed at the Marriott Ypsilanti several times for business and I haven't been disappointed. It is in a nice location next to a beautiful golf course with great views of Ford Lake. The lobby restaurant has good food and an extensive drink menu. The workout room is clean and comfortable. The rooms are dated but clean and comfortable as well. I will continue to choose the Ypsilanti Marriott when traveling to this area for business.

Text: Beautifully appointed hotel. Beautiful golf course you if you get on the right side of the building. Beware though, you are not allowed to walk on the golf course parts. Luckily, there is a Nice 2.5 mile walking trail nearby. This hotel has everything you could possibly want or need; Also, these are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on in a Marriott. Very impressed with everything. Free parking & WiFi. Friendly staff. So pleased we stayed here. ?

Text: Easy to find, right off the highway. Rooms were clean, spacious, comfortable and we had a great view of Ford Lake. Everyone was friendly and helpful including desk clerk, housekeeping, bartender, and wait staff. I was attending a conference which included meals, all the food was delicious and again, the staff were all very friendly.

Text: It's a nice hotel, the customer service is A+. I highly recommend the restaurant for the service alone. My room was comfortable, though pretty standard. The lobby is gorgeous - I think they recently had it remodeled. Overall, I think the service makes this place a great choice for the area. I didn't go golfing, but there is a course if that's your thing.

Text: The event I attended was an awesome nonprofit celebration. The Ballroom was nice although how the tables were arranged made me feel a bit hidden away from the rest of the attendees. I also didn't think the food was good at all. It was a continental breakfast so I have to regulate my expectations, but Ill just say the meal was 'underwhelming' in taste and presentation. I have to also share that it's always bothered me that they call this hotel the Ann Arbor Marriot in Ypsilanti. Weird, because its clearly in Ypsi.
