Cobblestone Hotel & Suites

Text: A few friends and I stayed in this hotel on our way to see the solar eclipse. It's such a wonderful hotel! The staff was amazingly helpful, and we actually ended up staying an extra night because it was so nice. The breakfast selection was great, the pool was clean and a good temperature, and the room was really comfortable and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming through Southern Illinois, and I'd stay at any of their other hotels in the chain if they're as nice as this one.

Text: Great hotel.  Staff always greets you and asks if there's anything they can do.  Clean rooms and lots of extras on property.  Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling through or close.  Little bit off of 70 but nice drive and well worth it.

Text: The staff were very accommodating, even let us put our luggage in our room before check in. Rooms were clean and nice and for the price you can't beat it. I would definitely stay here again.
