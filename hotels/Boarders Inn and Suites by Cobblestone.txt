Text: The rooms were great! They were clean and comfortable. There were some loud guests, but I think there was an event going on nearby. The staff were incredible and kind. Also, the hotel was right off the road I came to town on. It was convienent being that close and I couldn't hear the road while trying to sleep! If the rooms hadn't let in so much noise from other guests it would have been perfect.

Text: The Lady who worked the front desk overnight was pretty much useless. She kept telling me "I dont know because i am not in charge" over the dumbest things like when i asked her for a wine bottle opener. The next morning I asked the lady at the front desk for a partial refund on my room because they did not give me the room i actually paid for (which was an up charge) and she told me that the lady in charge was there the night before working overnight and she is sleeping right now so she can't help me. THE SAME LADY THAT SAID SHE WASN'T IN CHARGE.

They decided that they would book a wedding reception in the hotel the same night we were there which is cool because they have an entire room for events. However, the wedding guests spent 2 hours in the lobby/halls before the event even started. We had to walk through the entire party in order to get to the pool. 

ALSO, Our Key cards stopped working about 5 times during our stay, we had to keep getting them reactivated which is incredibly inconvenient. 

This gets a 2 star because the free breakfast in the morning was actually pretty decent which surprised me.
