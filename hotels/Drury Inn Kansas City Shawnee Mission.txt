Drury Inn Kansas City Shawnee Mission

Text: This is an excellent Hotel to spend the night at. I always enjoy my stay here. After a long day at work it's nice to return to the hotel and enjoy the happy hour with the other guests. They serve fresh snacks like nachos and tacos or baked potatoes and all guests receive a complimentary drink card which allows for 3 alcoholic beverages. Breakfast is served every morning and the cleanliness is top notch. There is an inside pool, Jacuzzi and workout room. I also appreciate that they have washer and dryers. All this helps me get a good night's sleep.

Text: Excellent motel, in fact one of the nicest ones I stay at. Staff is friendly, rooms are clean, breakfast is good. However I'm only giving 3 stars because the kickback meal is not very good. They always have chicken and these nasty pasta.  If they would change that up to say maybe meatball and tomato sauces pasta it's be a whole lot better. In fact is have no problem giving this motel a 5 star rating. The comfort inn changes their menu daily. And they offer cookies for desert. Their salad is iceberg lettuce which is much better than the green grass they offer here. Also lately they either don't put everything out during breakfast and lunch, or they are out of things like toast or chips.

Text: For what it is, this place does a great job. Not fancy, but cheap, clean, convenient, comfortable, and quiet. Plus free breakfast.

 My only concern is that I did hear my neighbors through the adjoining door pretty clearly for a few minutes. It didn't disturb me but if they had been noisy overnight, it probably would have.

Text: Decent hotel. Needs updating. The staff is amazing and so helpful.  Wasn't real impressed that housekeeping was knocking on the door at 8 AM and then just came into our room at 1045.  The extras were nice, the free drinks were really small and you are limited to three.  But the food choices were good! It's definitely NOT an Embassy.  It would be a good place to stay with a big family and if you're not going to spend too much time I  your room.

Text: I truly love this hotel. Super clean and comfortable. Unbelievably friendly and helpful staff. Quiet, well appointed room. A home away from home, which is the highest compliment I can give. The BEST hotel at this price range.
