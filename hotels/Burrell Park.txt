Text: Tent and RV camping with bath house. Picnic areas, walking trail, and several playgrounds. There's a small lake for fishing. Great place for a party. Can reserve shelters through the Carmi PD. Closes in winter.

Text: What a nice park and campground.  The sites are level, most are shaded, and access is easy.  I hope we can pass through Carmi again and maybe spend a little more time there.
