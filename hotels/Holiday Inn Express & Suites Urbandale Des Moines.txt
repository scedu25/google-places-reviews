Text: Great stay! Breakfast was great, beds were very comfortable, and rooms were very clean! It's right off the interstate and has plenty of restaurants and gas stations near by! Customer service was amazing, Andrea at the front desk was great! She helped with all my needs and was very eager to help! Will be coming here again!

Text: Great breakfast, comfy beds, clean rooms and lobby area. The lobby was very welcoming. Had some minor issues with our TV but, Andrea at the front desk was quick to help and she didn't leave until the TV was working the way it was supposed to and also assisting others at the front desk! I was very pleased. This will be the place I stay at if I ever stop into Des Moines again!

Text: Very nice hotel, friendly staff, and up to date rooms. The only complaint is the smell in the lobby by the dinning area. There was a strong sewer smell for the 3 days I was there in the evening.

Text: Fantastic Hotel, large breakfast area for free breakfast great pool, rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds. Only thing I wished was different was that they would provide Pack & plays instead of portable cribs but otherwise we had a great stay there.
