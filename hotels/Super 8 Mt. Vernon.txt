Super 8 MT. Vernon
Rating: 2
Text: It's a roof and a bed. Shower drips. Tiny toilet. Smells like smoke and cigarette burns on bed covers. We had a non-smoking room. Generally clean. Staff was helpful. Parking lot is tiny.

Text: I really like the people at  Super 8 that is the only reason it is getting  2 stars. The carpet in our room and throughout the entire place is dirty and the smell in our room is from being dirty. The swimming pool is super cold all the time. The nice lady working the front desk tried to adjust it but she could not. As we settled down for bed we could not sleep due to several bugs flying around and dive bombing us. Again, the very nice front desk attendant try to help but not much she could do. I love the staff here they are helpful, friendly and go above and beyond but the conditions here are awful.

Text: My lights in my room by my bed didn't work. Several stains of what looked like ink on the bed spread. The first floor smelled horribly of smoke, but it was a non-smoking floor. There was duct-tape on the wall. A horrible place too stay.

Text: The Indian man was so nice. I booked last Sunday but we ended up not making it til Monday due to the distance traveled, and he still honored our reservation. The pool looked very clean and fun unfortunately we didn't have time to enjoy it this visit.
