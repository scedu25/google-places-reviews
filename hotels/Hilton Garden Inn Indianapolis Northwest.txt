Text: We had a great experience here. The room was really nice. It was spacious and had comfortable furniture in it. Breakfast that I ordered was delicious and didn't take forever to get to me. We will probably stay here every time we're in town.

Text: Stayed 5 days for a business trip, TV was broken when I arrived an would start freezing and artifacting after some use. Reported it to the desk on day 2, was never fixed. Apart from being bored out of my skull the room smelled like it had a slight tinge of mildew to it which seemed to come an go. I'm not usually one to complain, I believe things should just work out of the box... I guess I should of asked to be moved. :/

Text: Ffa week. Hotel price outrageous. Ac would not turn off and ran all night with 40 outside temperature. Hotel tried to fix it the next day. It now turned off but wouldn't work. Not very interested in ensuring it was repaired. Shame on the management
