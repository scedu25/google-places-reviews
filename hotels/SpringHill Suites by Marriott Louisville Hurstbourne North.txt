Text: Wonderful hotel!!  Clean rooms....with lots of space (loved the separated living and sleeping areas....plus the sink area was separate from shower/bathroom so one could get shower while others are using the sink and mirror!!)  Swimming pool with hot tub and fitness room....plus hot breakfast in the morning.   Very nice area... safe.. nearby places to eat... and deliver to hotel.   Highly recommend!

Text: We stayed here over night after a wedding. The front desk workers greeted us with kindness and smiles. The rooms were very clean and big! I wish our double room had queen beds instead of full size (this may be an option.. I didn't book the room :) ). Continental breakfast was good and warm. Check out was at noon which I loved and they thanked us for choosing that location. Overall great experience!

Text: Arrived late, exhausted...it was so nice to get checked in  with our room saved, friendly staff, and CLEAN, COMFY, and nice large King suite..with what seems to be newly renovated hotel. Love the couch and tray tables, large flat screen up on the wall with swivel capability to adjust viewing preferences. The location is a few miles off the interstate but convenient to many Food, shopping,and the Kentucky Downs. It also has an indoor swimming pool..but have not had a chance to check it out as well as other hotel amenities. Good choice for East Louisville.

Text: Excellent!!  Very comfortable beds, quiet rooms, nice staff.  Very clean, nice sitting area with couch desk and small kitchen with mini refrigerator and microwave in rooms.  Rooms have a great layout and were recently refurbished. I would highly recommend.

Text: Good rooms, Wi-Fi worked, breakfast was decent. Sofa in room had a pull out mattress which was handy, but a spare set of bedding that I think was for it didn't have a fitted sheet and the comforter for it was gross. Thankfully, I had my own. Otherwise, decent place.
