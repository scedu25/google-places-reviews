Drury Inn & Suites St. Louis O'Fallon, IL
Rating: 5
Text: Located right off I-64 with great access to the O'Fallon Sports complex. Plenty of parking at this 7 story hotel. Restaurants closely located, bit you shouldn't need it with the great breakfast in the morning. Bicuits and gravy, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, eggs, juice and coffee. Also, the 5:30 kickback happy hour which has drinks, baked potato bar, soup, hot dogs, and pasta. Room on second floor was quiet and roomy. A little bit of a wait for the elevator during morning checkout rush. Pool had an indoor and outdoor area.

Text: Room look new and modern. Great staff! Hot breakfast, dinner and free popcorn included with stay! (All hotels should do this!) 
The only problem I had was the bathroom. There was toilet paper in the toilet that someone didn't flush.  Not sure if that means my the toilet wasn't cleaned before we checkin..? The knobs and drains in the bathroom needed a cleaning, they yellow stuff around them. And shower glass door had not been cleaned, the door had streaks everywhere.

Text: Remodeled at the beginning of 2017... Everything was immaculate, friendly staff and while we were there, a breakfast and a dinner buffet.. Dinner was so good (and free) that we chose dining at the hotel rather than going out for dinner. Also three bar drinks per night were included per adult.. We'll stay there again for sure!

Text: Our family of 5 stayed in a two queen suite in June. This was a good layover for us on a longer trip. The hotel was clean and modern. The staff was friendly. It had a large continental breakfast with good hot and cold food choices. The cocktails and kickstarters were welcome after a long drive. Our room was spacious, well designed, and comfortable.
