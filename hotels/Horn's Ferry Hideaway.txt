Horn's Ferry Hideaway

Text: We went to Horn's Ferry Hideaway for our honeymoon, and we cannot say enough good things about this beautiful place! The owners were absolutely wonderful and so kind to us throughout our entire stay. We had some vehicular issues on our way, and the owners were more than happy to help us with whatever they could. The cabins themselves were very clean and stocked with everything you could need! The views from the cabin are very peaceful and full of trees, and it is very close to the Des Moines River so we were actually able to walk our kayaks down to the river and go kayaking! Nearby towns were also a joy to visit. Absolutely wonderful and would highly recommend!

Text: Very comfy cabin buried in the woods. They have everything you need for your stay from towels to dishes  and coffee. The location is good being between Pella and Knoxville.  The cabins are very clean and the staff will do the cleaning so you can take advantage of the cabin till the last minute. Its a great get away. Make sure you take the hike to the other side of the river and go to the old bridge.

Text: What's not to like? We go after Ivan's campground closes for the season and basically have the place to ourselves. Very peaceful, and the cabins are very nicely appointed.
