Text: Very nice place to stay especially if you want the option of cooking in your room.  The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  This location is very pet friendly as well.  They have plenty of grassy areas for your pets; they even supply waste bags and trash cans for disposal.

Text: Nice large rooms. Decent sized kitchen for a hotel. Fully stocked kitchen. Average breakfast but they also provide evening drinks and snacks Monday through Wednesday. Nice hotel in a nice area. Good alternative to staying downtown if you are here for an extended period of time. I will definitely be staying here again.

Text: We had a last minute stay as our house was without water for several days. They were extremely accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed including a late checkout. They were under renovation and there was a few things about the room that needed updating. Breakfast was great and the staff was very welcoming. I would recommed this location if you are staying in the area.
