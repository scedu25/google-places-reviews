Text: Called this hotel and the front desk person could not speak English well at all. So i respectfully asked to speak to a manager or someone else who I could better understand and the person started yelling at me saying "2 WEEKS CALL 2 WEEKS" than hung up. This happened two more time how is anyone suppose to book a visit if you just yell at them and hang up?

Text: Will not stay here again. The room looked clean. But I found bed bugs. Also my husband and I had share towels. They told us one set towels for both of us. And could only get clean towels every other day. Our room was not clean the time we were there. So we went some where else.
