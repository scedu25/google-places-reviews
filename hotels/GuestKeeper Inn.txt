Text: Pleasantly surprised and pleased with our room.  It was reasonably clean and very quiet. Nice flat screen tv.  Microwave and refrigerator that works. Price was so reasonable.  We would stay here again.

Text: Decent hotel, but the the management was terrible. They tried to give us a fee for our service dog and when we provided them the card and docs they said they were going to still charge a pet fee. They wouldn't honor the online prices and then told us to go somewhere else. I guess they don't need business?

Text: This Place should be SHUT DOWN! This was the worst experence. We did not have a chance to research this hotel before staying it was a pick off the road at night. BUG POOP, all over the walls, holy sheets. Just unhealthy conditions! We tried sleeping in our car, but ended up leaving and coming home around midnight. We came into town to spend some money but this was HIORRID, Sorry Van Wert as long as you have a hotel with these conditions, your going to lose ALOT of revenue.

Text: GPS took us to a dead end street. Hotel is very dated but a good cheap price. Sink leaked and a lock on our door was broken.
