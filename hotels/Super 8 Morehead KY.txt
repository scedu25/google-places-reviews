Text: Stayed at the motel in Morehead Ky and was not impressed to say the least. The room was supposed to be cleaned. However the chair in the room looked like someone with grease on their back had sat in in it. No flat screen tv in the room, or refrigerator. They did come in and clean the chair and bring in a fridge, yay me. The chair was still filthy looking. Major thing was one small ice machine for the entire motel and it was giving any ice. Overall rating booooooooo!
