Super 8 Sioux City/Morningside Area

Text: Standard rooms, nothing shabby other than some doors not having brakes to stop them from slamming. Guest dryer machine was broken, but washer was fine. Location is good with a gas station, laundromat and KFC close by. Semi parking available.  Tv's were great with good selection of channels. Breakfast was lacking though. However I'll give it the 4 stars because they have a functioning treadmill. This ain't no cheap treadmill either, which was great.

Text: Place was kinda dated. Not dirty but could have been cleaner. Checkout time is 11 am and we were running a lil late...like not even 5 min by 1030 housekeeping was knocking on door and at 1101 the front desk was calling and the housekeepers were standing outside the door.....very rude.

Text: Not the greatest place that I stayed cleanliness was not the greatest.  There where bottles and cups behind the fridge and I would have gotten past all the cig burns in the blankets but the mold like substance on my pillow was not something I wanted to see.  Among other things I'd say this was one of the worst ones I stayed in.

Text: Meh. It was ok for one night but not any longer. Was noisy and could smell cigarette smoke.
