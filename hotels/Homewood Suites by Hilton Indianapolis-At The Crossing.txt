Text: One of the worst places I have ever stayed.  I was working in the area for several days and my company booked me at this hotel. It's all smoke and mirrors. I came back to the hotel several nights after a long day of work to a room that hadn't been cleaned, a shower curtain laying in the middle of the bathroom floor, trash not emptied and water all over the kitchen floor from a leaking ice maker. I would call the front desk to report and the most I got was an "I'm sorry" . I will never stay here again. Many other nice places to stay in the area.  Try them before you book at this location . They also took a large amount of money from my card that I put on file for " incidentals". Within two days of check-in they had stripped my account of $800.00 and I hadn't charged anything.

Text: This hotel was very nice. Large, clean rooms. Staff was very friendly and provided a map to be able to navigate between the buildings. I'll definitely stay here again if I'm in the area.

Text: Friendly staff, convenient location, room layout and cleanliness was impeccable but i was really disappointed by the pool. I was hoping to be able to swim and come to find out the deepest part of the pool is 3ft. That's if filled all the way. It was over 6 inches under filled. Besides that i highly recommend!

Text: When we stayed the hotel was under renovation so there were saws and hammers at 8am until the evening. Other then that the breakfast was good. The rooms were very spacious. Bed was comfortable. The location was very convenient.
