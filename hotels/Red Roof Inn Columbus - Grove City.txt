Red Roof Inn Columbus - Grove City
Rating: 5
Text: Pleasantly surprised.  This was an excellent place to spend the night, especially when traveling with dogs.  The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean.  The front desk staff was very pleasant and went beyond what they needed to.  There are numerous restaurants and stores around.  We will use Red Roof Inns in the future.

Text: Check in hostess was great, even at 3:45am. Room was clean but could have provided more towels. Reserved a king bed and got 2 queens. Not a huge deal. Very quality internet for 2 college students who had work to do on our time out of town.

Text: A great budget motel. The rooms and parking lot are small, but everything was clean and maintained, and the room seemed relatively new. 

Quiet, despite being in a potentially noisy area (shopping centers, freeway nearby). A safe and typical suburban location. Not too far of a drive from downtown Columbus. 

Staff was pleasant and cordial. 

The complimentary breakfast is the "cold cereal and coffee" approach. 

Plenty of options for chain restaurant food and shopping nearby, some within walking distance. 

The wifi signal was good and was fast enough to stream videos without much buffering. 

Would definitely consider staying here again next time I'm in Columbus.

Text: The room was very nice and very clean. It had tons of cable stations. The people that run it are constantly working keeping the grounds clean. I was impressed. I wanted to stay a third night but had to get home.

Text: Was stuck near the washing machine. Very loud. Bed was firm. Bare minimum. Tv was nice. Lots of channels. Worth the money but would have been better in a different room.
