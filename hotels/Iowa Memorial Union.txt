Text: Fantastic place to study, with multiple floors to attain desired quiet study levels. Even in my senior year I was still finding new nooks and crannies. Also a great place to work, and has great finals week programming. A must visit for any UIowa student (and the hotel inside it that gives it 24/7 hours ain't bad either)

Text: Pretty good place to eat as a student, but I wish that the common areas were bigger and  would fit more people in. Sometime you can't find a seat to sit!

Text: Went to a beautiful wedding here.  Basement has a lounge and restaurants for students.  There is a book and tech store here in the basemenr.  Rooms are available for meetings and gatherings but I think are managed by the University

Text: Great space - plenty of room. 

Would like to see more friendly colors and better maps throughout the place - but it works.

Text: Great place to study or get a bite to eat. It's the most confusing building to get around, but it has everything a student would need. LOVE the $3 CAB movie theaters
