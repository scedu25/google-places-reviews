Text: It was a very delightful stay. They had it microwave mini fridge so hotel staff was delightful the pool was good the hot tub was good except for the fact that the hot tub did not have any checks. & I would prefer to hot tub with the Jets but it said it was in occupational spa and the words no just. That was the only bad thing. However the breakfast was amazing they had a very good selection and kept it very well stocked. I have absolutely no complaints except for Jackson the hot tub for this hotel. It was a newer hotel at was for comfortable and I recommend it

Text: The staff was nice and the rooms were clean. The pool area was indoors which was great for the weather and accessible every time we were ready to use it. The front desk staff and cleaning crew were always courteous and helpful.

Text: The people here make this place worthwhile.  And all that they do for Servicemembers and their families, both brand new soldiers and retiring as well, they go out of their way to help. It's tough that there are smoking rooms next to non-smoking ones and that every single room may have had a pet or 2 in it at some point. The carpet in the hallways needs to be replaced too. But again, love the staff.
