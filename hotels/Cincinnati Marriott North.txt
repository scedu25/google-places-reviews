Text: I attended the West Chester Liberty Chamber Alliance luncheon. The way staff was wonderful! They made the students in our group feel welcome and a helped them get more out of the meeting. The food served was absolutely delicious.

Text: Nice place with recently renovated rooms. All feels new and clean, but the overall effect isn't quite like a typical full service Marriott. The room service food is boxed, and the concierge lounge offering is simple. While this place is nice, it down compare, for example, with the redone full service location in Dallas. Nice, but somewhat limited.

Text: I am spending one week here for a business travel. The room is big a extremely comfortable with a big TV and a king-size bed. The breakfast has a good choice a products. There is a 24h open gym and a swimming pool. The price is quite high but it the only hotel where I have been so I cannot compete the price.
