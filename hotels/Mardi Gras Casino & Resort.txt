Text: Had a great time here with a large group of friends. Everyone there was very helpful and nice. Dealers were absolutely awesome especially Trisha and Amanda! And as for food I actually only ate breakfast while I was here but that was delicious.

Text: This is by far one of my favorite casinos to visit whenever I am anywhere near Charleston, WV. The machines are usually VERY generous to me! Staff is always polite. Next time through I plan on making time to visit the eateries within. I'm not really into it, but they have a good variety of table games, as well as greyhound races. Love this place!

Text: I personally am not much of a gambler.  But I could be called a foodie. Mardi Gras Casino and Resort has numerous places to choose from when you're hungry. The buffet here is amazing, but not open all the time. This place has burger and fries, a good cafeteria, and even steaks and prime rib. If your gambling, this place is a no brainer. If you're just eating, you still cannot do wrong here.

Text: Service was good. Join the players club. You'll get up to $20 credit. Staff were friendly and helpful. First time being there and I'd go again. I'm not real big on going to these types of places, but I'd go again given the chance.
