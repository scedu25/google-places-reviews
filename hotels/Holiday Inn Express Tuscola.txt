Text: We had a great experience with this hotel.  The hotel is very clean and well maintained.  Rooms are extremely clean.  We were travelling  through late at night and the front desk lady was very polite and helpful.  This hotel also had a parking lot large enough for my  big pickup truck with travel trailer.
