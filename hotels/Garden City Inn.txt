Garden City Inn
Rating: 5
Text: I am a cyclist traveling across the country from coast-to-coast. While my route doesn't take me through Garden City, I had bike issues and ended up getting a ride to the city since it was the nearest place around me in Kansas with any semblance of bike parts. The owner of Garden City Inn saw me pull up as a passenger in a police pickup, with my bike in the bed of the truck, and he immediately knew the sort of situation I was in. He was willing to negotiate on a room price just a bit (it was a weekday and I was obviously in trouble), assisted in getting my bike and my stuff into the hotel, and even offered to drive me to the nearest bike shop the next morning. Not only did he actually fulfill his promise to drive me to that bike shop, but when I called him to tell him they did not have what I needed, he came back to the shop to pick me up and drive me to another store. Amazing! I've simply never received the same sort of hospitality and friendliness at any comparable hotel before. In addition, I felt like the breakfast (cereal, waffles, fruit, coffee, tea) was more than adequate considering the price and I found my room to be very clean, my bed was comfortable, and I honestly just didn't have any issues at all. There is even a pretty good Mexican restaurant right across the street. I can't recommend this hotel enough!

Text: Well located in the centre of the commercial area. You can walk to various food outlets and a liquor store. The hotel itself is clean and spacious. Breakfast is not so good, a waffle machine and cereals.

Text: I have some men staying there that work for my church. Every time they go in there I get good feedback. Thank you to the young lady who respected him and got him right into a room for a good night of rest. They are good people there.
