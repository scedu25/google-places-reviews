Text: Our experience was delightful! In fact our room was upgraded for free to a premium king bedroom suite with a gigantic hot tub! I would definitely go back! Our room was clean and the hospitality was fantastic! Everything from check-in to check-out was exceptional including our hot breakfast the next morning!

Text: The manager is probably the rudest individual I have ever spoken with. I have stayed at Holiday Inns my whole life and I am probably going to bow out and spend my points so I never have to deal with rude employees.
