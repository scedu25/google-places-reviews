Hilton Fort Wayne at the Grand Wayne Convention Center
Rating: 5
Text: The location was right in the middle of downtown Fort Wayne within walking distance of many bars, restaurants, and a riverfront trail for running! The rooms were excellent, and the staff was very accommodating. I accidentally booked a 2 doubles room instead of a king and they quickly and happily found me a new room at no additional charge. Parking was validated across the street for only $8/day and you could take your car in and out as much as you need with no fee. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.

Text: Super comfortable beds and good pillows. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was also good. Didn't eat at the hotel but did go to a restaurant within walking distance that was excellent. The staff were friendly and happy to help. I would definitely stay here again .

It is Beautiful, Cozy, and Always Cleaned Spotless! The breakfast is quite Delicious-
The shuttle drivers are AMAZING,Emily & the girls at the front desk are GREAT! The restaurant staff/ servers are professional,courteous and kind. They work really hard! Ann Marie always helps me choose the best lunch options-The girls in the coffee shop are super, super, super sweet -The General Manager is always in reach and is the epitome of excellence, as each time I return,there is a new component added to compliment the hotel. I can only say that it' is the Perfect Home Away From Home!

Text: Nice room, with lots of amenities--safe, fridge, microwave. Pool is warm but small, and it's open 5.30am to 11pm. No hot tub. Nice staff. Weird surcharges on room service. Great breakfast buffet. Convenient to Convention Center and Allen County Public Library. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, especially now that I know that the no parking signs out front mean only no long-term parking. Hotel parking is across the street. Also a little weird, but okay.
