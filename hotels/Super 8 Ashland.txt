Text: This is definitely a no frills, place to lay your head kinda place. The rooms were clean, and some what updated. The bed was very comfy and for as full as the hotel was it was pretty quite. Only word of caution, there is no elevator to second floor, so if stairs are an issue or your traveling with alot make sure you request 1st floor accommodations.

Text: I checked in at 3am , they'd rented out all the rooms that accommodates pets so they let me stay in a non pet room with my fur baby. The hostess at the front desk was very pleasant to deal with . There's a Denny's that shares the same parking lot and they're open 24 hrs . I would definitely stay here again if need be .
