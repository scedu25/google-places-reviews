Text: Stayed here with several family members recently and I was very surprised and impressed by how great the rooms were. They were better than some of the rooms at some chain hotels that we have stayed at in the past. They were clean,stocked well and decorated nicely and the bedding was clean soft and comfortable. They have recently remodeled all of the rooms and they look great! The owner and staff were very helpful and friendly.  Prices are reasonable....I highly recommend it!

Text: I was surprised to find this diamond in the rough. I think it's probably the best thing in the whole town of Rich Hill. The room was spacious,had pleasant decor and was very clean. The bedding is very comfy and he water pressure in the shower was perfect. The staff was very attentive and was among the friendliest I have encountered. I highly recommend this place and I would definitely stay there again!

Text: My wife and I decided to get away from the world and take a ride trip to reignite the flame. Starting in OR ending in FL we found ourselves along the main highway that hosts this inn. After reading the reviews we were ecstatic to find this gem and upon arrival 945pm (ish) we found a note on the window labled "night check in" or something that asked any night arrivals needing a room to call a phone number written under the instructions. We called the number and a gentleman answered explaining the prices we stated we needed a room for two. He told us he would be up there in a moment. We waited for about 20-30 mins when the gentlemen called again asking if we still needed the room. Of course we said we did. This is where the weirdness started. We started hearing noises that sounded like faint whistles and its really dark out there so I started my vehicle and pulled into the middle of the drive way. After about 10 more minutes and a test of perience... after all I have known many countrt folk and I know that they work on a different clock than us from the city... a half window or something of the sorts opens at the doorway and I immediately recognize the voice of the man on the phone. He begins to explain that they do not want to do business after 10pm at night and that we needed to go. I was astonished... we had been there since before 10pm and had waitied no less than half an hour at minimum while this man called us pretending he wasnt on the property while hiding from inside. He was very rude and seemed angry. I was at a loss of words all I could get out was "you could have just said that in the beginning" and he barked back "I know!" And seemed to become more agitated. I immediately left and have since been at a loss of words. Something weird going on out there and I promise you its not something you want go experience. Some people might have come and gone in good favor but I wonder with the way our experience went how on earth others could not have seen or experienced it before. I have screen shots of my phone records to prove the date and times. I also have never posted a review before ever and I have had some bad stays or rough experiences in the past. This one was more than that though that was definitely not something I would want someone else to walk into blindly again. I really cant emphasize the weirdness. No words for it. Stay away.
