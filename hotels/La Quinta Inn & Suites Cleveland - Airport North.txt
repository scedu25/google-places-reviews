La Quinta Inn & Suites Cleveland - Airport North
Rating: 5
Text: We had an excellent stay at La Quinta Cleveland, although there was construction being done on the building we were accommodated well. We were early for check in but they had our room ready for us, the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience. The rooms were nice and one of the best hotel beds I've ever had. The location was right next to the airport and just about a 10 minute drive to downtown Cleveland which makes it convenient for everyone. Absolutely would stay here again.

Text: Hotel is under renovation but the rooms are super nice, clean and even though there is renovation work being done the whole hotel smelled really nice. Seemed like a safe location and  located close to the Rapid Transport. Friendly staff was a plus. I definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Newly remodeled rooms, beautiful.  Some construction still going on in first floor but no real inconvenience.  Love the huge shower with glass doors and we'll lighted vanity area.

Text: The room was newly renovated. It was a great size and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was clean and quiet. The hotel itself is under construction and my low rating is because the room was just as pricey as other area hotels even though there was limited parking, no lobby area, no fitness room, etc. There was significant construction noise and dust as we came in and out of the hotel, but it was not heard or noticed from the 3rd floor where our room was.

Text: Don't be fooled by the outside. Its what's on the inside that counts. Newly renovated rooms, was a pleasant surprise. Staff very pleasant, shuttle to the airport new guy very friendly, breakfast staff very friendly. Truly enjoyed our stay. Owe and it's directly across from a RTA station for traveling downtown by train. Doesn't get any better. Good job all.
