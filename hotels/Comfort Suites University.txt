Text: This is a beautiful property.   Room with 2 queen beds is huge.   Also has a couch. Very clean and the front desk clerk is very cordial. Would highly recommend staying here and I am picky!

Text: I haven't been in the rooms lately but the overall hotel is great as it was recently remodeled. The staff is helpful in determining the best places to visit around town if your in need of suggestions. The hotel does have a pool and hot tub, the pool room is a nice mellow smell to it not over powering like some hotels. The hallways were clean as was the bathroom and elevator and lobby area. They also have a slightly over priced market place for a quick snack but let's be honest if your wanting a snack who wants to drive a couple miles to the nearest convenience store or brave Walmart ...

Text: We had fantastic service here. They did their best to make our family of 6 comfortable. The rooms were very clean. The only draw back was the breakfast spread. It was pretty carb based. Adding better sources of protein would be great!

Text: Quiet rooms, comfortable beds. Didn't try the breakfast but it looked good. Friendly staff. Definitely will stay here for my next trip to Lincoln. 10 minutes to Pinnacle arena.

Text: If you're looking for a hotel with great service - this is it!! The staff at this Comfort Suites were impeccable.  We stayed with a large group and met every morning after breakfast in the eating/lobby area.  My husband even had to have a packaged delivered and it was immediately handled with care and prompt delivery.  Housekeeping was efficient and professional.  The breakfast was delicious, albeit standard in choices.  The room itself has been slightly updated with a hardwood laminate "foyer" and the television rotates from the living area to the bedroom.  The only negatives were: the water pressure wasn't fantastic, the elevator was extremely slow, the parking lot got full (which was great for business) but it shared it's space with another hotel so that's most likely why and construction was happening (totally not the hotel's fault of course) so commuters were using the parking lot as a shortcut to avoid it.  But despite all those issues - which aren't that big of a deal - we would stay here again.
