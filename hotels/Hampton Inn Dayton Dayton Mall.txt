Hampton Inn Dayton/Dayton Mall
Rating: 3
Text: Overall, this hotel was fine. It was a bit spartan compared to other Hampton Inns we have stayed at, but since we were just there to sleep during a long road trip that was fine. The beds were comfortable. I was disappointed that there is no hot tub, there wasn't enough creamer provided with the in-room coffee maker, and the breakfast was mediocre. There was also a goldfish cracker on the bathroom floor when we arrived, which makes me suspect the overall cleanliness of the room, but I didn't see anything else amiss. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Text: Spent the night here on a recent road trip to Dayton. Arrived in the evening without a reservation but they had available rooms. The employee at the desk was not very friendly. She didn't ask if I was a AAA member. I am, and this would have saved me a few dollars. I found this out the next night when staying at a different Hampton Inn back in PA. The room was clean, and 2rhe front desk staff working the morning shift was very friendly. We also enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.

Text: Not quite up to par with most of the Hampton Inn's at which we've stayed. Reserved two queen beds, but stuck us with a king and a horribly hard pull out couch. It was better to sleep on top of couch. The pillows were small and limp, not like what were used to at a Hampton Inn.
