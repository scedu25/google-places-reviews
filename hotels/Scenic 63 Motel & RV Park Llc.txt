Text: My Aunt drives 3 hours into town for a funeral and they won't let her have a late checkout when they aren't even fully booked! This is complete BS and the lady employee is very rude! I suggest no one to stay here!

Text: In a last minute decision to stay the night in the Vienna,MO area, I called an reserved a room at the Scenic 63 Motel.  They were very nice and friendly.  The room was small, but clean.  I am planning on staying there again when fishing in the area.

Text: We were tired n wore out,with minor vehicle problems in rainy weather. In a rural area we finally come across a place to rest we thought. Rang bell for service and no one ever came to the door.  Motels should be available at any hour. Very disappointed!!
