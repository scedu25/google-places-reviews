Text: Bed & Pillows were extremely comfortable. Great night's sleep! Breakfast was excellent! Water temp and shower head was great! Loved the room layout & the amenities like a sink with paper towels outside the bathroom, sofa and coffee tables along with small eating table & desk. It was a great experience and we would highly recommend it and would most definitely stay there again!

Text: Went to visit my cousin that was in town for a ball game. As soon as I entered the building it smelled like cookies and hot chocolate and the place was very nice and clean. My cousins room was nice as well. They have a couch along with nice beds an indoor pool and gym. It was a fun visit. I would recommend it to anybody.

Text: Wonderful hotel. Stayed here an entire summer and had no major issues, and very few minor issues. Staff is lovely. They serve cookies and milk every night, and their breakfast is a fantastic hot spread including biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, pastries, pancakes, fruit, etc.
