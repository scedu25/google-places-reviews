Text: My family and i have been staying at the Skyline for 20 years. Matt and Vicky have continued the exceptional hospitality we always received from Gary and Karen. The transition of ownership has been smooth - same clean, comfortable resort we have been calling our summer retreat for years.

Matt and Vicky go out of their way to make us feel at home. - the best Hosts on the lake. 

Thanks for everything you do!
