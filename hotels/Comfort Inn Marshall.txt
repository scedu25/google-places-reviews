Text: If noise bothers you, this is not the hotel for you. I could hear the conversations of the people next door, talking at a normal level. People above me sounded like they had elephants up there. I had the unpleasant experience of staying in a room next to one of the two outdoor entrances. There are two doors, with each slam of the door, my headboard would vibrate. The room had an odd smell, not horrible, just odd. The toilet would run and run, and even at one point flushed on its own over and over.
I will not go back.

Text: Nice place, room needed a little tlc. Dusty fake plant over hot tub, and upholstered chair grimy with fingerprints. For $200 a night that is unacceptable. Be warned, private balcony is inside overlooking pool, not outside.  But overall, nice place. Good breakfast and service!

Text: This is a clean,  well taken care of hotel.  The grounds are beautiful. The manager, Drew is excellent at his job.  All the staff are friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean. The beds comfortable.  They also allow pets. It cost $35.00 a day, which was cheaper than boarding her. Nice area to walk the dog. The pool & hot tub were clean. The pool was warm & hot tub hot. Great after a stressful day. Give this hotel a chance. You won't be disappointed.
