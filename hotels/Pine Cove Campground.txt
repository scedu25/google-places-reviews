Text: Before the current owners took over the campground, Pine Cove Campground was a very different place. As you can see from a previous review it was a "stay up all night and party campground" Jim and Julie have worked tirelessly to get away from that stigma and become a more family-friendly place. They've updated bathrooms to a considerably more pleasant standard, purchased new playground equipment, and introduced more events for families and friends. Everyone is included and everyone is treated fairly. 
I have never met more kid-friendly people. Last year, the owners donated over $800 to a child in the campground that was suffering from cancer. This year, they dollar for dollar matched the winnings from a raffle and donated it to a society that directly benefited the affliction of two children in the campground. Every year, they make considerable donations of cans and monies to the local homeless shelter that feeds many families. I have never seen Jim or Julie be unkind to anyone and they are the kind of business owners that others wish they could be. 
The new owners work so hard to make Pine Cove Campground a much better place and any decisions they make can be trusted to be for the betterment of the campground. This is a great place to bring your families, to bring your friends. There is no place I would rather spend my weekends than Pine Cove.

Text: My husband and I are preparing to start our 9th season at Pine Cove.  We've had nothing but positive experiences.  Jim and Julie are professional yet family oriented, and go out of their way to ensure our camping experience is truly a home away from home.  We have no issue with signing an annual contract, because it's for our protection as well as the campground.  These people who are complaining should seek legal counsel if they feel their contract was violated, rather than jumping on social media and trashing this amazing family-run business.  Keep up the good work Jim and Julie, we love you!
