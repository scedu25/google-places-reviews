Text: This was by far the most restful nights sleep of any hotel/motel that we have ever stayed at. The beds and pillows were comfortable.  The room was clean. No noisy neighbors.  The view from the deck was awesome.  Close to restaurants and lake activities.  Will definitely stay there again.

Text: Tv is 12 inches, but didn work, tile floor everywhere had filthy grout & was really slick, be careful not to fall, they  wouldnt let you walk out the back way to the lake, because someone had fallen before and sued them, and they wanted us to sign a waiver to go out the back way. Looked like a double bed but advertised a queen, but bed was comfortable/mattress. it was a really old cabin, with a futon that had a gray wool blanket thrown over it
