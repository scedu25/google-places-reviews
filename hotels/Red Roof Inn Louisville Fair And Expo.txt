Text: All in all, we had a great experience. The day staff was very friendly. Recommended local food spots that were fantastic. Rooms are updated & clean. It was a pleasant surprise compared to seeing the outside of the building. Cleaning staff came daily & did a fantastic job. I will def stay again when coming up fo the expo nearby.

Text: Not clean and put us in a room next to a noisy industrial laundry room.  They did change our room for second night and offered a discount but what do you want, a discount or a good night's sleep? Also, pillows were rock hard.

Text: For the price it's a great room, clean quiet and updated. Only downside is no breakfast, but that is no issue, plenty of restaurants near by. Great movie channels. I'd come back here again.
