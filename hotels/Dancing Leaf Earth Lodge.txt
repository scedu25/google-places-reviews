Dancing Leaf Earth Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: We had a very enjoyable weekend here. If you want to get away from the world for a day or two, this is a great place. It's about a 4.5 hour drive from Omaha. They have small cabins or you can camp at a more reasonable price than a motel room. You can also camp in the earth lodge if you want. They have a small pond there that was dried up when we visited, but there is a reservoir very close by that you can canoe/swim/fish. You will get a good history lesson about prehistoric and the recent history of Nebraska in the area. Gas up in North Platte; there isn't a station in Wellfleet.

Text: I first went to dancing leaf earth lodge when it was located in stockville ne as a girl scout.  I ended up staying after my troop left as a volunteer . I then got the opportunity to return the following summers as a helper. I absolutely loved the time i got to spend there and the owners as well.  my name is Amy Whyte.  the teaching, the artifacts. the history was amazing to learn about.  i also got to help guild a gift shop and go on an awesome canoe  trip down medicine creek. Since then they have moved to wellfleet I had the opportunity to go there once.  It was actually an old boy scout camp that they converted to this mystical journey back in time to get a feel of what it would have been like to be a native of the plains. over all a 10 of 10.

Text: I just got back from the Dancing Leaf Lodge with a group of 4th and 5th graders from Ansley, Nebraska. It was a two hour drive for us, but it was sooooo worth it. My kids talked about what they learned almost all the way back. We got to see and touch fossils, we checked out the earth lodge (which was awesome) and then we hiked down a path to go canoeing. All great experiences and all full of information that my kids could use in their Nebraska history class. If you are looking for a good trip, I would say this is one of the best places I have ever taken a group of kids. Make the trip, it will be worth it.
