Staybridge Suites Lansing-Okemos
Rating: 4
Text: The staff will do everything you ask to make things more comfortable.  The breakfast is hot and yummy, and there is a hot dinner three nights a week.  I stayed here for two months for work, and I was hoping the room would be spotless when I arrived.  It is apparent the floors are never vacuumed.  This is a pet friendly place, which is great, but nobody wants to "live" on other peoples' pet's dirt.

Text: Very nice room and comfortable suite with pretty much everything you need for an extended stay. Dishes, hot plate, dish washer, etc. The building entrance was leaking water into buckets, but nothing too crazy - it pretty much poured rain for the entire day. I'd definitely come back for a weekend or week-long stay.

Text: Hotel was clean and the room was large and comfortable.  Breakfast was less than satisfactory.  No breakfast meat available when I was there and no regular coffee creamer.  Otherwise a good place to stay.
