Gray Ghosts Trail Inn, llc
Rating: 5
Text: This Inn was well kept and in a great location for many nearby towns including Hermann. There are four beds and two bathrooms. Two beds are up a steep flight of stairs so would not be accessible to certain elderly or disabled visitors. The kitchen has all the things we needed to cook and eat some meals. The grounds are beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed visiting from the neighbor dog, Wiley. There is a general store and restaurant/museum within walking distance (about 2 blocks).
