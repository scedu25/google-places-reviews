TownePlace Suites by Marriott Springfield
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice hotel in the Springfield area. The hotel is the Tivoli New so it is very clean and modern-looking. I love how big the rooms were and the kitchen area as well. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and the location is good. If I have said anything bad about this place I would say that their breakfast is not the best with more limited items than I would expect but overall a great place to stay.

Text: Everything was clean and the staff seemed very good on keeping up on food and bring quiet when entering and leaving. My only complaint is the walls were super thin. We could hear another group giving a presentation and they weren't being overly loud

Text: Nice, clean and trendy hotel. My family loved the breakfast. My only complaint was the road noise I could hear. Next time I will request a room away from the road.

Text: Very nice hotel. Came up from AR to shop for school. Pretty picky about where we stay. Am really happy with my husband's choice to stay here. Nice kitchenette. Would be great of traveling for business and had to share with coworker. Stores and restaurants close.
