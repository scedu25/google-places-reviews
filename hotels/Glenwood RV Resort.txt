Text: I do not recommend this camp ground at all. Looks like nobody is taking care about this place. Postures online look fine but reality was different . Pool  was looked like under construction...not ready at all for camping season. Bathrooms are super old, full of bugs and a bit stinky. Roads very dusty, on the the internet says volleyball courts but nothing there. At the time of our  stay one camping group was  super loud around 1am, not friendly person who worked there night shift said he'll take care of it but not much was done...in general not good camp ground..I do not recommend this at all. Go to can Kia instead.

Text: My family has been coming to this camp ground for over 25 years. We LOVE IT!  There is plenty of room for BIG families, lots of room for kids to run around, they have play grounds, woods to hike, and an in ground swimming pool. The people are all very nice and kind to each other.  ONLY down side is the shower/Bathrooms... They could be cleaned better. BUT i see it as not a huge deal because when your camping  you shouldn't expect a beautiful shower at your convenience... But it would make it even batter if they did.

Text: Not a bad campground, full hookups as advertised, came into campground at night, quite difficult to find the few public camping spots available , the road is a bit rough and steep, and quite far in.  Yes the water is a bit stinky, but that is the way it is in that area.  The biggest fault is that the place could use a bit of a cleanup, a lot of trailer/cabins that look as if they haven't been lived in for years, gave it a bit of an ick factor.  Otherwise a pretty and quiet campground.
