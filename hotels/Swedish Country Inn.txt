Text: The place is decent and I got to stay here for free thanks to the college, but I would never spend my money here. The rooms are hot and only half of them have windows with screens so you can't open them to cool down. The sheets are dirty and the comforters always feel disgusting. They do have a TV but its only worked 2 out of 3 times for me. There is no fridge and while there is an ice bucket I've never seen an ice machine. If you do stay here i recommend a 2 bed room or asking for room 210. Its a corner room with 3 screened windows and a decent sized bed (the bed sizes range with every room) and while you can't turn around in the shower in that room the rest of its accommodations make up for it. I've stayed here 3 times now (all free, never same room) one sometime near January, Spring Break, and June 4th. I stand by my judgment. Although there's maybe 3 hotels in the city so this might be your best or worst bet; I wouldn't know since I've only stayed here since it was free. Oh and zero plug ins, unless you unplug the clock or tv.

Text: Loved this place! Friendly staff, decent price. The rooms are so cute and furnished with Swedish-style carved wooden furniture. You can view all the rooms and choose your favorite, as they're all slightly different. There's a wonderful breakfast buffet in the morning with some American and some Swedish options: herring, lingonberry, rye crisp, etc. 
Visit the sauna downstairs for ultimate relaxation.
