Text: The personnel cleaning and doing laundry were smoking pot. The hallways wreaked from the smoke. The manager's had to of known because the laundry room was so close to the front desk. The bathroom in our room wasn't cleaned very well. Definitely won't stay there the next time I visit Springfield. Our phone in our room kept ringing and when we called the front desk they said don't answer it. We unplugged it.

Text: The night we stayed was incredibly noisy and wasn't a good experience.  But the staff was very nice!

Text: Price was ok but still pricey for a Monday night. Was given a room with stains all over the floor and believe it or not a full iron burn in the carpet. As well as had "neighbors" that were smoking marijuana and making the entire floor smell like it. Besides all that the bed was comfortable but will probably ask to view the room first before future transactions.
