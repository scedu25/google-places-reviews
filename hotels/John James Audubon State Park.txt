John James Audubon State Park
Rating: 5
Text: 9-hole golf course is great!  Very inexpensive and course was in fine condition.  Played on October 2nd, 2017.  Green were awesome shape, fairways were nice too.  Couple tee boxes chewed up but not too terribly bad, and only a few at that.

Text: Nice enough campground for staying a short time or to visit the casino.  Some spots are tight to get in to and it's now very big.  Playground but not much else to do really.  Price is decent.

Text: Very nice park, but be warned, loud, obnoxious traffic comes in and out all hours of the night. Would be nice if there was an enforced quiet time.

Text: Beautiful, tree shaded campground. Clean grounds and bathrooms. Friendly staff. However, campground is located just a few hundred feet from a noisy, busy state route. Truck noises last throughout the night topped off by dumpsters being emptied in the pre-dawn hours.

Text: Easy to find. Clean facilities. You can see businesses and hear traffic from the campground. Otherwise nice.
