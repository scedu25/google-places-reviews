Text: Incredible! We've been there twice! Wish we could go every other week! So peaceful and loved that I got to spend time with God. Jesus is amazing! So much better than a bed & breakfast!

Text: Shepherd's Gate is an amazing ministry.  My team has been two years in a row and we are all set that this will be our retreat spot from now on.  Chuck and Becka  are awesome and so is the rest of the staff.  They are there to minister when you need and discretely tucked away when you need your time alone with the Lord.  God's Presence fills the staff and the property.  It has gorgeous gardens and trails that allow you to enjoy God's beauty!  It is absolutely breathtaking!  If you need a getaway to hear from the LORD this is the place to be!

Text: Chuck and Becka Lehman truly live their lives in a way that can only be explained by God. They have set an example for me of living like Christ did and I have tried to model that lifestyle as well to those that I disciple. My life changes every time I go on a retreat at Rest-Ministries and I believe it will change others as well and provide them with a new intimacy with God and a true peace that truly passes all human understanding during lifes promised  transitions and trials.
