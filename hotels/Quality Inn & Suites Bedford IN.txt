Quality Inn & Suites Bedford IN
Rating: 4
Text: Remodeling underway (seems mostly complete) but my room on 3rd floor was clean and bedding appeared to be new (pillows were small and too soft for my liking) breakfast was average of most hotels and the pool was kept clean. Area of town seemed safe and location was close to many things. Stayed for a weeks and travel often so this is an easy 4 star rating for the value for me. I travel with my own cleaner and air freshener if that tells you anything and I can honestly say that my room was up to power. Had pizza delivered right to room and that was prompt and satisfactory as well. I'd stay here again based on this visit.

Text: Absolutely loved rose petal writing after we returned from our wedding. They were very good with service but just a few things they could improve on. Few things need fixed in the room and not soap and shampoo which is easily fixed by going to the front desk.

Text: The hotel located close to eating place, and to Walmart and AT&T store,which was very nice. We didn't have to go looking for places we needed. The room was clean, and nice. Nothing fancy. We just had a regular room. The service that I had was very good, it was the nice lady, at breakfast. Very helpful, and went out of her way to be helpful.

Text: Staff was very, very friendly and accommodating.  
Room and bathroom were nice and clean. When we first walked in the room it had a little bit of a smell like someone had smoked in it at one time, even though it was a non-smoking room. The air conditioner worked well.  It was very convenient being on the first floor as it had a patio door. 
Not a 5 star hotel, but definitely worth the price I booked online. The only downside was the outdoor pool was not functional. Kids were a little disappointed about that.
