Text: Easy app setup. Use your phone to open the doors. Although it seems to be spotty, the app does work well. The room was very clean. Breakfast in the morning was actually very good. Great service. We had a great stay.

Text: The staff was friendly, and enjoyed the welcome cookie. Nice size rooms. The hotel was cold. The pool is a 3-4 foot deep pool with a gritty bottem. The pool deck was covered in water even with only a few people in it. The water was cold. No changing rooms in the locker room just bathroom stalls. The lockers were blocked by a bench, so you had to climb over to get to the locker. No changing tables for babies.

Text: We arrived not having a reservation, and we met Bruce at the front desk. He understood are situation and helped get us the cheapest rate for both hotel and parking. He was SO kind and got us on the Hilton Honors floor AND free breakfast, even though we weren't that high up in membership. They also had a couple people impersonating Abe Lincoln. The room was large and nice, with an interesting blend of old and new. This will FOR SURE be where I am staying on a return trip to Springfield.

Text: Service was top notch. Check in was quick and easy. Room was spacious and the gym was one of the best hotel gyms I've ever worked out in. Those oatmeal walnut cookies at the front desk were delicious! I've got another training to attend in a month. I look forward to staying there again.

Text: Stayed for a conference. Easy location to reach, and very nice rooms. Pool and fitness room with new Precor equipment in the basement. Meeting rooms were nice, and the  food provided for the conference was good. The hotel is accessible to the historical downtown areas. Parking is inexpensive ($7) and connected to the hotel via a series of elevators, which are a little confusing to navigate.
