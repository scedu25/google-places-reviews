FINDLAY INN & CONFERENCE CENTER
Rating: 5
Text: Expected an "older" interior, was greeted with a fresh interior, comfortable,  spacious, relatively quiet (those football revelers ?), beyond expectation! Nice to have the lounge. Breakfast begins at 7:30a
The value is well worth the price...what a gem in NW OHIO!

Text: The staff was friendly and the room was clean. I cannot complain about the hotel, I had a nice stay. However, the restaurant's service was incredibly slow and ruined the otherwise tasty meal. Overall I would recommend the hotel, but advise going out for dinner.
