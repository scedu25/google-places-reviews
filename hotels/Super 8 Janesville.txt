Super 8 Janesville
Rating: 2
Text: beds were fairly comfortable. didn't like the fact that the queen beds only had two pillows and looked like fulls. rooms were fairly decent. The housekeeper could have done better at her job by coming by. rooms were small ,not enough for three people with luggage. Beds could be better. Pillows could me more firm. overall it the rooms could improve.

Text: Decent hotel. Clean rooms with a comfortable bed. Reasonably priced. Few cons like only receiving 3 pillows for a king size bed. Breakfast is nothing spectacular.

Text: Room was fairly comfortable and very clean. Entrance was very strange, it had a handicap ramp up to the entrance but there was still 5 or so stairs to the top that you had to walk up making it difficult with large bags. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast left something to be desired.

Text: Very accessible off 26 and 14. Was very clean, but not very quiet. All night long, doors were slamming and voices were loud in hallway. The continental breakfast left a bit to be desired. For the price we paid ($92/nite), i thought we would have more than a waffle, yogurt, bruised apples, and a stale plastic wrapped dry cinnamon bun for continental breakfast. We'll try another place next time through Janesville.

Text: This motel is just great for motorists passing through. Clean, quiet with an efficient and friendly staff. Obviously this is not a destinaion. It serves its purpose. Recommended.
