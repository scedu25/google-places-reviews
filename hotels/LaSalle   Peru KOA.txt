Text: Without question the most cared for campground we've been to. Everything was well maintained, bathrooms and showers looked brand new they were cleaned so well. Site was very nice. No problems with hook ups. Store was well stocked. Owners were extremely nice. My wife bought two bundles of wood and was given a golf cart ride back to the site! Definitely coming back!
