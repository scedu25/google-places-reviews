Text: I went here for my Outdoor Ed field trip, and it was so amazing! The camp leaders were truly helpful and amazing! The ghost story they told us about was extremely scary. Especially when we had to run back to our cabins.

The only worst part was when my friend sprained her ankle. But overall, best camping place!

Text: We've just returned from our second yearly stay LOMC and are already counting down the days to our next year stay.  A great time was had by all in our group!  The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are very well kept and the staff is extremely friendly.  I actually left my cell phone charger behind the director was kind enough to mail it back to me, which I'm grateful for.  I highly recommend this camp!!!!!

Text: I went here with a group of students from bible class. We stayed for a full 10 days in the Hogans up in the hills, but beware there are lots of mosquitos and chiggers. They'll get ya good. When we went on our bible hikes we often ventured far away from the buildings, so bring a camera and take lots of pictures. There was medical staff standing by for anyone that needed anything, but the downfall was they left at 6pm after dinner. 

Food was good, camp leaders were awesome, and I would recommend this retreat to anyone who asked
