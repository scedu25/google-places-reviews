Text: It was a good stay, with a comfy queen bed and pullout couch. A tiny shop in the lobby was nice and supplied some stuff I had accidentally left at home. My only qualm was that after house keeping came there was a lot of hair in the sink that was not there before.

Text: The overall feeling after walking in is quite settling. Modern as well. Beds and pillows were AWESOME. Only complaint is that the breakfast area could be bigger. A lot of people in a small area during breakfast hours causes for a lot of holdup and lines, with nowhere to really stand.
