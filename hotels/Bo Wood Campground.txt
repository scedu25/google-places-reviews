Text: We were here for pack the park weekend. Free camping for 3 days and scheduled activities all weekend long. It was perfect. Even with campground at capacity the sites are far enough away you have some privacy. Enjoyed K9 demo, canoeing and the live music Saturday night. Great campground. Easy lake access to the boat ramp or the Sullivan beach 3 min away. Close to the marina.
