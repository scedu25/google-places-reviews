Text: We could tell that our son was a little sponge and our current preschool just wasn't cutting it in terms of teaching him enough.  So for his second year of Pre-K I set out to find a school that would meet our standards.  I toured over 10 preschools, The Little Guppy, The Goddard, Kids R Kids, etc.  I was getting frustrated because I really liked a few of them but my friend told me that when I was in the right one, I would just know.  Walking into The Learning Lodge, I just knew this was the school for us.  We are so in love with everything about the school from the secure door, the nutritious meals, and the web cam .  Miss Holly is the best and all the staff always goes out of their way to make sure all your needs are met and you are always greeted with a smile.  Our son is already reading!!  He is learning something new daily and is always so excited to tell us about it.  Our daughter will be starting school at The Learning Lodge for the 2012-2013 school year and we are so excited to watch her learn and grow at such a wonderful school.
