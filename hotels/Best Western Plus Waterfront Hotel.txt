Best Western Plus Waterfront Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Checked into this hotel on a whim, and very late at night. The staff was polite and accommodating (they extended our check out time). Parking passes are given for a $12 fee but it's worth it, as it gives multiple in and out privileges. The view from our room was gorgeous and the bed was so comfortable. The hotel is very clean and elegant. Would stay here again.

Text: Stayed here for a night. It was good. The view of the river was really nice. Room was clean and modern. You could tell the building is older, but it's well maintained and has been updated. 

The room included breakfast, which was decent. Breakfast was buffet style with cereal, different breads and English muffins for toast, fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs, sausage, French toast, boiled eggs, make-your-own waffles, coffee, tea and juice.

Text: Comfortable and clean rooms. Beautiful view of the river. Excellent buffet breakfast included and better than most. It had a better selection and variety of items. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great for business travelers and leisure travel.

Text: Great Breakfast. Great customer service. Great waterfront view. Very close to the Tunnel to Detroit. I would definitely go back here. I just wish Downtown Windsor had more to offer.

Text: We are three women who worked together 25yrs ago and became best friends, we plan a "Girl's Get-Away" excursion every year to reconnect and just have a relaxed, fun time together, catching up.  For the last four years, we have tried to stay fairly local to where we all live because we only have a weekend and don't want to waste any time travelling to our destination........besides how many people really check out their own local area's attractions!  My son had recommended this hotel from a previous stay of his and I can't say we that we were disappointed in any way.  The location is perfect, it's close to many restaurants, the Casino, the River Boat cruise (which was excellent by the way), and the waterfront parks and boardwalk are absolutely beautiful!  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone......you won't be disappointed....we weren't!!  Go and enjoy!
