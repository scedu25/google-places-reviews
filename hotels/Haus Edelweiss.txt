Haus Edelweiss

Text: Walt and Ann are very gracious and accommodating hosts...not only do they offer a fantastic breakfast, but Walt is known to break out some wine/snacks and offer great conversation in the evenings, also....
if you like country accomodations, fresh air, a very large hot tub and just a peaceful night, this is the place to stay...we came one year, and returned recently....
Our queen bedroom upstairs was very airy, open and comfortable...hope to return again soon!
