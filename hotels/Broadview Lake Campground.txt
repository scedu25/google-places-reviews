Broadview Lake Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We absolutely love camping at Broadview. The owners have made many improvements over the last few years and I cant wait to see whats to come! Every weekend there are activities going. There is a pool, play ground, pond and camp store for campers to use. I truly enjoy coming out to our "lake house".

Text: Everything about this place was nice and loved it except for the fact the pool and general store closed at 4pm and it was very inconvenient. We brought it to the attention of the people who owned the campground and they were very rude and made a million excuses as to why they had to do it that way. If it hadnt been for this experience i would have rated them a 5 star. Very disappointed!!!
