Text: Clean and simple, no frills. Quiet location away from the city, but only minutes away from attractions. Room was small but clean, area well lit for late arrivals. Better than expected. Friendly service, and good pricing. Would stay again.

Text: Owner was friendly but not a very professional looking guy. Room was non-smoking but smelled like smoke. Water bottles were provided. The dish TV was very shake and didn't really work. Otherwise the place was nice.
