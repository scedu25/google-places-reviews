Holiday Inn Express & Suites Kingdom City
Rating: 5
Text: Bed and variety of pillows comfortable.  People at front desk very nice.  Most everyone who worked at this hotel when made eye contact would always say hello and ask how things were going.  Room was clean.  Housekeeping people were always extremely pleasant.  Breakfast was just OK.  There is a washer and dryer, which was appreciated since stayed 11 days.  Pool was inside and warm.

Text: Just 20 minutes outside Columbia, MO with a good selection of fast food and gas stations around for a quick start next day. Room was very clean, comfy, and modern. Just a bit smaller than I expected from the online pictures. Called ahead for a pet friendly room. Water is softened. Overall very good place for an overnight stay.

Text: We were on a family road trip and happened to stay at this hotel. We were so impressed! Edward (front desk staff) was very helpful and professional. Check in was easy and fast and when we got to our room, we were delighted. The beds were comfortable with a variety of pillows which was nice. Housekeeping does an excellent job and when we saw them in the morning, they greeted us with a cheery hello. On the breakfast bar we saw pancakes, biscuits and gravy, eggs, cinnamon rolls, etc. Check out was also a breeze. Excellent stay and we will return if we ever are in the area again.
