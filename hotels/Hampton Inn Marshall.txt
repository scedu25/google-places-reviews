Hampton Inn Marshall
Rating: 3
Text: First an expensive rate for an isolated location. Somehow got put in handicap accessible room. Warning: toilet is conventional commode, not ADA height. Bathtub has grab bars but floor is slippery. Two half rolls of toilet paper in bathroom. Bed had a lot of "give". Not a horrible place but for the location, the price, and compared to all other Hamptons where we stayed it was not as good. People were pleasant and place seemed clean.

Text: Well, expensive for a Hampton, moderately friendly staff. Wanted to stay for two nights but didn’t as they refused to work on the rate. Good decision, moved on a few miles and got a better rate in a different Hampton.

Text: Was very happy with the Hampton in Marshall, MI.... Extremly clean and a staff that is so friendly and helpful!  Located right off HWY, close to Firekeepers Casino and down town Marshall. Having Denny’s right in front also was a nice plus to walk over and pick up dinner. We only wish all Hamptons would invest in larger TV’s!!!!!!!!    A 30 inch TV is just not big enough.

Text: Hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The only issue? we had was at check out. I was told I could receive my receipt via email so I didn't take a paper one. We checked out on Sunday and as of Tuesday morning I have not received a receipt.

Text: It was nice. Free breakfast in morning. Beds could have been a little better but you get what you pay for.
