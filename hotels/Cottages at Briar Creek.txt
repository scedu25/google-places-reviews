Text: Great location. We walked the state park and then went to Mammoth Cave National Park. Clean and very spacious.

Text: My husband and I have been staying here with our toddler son for two weeks! AMAZING! We have spent one week in each of the cottages, and they are both comfy! The upper cottage is spacier and has an enclosed deck. It was great for letting my son run around in, and great for night time grilling! The area is quiet, and not too far from Nolin Lake Park! We are sad to be leaving on Tuesday, but will definitely be back! 
If you're in the area, or even surrounding areas, this is the perfect place to stay! The owner is amazing and kind, very friendly.
