Text: The owners were rude disrespectful seem as if racist. the rooms were Old Hippie looking spider and webs infested. They overcharged us for 2 days for 3 rooms compared to what was on the internet I will never go there again or suggest that anyone go to UGLY Motel. They didn't tell us they served breakfast. I will be contacting BBB.
