Hampton Inn & Suites Detroit-Canton
Rating: 5
Text: Nice Hampton. One of my favorite chain's from a cost/cleanliness perspective. Good location with plenty of restaurants, shopping nearby, easy access to a main highway yet far enough away that the constant groan of traffic doesn't reach the rooms. Helpful and friendly staff, great cookies.

Text: Nice hotel! it is exactly what you expect from the Hampton Inn's, they are cookie cutter in design and service. Front desk was courteous, our room was nice, only a few minor quibbles - the bottom "fitted sheets" aren't big enough, and  don't stay on the King size bed all night,  and we needed a little extra cleanup on the walls in the shower. But when we travel, we try to use Hampton's, and recommend this one!

Text: This was an excellent property especially the gentleman working the front desk. Gives incredibly polite and very helpful with our check-in directing us to the proper location as well as where the pool and breakfast was located in the morning. The room was overly clean and was very well maintained we had a fourth floor room and felt that we received exactly what we paid for. The location is excellent and easily accessible to the freeway as well as multiple restaurants and stores. Would definitely recommend it to a friend.

Text: My parents, sister, and brother in law stayed here while visiting us from out of town. They were upgraded to king suites from their original rooms upon check in. The suites were spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. Would recommend this place to other family and friends who fly in to visit us.
