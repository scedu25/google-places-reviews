Text: Charming home, charming hosts, convenient location, easy parking. Delish breakfast. But next time we'll choose an upstairs room to avoid noise on the main level.

Text: My husband and I recieved a gift certificate for Christmas. We decided to use it for our anniversary. We were pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in downtown Jeffersonville. It was quiet and relaxing. Once you walked in and shut the door it was like the busy world outside was shut out. The owners are very friendly. The rooms are very lavishly decorated but not at the expense of coziness. We had a nice selection at breakfast and it was very tasty.
