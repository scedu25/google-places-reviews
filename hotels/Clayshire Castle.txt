Text: I attended a family wedding this past weekend at Clayshire Castle and the entire experience was amazing! The grounds and castle were very clean, welcoming, quirky, and wonderful. I loved how the grounds and castle were open for exploring, so many things to see and marvel at (my favorite was the giant chess board on the property)! The hosts were great to interact with, were very friendly and accommodating, and did an excellent job at making the whole experience perfect for everyone. I definitely would recommend this Bed & Breakfast to anyone looking for something a little different, it truly is a little treasure tucked away in rural Indiana.

Text: Had my son's wedding here.  It was awesome. Lord Douglas and Lady Mary Jo are the sweetest people  anyone could met. Very kind ,understanding, and extremely helpful. They go above and beyond to make everyday special, not just the wedding day. We had stayed the night, and the breakfast was so good. They make sure you go away very full. The food is awesome, and all made from scratch. We will def be back for mini vacations in the future. Will be life long customers for sure. I highly recommend this bed and breakfast.

Text: How blessed we were to get this as a gift. Incredible experience and atmosphere!  Beautiful, impressive facility and grounds. Absolutely delightful, attentive and knowledgeable hosts. Delicious authentic homemade food, handmade costumes, fun music and dancing and then pure peace and quiet. The list could go on and on. Amazing time!!! You can clearly see these two do this just for the love they have for it and the joy they get from it! Great job Doug & Mary Jo. Thanks again for a wonderful time.

Text: I have been there one time. Our host and hostess was very warm and welcoming. Enjoyed the tour and explanations of all rooms and amenities. Took a lot of beautiful pictures. Looking forward to taking my daughter and grandbabies. The only negative would be they didn't have a stable or horses. For me that was a huge part of that time period. All in all a wonderful experience.
