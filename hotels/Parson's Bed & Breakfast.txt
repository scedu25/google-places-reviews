Text: Such a nice place. We stayed after a 20 mile hike on the Katy Trail and enjoyed the town and the house. Breakfast was great, the people were friendly, just what you want in a b and b.

Text: Historical paradise.  I love antebellum history. This mansion is full of it.  Built in the 1830's the plantation had more slaves than any other in Missouri, and you can imagine life as southern aristocracy, as it is furnished with many period antiques.  Norm, the owner knows the history and his wine collection.  Every time my wife and I stay there he has some fantastic new wine for us to try. My only complaint is that the beds are the most comfortable we have ever found along the Katy trail, and it cost me thousands of dollars buying mattresses just like them for our own home.
