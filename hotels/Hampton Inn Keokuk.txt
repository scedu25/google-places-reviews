Hampton Inn Keokuk
Rating: 5
Text: The Good: Clean, quiet, comfortable. Pretty much the only good hotel in the greater area. Walk-in shower. Staff was all very friendly and helpful. Loved that the AC was whisper quiet.

The Bad: Small bathroom. Shower needs a shelf for shampoo. The bathroom fan ran constantly with no switch to turn it off. It was fine though as it provided the white noise I wanted to fall asleep to. But would have liked to turn it off when not needed.

The Ugly: Nothing would prevent me from staying here again.

Text: Our rock club stayed there and the breakfasts the two mornings we were there was out of this world.  We needed the extra heavy breakfast for our digs for geodes.  I loved the Scrambled eggs.  Tha man bringing out all the food was very efficient.  Did not have to wait for any thing.

Text: Gotta say I love Hampton inns. Stayed for the geode festival, comfortable room to unwind. Breakfast was good for this kind of hotel. Had a small problem in my room and the front desk helped out right away.

Text: We went to Keokuk for a wedding reception. The reception started before we could check in. We called and they were gracious enough to let us check in anytime. It was after 2am, and we were able to check in without problems. Very clean rooms, comfy bed and pillows. Would highly recommend this hotel!!

Text: Excellent customer service.  The pool is small but nice.  Rooms are as advertised and  clean.  Housekeepers were amazing as well.  Decent place for a small town.
