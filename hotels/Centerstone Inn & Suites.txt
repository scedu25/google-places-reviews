Text: Great hotel. Loved that they had a kiddie pool for my young kids. I do wish the bar downstairs was actually open though and not only used for spill over from events in their party room. But still, a great hotel stay!

Text: Do not rent rooms from here. I called twice in advance and spoke with the front desk to tell them I wasn't going to be needing my rooms and they still billed me. I called to get a refund on the charges and the manager said she was uncomfortable refunding me. Their policy states that you have 24 hours. I even had screen shots of calls I had made to the hotel. I will be sure to let everyone in my network of friends know about this poor customer service.
