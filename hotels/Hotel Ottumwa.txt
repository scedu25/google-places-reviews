Hotel Ottumwa
Rating: 3
Text: The service is very friendly but the hotel is very dated.  I think with a serious renovation this place would be phenomenal.  Great location down in Ottumwa.  A minimalistic breakfast is available starting at 0500 which is convenient.  Parking was on street, in the alleys on either side of the hotel or across the street in a parking garage.

Text: I went for breakfast, food and service were alright. Nothing to write home about but the service was fast and the food wasnt bad. Pretty cheap too.

Text: The limited staff was very nice. More staff was needed to accommodate our large group. Hotel offers "well used" feel, a throw back. Rooms were comfortable.

Text: A really terrific experience!  There's a lot of history at this property and it's a beautiful building. Consuela at the front desk was very welcoming, professional,  and able to answer all of my questions at check-in.  My standard room was very comfortable and clean.  Located on the top floor (6th floor) corner with a nice view of the courthouse and town hall. 

A breakfast voucher was included making this an even greater value.  I'm overall very pleased with my stay and look forward to visiting again soon.

Text: The front desk help were very friendly. The room was amazing for being in an older landmark hotel. The diner in the hotel was excellent, waitress was very friendly. Definitely stay there again.
