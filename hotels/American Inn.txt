Text: If you're looking for a proper roach motel, this might be the place for you.  The residents, and they are residents, people actively live at this location, feels more like a halfway house than a hotel.

It's a seedy location, not the kind of place you should even consider bringing family or children to, spend a little extra money and lodge at a proper hotel.

Text: Parking sucks. Pot holes everywhere. Too much noise at night, should have quiet time hours. Stained blankets with holes in them. Bed bugs, killed 4 of them, took pics of the bugs & bites all over my arms and ankles. Decent curb appeal but that's it, at least the paint job looks good. Pull the blankets back and it's not good. Been here many times and never had any issues, but this time I'm appalled. Really sad about this because I used to like the place. Time changes everything I guess.

Text: If I can go lower I would! Been here a year and roaches. They sprayed. Falling ceiling, moved me. Now in a room with bed bugs! Been bit for two weeks, when I said something, nothing done! They don't care here, just want your cash! Sure as hell, I'm calling the right departments when I go. Great stay for a meth lab, or a prostitute camp..you will go unnoticed! Update! Got a whole weeks worth refunded and asked to leave. Well, if this does not say how shady management is, I don't know what to say. They got bugs, and if you complain, they boot you! Oh and BTW, my allergies are starting to clear slowly..black mold, roaches, and bed bugs will do that to you, but hey, american inn don't care about your health...just paychecks and tax write offs! So good luck travelers!
