Herrington Inn & Spa

Text: If you have the opportunity to have your wedding at Herrington Inn, take it!  Everything about it is fantastic!  The "Pumphouse" reception room is simply decorated and beautiful with an upstairs loft area overlooking the main floor, and windows looking over a lovely and spacious patio with a view of the river!  The food options they provide are so excellent that it was very hard for us to narrow down our choices at our tasting, which they set up to be a fantastic experience.  The inn itself is elegant and beautiful, and our honeymoon suite was absolutely incredible.  

We were particularly impressed with the entire staff, both the reception and the hotel.  They made us and all of our guests feel like royalty every time we were there.  Deanne and Rose, the event coordinators for Herrington, were especially a pleasure to work with from the very start.  They made the entire planning process so easy and stress-free for us, and they personally tended to us throughout the reception to take care of anything we needed!  

We are blown away by the level of quality service we received at Herrington and we've heard numerous times from our guests at how wonderful the evening was and how much fun everyone had.  We are forever grateful to the Herrington Inn Staff for being such a huge part of making our special day truly wonderful.  We can't wait to come back and visit!  Thank you!

Text: This is a first rate hotel. The rooms are first class. Get a room on the Fox river side which is on the east side of the hotel.
It is very close to downtown Geneva. There is a free continental breakfast. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a spa in the hotel. There is also a first class restaurant in the hotel for fine dining. Recommended.

Text: Would give less than one star if possible. We visited this Hotel to celebrate our new business being formed. We had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready. So we left to walk the town. We come back to stand in line for another 30 minutes while some very questionable guests where trying to check in. We got to over hear about how high they were and how high they were going to get later.  The wait, and experience were just terrible.

Text: Atwater's restaurant within the Herrington Inn & Spa was wonderful. Server was attentive and friendly. Quaint little restaurant with beautiful view of the river and cozy little fireplace. Food was delicious and presentation phenomenal!

Text: Absolutely amazing time. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Stayed in a junior suite and was blown away by everything the room had to offer. King 4 poster bed, giant jetted tub big enough for my 6ft frame to fully soak and the view from the walk out balcony is gorgeous. Spa treatments are kind of odd with check-in on the first floor and the actual treatments done on the second. That said, the robes are ultra soft, the massage specialist really know what they are doing and the heated floor shower room is well laid out and stocked. I can't wait to make another trip to the best hotel in Geneva, IL.
