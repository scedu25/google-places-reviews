Candlewood Suites Rockford

Text: I loved the room itself, and I loved the fact that the room had a full kitchen. However, I don't believe that the hotel uses hypoallergenic detergents / products for their bedding and / or towels. We both woke up congested, and my face and skin were irritated in the morning. The night before, I used the bath towel to clean carefully around my eyes--no makeup was worn, nor any products used to clean my face--and they were extremely red in the morning and took hours to clear up.
