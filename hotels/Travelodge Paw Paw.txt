Text: I was pleasantly surprised by the clean spacious room. Coffee in the room as well as a microwave and refrigerator. Lots of counter space in the bathroom. Tastefully decorated.

Text: Great experience. The room was very clean and comfortable.  The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again if we travel this way. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the continental breakfast, which was somewhat disappointing.

Text: Rooms are nice enough if you're into retirement home decor... Meh, at least it's clean. Staff is polite but not a big fan of the booking practice. They pretended like they're booked when there's virtually no one here to artificial drive up the price. Now I'm stuck in this place for three days because once you're booked... You're on the hook.

Text: Room was clean but the towels were thin and no wash cloths were provided. The breakfast was decent.
