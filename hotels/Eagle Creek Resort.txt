Eagle Creek Resort
Rating: 1
Text: Banquet hall and the lodge are non-existent. They closed 4 years ago and likely will never be reopened. That aside, the park has a nice campground and walking trails. The prairie is quite good and lots of butterflies and other pollinators can be spotted, along with plentiful birds. Fewer deer than at Wolf Creek State Park.

Text: Hopefully this place will be reopened soon
