Americas Best Value Inn Monroe City

Text: I can not say enough good things about my stay here! The staff was over the top friendly and helpful. Price is crazy good. PET FRIENDLY btw, and they even provide a small breakfast service in the morning. (I didn't check out the pool.) Don't let the parking lot deter you away from a great affordable room! Also, the bedding could probably be updated, but it was all clean and ready to go.

Text: Clean and great value for the price. Well taken care. Pool was still down and the breakfast area left much to be desired but you can't complain considering the overnight stay price. Very quiet area and it felt safe. No traffic noise and the storm that night was barely audible except for the odd thunderclap here in there. The upgrade to laminate floors is a must anymore I think and these folks had it. I'll be back again should I be in the area again.

Text: Not a bad place for a motel on a US Hwy. I booked online and arrived late night. The owner answered the door right away and was extremely courteous. Can't beat the price. The next time I make the trek home from Denver, I'll be looking to stay here again.
