Best Western Plus Hannaford Inn & Suites
Rating: 3
Text: Staff was nice and friendly. Breakfast was also very good. The cleanliness of my room left much to be desired. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well at all. When we pulled out the couch for my daughter it was obvious that they didn't even look or attempt to clean it.

Text: I have stayed here on business travel to Cincinnati the last 3 years.  There is no finer place.  The wonderful people that work there are happy and genuinely seem to love their jobs.  It is like staying with family.  The hotel is clean decorated nicely and the beds are truly comfortable.  Cannot say enough about the great experiences I've had at this establishment.

Text: Clean, spacious rooms, very comfortable bed, great value for the price! Well-located near several restaurants. The building is tucked behind trees and not visible from the road and the sign says Hannaford Inn rather than Best Western. I overshot and had to turn around. Not a problem though, and I loved the hotel and location.

Text: Great hotel in a great location.  10 minutes to downtown.  Large mall is 1 mile away and plenty of other restaurants nearby.  Room was updated and very nice. Will stay there again.

Text: I stayed here for a few days with my family for a short vacation and was thoroughly impressed with this hotel. I did not have high expectations and was really just looking for a place to crash each night and I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the facility. The room was larger than expected and very clean upon checking in. More than enough room for me, my wife and my three kids. The breakfast in the morning was quite good and much more than just cereal and bagels. There is a station for making fresh waffles and they had a person making omelets which was great! On Saturday and Sunday morning they also had sausages and grits (which come HIGHLY recommended, and I'm not a big fan of grits. So that should tell you something.) Again, I cannot stress of friendly and accommodating the staff was. They even gave us plates and napkins when we brought in pizza for dinner one night. I will definitely use this hotel again when I'm in the area.
