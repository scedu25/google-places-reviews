Text: Extrodanary beauty as far as the eye can see.  A beautiful piece of nature where one can go to purge the negatives and download the positives.  Replenished my soul, I call this place home.

Text: First of all, when I called for a reservation, I told the lady I had a 42ft class A. She said "no problem".  It was a freaking nightmare getting to this place.  After getting off the freeway it was 6 miles of narrow pavement with multiple, multiple sharp curves and steep hills.  The side of the road had steep drop offs only inches from the edges of the blacktop. The last half mile was a bumpy ONE LANE gravel road. She had given me a site # on the phone.  Office was closed so I went to the site.  The campground was about a 1/4 of mile down another hill and was near a river.  It was flat. The sites were partly gravel. I had NO cell service. Next morning her husband came around to collect the garbage and i told him my apprehension of driving out on the one lane gravel road when I left.  He went down the road ahead of me to make sure no one was coming the other direction.  This is NOT a place for huge rigs like mine, unless you like the thrill of ATVing in your motorhome.  I will never put myself or my $300,000 motorhome thru that ever again!

Text: Nice place right on the river. They also liaded my coolers and gear at the river after floating and drove it back to my campsite

Text: We really enjoyed our time here.  This was our first time renting a cabin and we weren't really sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised when we got there. Everything was very clean and the kitchen was furnished with a coffee maker, plates, basic pots/pans, and silverware. You will need to bring soap or buy it at the camp store. The shower is TINY but functional. The bed came with bedding and was very comfortable. There was a fire ring, camp grill, and picnic table, so we were able to cook s'mores and then go to bed in a real bed. It was great. I would highly recommend one of the cabins if a member of your party needs electricity and temperature control due to health concerns, or if you are just over sleeping on the ground and want a flush toilet.  

We also went on float trip while we were there. They offer trips down the Big Piney and the Gasconade. We did the tube float, which is only offered on the Gasconade river. I had done canoe and raft trips before, but never a tube float. I won't do the tube in late July again. The Gasconade is just too slow at that time of year. It was absolutely still in many parts of the river. Very slight breezes would blow us upstream. It took us 5 hours to go 3 miles, and that was with us using our arms to paddle most of the way. It is a BEAUTIFUL trip, but I will do a canoe next summer.
