Text: First things first, this is not a chain with big corporate bucks.  I came to town for a funeral.   I read the reviews and was hesitant to keep the reservation.  Let me first say, it's dated.  Not horrible by any means, and it was clean and comfortable.   It's not the Ritz nor Comfort Suites, but the staff was incredibly friendly, TV was not a flat screen, but had plenty of channels, beds were clean and comfortable, bathroom was average but towels were great.   There are some cosmetic issues, but if you're in the area, this hotel will do you just fine.  Some people posted pics in other reviews to make this place out to be horrible, but good customer service gives them an extra star.  We needed to check out late and it was not an issue at all.  Super manager.  Take a chance, support a local business.

Text: if you were to look in the dictionary for roach motel, this place would have an entry. There were holes in the walls, peeling wallpaper, that smell that one can't describe, furniture that was falling apart, and roaches crawling across the nightstand. If we had not been so exhausted from driving we would have asked for a refund and left. When I turned my keys in and brought up the roaches, I got told I must have carried them in with me. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else. So not worth $80 a night.

Text: Smoking rooms on the same hallway as non-smoking rooms so the hallway was smokey smelling even though I was in a non-smoking room.
