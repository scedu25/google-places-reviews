Days Inn & Suites Monroe

Text: Horrible. A bad attempt to turn a construction worker hotel into something nice. Rooms not clean, cigarette butts everywhere. House keepers smoking. Nothing good to say except new mattresses were comfortable. Were planning on staying 3 nights; stayed one and checked into the Holiday Inn Express next door for remainder of our time in Michigan.
