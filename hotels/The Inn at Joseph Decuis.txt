The Inn at Joseph Decuis
Rating: 5
Text: Wife's birthday so I chose to do a night at the Inn and dinner at Joseph Decuis. We were able to do mid week, which meant Chefs choice dinner and house to ourselves. Everything is way nice. Told my wife even though we are in luxury here, it feels like home. Inn keeper was very fun. Thank you! Breakfast was fab.

Text: Beautiful period home decorated as such but with modern kitchen and bathrooms.   Common areas including tv (no televisions in the bedrooms).  Walking distance to restaurants and lots of unique shops downtown.  Dining within a few blocks include sandwich shops, bar food, and four diamond cuisine.  A great weekend small town getaway.
