Santa's Cottages

Text: We've been coming back year after year. First off the service is impeccable. The grills are taken care of daily and the trash is emptied from the storage rooms. If you need some firewood they're happy to drive a bundle up to your cabin. It's nice to be able to cook your own meals rather than go out all the time. The kids love fishing in the stocked lake, swimming in the pool, or playing on the playground.  You're just a few minutes drive away holiday world. It's a great family location and we'll be back again.

Text: We stayed a night in cottage 2 and everything was great. The staff was friendly, the cottage was clean, and the surrounding areas were well maintained. The girls were swimming in the pool, fishing from the cottage deck, and zipping down the zip line. Next time we'll have to stay longer so we can truly enjoy it all. Highly recommended.

Text: To pricey, and the location is far fetched, and people next to it are loud and like to burn fires and we cant even keep the fish we catch, would recommend. (recommend going to the lodge)

Text: Stayed for four days/ three nights.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Wish we would have done one less day at the theme park to enjoy the cottages. Fishing, relaxing and good old family fun.  Will be back next year.
