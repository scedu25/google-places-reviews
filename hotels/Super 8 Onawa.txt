Text: 105 bucks after tax for a room that could be compared to a carpeted motel6(there was a 10 dollar pet fee for my service animal). No fitted sheets on the bed only flat so they come right off watered down coffee, dated bathrooms.  There's no other hotels around so they have a monopoly on prices I guess...not worth it.

Text: 83 bucks is to much for this hotel. I think it was rated N 8 of 10. I give it a 6.5 tops. I've been to way better hotels for less than this price. I guess tyhat excplaons the empty parking lot.
