Text: I'd have liked it better if th guy would have put us in the room with the king-size bed like he said when I called, but instead we got the tiny room by the laundry & ice room, #122 to be exact I do mean that room was small & not a good AC unit, we had to clean it b4 we could feel any anywhere cool air the bathroom was almost as big as the room, but the guy is very polite & kind
