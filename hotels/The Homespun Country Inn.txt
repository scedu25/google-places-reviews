The Homespun Country Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This place is just like going to Grandma's house. Your hosts, Dennis and Dianne help you to enjoy hospitality at its finest.
They offer guidance for planning your visit to Nappanee,             (Nap a knee) or just let you rest in the perfectly clean and quiet Victorian Country rooms. Plus in the morning, a full candlelight breakfast served each morning in the dining room. On one stay I had missed breakfast by 45 minutes or so, and they cooked for me anyway. The Homespun Country Inn B&B is by far one of the best around anywhere. JP

Text: Such a charming experience! Owners Dennis & Dianne made me feel right at home from the moment I arrived. Their hospitality and friendliness is far superior to any other place I've ever stayed in. Next time I am in Indiana I will definitely be getting in contact with them again! ?

Text: Beautiful and relaxing Inn with great inn keepers, lovely comfortable room and pleasant atmosphere. Excellent information & details on attractions in surrounding area. Wonderful place to work on picture puzzles. Inn keepers willing to make changes for guest comfort and make quests feel at home. Willing to converse with quests and to meet special diet. Comments on room view depend on a quests personal opinion. We had no problem. No reason to rush back home.
