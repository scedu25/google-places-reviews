Knights Inn Wentzville MO
Rating: 5
Text: Knights Inn / Economy Inn of Wentzville: Clean, the doors lock, run by decent folks.

Unlike the Budget Inn nearby, no drug dealers or prostitutes or criminals. The Wenztville Police / St. Charles County Sheriff drive through to make sure all is safe. 

Not fancy, yet less expensive than the slovenly Budget Inn.

Text: Met the requirements for being a hotel room. No amenities on site. Closest dining was a little more than a mile away.

Text: It was the cheapest price wise, had a fridge and microwave. Insanely fast, not to mention free Internet. (20-30 Mbps download speed) The pool had a cover over it, not in use. They are remodeling so I bet it will be great when finished. Great hospitality and room service when needed. I personally gave it 2 stars for the no pets whatsoever policy and I couldn't smoke in my room and had to go outside. Smoking outside probably for the best, but I was sad to have to have a friend watch my Lil buddy, Tuffy.
