Kalamazoo House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Every aspect of the Kalamazoo House B & B was exceptional: from the easy access and check-in, the OUTSTANDING chocolate chip cookies waiting for us each night, the right-at-home feel of the room and parlor, to the delicious made-to-order breakfast!!!

And, if there were to be a Commissioner of Hospitality in Kalamazoo, Steve Gibson would be an excellent choice.  Not only does he know and share the detailed history of their beautiful house, he seems to have abundant knowledge of the entire area.

We will definitely stay with Steve and Stephanie anytime we are in Kalamazoo.

Text: If anyone has to go to Kalamazoo this was a very nice & pleasant place to stay. The hospitality, breakfast, amenities, location were all top notch! Definitely recommend for future traveler’s. Oh. The beds. As a avid traveler there are only (2) places I have stayed & slept comfortably. This 
 was definitely one of those places. I'll be back again just for fun!

Text: My husband and I have stayed here twice for short vacations and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  The breakfasts are delicious, the rooms cute and comfortable and the location is great.  It was an easy walk to the Amtrak / transit hub and all the downtown attractions.
