Text: Not the best customer service esp. At the front desk. Great breakfast- sausage, eggs, bacon, waffles, yogurt, etc. Clean rooms. I'll return but hopefully they improve their service by then.

Text: Great location
 Staff was very nice and the rooms were comfortable, clean, and everything worked perfectly. Breakfast was great with a very nice variety, coffee could have been hotter but it was good. 
My only complaint is that the pool and hot tub area were way too cold. My kids wouldn't get in the pool, the hot tub wasn't warm let alone hot and didn't seem to be working, which is a shame because my kids were very excited to go swimming. We even planned our trip so the kids would have extra pool time.
