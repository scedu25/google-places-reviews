Tioga Suites Hotel - Chanute
Rating: 3
Text: Best of the 3 hotel options in the city of Chanute. I like it's down town with a good sports bar next door. Been her 10 times for 3 and 4 week stays. They reduce prices with the longer stay. ???1\2

Text: This place is a mess. Some of the rooms are decent, some of them are a total wreck. It's like staying at your great aunt's place. The entryway of the building is beautiful and historic, but everything else is a letdown. I guess that's what you can expect from somewhere that lets the staff live on-site. One of them was arrested for stealing and using the credit card numbers of people who stayed here. Lots of meth heads here.

Text: Well, it's vintage for sure. Was lovely downstairs. As far as the rooms go I wasn't impressed.. our bathroom was the most hideous lime green color

Text: The staff was very polite. Our bathroom was dirty when we arrived, the tub was peeling and falling apart. They did scrape the tub out next they could and put a mat down after we complained. We requested the maid come clean after we had been there a few days, but they did not. Over all, I was not impressed with hotel, if they could put some money into it and restore the building properly it would a great landmark.
