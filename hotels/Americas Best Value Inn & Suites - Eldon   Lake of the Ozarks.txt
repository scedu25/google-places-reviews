Text: My family and I stayed two nights here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was decent. About what you'd expect from any average hotel. My main and only real issue was the smell. All of the rooms had a distinct odor. At first I thought it was old smoke but it became more of a mildew type smell. Along with the smell, the rooms felt, well damp is the only word I can think of. It was as if the rooms were overly humid. Otherwise our stay was average. Overall, I probably would not stay again unless absolutely necessary.

Text: This hotel is recently refurbished so definitely don't go by old reviews. It's very nice. We have the King Jacuzzi Suite and it's awesome. It's a large room with a huge 2 person Jacuzzi, flat screen TV, fridge, microwave and cold ac. Absolutely great staff! If you're ever in Eldon definitely stay here, it's very affordable.

Text: Staff is super nice! Rooms are nice and looks like they are trying to upgrade them. Only thing I didn't like was the very firm mattress. We are smokers and the outside patio with chairs was perfect for smoking even when it was pouring down rain! No smoking inside but that's ok!

Text: I worked here. The owners cut every possible corner. The hot tub and pool haven't been properly drained and cleaned in years. I would never stay here or at any other chain owned by the Patel family.

Text: The rooms smelled horrible, and they did not have what was requested in one room, a pack n play. It was so humid and musty in the rooms that our clothing was damp. I would not recomnend this place.
