Text: I was in one of the recommend numbers the person who reviewed this hotel before me. The rooms AC was out. When I took a showers and walked to the bed my feet would be black. The place was in disrepair and seemed like a cash cow for some absent owner to me. No 24 hour service but the staff was nice and professional. I went in June and can sleep at 95 degree heat, very well myself. I will be trying a different place next year.

Text: Great price, but not a great room. It smelled old, musty, and like it had been smoked in, despite being a non-smoking room. The place looked like not much had been updated since about 1970. The shower ran completely out of hot water after just 15 minutes. The walls were warping. The WiFi password given to us did not? work, and when we contacted the office, they said they didn't know what the correct password? was. The office hours are incredibly inconvenient, too. Honestly, the place basically needs torn down and rebuilt.

Text: Overbooked our room but went above and beyond to ensure we had an even better room. Quiet. Quaint. A good place to sleep it off.

Text: It is an affordable place to stay in Carbondale.  It's certainly not luxurious, but I was comfortable and got a good night of sleep.  I'd stay there again.  It's dated, and could use some modernization, but it's kind of charming in it's own right and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

Text: Recently stayed 2 nights there. Lowest rate in town. Rooms need a little updating but it is still worth going here. The peace and quiet alone make it an excellent place to stay. The staff was very friendly.
