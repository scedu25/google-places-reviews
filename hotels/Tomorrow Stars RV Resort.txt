Text: It’s next to a freeway. But as long as you’re okay with it going into it you’ll get use to it. I can’t say the freeway noise is all that bad. For me it’s just a nice campground to stop at when cutting through.

Text: Nice roomy campground, however no cable tv and antenna couldn't pick up any stations.  We stayed 4 days but paid for a week because it was cheaper.  I believe many people live here so a lot of junk around campers.  Near 1-70 So a lot of highway noise

Text: We enjoyed our stay here very much. We especially appreciated the dog park. Full hook ups and cement pads for picnic tables was very nice. We plan to come back next year.

Text: Beautiful campground. Kid and pet friendly. Lots of activies going on. Has a swimming pool, playground, games, lake, propane, full hookups and sewer. Very friendly staff. Campsites are wide and roomy. There is a store in walking distance in case you need something. We just stayed overnight but want to come back and stay longer. Want to add that it is big rig friendly.

Text: Restrooms were clean but needed updating. Water was extremely hard. Office staff wasn't the best, in fact lied about not having a book swap location. OK for one night's stay.
