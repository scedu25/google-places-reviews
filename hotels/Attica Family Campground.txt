Attica Family Campground

Text: This campground is really here for Badlands OHV park. If you don't have machines and don't  intend to use the somewhat small but marvelously diverse trail system, this campground might not be for you. Having said that - the store is nice, showers adequate, and there are primitive through full hook up sites that are large enough to accommodate about any size rig. I camp there in a 43' 5th wheel toy hauler.

Text: Nice and quiet during the week. No shade trees near the sites, it's very dusty. But it is for the off-roaders.

Text: Awesome park lots of fun!! Bathrooms/showers are not the cleanest and the doors slam on in and out traffic, if your in a tent across or around the be prepared to be annoyed when trying to sleep.
