Text: The Northside Motel was clean, reasonably priced and a very friendly atmosphere. I would recommend staying here to anyone! Bruce took the time to make my hunting group feel like home. I plan on returning next year! Thanks Bruce!

Text: Folks this is not the Hilton.  This is a small motel in a small, remote, western Nebraska town.  If you need a place to stay while in or close to Imperial you will find the owner accommodating and friendly.  Rooms are clean, not everything is perfect but it's perfectly acceptable accommodations for a few nights or more.  We stay there while hunting and have never experienced loud groups, parties etc. Always been good groups of hunters from around the country in a freindly atmosphere.
