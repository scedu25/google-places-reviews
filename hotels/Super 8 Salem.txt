Super 8 Salem
Rating: 5
Text: One of the most exceptional hotel experiences ever! We called from the road and managed to secure their final room, a suite across from the lobby. Our daughters slept in the queen sized Murphy Bed while we had a king sized bed up in the mezanine. Great breakfast. Great service. Great experience.

Text: Exactly what we expected. Room looked clean, desk associate was friendly. Could've had a couple more towels but not a big deal. I'd happily stay here again!

Text: Nice hotel for the price. Was in the area for the eclipse, was the only place we could get a room for a decent price. Was clean and had a basic continental breakfast. Nice little town, with enough to do. Would stay again.

Text: We drove an extra 20 miles on our road trip to spend the night here based on the good reviews. We were not disappointed! 

Really clean. Like cleaner than my house will ever be. 

Suuuuuuper comfortable mattresses. I was going to try to steal one but it wouldn't fit through the door...

Really helpful staff. They were so nice and you could tell had a lot of pride in their motel. 

We happened upon a hotel coupon book at a rest area and got the room for $55. Would have paid double that, easily.

Text: Really clean! No pet fee we really appreciate that. Large vehicle parking. The beds and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Shower was perfect and towels were fluffy and big. Good breakfast. This is one of the best Super 8 we have been to. The only small negative was the morning check out girl was less then friendly but maybe she was just tired or something. The value here was great. We will be back for sure.
