Fairfield Inn by Marriott Corbin
Rating: 3
Text: The Fairfield Inn in Georgetown was better appointed. This one was laid out similarly but everything seemed to be a little on the cheaper side. This hotel might have one of the smallest indoor pools I have ever seen in a hotel. The staff were friendly and the room was clean. There was no view. It was fine for a one night stay while traveling.

Text: Typical Fairfield, clean and comfortable for a reasonable price. Right off 75, close to restaurants.

2nd stay - tub drained very slow and sink leaked.  It took 20 minutes after a 5 minute shower for the tub to drain.  No other rooms available to switch to.
