Kingman RV Park
Rating: 2
Text: Oversized gravel parking lot inside storage facility, next to some facility receiving and sending shipments all night. Took 20+ minutes each time attempting to contact someone. No facilities such as shower, laundry or restrooms. No office, no offer of receipt, no offer for wifi although they have it.
On a positive note, it was clean and neighbors kept to themselves.
Not likely to stay again.
