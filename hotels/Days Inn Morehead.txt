Text: The night shift person was very helpful in getting my room changed due to the a/c not working. However I booked for two nights. Check out after the first and checked back in for the second night as it was a different room and have been charged for e nights. Received an invoice showing refund for one night and it is now a week later and no refund to my account and the manager is not willing to help resolve. I will never stay here again.

Text: Extremely worn down place. The people in front had no idea I had a reservation and our room was not clean. Even after they "cleaned" there was blood stains on the carpet and the room smelled like cat pee. 

Steer clear of this place. There are cheaper alternatives that will suit you better unless you want to deal with clueless employees and ratchet rooms.

Text: It was clean and provided a quick place to sleep.  The staff was friendly.  Breakfast was cold cereal, toast or bagels. We got what we paid for.
