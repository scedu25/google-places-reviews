Drury Inn & Suites St. Louis Southwest
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were accurate to their pictures, staff was amazingly helpful and nice, engaging in conversation and looked like they enjoyed working their. Shower supplies were dispensed like condiments via a dispenser in shower, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The boarding was cheap and offered free breakfast and free themed dinner nights. Food was fresh and employees were happy to take dirty dishes for you and help you get on your way. Upon returning late at night to the hotel the staff greeted us saying "welcome back" and seemed to mean it. Overall the experience for price was phenomenal.

Text: I loved the fact that they provided a decent dinner and breakfast for guests. They even had alcoholic drinks for free, it was limited to 3 per guest. The beds were very comfortable and I wanted to take home the pillows they were so soft.

Text: Exceptional service! My family and I stayed a total of six days and five nights. We were slated to leave sooner but we decided to extend our stay. Every single employee that we encountered asked us about our stay and if there was anything they could do to assist us. The breakfast was superb! I especially enjoyed the 5:30 kickback. The bartender that we had was such a wonderful young lady. Her drinks were amazing. Like seriously, those drinks were amazing! Overall, I was blown away by this hotel. I had never stayed at a Drury Inn but I can say that I will always look for one when booking a hotel. I highly suggest that you all stay. It's centrally located to everything in STL. I've never written a review but I told my husband I have to do that others will consider staying at this exceptional hotel! Oh, my kids wanted to throw in that the pool was the highlight of their stay.

Text: We had a wonderful stay at this hotel while here for a seminar.  We had a small dog and our pet Mini Pig with us and they allowed her to stay at the hotel and we were forever Greatful for that! The staff was very friendly! This was by far the best Hotel I have ever stayed in ! I have never stayed at a hotel that had Free food in the evening,  even had Free drinks! Wish there was a Drury Inn near our state . If we ever come back this way we definitely will be staying in this hotel again!
