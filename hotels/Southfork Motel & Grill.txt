Southfork Motel & Grill

Text: For the most part our stay was ok for the price. Checked in for 2 nights with understanding of a possible third. When we went to secure the third night we were told they were unable to accommodate and we had to vacate the room. No compassion or understanding from the desk clerk. Can't recommend this place and will not be back.
