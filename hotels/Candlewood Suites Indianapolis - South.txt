Candlewood Suites Indianapolis - South

Text: The room and service were both no e. I didn't end up running into problems with either. I don't remember seeing anything about the hotel being an extended-stay hotel, so having a full kitchen was a pleasant surprise.

Text: Something to keep in mind: this is a newer hotel but literally in the middle of (what seemed like) farm country. We ended up not staying because we were looking to be closer to restaurants etc. That being said, the gentleman working at the desk was extremely nice and very understanding, couldn't have been nicer. Much appreciated. If you're looking for a quick place to stay off the highway, this will do just fine.

Text: Everything was clean and comfortable. The internet is absolutely horrendous, don't expect to get much done with it. Seriously, the internet is like dialup a lot of the time.The tv is pretty outdated. My room didnt have a DVD player just some chewed up wires that I'm guessing a DVD player was hooked up to? My friends said their's had one, they also said their toilet didnt work properly. Consensus seems to be overall inconsistent.

Text: For the price and type of hotel, this was a great pick. Kitchen in the room was great to have. Beds very comfy, staff welcoming, small food shop, workout equipment, all good stuff.
