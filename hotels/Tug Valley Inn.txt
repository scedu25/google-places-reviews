Text: The Good:
Stayed there for two nights while riding the Hatfield McCoy Trials.  They have A+ hospitality.  A hot breakfast was included each morning (Eggs, Bacon, Biscuit or Pancakes along with other continental items).  The Inn is remodled and looks very nice and clean, very nicely decorated rooms.  Also allowed us to park our dirt bikes & trucks in the driveway.

The Bad:
The two rooms we stayed in (#7 & #8) the beds were very uncomfortable, I can't speak about the other rooms.  Room 7 the bed was bowing in the middle so my feet were up in the air above my head. I had to sleep with my head at the footboard so i didnt feel like the blood was rushing to my head. Room 8 it had a low spot in the middle that made you roll to the middle of the bed.  If the beds were better, I would definately be back.

Text: Beautiful place. I had a wonderful stay. Kathy, the owner was wonderful. Had full use of kitchen even tho I o lying used the microwave it was nice know I could've. The room was cozy and comfortable and very spacious. WiFi was good. My only complaint is the lack of shower pressure. That's a big deal when you travel like I do. But overall I loved it and would stay many more times.
