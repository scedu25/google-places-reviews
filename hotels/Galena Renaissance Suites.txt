Text: Would come here again! Within walking distance to downtown. Clean and we went in the fall, it was decorated wonderfully. Reasonably priced. We stayed in the Golden era and were happy with that room. Homemade breakfast treats were yummy!

Text: Rooms are styled in an older fashion... But that doesn't make them any less comfortable to sleep in. Everything was spotless and I was very reassured when I inspected the room. Highly recommended.
