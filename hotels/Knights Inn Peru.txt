Knights Inn Peru

Text: The nicest knights inn I've ever stayed in! Comfortable bed, rooms were just redone. Nice bathrooms with amazing water pressure and hot water. And NO BUGS! Great price. ?

Text: The owner of this establishment is ridiculously rude. When checking in he would not look at me, and when I spoke he disregarded what I had to say and waited for my boyfriend to respond. We ended up getting a hotel some where else because this place looked less than safe, and not well looked after. We'd rather lose the money that we paid to stay here than actually spend a night here. If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would.

Text: Great hotel for the price. Clean comfortable rooms, very good showers, better than most chain hotels in this price range and even higher range. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.
