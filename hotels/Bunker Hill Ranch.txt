Text: My family has been coming here for nearly 50 years. It's a wonderful place to get away from the rush of modern life and enjoy excellent country cooking and the great outdoors. You don't have to rough it -- the cabins have private baths with hot water and window air conditioners. There's so much to explore up and down the Jacks Fork and so many great ways to make memories for a lifetime. Greg and Mary Howell are excellent caretakers. For decades, Bunker Hill was a secret getaway for members of the Missouri State Teachers Association, but now that it's open to the public, everyone can enjoy this treasure in the Ozarks.

Text: My family loves Bunker Hill. It is a wonderful, quiet get-a-way for the whole family.  As our kids were growing up, we went to Bunker Hill every summer. All the eminities of a resort without the hassles. We have made many, life-long friends at the dinner table and in the water of Bunker Hill.

Text: My wife has been going there for over 45 years, and the place hasn't changed. As the sign says, "time stands still at bunker hill ".  Every year we go back and I reconnect with my family. Far from civilization, your electronics won't work here. You'll learn how to talk to your family and friends again, and your kids will have to go outside and play!
We look forward to it every year.
