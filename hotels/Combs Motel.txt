Combs Motel
Rating: 4
Text: This motel is quaint and the owners are very nice. They went out of their way several times to make sure we were happy. The beds have quilts. The rooms are clean. It's not the Ritz, but it is very accommodating for the price. It can get loud because it's by a busy road, but well worth it.
