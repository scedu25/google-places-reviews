Text: One of the cleanest modest hotels I have had the pleasure of visiting, even the pool and hot tub were crystal clear, with towels laid out on the pool chairs for our use. Typical fast hot self serve breakfast. Nice, friendly staff. Would stay at this Marriott property again.

Text: This place has been such a blessing to us. The staff here goes above and beyond for all their guests. Very clean and close to a bunch of restaurants. Our car broke down and they were very hospitable. I have never been treated so kindly in a hotel EVER. This place is AWESOME!!!

Text: Clean Hotel. Friendly staff. Rooms are pretty basic include refrigerator. Standard hot breakfast every morning. It's in a heavily trafficked area so there's some noise from cars going by but you only hear it on occasion.
