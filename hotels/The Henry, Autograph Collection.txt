The Henry, Autograph Collection

Text: One of my favorite places to stay in the Detroit area. Very nice, well appointed rooms. Unique ambiance, every wall is covered in a variety of artwork. Gym is okay, has what you need but not much more. Restaurant (Tria) is stellar. Food is excellent, solid wine and cocktails menu. Top notch!!

Text: I attended a 2 day conference for work and was absolutely impressed by this hotel. It is absolutely gorgeous, the food was excellent, and the drinks were great with a selection of local beers to boot. As for the venue for a conference, several huge rooms held all of us comfortably, and the wait staff was awesome. The room itself was gorgeous and comfortable as well. If I ever return to Detroit, I may just only stay here.

Text: Interesting and nice place to stay with a good bar and bar food. You could walk to the mall but it's a ways. On the concierge floor is a self service wine machine with four wines you pay for with your room card. That is convenient but gets expensive.

Text: Went for a college fair, so I can only comment on the conference facilities. Quite nice and easily accessible. The decor was a bit over the top. How many bureaus does one hallway really require? Bathrooms were top notch.
