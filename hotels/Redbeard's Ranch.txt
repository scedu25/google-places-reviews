Redbeard's Ranch

Text: This place was beautiful and the owners were extremely friendly! We did their one hour trail ride, which was gorgeous. Neither myself or my boyfriend has any horseback riding experience, but they were great teachers! We had a blast and can't wait to do it again!

My only suggestion would be to fix the gravel road leading up to the ranch! It was extremely bumpy with potholes and our car bottomed out a few times while driving.

Text: They run a good clean, family-friendly campground.   Lots of open space.   Horse rides, canoes, and lots of campsites.   Clean bathrooms and hot showers.  Recommended
