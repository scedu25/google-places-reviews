Holiday Inn Express & Suites Woodhaven

Text: Spacious room. Comfy bed. Nice staff. Bit of dust on the top of the lamps, but nothing bad. Be careful with Google's directions! It will take you to the abandoned lot behind the hotel. The hotel's actual parking lot is directly behind the Best Western.

Text: How is this place getting good reviews?  Booked under a block 3 months in advance.  Showed up after wedding reception after 9pm only to find out I had to pay full room price because rooms were not all filled under block.  Could not cancel room after 6 & nothing on reservation said they could bump my rate up without notice.  Hotel certainly not worth $160 per room after taxes.  I  was treated very bad on phone by girl at desk.  The bride & groom involved were also treated badly by front desk personnel.  Manager told main office they gave me a refund but never did.  Do not set aside a block for any event & don't rent a room under any block at this place.

Text: This is our second time staying at this location and both times we’ve had great stays. The staff are very friendly. The room was super clean, the breakfast area is clean and there is the normal holiday inn breakfast fare. The coffee is actually really delicious, though!

Text: It was quiet and the internet was really good. They even had a LAN port. The sink was too small and the gym equipment was rickity.
