Best Western Paducah Inn

Text: I have a broken ankle and the staff was so good to me. They never rushed me when I was trying to shower quickly after foolishly dozing back asleep due to a hectic three day road trip. Breakfast was delicious as usual. Everything was so clean and smelled so good. I would absolutely LOVE to visit this BW again one day. Thanks to everyone there!

Text: Modern, new and nice.  Paducah has long been a stopping point for my wife and I on the way to my visit mother.  We usually stay one exit north but glad we decided to try something new.  The fragrance in the halls was overwhelming and there was no elevator but it was clean and a decent value.

Text: Staff was friendly and room was sufficient. Although there are signs everywhere saying NO PETS they let us have it cat with us for $15 per night. Breakfast was nice—waffles, oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, cereal, coffee, sausage, eggs, biscuits, gravy.

Text: The building was beautiful. Rooms were amazing! Very clean nicely decorated and the bed was heavenly. The bathroom was modern and I loved the shower. The breakfast was big and was all freshly made. Pool was just what we needed

Text: Stayed here during the 2017 eclipse. Very professional staff, understanding and helpful. We viewed eclipse from the gazebo in rear of motel, and the manager personally came out and brought eclipse glasses for anyone who needed them and brought iced bottled water for everyone, far exceeded expectations. He even set the light sensor lighting to off, so it would not come on during the eclipse, very thoughtful. The motel was at capacity for the event, but the service  level was maintained. Would definitely stay here again.
