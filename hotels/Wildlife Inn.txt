Text: It is a small place but the rooms are super clean the owner/staff are super friendly and the price is easy on the billfold. Have stayed there on a couple occasions and was impressed every time. You might find fancier or bigger but you won't find nicer or cleaner. If you want a comfortable room where you feel welcome you can't beat this hotel.

The rooms are spacious and beds are super comfortable...oh, and the pillows...!!!!!! It's around $71 after tax but absolutely worth it!!!

Text: Great place to stay, with fantastic owners that take care and pride in their rooms.  The rooms are big and clean, beds are comfy,microwave, fridge and wifi for all the rooms and my room even has an extra sink and a counter top.  I'm working in Blaine, Loup, and Garfield counties, and this is a convenient easy to find location for me.
