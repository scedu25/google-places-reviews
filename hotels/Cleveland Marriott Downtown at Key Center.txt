Cleveland Marriott Downtown at Key Center
Rating: 5
Text: I would like to give a big thank you to the Marriott at key center. As a business man who has traveled  to large cities.  The staff at Jake's restaurant  made me feel welcomed and within 15 seconds was attentive  to my needs especially Kara easley. In contrast the Hilton being closer to my venue , was not. I was not greeted , no smile. I asked to be seated for lunch. After seating, my wife and i sat for about ten minutes. The restaurant  was not busy. As I watched and even stood up as two waitresses  passed by neither one offering us as much as a glass of water. I also observed two mangers enter the room, and they as well did not greet us. So we got up and left the building. You may ask yourself, did any of the staff stop us or even say thank you for coming. No they did not. These are the true facts folks. Oh get this folks, real time, just happened. The manager of the Marriott  just stopped at my table and thanked me for coming and in conversation informed me they are getting ready to start a major renovation to modernize  the hotel. Wow a great staff and new hotel. I'll be staying at the Marriott at key center.

Text: Nothing bad about this place. Room service was very quick even during peak hours. Clean room, beautiful building. Fantastic bar and personable bartender. It's time they upgrade their tech to include streaming services as many other Marriotts have! But I'm sure that will come with time.

Text: Arrogant and rude management/ front desk staff.  Requested a check-in for Noon weeks in advance.  Had meeting at 2:30 I need to shower and change clothes.  They informed me that they were cleaning my room and it would be a 1 hour wait when I arrived at 12:30 (LIE)  At 1:30 they said the room is clean, but it was going to be another 45 min wait for a supervisor to check the room. (LIE)  I explained to them I had a meeting and I had a requested check in for 12, and they said "Requested times aren't guaranteed and it is first come first serve... Sorry.  We will call you when your room is ready"

I will never stay at this hotel again.  Absolute joke.  Bold faced Liars! Not a customer friendly hotel!

DON'T STAY HERE IF YOU ARE EXPECTING STANDARD TO GREAT SERVICE, BECAUSE YOU WONT FIND IT!

Text: This is the place to stay when you go to Cleveland. If you are going to the stadium, its nearby. If you are going to the rock n roll hall of fame,... Same deal. Aside from ease of access, they offer valet and the best breakfast ever. The room was amazing as well!
