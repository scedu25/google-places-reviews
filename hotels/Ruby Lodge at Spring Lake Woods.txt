Text: I loved my birthday get away here. It was quiet and perfect for some R and R. We had the pool to ourselves and the local coffee shop and local stores were really nice. The food was very good! I would definitely go again.

Text: The lodge is a quaint b&b with great views of the lake. It's nestled away from the street and has a beautiful wooded drive. Very scenic. Very peaceful. The owners are fantastic! Shirley makes much of the food from scratch. Would definitely stay here again!

Text: I attended a wedding here this weekend. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. The Lake House is in excellent shape and very rustic looking. Loved my stay. The only downfall at all is that it gets a little hot in the rooms.

Text: Clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced B&B. My family stayed there a few times over the past couple months, and enjoyed our visits to the property. Would definitely recommend staying here over a local hotel.

Could be difficult to find at night, so I do recommend checking in while it's still light out.
