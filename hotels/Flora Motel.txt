Flora Motel
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed for two nights at this gem of a motel while visiting with family nearby.  The staff were friendly and welcoming, the room small, but clean and comfortable.  Just exactly the quiet place we needed.  We'll stay again when we come back to the area.   I give it 5 stars.

Text: Very friendly people making sure I had a room even tho I was unsure of how long I was working in town.  Rooms are older but well kept up.  My bath room was smaller but had a tub and plenty of room for me.  Would stay here again to take advantage of the great value of $40 a night or $180 a week

Text: Cheapest accommodations in Clay county. $154/week or $580/mo. Geared toward long-term tenancy and rooms are often sold out. Micro/fridge in rooms. Wifi available. Rooms and furnishings are old but well-maintained. Clean, no bugs. Ample hot water. Non-smokers only inside or out and this is strictly enforced. At best, if you need a smoke, do so in your car or down the road.
The manager is friendly, welcoming,  and strives to meet the needs of the tenants. Very quiet and peaceful here overnight.
It is not really an issue for me, but climate control is solely on the discretion of the manager. Tenant only has control by opening or closing a window. Also, the tiny shower is not made for large people. It is barely two feet wide, smallest shower stall I have ever seen.
Overall, for the price, this place is preferred over other places for long term stays. As a vacationer or traveler looking for a stopover, if amenities are not a concern this place will work, and for those on a budget this is the place to go.
