Text: Okay, so it's not a 5 star hotel, but if you need to be in the  Creighton, NE area (Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park, for example) Stubby's is a good choice for a place to sleep.  WiFi, air conditioning,  laundry, nice rooms with comfortable beds, refrigerator, microwave and flat screen cable TV.  If you like your coffee in the morning bring a mug and Starbucks Via instant because that's the only way you're getting a good cup of coffee. And the price is quite affordable  ($60+tax).
