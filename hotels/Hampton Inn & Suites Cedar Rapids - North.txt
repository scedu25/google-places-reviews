Text: We have stayed here twice for the Weekend to Remember and this hotel is great! The rooms are spacious, updated, and clean with great rates. And the staff is always helpful and friendly. This is our go-to Cedar Rapids hotel.

Text: This hotel is great! I was put here for a work event so I wasn't expecting much. But the staff were great and the room was nice! The staff even went above and beyond for my roommate and I because we didn't have a fridge in our room and they got one for us!

Text: Everyrhing was fine but the breakfast. The "fresh fruit" was slimy, there were rock hard biscuits and western omelet egg something. It has the usual waffle and muffins but nothing great.
