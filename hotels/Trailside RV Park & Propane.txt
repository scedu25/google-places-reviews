Trailside RV Park & Propane
Rating: 2
Text: A bit noisy, it's next to the freeway.

Internet varies from D (spotty, inconsistent) to F (simply not there.) I'm writing this review while sitting at the park, my internet is through my phone.

Angela, the owner, thinks having a parking space reserved for the two days a week she's actually here is more important than giving her customers good service. There's open spaces all over the place, but the spaces with the best internet are reserved for her trailer and her car. And she doesn't even live here, she has a house nearby.

There are hot showers available for free, so that's something. Ad her employees are nice. They're not actually allowed to do anything, but they're nice.

Text: Horrible experience. Owner wouldn't let our kids swim because she was in the pool. Dirty little campground with much needed upgrades on everything. Tight spaces to get into. Not worth the money . Go up the road to the KOA for a much better experience!

Text: The nightly rate is too high for this aged and somewhat dilapidated park. Old tires, a huge broken sign, and an assorted pile of wood certainly did nothing to add to the state of the grounds.

Text: Friendly service. But when we booked our 6 week stay they forgot to mention that they were closing down our side (west) of the campground during the last week we planned on staying here. (First week of November) 
The west side of the property is under different city code and does not have sewer. Though they bring a honey truck around to empty your tanks 3xs per week. That is, until the first week of November. Just plan your trip accordingly.
