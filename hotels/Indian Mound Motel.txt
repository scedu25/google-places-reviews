Indian Mound Motel

Text: Place is quiet and nice. Small things like telephone not working, and the washroom knob was not proper made me walk to the office couple of times. But the people were friendly. They fixed those immediately. I stayed an hour past the check out time and they were fine with it. Beds are comfortable. No breakfast provided.
