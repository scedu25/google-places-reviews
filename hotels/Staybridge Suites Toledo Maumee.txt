Staybridge Suites Toledo Maumee
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed in a spacious two-bedroom suite and loved it. Suite had a kitchen with full size fridge and microwave. Rooms had huge, comfortable beds. Tons of shops at the mall next door. The lovely and moving Fallen Timbers battlefield memorial was also just across the street, perfect for a walk or run.

Text: Room was nice and clean and had a nice set up. I had to hang out in the room for most of a day and ended up telling my wife that I could have lived there for awhile probably. The free breakfast was pretty good too.

Text: The hotel was near a large shopping outlet to which I found vary convenient. The rooms were clean. The employees were welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was also pretty good. The pool is a bit small and the hot tub a bit too cool, but I think that makes the pool house kid friendly.

Text: Great place to spend a night. This was our second visit. I enjoy that the mall is nearby and you can have a nice meal within a short walking distance.

Text: After losing power in Michigan, we decided to take our kids down and stay at the Staybridge, it was important for us to have a kitchen so this matched our needs very well. We were so happy to pull into the hotel, the location was amazing, having most anything we could want to check out, so close. The rooms were amazing, updated, clean, and filled with little things that we might need, my favorite was the laundry basket, I've stayed in many hotels with laundry facilities, but never one that had laundry baskets! It gave us a homey feel. The beds were amazingly comfortable and BIG, and the pillows were better than the ones I have at home. We found out we got our power on the first night and would not need the second night, and getting them to cancel the next night was as simple as calling the front desk. Amanda was amazing, I asked if we could have a few more towels and she LITERALLY ran to get them for us. We have already decided we will be making trips to this hotel every year for a little wind down session! Thank you so much for making our stay as comfortable as possible!
