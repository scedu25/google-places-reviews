Camp Sequoia

Text: Very nice campground. Spots are spacious. We have a 46' and have plenty of room for both vehicles. The only drawback is they have no sewer connections. They offer free tanks or you can pay $20 weekly for a service to take care of it. 30 & 50 amp service. Power seems to be good so far. Lots of activities for children like pools & playgrounds. Very quiet considering the place is completely full.

Text: Stayed in the group camping area to the left of the entrance...very clean park, quiet, and has a pool. (Not heated though). Nice kitchen and dining facility that our group used. Looks like the majority of the campers to the right of the entrance are semi permanent so not sure what that side has to offer (i didn't venture over to that side).
