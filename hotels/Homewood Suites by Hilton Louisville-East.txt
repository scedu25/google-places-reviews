Text: Beautiful hotel. Lobby is very modern and elegant. First impression here is spot on. The room was very cozy and quiet. I think there is a good level of soundproofing in the walls, ceiling, and floor, as I didn't hear a thing from any adjacent rooms. Where this place stumbles is the breakfast and dinner option. Food is is very minimal and spartan. I get the impression here that the management is trying to keep a tight budget. For a Thursday night they had chicken fingers on... a hot dog bun with a tiny green salad selection. Friday's breakfast was equally underwhelming. Also the food serving area is extremely dark, it almost feels like a cave. On the other hand, staff were very warm and friendly. I would stay here again for the quality of the hotel room alone.

Text: Beautiful hotel with kitchenette & very easy, close access to a bottle store for wine or Scotch just next door to Lucky's Grocery which is actually one of the finest, quality grocery stores I have ever visited.
