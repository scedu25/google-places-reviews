Text: One thing the owners are extremely nice they make you feel welcome and they are very accommodating. If you need anything brought to your room they are on top of it.
Overall nice place to stay.

Text: It is an all around decent hotel the location is okay although lights would be appreciated but that's a city issue not a hotel issue till people die there like at holiday Inn or whatever it's called now

Text: We were in town yesterday for hillbilly days to see Chris Stapleton. We found most places were booked full Alpine inn and suites did have a room. We arrived the man at desk was very friendly and helpful we paid $72 for a double queen room, number 209 upon entering the room we noticed that they had a trashcan collecting water that was leaking in through the roof,then the bathroom ceiling was leaking and caving in as well. We said wth it's only one night,so we went to the concert and returned after went to get into bed and bed bugs were on the beds,blankets,and pillows. We left went to the office the man came to the room showed him the bugs and he did refund our money so five stars for the staff one star for the room.

Text: I stay at this motel a few times a year, it has friendly owners and convenient to pikeville and prestonsburg. 2 days ago when I woke up there was a roach on my pillow. The blanket under the bed spread had crusty white stuff on it but the sheets were clean. I checked for bed bugs very well when I checked in and I didn't see any when I lifted the mattress. Even with the negatives mentioned it's the best hotel for the value.
