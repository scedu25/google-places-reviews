Text: I feel like this place makes too much money not to have better amenties... though the crowd makes the stay unpleasant even more. My room is a 6/10... after cleaning the carpets, walls, shower curtains, bathroom and desantazing everything. Its more of you pay for what you get in this day and age... $60 nightly or $300 weekly
