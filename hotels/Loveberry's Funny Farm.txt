Text: It's a great place for the family. Have a lot of activities for the kids. It's a great place for a weekend getaway with the kids. Has a snack shack with great food, ice cream and has reasonable prices. The owners are really great people. Can't ask for better. We really love it especially the kids.

Text: Spent the weekend here,  ALOT of activities for the kids.   The restrooms were clean,  however, the showers are small.   While I feel like there needs to be more showers, there was always plenty of hot water.   I will definitely be back again.
