Text: My family and I just got home from tent camping here for a week and it was wonderful!  This is our second stay at this campground and we will definitely be back!  Our camp host, Kevin was fantastic!  The bathrooms and showers are kept up on.

Text: The campsite was clean and flat, and the tent area was empty, at least on the night we were there. However, the latrine was smellable from at least three tent sites away. Also, the Union Pacific railroad runs nearby, and trains go through at least once every half hour, whistles blasting. Sleep may not be easy, but you don't really have to worry about quiet hours in the camp.

Text: Lot of area really close to the river, with a good shaded campground. The only real downside is the trains that run at night can be a bit noisy.
