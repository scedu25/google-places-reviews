Text: We read all the bad reviews before staying here. So we were a bit  skeptical. But our stay was NOTHING like the terrible reviews said. For the price it's completely worth it. You can't beat having  a hot shower a clean room and sheets Internet , tv and a roof over your head for the night. The staff was great and Our bed was comfortable and we were happy with our stay and won't hesitate to stay here again.

Text: Not too bad for the price I guess. The bed was WAY too hard but my biggest complaint is the entry hall smelled like old, old sweat and mouse droppings. The room didn't smell too bad once you got the AC going, just stale. Like I said, not too bad for the price.  The water was hot and the sheets were clean...my two biggest reasons for staying.

Text: This place is a dump. Rooms are dated with extremely thin walls. No maid service because personal items were left out? Where else are you supposed to put them? Dead flies and dirty room upon arrival. At least the staff were pleasant.
