Sunrise Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Loved our room!! It must be one of the newly renovated ones because it was super cute with such charm. The only non renovated area was the bathroom, but it served its purpose. Really conveniently located to the Arc. We saved $10 in parking by walking. They provided us a good simple breakfast--bagels, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit cups, Danish, biscuits, and coffee.  The only con was the noise level. Since it is right near the highway you can hear traffic in the background. Wasn't terribly disturbing to us, but if you're noise sensitive, keep it in mind.

Text: Overall my experience at the Sunrise Inn was very pleasant. Staff were nice and accommodating. The facility appears in the process of a much needed updating. 
'Breakfast' consists of simple quick cold items such as breakfast cereals, yogurt and cups of fruit. But considering the price, everything was ok.

Text: Across the street from The Ark Encounter. Location is wonderful, great proximity to I-75. Large room with King-sized bed and large corner desk. Small bathroom. If you're just wanting a place to rest and sleep it's great for that. If you're looking for fancy you won't find it here. We'll likely be back when we visit the Ark again. Many restaurants close by.

Text: We stayed here two nights so we could go to the Ark Encounter. If you like to walk it's a short walk to to Ark parking lot. The room was clean, beds firm and tho close to I-75 it's pretty quiet. The breakfast was spartan, but had enough to satisfy. Staff very friendly and helpful.

Text: Well, we certainly did not have one of the renovated rooms! ?  First impression took a while because the door was stuck. Got inside and settled in for bed and realized no clock. ? Was gonna call the front desk for a wake up call and..... no phone. ? Hard beds and room needs a lot of help. ? On the good side - nice staff and breakfast. ? Average price.
