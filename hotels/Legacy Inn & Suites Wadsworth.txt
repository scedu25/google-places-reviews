Text: Unfortunately,  this was the only hotel a couple weeks ago that allowed me to stay for five days. (First week of August 2017) While there it was know for hookers and heroin.  I would never recommend. Door locks changed every day and my first room was not cleaned and both rooms 105 & 303 had a terrible smell. $55 was a good price but not worth the 7 police attending 3 separate visits in such a short time (between 5pm - 11pm). Very dangerous hotel!

Text: While inexpensive, I really can't recommend this motel unless you can't afford anything else. The rooms should probably have been demoed and remodeled a decade ago. The staff is wonderful and friendly, and great but the rooms are not great.

Text: Not very friendly staff. We heard a very loud bang on the door. It was this woman with a very angry look on her face, she then yelled at my mother to shut my little brother up ( he has autism.) Or we would be thrown out of the hotel. My mom told the woman that my little brother has autism and that we would try to keep him quiet. She then started calling him names like "retarded" and such. My mother being upset yelled at her that we would just leave and get our money back. We took it up with the front desk and they said they would not give us our money back. P.s. we never got our money back and the woman was a part of their staff her role is unknown to me. P.p.s we called up their and they cussed my grandfather out for no reason.

Text: Non smoking rooms real of smoke. We paid for a non smoking room due to my sons asthma and he coughed all night. They stayed that they cannot guarantee their wifi and that is unacceptable in this day and age. They should not have it listed on their amenities if they cannot on fact get a signal 90 get from their office. Would never stay there again. 

Also to note they have stray cats everywhere.
