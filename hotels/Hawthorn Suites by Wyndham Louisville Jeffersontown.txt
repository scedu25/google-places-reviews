Text: There wasn't any one terrible aspect, but it wasn't a great stay.  I remove one star for each of the following: 1, at check in, when the staff had questions about my payment they were a bit condescending.  2, the bug running across the floor in our room wasn't welcome.  3, the walls were so thin I woke up several times to our neighbors speaking at a normal indoor volume.

Text: I spent 2 days here....and i found our rooms were very very clean... i was a little surprised cause it was my first time there im always a bit skeptical about hotels... Additionally the service from the front desk attendant to the dining room and maintenance team they were all very friendly and courteous.

Text: Rooms are nice and clean, very modern feel and cozy. All rooms are either queen bed, or queen and pull out. The complementary dinner is okay: not the best or worst. Overall would recommend.
