Holiday Inn Express O'Neill

Text: Great hotel for its location and nearby area. Rooms were roomy, clean, and slept great. Only wish room televisions were larger; hard to watch even laying down. Fitness room is great, full up to date aerobic machines, resistance bands, free weights, exercise balls. However, the room is fairly cramped and limits use of the full hand weight set. Staff were very friendly and helpful, would definitely stay here again as a first choice.

Text: Staff was friendly, the carpet near the A/C in the room was moist. The suite we stayed in was a little dated, but some of the furniture is up to date. Microwave, wet bar, and mini fridge were fantastic amenities though.

Text: Clean comfortable lodging, quite and peaceful. Some minor improvements could be made. Seen some patched areas in bathroom wall that needed painted and one of the lights in the hallway by the north entrance was filled with dead bugs.

Text: This was a fine place for a quick overnight stay.  The room decor was ok, some of the carpet was torn & frayed and there was some black staining in the tub, not sure if someone cleaned an engine in there or what, didn't investigate any further. The breakfast was standard hotel breakfast.
