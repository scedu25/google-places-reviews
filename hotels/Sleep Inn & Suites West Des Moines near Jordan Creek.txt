Text: Perfect location, meaning easy to get to off freeway & not too noisey surprisingly. Easy check in, beautiful new clean clean rooms! Big TV, comfort height toilets, plenty of towels. Small little area where you can purchase a pizza & bake it yourself, purchase a beer, soda, & even ice cream! First I've ever seen such offered motel. Breakfast was hot and everything fresh!

Text: Our football team stayed here last weekend.  20 12 year old boys!  Staff was very understanding and kind.  Breakfast was very good and facility was beautiful!  Everything was immaculate!  Manager let us come back Sunday after we had checked out and use the conference room for lunch and to hang out between games.  They went above and beyond our expectations.  We will be back ( If they will have us ?).

Text: My husband and I stayed here as a rest point between Kansas City, Mo and  Chicago, Illinois. We stayed here on our way to Chicago and again on our way home. The staff was great, the room was comfortable and clean. They also had a very nice breakfast included. Fresh waffles, eggs, potatoes, pastries ect. I highly recommend this hotel.
