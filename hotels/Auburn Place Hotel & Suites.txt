Each night from 8-9pm they serve milk and cookies. There's pool tables, foosball, arcade games, indoor pool & hot tub among many other amenities.

Text: As s former events planner, I am highly impressed with this beautiful hotel and the gracious staff.  Breakfast was a full hot meal, and the ambiance, we'll, it's a #10!  Great place to stay, at a reasonable price, and I highly recommend it, and will stay here again when in the area.

Text: I was pretty please. Always forget this place is here. Beds/rooms were very comfortable and the inside common areas have a unique look/feel. Wish the hotel kept the lobbies cooler (seemed hot), but at least you can crank the temp down in your own room.

Text: The rooms aren't anything special but that's ok, they were clean & had everything we needed. But this hotel is really nice, we had several rooms after a wedding and we all enjoyed the pool and hot tub.  There is a nice little gaming room with pool tables & foosball, not many hotels have that anymore.  Plenty of places to hang out in the common area which we did until after midnight. Free breakfast the next morning with plenty of options.

Text: Love this motel.  Always stay here when we are in town.  Great service.  The lady at the desk named Su always remembers our name.  We always get to stay in one of their suites.  They have one that is 2 room that they charge the same price of the other suites.  Very nice.  Free breakfast.  Fee WiFi.  Will always stay here.
