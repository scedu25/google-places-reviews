Text: Hollis is so wonderful. It's beautiful, affordable, and they are very laid back and easy to work with. We hosted our rehearsal dinner here at the Lodge and it was perfect. All  of our guests loved it and want to come back! Hollis is this perfect hidden gem, I highly recommend it for whatever event you are planning.

Text: Hollis is a hidden treasure in the Kansas City area. If you are looking for a place to get away from the daily grind and crazy days Hollis is the place. It is also excellent for small to mid-sized business teams who need a work place to focus and plan.

Text: I am also working on my Eagle Scout project here. Grown up around this place since I was little. My troop and church have used the facility more than enough to know that it is the best place to come and relax!!!

Text: I am an Eagle Scout from a troop that uses this place frequently. I like the Hollis Renewal Center so much, that I wanted to help it improve. At the main lodge there was an old brick patio that was falling apart, so for my Eagle Service Project, I Replaced the old patio with a brand new one. This place is very nice, and everyone should have a chance to visit.
