Fort Rapids Indoor Waterpark Resort
Rating: 3
Text: I used to go every Thursday in the summers when I was in day care, the water park area was nice but the chlorine was too strong, we always had to bring our own towels because there wasn't a lot provided by the resort. Waiting in the line to get in took like 10-15 minutes, but of course now its closed due too an electrical fire which gave poor ventilation around the resort, bed bugs, roaches, house centipedes, and not so clean water and fire hazards, they say they plan to fix it back up and open it up again, I hope they do but I don't think I'd ever stay in the hotel part, this place was a Western version of Coco Keys. I've been to both water resorts and they are the exact same basically, water bucket, toilet slide and all.

Text: This one star rating does NOT COUNT! Why won't a construction crew repir all the broken stuff and make it new with a diffrent hotel name.

Text: They lost my reservation that was prepaid online. Not only that they had made us sit their for about an hour to look for it. They finally had found it but by then we were put into a bad mood. Their had also been rumored that there was bead bugs in the hotel. Overall it was an disaster and I am glad they closed down.
