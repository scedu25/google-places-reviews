Text: Do not rent or buy from this place. They make promises they have no intention of fulfilling and if you complain they will evict you. They let pedophiles move in by having someone else put the app in their name.

Text: Went to ask about purchasing a trailer for me and my husband.  The people in the management office were rude.  The woman that seemed to be in charge implied thirty ways from Sunday that me and my husband might be felons and only talked about the cheap really run down trailers...until i mentioned my husband was a lawyer and i used to work for the IRS. Then it was a major change in attitude and look at these big nice trailers. She also kept emphasizing how some dog breeds just weren't allowed because of reasons.  Me and my husband rescue dogs of all types.  In the end I left disappointed because i had been hoping to secure my grandma's trailer but not from a park that treated perspective people so crappy.

Text: Liberty Farm in Valparaiso IN. I don't even know where to begin. My husband and I have had nothing but problems since day one. For starters,  our lot rent is so high, and gets raised every year and nothing ever changes. It looks more and more like a run down trailer park with garbage all over the place, blowing into the pond. So many deep pot holes, weeds taking over the pond, run down trailers full of green mold, light posts laying on the ground with exposed wires, ext. Would you want to pay $564 a month to look at that? Ontop of the horrible manager and other officials that could care less about our issues.  I'm constantly getting lied to, and harassed. Certain people in the community are getting bs tickets smacked on their cars and doors, while others are not. I am constantly having issues with it. I have family/guests over to visit or so forth and at 4pm they're getting tickets put on their windshield about parking? What is that? The manager has her friends and family driving around in the company truck and golf cart without uniforms on going on everyones property, issuing these tickets when there is so many other things that should be getting done, she sits at home and hides while her crew is out harassing people in the community. Every time you call or email, never get a response.  If I go up to speak to her, I get answers like "you're lucky you even caught me here." Or "I don't know, that's above my pay grade." She uses her "authority " to intimidate people who PAY TO LIVE HERE! She can continue to send her friends and daughters around who don't work there,  to harass people in our community and we'll continue to call the cops and file complaints. You can't do to 1 and not to all. We are tired of it as a community, and we are going to come together to take action! No matter what it takes! Stay clear from this establishment.  All I keep hearing is how they  "apologise for the management lieing" when I threaten to leave, I was told "I can sell your home on the streets for more then what you paid for it " it's disturbing what we go through here. Typical trailer park management,  deffinetly learned our lesson. Should have listened to all the reviews on the internet. I am going to try one last time to contact cooperate  and file a complaint.  Next is a lawyer.

Text: This place is alright... for the first year. Rent was alright until years two and three. They constantly raise your rates and claim it convince to the highway. Truth is, with poor insulation on these trailers, your heating and gas is well over 200 per month if you keep your house at 67°  
Staff is alright, but you might wait awhile to get anything done or fixed. They say it's because they have to get approval but at the same time i have to go without and receive no discounts or even a letter apologizing for waiting 3 months to get a washer. For being so big you'd assume they could atleast take care of their renters. 
I wouldn't go back here or recommend to move in here. Defiantly don't buy here. At very least rent a trailer for a year to get on your feet and get out of there. Much better places and just as convienent elsewhere in town.
