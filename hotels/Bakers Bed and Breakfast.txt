Bakers Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here for three nights and absolutely loved it. Karen has a beautiful home and is a great host. Breakfast was amazing! The home was clean, spacious, and easy to get to. There are two rooms and we had the king room. I really loved staying here and will do so again when visiting family in the area.
