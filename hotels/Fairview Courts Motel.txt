Text: This place is worse than sleeping in your car. The door had been kicked in and they pieced the door jam back together. There we dead bugs under tables. Windows had spiders and dead bugs on them. The toilet set was broke. The tub had something stained all over it. The phone was so caked with black build up you could not touch it. The bathroom door had a hole in the middle that was covered with duck tape. Someone had been smoking dope in it and left their unfinished funny cig under the tv table. The little frig was unplugged and when we looked in it the smell was disgusting. The owner ran around in his pj's and smelled of body odor. The comforter had holes burned in it. There were long black hairs in the bed. We had room 200 and had it for 20 mins and were told no refunds. This place should be condemed. Going to contact the city not letting this go with a review.

Text: Worst experience ever! He checked us in while wearing his pajamas, he gave us a room that had no curtains and smelled. When I told him about the room he gave us the room (directly next door to the previous room) that had cigarette burns all over the comforter, the shower looked like a prison cell, the room had spider webs in the corners, and it smelled like the previous people who resided there. Don't stay there! He also does not return your money! He says that it's not his fault and that he returns the money, when we checked the card, nothing! If you have a choice to spend $50 on a room here, or $80 at a better hotel, spend the extra $30 to save yourself the hassle of dealing with this guy and these terrible rooms!
