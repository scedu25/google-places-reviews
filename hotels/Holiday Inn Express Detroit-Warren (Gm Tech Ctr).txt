Holiday Inn Express Detroit-Warren (Gm Tech Ctr)
Rating: 3
Text: We were in town for a wedding and this was a great location.  We checked in and our room smelled of strong cleaning chemicals so we asked to be moved into another room in which the manager was very sorry and put us into another room right away. The new room smelled of cigarette smoke and we do not smoke. We just decided to stay in it anyway because we were in a hurry to get to the wedding. The entire staff was very friendly and the free breakfast was awesome. It looks like they just did a quick make over of the hotel to make it look nicer.

Text: Room was spacious, clean, and well apportioned. Bathroom was on the small side, but I was there alone, so it wasn't a big deal. Rooms were quiet (never heard the ice machine, even though I was right next to it). Friendly staff. Breakfast was typical for a Holiday Inn Express.

Text: This is a great value.  The room is fresh and clean.  The breakfast is much more than stale muffins and coffee.  It includes eggs and sausage and good coffee.

The price is very reasonable and the location is convenient.

Text: This place was a delight to visit! Ms Ashlee at the front desk was super courteous and let us get to our room early. After a 12 hour drive, that was really appreciated! She also let us enjoy the complimentary breakfast that morning. The breakfast bar was somewhat cramped but had a delicious and wide selection of food! For a holiday inn, I was expecting... Much Less. Had an awesome experience. Also want to give Ms Artrese a high approval as she worked tirelessly to keeping that breakfast bar stocked and tidy! Awesome visit. They say the bar for all other holiday inn visits in the future!!
