Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Airport
Rating: 4
Text: It's always clean, and the staff is very cordial. The airport noise is busy, but they provide earplugs. The bar is a fun atmosphere. I have not been very pleased with restaurant within the Crown Plaza. The food is not worth the cost. There are much better options within a short drive of the hotel.

Text: I bring a group of students to Indy each year for a convention. These accommodations were great! We had plenty of towels, indoor pool, meeting areas for the students and an overall great atmosphere. The only complaint I would have is that there was no fridge or microwave in the room. Available upon request but not standard. Overall a great experience.

Text: The hotel is clean and comfy but a little bit outdated. The door between the rooms is thin allowing a lot of noise. But the bed and pillows are nice and the staff is wonderful. It's a fine choices if you need something by the airport.

Text: Even though it's located near the airport, the planes were barely audible and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were nice and clean. The only issue was that for the television channels offered, the ones that weren't HD looked like they were being shown on a very old CRT television. They were not very clear, and the image was wavering. Overall a great stay though.

Text: This place used to be great but now its just average. It's right in the Landing zone for the Indianapolis airport so there are constant jets flying over. The hotel is decent but not anything to write home about. They can't do anything about the aircraft flying over but they do the best they can.
