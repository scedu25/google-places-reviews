Suite Dreams Hotel

Text: The pool looks beautiful. The staff are wonderful. But I had a double bed smoking room and the carpets are very badly stained. The toliet paper roll and holder came out of the wall when I went to use it. Couldn't plug the tub drain lots of areas in the room peeling. But bed sheets were clean and looked like it was vaccumed and I couldn't find any bugs. But for 100 dollars not worth it.I think I will go to super 8 for 55 dollars. Live and learn.

Text: Had my sons 12 yr birthday party and rented 6 rooms. The room is older, but clean. The common space with the pool is awesome. The boys could swim and play without worry. The staff is very nice and helpful.

Text: Jeff took good care of us. The woman who was tending breakfast asked if we needed more of anything, (even though it was time to shut it down. Some other hotel staff will treat you as though you need to get out :))

Text: Perfect family spot!!!
We love, love, love the indoor pool. It's in the middle of the rooms and the entire area is quite relaxing. We brought our 4 kids (ages 4-13) for a one night mini-vacation and we couldn't be happier with our stay! The breakfast had something for all of our picky eaters, which was SO wonderful. The rooms were very clean, and the beds!! We all slept like rocks! It was perfect for our budget and the staff was so friendly!!! We will be back, this might be our new favorite place!
