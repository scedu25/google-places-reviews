Text: Had to change rooms 4 times because all the rooms was dirty. The 4th room was also nasty but we decided to settle because we was tired of moving. The property was sketchy and the lobby smelled bad just like the rooms.

Text: It's dry...but that's all it is...everything else is a dump.  No cable no electric outlets no flooring no phone no clock not even a Bible or even a do not disturb sign
