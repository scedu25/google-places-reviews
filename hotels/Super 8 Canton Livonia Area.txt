Text: You get what you pay for.  Very well used dated furniture, desk chair was scarred and had seen better days. Curtain rod on shower was only partially screwed in to the wall. Bathtub was super slippery. VERY thin walls and early riser children is the halls could be heard vividly in our room. The couple (?) enjoying their stay on our arrival night could also be vividly heard when you walked down the hallway. Pillows were somewhat flat and they had no extras to help with the issue, "they were out." Double room was very small yet the AC on high didn't cool the room, I can't imagine what the 3rd floor would feel like in August as it was overly hot to sleep and stuffy feeling in May. Breakfast had only waffles or oatmeal packets as a hot option. Only one waffle iron with broken handles made for quite a long wait. "Juice" tasted horrible and was more like "orange flavored drink."  Had to go upstairs and bring our dirty towels down to trade in for clean ones because we wanted to take a shower in the morning, though we each took one when we got there the evening before, because we had sweated so much overnight. I have never paid to stay in a hotel and then been made to feel I couldn't be trusted with towels before.  The good? It was cheap and the beds were comfortable other than the pillow issue.

Text: They were homely and accommodating.  They respected my privacy.  
There was a 'situation' in my room; while I was out at work, the staff politely brought it to my attention.

Text: This is a 1 star hotel at best in my opinion. Breakfast is available but it's not as good as the McDonald's or the dinner next door. Call and reserve a king for a night, Sleep in a twin.... I'm impressed. Free WiFi, right, if you use your phone, good luck connecting a console to the WiFi for use. I think it's intentional, and unfair. So if you want to play games bring your own internet, or a tablet you can watch Netflix for free. Password is guest. Just pull around back and u don't even have to pay. I rate my experience as 2 star generously for the simple fact that the beds and rooms are not bug infested and there's no overpowering smoke smell. My apologies for my disorganized thoughts this place impressed me enough to write a review, not a good one.
