Staybridge Suites Davenport

Text: Great staff, great rooms. We had been staying at the Ramada right down the road (don’t stay there, disgusting) when I called the Staybridge and asked if we could check In early to get out of the Ramada. They accommodated us and got us in FOUR hours before normal check in. Fantastic staff, all very friendly. The rooms feel like home and the beds are wonderful. I spend my life living out of hotels, and highly recommend this one.

Text: This hotel is great looking inside and out. Good breakfast and happy hour. Room was clean but had a slight smell of indian food all week. Not bad but just enough to annoy me. Also dishes and microwave weren't very clean. Just seems to be a pattern with the housekeeping's attention to detail. Overall I had a good experience, just have had better at other StayBridge locations.

Text: Pretty decent for the price. They were almost entirely booked and we still got a room, since the girl at the front desk was willing to look through her overloaded system and make sure we were taken care of. When we arrived I learned that their system wasn't working, but you couldn't tell, because of how professionally she handled it.
