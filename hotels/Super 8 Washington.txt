Text: Great staff. Room was clean and well taken care of. Bathroom looked great. And the breakfast was amazing. Eggs and toast, biscuits and gravy, waffle maker, apple and orange juice, etc. JUst a wonderful spread.

Text: Great staff, nice accommodations. Although breakfast is included selection is pretty limited, and the wifi was absolutely horrid while we were there. Washington also lacks Uber or Lyft coverage, so be aware of that when booking a place for this location if you don't have a car.
