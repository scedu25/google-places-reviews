Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Toledo North
Rating: 4
Text: The location is off the highway near a racing Speedway. The room was clean. The heater is a little weird because there's no actual temperature setting just high or low. The remote control only has up and down buttons no numbers. The staff was pleasant and they actually had hot items for breakfast like eggs, sausage and a waffle station.

Text: Upon arriving the staff was very friendly and was sure to explain all available amenities. I received my key card and proceeded to my room, only to find that the bed was not made, dirty towels were piled on the bathroom floor and trash was on top of the microwave. I returned to the front desk, explained the situation and was given another room, along with a sincere apology...this next room was nice and clean. 
I saw someone mention noise in another review. I agree, this location has much to be desired. There is some sort of car racing track next door, a train nearby and the view out of the back of the hotel is of a semi loading dock, complete with graffiti.

Text: I thought I had booked a room with one bed and a pull out couch for my adult son who was traveling with me.  I apparently hadn't. The front desk put us in a suite to accommodate the situation. I was very grateful   Very nicely kept hotel. I travel a lot.  It's totally non smoking.

Text: Wonderful stay.  Very quiet.  The only drawback is the proxcimity of resaurants/bars -nothing within walking distance.
