Text: This place is disgusting!!! One look at the bathroom and I wanted my money back right away. I would have rather went and paid the extra $10 -$20 somewhere else. Don't know if they give refunds but I will post once I find out. A Pilot or Loves would be a better place for a shower. The hall smelled of urine and loud (weed/marijuana), it was dirty like they have no cleaning service or people don't know how to use garbage cans to throw trash away. When we got to the room there was nothing in it remotely comfortable. We don't even trust the bed and I have the strongest feeling we'll hear mice tonight if we stay. No microwave, coffee pot, or mini fridge. Everything is outdated and barely working, like the light in the room didn't even have a lamp shade. This place is pathetic! Highly disappointed. My husband checked the receipt and there are no refunds. I wouldn't have even have given this place a half of a star let alone one. I hope this prevents anyone from making the mistake we did. Hopefully the Motel 6 across the street is better than this place for tomorrow and I'm so grateful I told him one night. The manager had the nerve to get mad at the maid for lack of cleanliness when it was beyond her reach. Not only that he looked at my husband and I like we were crazy because we found the place despicable compared to the other guests who obviously didn't know any better or were just grateful not to be homeless. The laundry room has several signs saying use at your own risk and after using it I could see why. Our clothes came out dirtier than they were before. This place is a disaster and I would recommend a some work or tear it down and start from scratch.

Text: Me and my husband had the worst experience at this horrible place. We arrived on a Friday evening to only one set of towels and never received towels for our our whole stay which was Friday to Sunday. They continuously gave us a run around about the towels then got rude when we asked for the only two face towels she could find on Sunday being our last day and when I asked for the owner he was not there of course. We also had no remote to the tv and paid extra for a microwave that was in the lobby not our room. Just a horrible experience!

Text: The first room they gave me was not even cleaned. The bed was not made and there was garbage on the floor. The second wasn't much better but at least someone made the bed and change the sheets. Absolutely disgusting.
