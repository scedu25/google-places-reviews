Text: The location is really nice, it's very close to grocery stores and Jordan Creek mall. The rooms are very similar to a studio apartment. The TV's are a little small and the kitchen isn't anything special. Overall it's above average.

Text: will give no stars .... My husband recently stayed there while working out of state and he had 1500 come up missing. When he told the company they said they aren't reliable for his money being stolen. 1. They never offered a safe and 2. We was told by corporate that the cleaning personnel are not allowed to go through ones belongings but in order to find the money he had stashed they did just that but nothing is going to be done to anyone for his loss. 
If I could rate this motel honestly it would be a negative 10. Only reason they got one star was because you can't post without one.

Text: If you want a hotel that offers no breakfast, doesn't clean your room, expects you to take out your own trash and get your own clean towels and charges just the same or more than a hotel that actually takes care of its customers...then this is the place for you. The only reason I give 2 stars is because the bed was comfortable.

Text: Not perfect but really nice.  The bathroom is large and allows for more than one person at a time. The kitchette has all you need for a long stay. Bed is comfortable.
