Baymont Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We blocked rooms for my son's wedding. The staff was extremely helpful and polite, Parseh during the day and Angel during the night who handled all of the room arrangements. The hotel is simple and and clean. It used to be the Heritage and is now a Baymont franchise which came with many improvements including the pool being completely redone, a breakfast room, new TVs and a lobby computer. The staff was helpful and accommodating with our plans for handing our Welcome Bags, an after reception party in the breakfast room and also our additional food for our guests in the morning.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is either travelling or wants to block rooms for a wedding in town.

Text: If I could give this a 0 I would. The worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Rooms are so dirty and we had no air when it was 95. They said they couldn't do anything but give us a fan. The man at the front desk said the Manager would call us later... we found out he was the manager and lied to us. DO NOT stay here.

Text: The service was good but the room was dirty. I found old food under the bed. The sheets had stains and the whole place smelt like weed as well. Would not recommended
