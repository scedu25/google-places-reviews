Text: Changed name to Sunset. They attract unsavory "residents". The one maintenance man and his man lady lookin girlfriend are known thiefs, and meth heads. Uncomfortable, broken beds, ice machine broken down. Breakfast sucked.

Text: Had to change rooms, heater not working, no heat.  New room's heater was all or none, no control of heat.  Dresser drawer broken and hanging off.  Morning coffee was all gone.  When asked for new, was shown the full decaf.  No coffee cups, no waffle syrup, no milk.  New owners as of one week ago, have tons of work and training to address.
