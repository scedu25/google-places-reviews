Holiday Inn Express & Suites Charleston NW - Cross Lanes
Rating: 5
Text: This is my second time staying here, and I've been equally impressed on both occasions. The hotel looks and feels clean and new. The front desk staff are friendly and accommodating (including helping with a few specific requests from traveling with two small children). The rooms are furnished well, breakfast is sufficient, and the price is reasonable. The pool was an enjoyable temperature (cool, but not freezing like many other hotel pools). I wish that every hotel I stayed in was as enjoyable as this one.

Text: Very nice hotel, but the carpet in the rooms needs to be steam cleaned- my bare feet or socks got visibly dirty pretty quickly. Linens and towels are nice and clean though!

Text: The location was fairly easy to get to with lots of restaurant choices nearby. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The rooms were clean, quiet, and spacious with all the amenities. Breakfast the next morning was busy and the staff was trying to accommodate as best she could. The food was good and fresh. I did not check out the pool, but they did have an indoor pool.
