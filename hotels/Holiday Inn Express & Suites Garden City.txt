Holiday Inn Express & Suites Garden City
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed here for 12 consecutive nights as part of a work trip. The room was very nice, modern and clean. Thse staff was very nice. The breakfast is superb and the cinnamon rolls are great. The only reason for a 4 start and not 5 is that I had perpetual problems with my room key opening the door to my room. It was fixed promptly but was a problem that should not have existed.

Text: Friendly staff, nice rooms. Not great for extended stays. But a good hotel despite that. Breakfast isn't bad considering it's free. Good location too. Just a few minutes away from about everything in Garden City.

Text: This Holiday Inn is exactly the reason I choose to exclusively stay at this chain of hotels when I travel. Super clean, friendly people, good breakfast, super hot water and quiet. Nice job to the staff here. Would not stay anywhere else.
