Text: Me and my family have been camping here for about 2 years and we love it. Everyone is friendly, it's clean and family friendly. Has a nice little lake/pond with nice fish and a swimming area. Also plenty of woods and trails to walk through. Love the events they have and they always do their best to make sure the kids have stuff to do and they always make sure the kids have good play equipment.
