Super 8 Pekin/Peoria Area

Text: Our company reserved 4 rooms for 2 months. On the second week, one of the rooms had bed bugs we complained and they change us rooms.
On the following Monday when we checked in , they told us that one of the guys in our group was put on the no rent list by the manager Kitty Patterson. I talk to her and she was really rude and told us that we had brought the bed bugs. I asked for a phone number of the owner or HQ and she refused to give it to me. Our company spends about $80.000
dollars a year on hotels, most of that money on Super 8 motels. The way we were treated I don't think we're going to be staying in super 8 motels anymore.
