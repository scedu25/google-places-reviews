Text: I'm convinced this is one of the loveliest spots on the planet! It certainly has benefited from nature but the Alexanders obvious loving care and attention to detail are the icing on the cake. My husband and I were there for two nights, had the place to ourselves and were enchanted. We had the larger of the two cabins, it was comfortable, cozy and thoughtfully appointed. As noted in another review, the bath facilities are not attached but are close and hotel quality. IF I was going to give anything less than 5 stars, it would be for that. But the whole package is just so wonderful, I could live with it.

This would be an ideal place for a family gathering. There are ample recreational facilities on the property: a wonderful pond, horseshoes, campfire ring, fishing or boating (canoes provided) on Oil Creek with access to the Ohio River. But for those who just want to get away for some peace and quiet, this is the kind of place where the hardest part is deciding whether to sit on the front or back porch. We will definitely be back!
