Text: Great experience! Staff very friendly and helpful. Nice rooms and facilities. I really enjoyed my visit. We came to view the total solar eclipse and the staff had eclipse glasses and tshirts for purchase. We watched in the parking lot and enjoyed this amazing experience. I highly recommend this hotel.

Text: Great place to stay.  Breakfast was included.  The room was extra roomy with a sitting area plenty of seating without sitting on the beds.  The fridge and microwave were perfect for restaurant leftovers.  The staff was super competent and very sweet.  Indoor pool and spa, an added plus.?

Text: This is a bit of an older hotel the interior is not great. The room is a yellow beige with a horrible 70s esque rug carpet. It was pretty spendy for a HII especially in NE. I'm glad I was staying here for business this is definitely not as nice as the HII in York or Hastings

Text: Worst customer experience I have ever encountered.  Amy the GM is unprofessional. I have noticed Tricia has mispoke about trying to accommodate me. I had the flu the following week when I was staying again in Grand Island and was forced to stay or pay a night and was charged $144 even though I never stayed. I called to ask to move it to Tuesday night from Monday night and was told  "NO". I went as far as to call the rewards hotline after I never recieved a call back from the GM. They even called her and she still was rude about it. Never give them your credit card.

Text: Biker friendly.  Suggested I park my motorcycle under the front awning because of the impending rain.  Clean rooms and ample breakfast.
