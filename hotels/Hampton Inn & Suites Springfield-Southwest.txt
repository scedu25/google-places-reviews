Text: I was there for a week for work. Location is near many restaurants. The rooms are clean. There was a typical hotel breakfast spread every morning, and in the afternoons they had a social hour with food, wine and beer. Service staff was friendly.

Text: My room was average. The mattress was on/in a platform and your legs hit the platform each time you sat down or got up. The room was clean. They had the amenities you'd expect. Their soap collection was great. Bar was very casual. Some signs of wear. Complimentary Breakfast was good. You could walk most places downtown Springfield.
