Ramada Columbus Hotel and Conference Center

Text: We stayed here specifically because of the pool. It was a super cute kiddie wading pool complete with a pirate ship and low key water slides. The water appeared yellow, but upon further investigation, the pool itself just seems to be yellowed. The whole area of the pool could use some touch up. There were lots of bugs in the pool area. I didn't swim, but my kids loved it. 

We were there midweek and the place was completely dead. 

But for conferences this hotel is set up very well. The rooms were clean and the staff was very nice. 

The prices on Expedia seem a little more than the prices posted at the hotel itself. I've felt like I've gotten better value for the price (especially mid week) at other hotels but I still had a pleasant experience here. I just wish they had suites with sofa beds, but they don't. It was a bit of a squeeze for our family of four.

Text: The newly remodeled conference center was very clean, comfortable and inviting. The area was designed to accommodate large events comfortably while providing easily segregated areas for more intimate occasions. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The conference room has multiple entrances, allowing easy access from the lobby, guest rooms or parking lot.
