Text: The  rooms were very nice and clean, staff was friendly, and breakfast was great! They even gave us "happy bags" for the road which included a water, granola bar, a little breakfast loaf, and a piece of fruit. Will definitely stay again!

Text: Family visit with kids. Super friendly staff. Room/hotel were in new condition. The kids liked the pool (don't forget floats for little ones). You can definitely hear noises outside of your room during the night (toilet flushing, people in the hallway, etc.). Breakfast is free but you get what you pay for ;) (it's the normal Cereal, waffles, and a few hot choices). They do give a few discounts at local restaurants when you stay here so make sure to ask!

Text: We stayed at this hotel on our way up to Michigan. It was so nice and clean that I had to stay again on the way back home. I love Hampton Inns, but this is one of my favs. The staff is so nice and friendly!

Text: Went here for a training conference on a Monday evening. Front desk reception was very polite and helpful even offering cookies and water although I was not a guest at the hotel. The lobby and dining areas were very well taken care of and numerous people seemed to be taking advantage of the space. Grounds are clean and manicured. I would be happy to stay at this hotel based on what I saw in my short time there.
