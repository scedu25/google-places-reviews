Airliner Motel

Text: This hotel was NASTY! We stayed here for a family reunion and were greeted by a dirty room, with hair and mold all over the bathroom, a strange vomit smell wafting through the air, and some scary people at the restaurant. I felt unsafe and dirty the entire trip. Never stay here!!!
