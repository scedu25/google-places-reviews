Text: Very nice Hotel.  We were there for a wedding. We got upgraded from a King bed to a 2 king bed room. The room was really nice. They have a small bar and snack area. Hotel staff all very nice.

Text: We stayed here for a family wedding. The facility is very clean and well maintained. The staff was very helpful and accommodating (especially when asked to keep the bar open later). High marks!

Text: The facilities at the Courtyard Marriott in Brighton are excellent--very clean and modern.  The staff members have all been exceptionally professional.  We ordered drinks and dinner to eat in our room (because we have our dog with us).  The drinks were prepared perfectly.  We could have had dinner in the dining/bar  area by the entrance, where besides dinner, you may also purchase breakfast items.  Our room was furnished with fridge and coffee-maker . The room is decorated in a mid-century modern decor which is very pleasing.  The bed is very comfortable--there are two different types of pillows--one firmer, one softer. Because Courtyard Marriott allows dogs (at $75 for our two night stay), they have "doggy bag" dispensers by all the doors so guests can clean-up after their pets. There are covered trash containers on the outside of the doors--all very convenient.

Text: Excellent stay. Older Courtyard but well kept. I would likely stay there again if in the area.
