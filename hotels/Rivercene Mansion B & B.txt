Text: My mom planned this trip for my two Aunts, sister and myself.  We take a lot of trips together but this has got to be one of the best ones.  We stayed on the third floor for two nights, and the house is absolutely beautiful . The walls are just saturated with so much history,  and the owners are full of knowledge regarding that history, and love to share it with you.  The food was wonderful and the home was so clean and well decorated.  I just can't say enough good.  We had such a great time we have already reserved those same rooms in December.  Can't wait to see what the Christmas decor looks like.  Thank you for everything.

Text: My mom planned a birthday trip for me with my sister mom and 2 aunts. We stayed at Rivercene for 2 nights and I must say it was the highlight of my trip. The house is beautiful.  The owners were so fun and so knowledgeable about the history of the home and the family who built it. I could have listened to the stories all night.  It is so evident how much the owners truly love the house in the way it is lovingly being restored.the food was awesome. Rooms  clean and comfortable. I cant say enough good things about it. We loved it so much we have already booked our next stay. I highly recommend you check them out.

Text: Fantastic food!  Home beautifully decorated. Host's are entertaining if you needed that. 
We have returned three times.  Secluded and haunted?  We think so.

Text: The new owners went above and beyond expectations!  Fifteen years after our first visit, we had a wonderful anniversary stay, and were thrilled at how this house is being cared for and renovated.  The breakfast was excellent, and far more than we could eat.  We will definitely not be waiting another 15 before we go back again!
