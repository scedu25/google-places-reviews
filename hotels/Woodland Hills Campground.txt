Text: Giving it 1 only because there is nothing lower! If you are planning an overnight visit DO NOT choose this camp ground (not a camp ground per se, more like a run down mobile home park) NO REGISTRATION, NO ONE THERE to check you in and show you where your supposed campsite might be (not a campsite it's a spot in their yard with an electrical pole and you need a 100 foot water hose if you want water as promised.) I've left 2 messages for them to call me back 1 the day we arrived looking for our site, we ended up having to go somewhere else went back after 3 and still no one there!!! I have not heard back from them but they took my money!!!! DO NOT SEND THEM ANY MONEY FOR THIS DUMP!!!
