Text: Nice, clean rooms. Conveniently located off I57 North and south. Too bad the mom and pop diner just steps away from hotel is closed, the food was decent.

Text: The dirtiest place I have ever stayed and there was no hot water and most uncourtiest Indian man charging $69.95 with no breakfast. Beds were having bugs.

Text: The room was ok for 50 a night.  Clean. Management was a saint.  Guess previous complaining made an impact.  Would go back.

Text: This place is a joke. The guy was so rude. From the outside it looked like I might not make it back home after staying. There was black ice on the road and the guy shut his door in my face and told me he didn't want me to stay there. Pretty sure he is a racist.
