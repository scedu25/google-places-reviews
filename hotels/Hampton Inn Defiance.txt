Hampton Inn Defiance
Rating: 4
Text: I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn for business and I had a wonderful experience with the stay and staff. The women who I encountered at the front desk (I only remember Cindi's name) were so incredibly sweet. Breakfast had a good variety and was very well kept and clean in the space. My room was well put together and the sheets were definitely cleaned very recently. I know that part sounds silly but in the last month I've known 7 people to get bedbugs at several hotels so I was a little worried.

Text: The rooms were very nice, and customer service was good. The only thing to change would be breakfast. It was lacking and a few things were dry and hard.
