Text: Room looks decent. It's clean! Bad smell when we first came into the room. Pool was awful...green, no pool lights. Wouldn't let my daughter swim in it. Hot tub was out of order. Breakfast was lacking...out of a some of the food, but the coffee was good!

Text: Bathroom and shower was dirty, I had to clean it before I could use it. The lady who checked us in was really nice and everything else was decent enough other than the bathroom and shower which was filthy.
