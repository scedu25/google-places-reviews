Text: The hotel is very dated and had odors in some of the rooms. The good thing is the pool and gym was 24 hours. What made me give them one star was based on a our toilet being clogged. My husband called it in and went down to the gym. I came back to the room there was a knock at the door I opened it and a gentlemen said someone called about a toilet and tried to hand me a plunger. I gave him a awkward look and he sat it in the corner and left. I went to the gym got my husband and he plunged the toilet. I know it's not a huge thing but I thought we were guest and I would never have someone pay and PLUNGE

Text: Wonderful! Got a spa tub room and it even had a shower. Just beautiful. Bed was very comfortable with pillow top. Breakfast was great: hot eggs and ham, bagels, waffles, Greek yogurt, chocolate muffins.

Text: Honestly, without a doubt the worst Comfort inn I've ever seen!  Dirty rooms, in need of major maintenance, very loud. And for Pete's sake, a couple of sheets for a bed cover isn't cutting it guy's.

Text: When you pull up it looks like a beautiful lodge. Inside the foyer the look continues, but this seems to be where the good ends. The desk clerk wasn't there. I rang the bell and no one came. Finally I called the hotel and the desk clerk answered. Someone else walking out said they had the same problem. The rooms are outdated. My smoke alarm started beeping, I went to the front desk and waited in line for help. When I got up to the desk, the clerk told me to wait until she checked in people behind me.
