Text: Kinda weird setup. Called several times before arrival. No one answers phone. Motel has a very small bar attached. Front desk lady was bartender too. There's a door between desk and bar. I understand a small motel setup. You have to do this to keep doors open. An answering machine would be nice to leave a message. Rooms were not cleanest. Old tissues on floor by night stand. But all in all they were very friendly and for a small town it was ok.
