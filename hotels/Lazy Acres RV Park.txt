Text: This RV park provides a personal touch from check in and throughout your stay. Wonderful hosts and facilities. So many things for children to do. Our children couldn't wait to get out of the vehicle to begin playing. I highly recommend including this park in your travels.

Text: Very friendly @ check in. Guided us to our huge site with pull through. Sewer water and electric layed out well and easy set up
Level gravel site. A bit dusty but it was extremely windy. We will stay here again. Dust is why its a 4. Really wanted to make it a 5.

Text: When we exited the highway and saw the park sign, we figured we'd be hearing a lot of traffic noise. But we were pleasantly surprised how quiet it was. We had a FHU site at the back of the park that was a really long pullthrough. The owners are delightful. It's a very nice park for families - lots of grass, a pond for fishing, and activities for the kiddos. But we didn't feel like we were being overrun by kids like we have in other family-friendly parks. As we were leaving, we had a problem with a jack not retracting and had to inform the office that we were stuck. The owner offered to get a pry bar and between him and my husband, they were able to fix our problem and we were on our way. Enjoy your stay!
