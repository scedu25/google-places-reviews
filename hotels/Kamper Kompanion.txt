Text: Having never been to the area, we were pleasantly surprised.  We arrived after 7pm and had called ahead to let the park know but was assured that it would not be a problem.  We were greeted by Cindy who checked us in and led us to our site and also invited to their weekly pot luck get together.  Everybody was so friendly.  I would highly recommend this park if you're in the area.  The facilities looked updated and newer...well kept and clean.  Very convenient location off I55.  Top notch in my book.

Text: Pleasant stay. Great WI-FI & phone signal strength. Campground is flat with mostly stone sites. 30 & 50 amp service, water & sewer @ each site. TV reception poor but hey we are camping so who watches TV?. Near Historic Rte 66 & several museums.
