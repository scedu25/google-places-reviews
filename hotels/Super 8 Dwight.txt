Text: The hotel was decent. The comforter on the bed was made of the exact same material as the curtains. It was scratchy and it was, frankly, strange. The bathroom was incredibly small, however, for the price, it was fine. There weren't any other issues, and the rooms were clean.

Text: Service was great but room was the worst I've ever stayed in. Smelled like smoke. Bathroom consisted of a tiny shower with a dirty curtain and a toilet. Sink was next to the bed but hand towels were back inside the bathroom above the toilet. Big gash in the sheet rock. Burn holes in the blankets. Only reason I have 2 stars instead of zero was the nice staff.

Text: Quiet clean budget friendly hotel. No elevator for second floor. Close to restaurants and Route 66.

Text: David at front desk was pleasant.  Possible fire code violation in hallway.  Between room 111 and 113.  Emergency light on ceiling had exposed wiring and a damaged socket or bulb.  Needs immediate attention.  Room 120 was fair.  Electric socket next to heater was pulled.  Coffee maker was ancient...Did not use it....  No reason to return here.

Text: Perfectly acceptable motel for stopping when one is tired from driving. It's nothing fancy, but it is clean and comfortable.
