Text: When I stay here I always take my own tissue and hair dryer since they aren't furnished.  This time they gave me a room with a sit down shower.
Very nice!

Text: I wish I would have found somewhere else. It looked pretty nice from the interstate. The sink was broken, the towels hurt my body to dry off, the fake bamboo flooring was squishy probably because they laid it over old carpet. There was supposed to be coffee at 7am, and the front desk wasn't even open at 7:15.

Text: I did not stay and glad that I didn't. Smelled weird very dirty and no one there. The night auditor wouldn't even take my corporate card so I drove another hour and found a really nice hotel at the same price. Don't bother stopping here and in my opinion this Motel 6 should be closed down.

Text: This hotel was so dirty. They must never wash the Duvets/ comforters on the bed. The 1st room I went into had more srains on the bed than I could count, urine on the toilet seat actually food and crumbs on the desk. The bed was made but it looked as if someone had just walked out of the room. The second room was not as filthy however the shower had hair all over the walls and the non smoking room had cigarette burns in the bed covers. There was puke on the floor in the stairwell. And the front desk closes at night. It's neXt to a Road Ranger truck stop for truck drivers there's plenty of parking . There are a few places to get food.  But this hotel is Pretty much a stop only if you can't make it any farther
