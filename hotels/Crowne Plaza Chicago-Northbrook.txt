Text: Talk about attention to detail, check.  They do their best to accommodate your needs and make your stay comfortable.  This is my second time staying here and I returned because the service and the establishment was better than I anticipated.  The hotel is $$$ pricy so get prepared to spend a higher then average rate for your stay.

Text: It was easy to find and to get to. The room was clean and everything was in good order and not run down. All service interaction was nice and as expected.

Text: Service: (1 out of 5) - Spoke with hotel staff about shuttle from airport and waited an hour with multiple Crown Plaza Northbrook shuttles passing by us. When we arrived the manager, Rob - who attempts to sound like he cares - tried to convince us it was our fault. Once we were finally able to check in, we received a room that was already occupied, then received a bad set of keys to our room, all requiring three trips to the front desk. Just an unprofessional experience all around.

Room/Amenities: (3 out of 5) - About what you'd expect from a budget "airport" hotel. Decor could use a good refresh, especially dark brown carpets that visually shrinks the room and hallways. Shower was good.
