Wyndham Garden Warsaw

Text: Loved the hotel. Coffee in the lobby, water and fridge in the rooms. Soft pillows and great soaps (shower gel and bar soap) and well scented lotion. Friendly staff. Comfortable bed.

Text: Had a professional event at the 2nd floor atrium. Good amount of space and decent food. Good location but hard to exit hotel with left turn.

Text: I would give this hotel a zero if possible.  Worst place to stay in Warsaw and maybe Indiana.  I had small roach type insects in first room.  Thinking it was isolated, I returned again on business and had a bed bug crawl out of the bedding in second room.  Disgusting.  Horrible restaurant with poor service to match.  Never returning here again!  Rather sleep on a park bench outside before another stay.

Text: Front desk staff was professional and friendly. We sat at the bar for about half an hour and the bartender was good. The pools were nice and everything was clean.

Text: Clean, quiet, and friendly staff.  Our room had two double beds, and it would've been more comfortable if they were queen sized.  AC units are pretty loud when cycling on/off during the night.  Would probably return if we were in Warsaw again.
