Text: You get what you pay for. Overall, looks good. Suprrised at the simple fixes that are needed aren't attended too. I.E. carpet stains, broken door latch, loose shower curtain rod due too insufficient anchors. Room 215. (Edit after stay:  Tried the jacuzzi in room the final morning.  Wouldn't work. Told clerk on checkout. She asked if we turned on the wall switch.  We had.  She next said "You're all set (to leave)."  

No "Sorry" or "We'll have to check that out".
