Text: Cheapest prices in town. But you get your money's worth. Unsanitary rooms. Bring your own cleaning stuff. Smells. No microwaves in room. Still use box tv. Weak WiFi. Dusty, dust everywhere. Druggies everywhere.

Rude manager. Outdated not clean and not Military Friendly. We would never recommended this hotel. Beware and stay away!!!!
