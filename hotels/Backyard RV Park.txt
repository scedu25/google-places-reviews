Backyard RV Park

Text: A nice, out of the way campground that was quiet, peaceful and had large pull through. Showers were nice and overall a pleasant place to stay night on a cross country trip. Prices were very good as well

Text: We've known about this little midwest gem for several years...best kept secret! However there is rarely hot showers and they are rustic in nature but other than that..low cost, peaceful, large lots, green soft grass for doggies and very quiet. Totally beats those overrated chain parks by far!
