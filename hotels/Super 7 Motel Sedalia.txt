Text: Obviously an older motel. Don't expect much. Bare minimum here. They've tried to do some remodeling but obviously aren't working with a large budget. Had a fly problem in one room and they were quick to try and remedy it with a fly swatter and fly tape. Seemed to work as only one fly was caught on the fly tape in the morning. Beds seem ok but could be replaced as you can start to feel the springs (sign #1 that the mattresses need to be tossed). I think the bathroom toilets, sinks, and tub are stained due to age but seemed to be cleaned after guests check out.  All-in-all a fair place to stay for a night but I wouldn't call this "base camp" for an extended stay.

Text: Good cheap sleep, but if you are spending more than one night I don't suggest it
