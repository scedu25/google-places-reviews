Cortez Motel
Rating: 1
Text: If value your money don’t spend it here. First off staff and owners are rude. They do not honor their online prices. They did not provide blankets in October 2017. The beds are hard as a rock. Barely any shower and soap supplies. Towels are rough and small if you are any taller then 5’5”. Room smelled old and musty. Hotel is not close to any restaurants or stores, it’s literally in the middle of no where. For 80 dollars a night even if it was 68 as it was listed, you cna get 1000x better.  Good luck use only as last resort if you really have to but plan on finding another hotel next day and book a massage, one night in those beds kill your back.

Text: It didn't look like much pulling in but after meeting the owner which was a really nice guy and getting a clean room I was surprised.  I stay here now every time I come into town. It also had a nice big flat screen. The people that own it are a really nice Hindu family and very helpful.

Text: My wife and i stayed here for two weeks. We really enjoyed our stay. Everything was very clean and taken well care of. The owners were really friendly and helpful. I was able to connect my ps4 to the wifi and hook up to the HD tvs and watch netflix. Would definitely recommend this place.

Text: The room was pretty nice. Above par for a zero star motel for sure. Flat screen TV with all the movie channels. Problem is the vagrants who appear to live in this place outside their rooms at all hours. Initially music was blasting from 2 different rooms, doors open. A call to the office silenced it but then I hear them conversing outside my door about how i had complained! I was also awoken to someone pull starting some kind of engine outside at in the late PM.
