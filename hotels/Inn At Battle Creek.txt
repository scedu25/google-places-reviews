Inn At Battle Creek
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed here for one night after touring Loess Hills. Didn't need a reservation.  Room was nice and clean. We had an excellent meal in the dining room.  Had a peaceful night followed by a delicious breakfast. Would recommend to anyone wanting to get away for a weekend.

Text: Two months ago we made reservations at the Inn for a birthday celebration for my mom on August 24, 2013.  This week we called the Inn to make final preparations and were dismayed to find that the phone had been disconnected.  We contacted someone in Battle Creek and found out that the owners simply closed the place and moved to California.  They didn't even have the decency to call us and tell us they were closing immediately and that we would have to make different arrangements for the party.  We have relatives flying in from out of state for this celebration.  What would have happened if we hadn't tried calling today and all just showed up on Saturday?  The owners should be ashamed of themselves.

Text: This historical home with its lovely interior woodwork is beautiful.  The owners are very kindhearted and friendly.  We were a bit weary and hungry upon our late arrival, so Nancy took care to serve us an elegant salad and delicious home-baked bread with our tea.  Her husband, Jeff, is an award-winning gourmet chef and we tremendously enjoyed his French Toast breakfast and conversation.

For Christmas, we gave our parents a gift certificate to The Inn at Battle Creek and they raved about the steak dinner they enjoyed here.  This place is an Iowa treasure.
