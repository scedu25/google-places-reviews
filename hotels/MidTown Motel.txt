Text: They charge $50 a night and take it apon thier selves to come and charge extra because friends come to visit and most rooms are dirty. The owner come in your room when you leave and checks your room as hes been caught before. They take it upin there selves to ckme in your room any time they like and demand things. Strait disrespecting you space and down right needs to be fixed and up graded.

Text: I am surprised to see the earlier review . My experience at the hotel is entirely different than what has been mentioned in the review. The rooms are nice and clean. The Owners are nice,friendly and helpful people. I am in the town for a short term IT project and sort of made it my HOME. Its really nice and affordable . Nothing got stolen from my room . Nothing sort of wrong happens around here. I have not seen anything crazy-going in here. Very Safe..  I am glad I am staying here.
