Coles Creek Campground

Text: Excellent camping, beautiful lake, nice surrounding area.

Camped at Cole's Creek and the grounds were wonderful.  The rangers schedule short presentations about the natural surroundings.  This was the South end of the lake.  The North end is also nicely set up as well

The town of Carlyle is a great little town with nice eating, and attractions.

Super relaxing weekend!!

Text: Very clean! The beach was clean and loved the fact you can bring your dog to the beach as well! Laundry mat and bathrooms and showers were really clean .The breeze from the lake made it perfect for hot days!

Text: Wide, full hookups in one loop. Sites on or near the lake. Dove fields nearby might be noisy to those who are sound sensitive.

Text: Beautiful lake. Come for a week every year. This year is the worst visit yet. Teenagers with loud music all night and breaking  bottles on the rock where kids play. If it wasn't for them it would be a 5 star. Will be looking for more secluded campground  in the future. Worst nights sleep ever. Should have kept my kids and self at home

Text: The campsite is beautiful,  I have two oroblems, one, we can't bring firewood and yet there was none to buy. 

Second we have our 2 little puppies and we clean up after them. The first night we got here and was setting up my husband stepped in a pile of dog feces an tracked it into our camper,  it was dark. As I type this a dog is running loose and has been since they have been here and we watched it go potty on our site.
Rules should be for everyone, not just a few.
All the sites here are very nice. The lake is beautiful
Not a happy camper right now
