Text: It is clean and affortable for one night.  We was happy with it.  We stopped there on our way to Marion SD.  Not a bad stop for 20.00 for full hookups.  If you are looking for extras it is not for you  but if you are looking for full hookups at low cost this is it.

Text: No office, no Wi-Fi, no laundry or showers, no cable. Just put the money in the box on the pole after you pick a spot.  Traffic noise and trains all night long.  But for electric, water and sewer hook-up, it's only $20 a night.
