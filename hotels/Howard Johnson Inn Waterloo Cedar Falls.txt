Howard Johnson Inn Waterloo/Cedar Falls

Text: Friendly staff at the desk, pretty standard experience. Looks like they were in the process of sprucing up the place at the moment with fresh paint and decor so the whole place might look a little newer soon. A good stay and breakfast for the price. And it was a really good price. The air-conditioning was a bit loud but worked well. I'd stay here again.

Text: There were doing a lot of painting on walls and doors, looked very nice, good to see them taking care of the building, but it was a slight annoyance. Nice comfy beds, rooms were clean besides a hidden pop bottle. I didn't see the pool at all, so no comment there. Staff was friendly. All in all I would come back again.

Text: Loved the atmosphere and the manager was great. I could tell he takes pride in what he does and that's so rare these days. Will definitely be back.
