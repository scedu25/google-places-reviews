Text: Outstanding CCW course. The Primary Instructor that taught my CCW class was on point and his method of instruction insured that those without any experience got it. I would recommend that all handgun owners even those that don't intend to conceal carry take this course. 17 years as a Military Police Officer, I learned a lot, plus any chance to go shooting is an added bonus.

Text: I HAVE SPENT 4 DAYS UNDER THEIR INSTRUCTION
IT IS A GROUP OF HIGHLY SKILLED PROFRSSIONALS WITH MULTIPLE SUBSPECIALTIES 
RANGING BETWEEN VARIETY OF FIREARMS  FOR DIFFERENT RANGES STARTING AT OPEN HAND , EDGED WEAPONS, PISTOL, CARBINE,AND PRECISION SHOOTING.
THE UNIQUE QUALITY OF THE TEAM IS THEIR PRACTICAL WAY OF INTEGRATING VARIOUS WAYS OF FIGHTING, CREATIVE TRAINING INCLUDING MULTIPLE SCENARIO FOR SELF DEFENSE AND FORCE ON  FORCE TRAINING.
ALL THE INSTRUCTORS WERE HIGHLY KNOWLEDGABLE AND SKILLED, CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY WITH TRUE CARE FOR IMPROVING MY SKILLS ,TECHNIQUE AND JUDGEMENT.
INSTRUCTOR STARTED EARLY AS 8AM AND FINISHED TRAINING AS LATE AS 2300PM AND WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING SURE I WILL GET THE REQUIRED SKILLS
THE FACILITY HAD ALL THE NEEDED  EQUIPMENT AND THE EXPANSION PLANS WILL MAKE IT TRULY OUTSTANDING.
HOSPITALITY AND ORGANIZATION WERE FLAWLESS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE AND SKILLS OF INSTRUCTION WILL SATISFY ANY INDIVIDUAL OR TEAM WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE THEIR FIGHTING/SURVIVAL  SKILLS.
I HAVE HAD PRIOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN TRAINING AND THIS TEAM OF TRAINERS DIVERSITY, OPEN MINDED THINKING , PATIENT AND SKILLS WERE THE BEST I HAVE SEEN,
I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!
