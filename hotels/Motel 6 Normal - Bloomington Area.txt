Motel 6 Normal - Bloomington Area

Text: Felt very Third World. No one i encountered spoke English very well and some, not at all. Smelled like curry and cigarettes in the hallways. Room was too warm. Hallways are not air conditioned. Large gap under my room's door and the hallway. Also a large gap along the door's locking side.  Smell of Third World hallway drifts in. Helped to stuff bath towel in the gap under the door. This is a franchise NOT company owned facility.

Text: Room was very clean, apart from the shower, which was old. Toilet ran a little extra water if the handle was not adjusted correctly, but not too bad. Customer service was great! Hallways were not air conditioned, but it makes sense since there were only about 5 rooms used in the entire place. Overall very nice and would stay again

Text: This fit the bill for what I needed. However, the cleanliness of the the shower enclosure left a lot to be desired. Also every single towel in the bathroom had what I can only hope and assume were bleach stains. The bed was surprisingly comfy and the location was perfect.

Text: My room was supposed to be a "smoke-free" room yet the blanket was full of cigarette holes.  Also, the room had a funny smell so my guess is that someone was smoking in the room prior to my arrival.  Lastly, the room was touted as a "quality" room and if this is quality, I'd like to know what is the bottom!
