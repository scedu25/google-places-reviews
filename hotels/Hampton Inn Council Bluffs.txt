Hampton Inn Council Bluffs

Text: Upon arrival, I waited over 5 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in.  No apologies. When in the lobby later in the evening, not acknowledged by the front desk attendant. She was seated behind a wall, so no one could see her. 

The room was large. Found a bunch of nastiness around the shower drain. 

Not near food options except at the casino. In a more isolated area.

Will never return. As a diamond member, this was the absolute worst customer service I have received at any Hilton brand hotel.

Text: Friendly staff. Non-smoking room smelled like cigarettes. Toilet seat was melted and yellowed, so it looked nasty. Spa was out of order, which meant I couldn't enjoy the pool either, because I like to go from a cool pool to warm up in a warm spa.

Text: I loved my stay at the Hampton Inn! It was convinently attached to the casino that I gambled and drank at so I could just walk a short distance inside. The help was very friendly and helpful as well.
