Text: I went here in the summer after 5th grade and before 6th for D.A.R.E. camp. I Had a blast we rode horse's, seen a old Indian chief and some of his family members do some dancing, walked on some trails, and canoeing. Oh ya some crud that pertained to dare came. The place was very nice and well keeped and the people the worked or ran the place was nice and helpful. I would certainly go back and stay a little longer.
