Maumee Bay State Park Lodge and Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed on the Columbus day weekend and enjoyed this lodge and park very much. There were so much to do for us and our 7 year old and 2 year old.the restaurant on-site has a very good menu , big servings and for $7.95 for a maumee breakfast enough for two people- it was an amazing deal. The swimming pool was clean and splash pad was great for kids. The hot tub / spa although a bit old and very loud, there were two so you don't feel crowded or cramped when there's a lot of people using it. 
Our room was spacious, although the design was a bit out dated and kinda feels like you are in a motel, the beds were comfortable and the view of the lake was spectacular. I give it a five star mainly because the park has a lot to offer, the restaurant was superb and the staff were very warm and welcoming. Will definitely go back again.

Text: Attended a wedding reception at on of the ballrooms. View of the lake was beautiful. Everything in hotel was sparking clean. Food served at the event was very tasty and satisfying. Everything from room temperature, too signage to staff was exceptional for the event. Grounds are well manicured. Don't know cost, as I was a guest. Would deterrent consider an event there myself if in the area.

Text: Location was nice and on the lake. I was disappointed there was no Sandy Beach right at the hotel. Rooms were generously sized and convenient for access to out doors. Many recreational activities were included and available, including indoor raquetball courts. Nice venue for our work conference

Text: Was there for a wedding in the tent. Food was great. Service and venue were all lovely. Only negative, and it's small, is the location of the restroom to the tent.
