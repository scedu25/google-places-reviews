Text: Hot tub was down and breakfast is just waffles and mini muffins, but very clean and nice people. Pool was freezing so we didnt get in but looked like fun. Brought along my dog was only a $10 fee and they put my room facing the back grass so it was easy access to take him out. Would recommend and would definitely stay here again.

Text: When the young lady checking us in found out that I recently had knee surgery she put us in a room with a walk in shower.
Comfy bed. All around good experience.

Text: Charming historic hotel built in 1971 (per the front desk clerk) which has been maintained well.  Big room with a fridge and microwave and coffee pot.  Cheap television but strong Wi-Fi for streaming.  Pet friendly.  Breakfast includes something for everyone, waffles, yogurt, apples, muffins, juice and more.  Great value!

Text: This place was nice.  And the breakfast they serve is just right if you want to get back on the road early.
