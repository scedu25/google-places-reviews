Text: We stayed at the Gables cottage. We rented a few of the cottages with a group of friends. It was so wonderful. The cottages were decorated beautifully, the beds were comfortable. There was a fire pit where we could gather as a group and enjoy the weather. The staff was kind and helpful. Very much enjoyed our stay.

Text: This was our first time ever going to a B&B. It was absolutely amazing. The owner(s) were very nice to us and very accommodating. Elsah is a very nice small village with great scenery, there are also several towns nearby which we took advantage of to rent some movies (the room included a bluray player!). 

The breakfast was fantastic (we got it a little late because we slept in, but  they were nice enough to keep it warm for us!). We would both highly recommend this place if you're planning to do anything in the area.

Text: This bed and breakfast is the best place I've ever stayed. The rooms are so very cute and the village itself is quaint. Deb, is such a sweet hostess. She, and her husband, Tim, are the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful humans I've ever met. They were both so helpful during our stay and a lot of fun to talk to at night. I would highly recommend staying here for any traveling plans you have, my husband I decided to make this trip a yearly thing and stay here each time.
