Super 8 Carbondale
Rating: 4
Text: Clean, comfortable rooms adjacent to a large shopping center and the local mall, within easy driving distance of the SIU-Carbondale campus.  Decent free breakfast in the lobby area.  Rates go up for weekends of campus events (such as move-in day and commencement), if you can even get a room for those dates.  (If you have a graduating senior or grad student, Christmas Day would be a good time to book a room for Commencement Weekend; we waited until January to book a room for law school graduation (on a Friday), and could only stay here Thursday night; we ended up on Friday an hour's drive north at a motel in Mt. Vernon (on our way home, at least).)

Text: They put me in a good room where everything was clean and worked properly; This might have been because I reserved through the hotel directly. Anyway, The staff was friendly and the breakfast in the morning was decent. Would stay again.
