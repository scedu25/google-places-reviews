Text: Nice little Fairfield. Kinda weird the don't have an elevator, but they were nice enough to comp us a king suite on the ground floor for the same price so that my wife recovering from knee surgery didn't have to climb the stairs.

Text: Just had a wonderful experience with securing a reservation with your staff member, Bryce (I believe that was his name.) He was not only courteous, but every question I had was dealt with patience and the utmost in courtesy. 
The most important first step is the first interaction, and I must say mine was pleasant in every aspect. Definitely off to a great start, Fairfield Lansing! Thank you! 
 I am looking forward  to my upcoming business stay with this Marriott property.

Text: Hotel over booked the hotel. I was bumped from my room and was not notified of this until I got to the hotel from Traveling from SD. Front desk staff was a mainland they sent me to the comfort in but I found a different room that I stay at. So definitely disappointed in this hotel and interaction.

Text: Staff is courteous and helpful. Rooms and facility is a little dated and in need of remodeling. Pool is a nice size. The hot tub was out of order when visiting. Breakfast area was small but breakfast was good variety of food.

Text: Bryce at the front desk is a Rockstar. Great service. Lobby and eating area were really cold, hard to hang out there.
