Embassy Suites by Hilton St. Louis St. Charles

Text: Rooms were large and comfortable. Breakfast was quite good for a hotel, including made-to-order meals included with the stay. The coffee shop was the best I've ever seen in a hotel with excellent service. The landscaping is attractive and inviting. Loved how the hotel and conference center are attached. Super convenient for conference attendees. With walking distance of a number of great restaurant choices.

Text: Nice big room. I used the electric check in and virtual key options. The check in was great though I couldn't get the virtual key on my phone to work with my phone. Went to the desk and got a regular key card, no big deal. Nice hot breakfast bar with omelets to order. Over all a very nice stay.

Text: We were in the area for a family wedding and were greeted warmly by hotel staff who were very accommodating during checkin to all our requests.  The hotel has a lot of amenities and our rooms were very large with plenty of room for family.  The rooms were clean with super comfy beds! I’ve stayed at many Embassy hotels and I really enjoy the breakfast but this hotel was way understaffed which made the line for breakfast too long and while they had a small buffet there was only eggs and sausage...you had to wait in line (at least 30-45 minutes) for bacon or pancakes, etc. so this was disappointing.  However, I would return to this hotel again mainly because of the front office staff!

Text: Very nice hotel. Front desk staff was pleasant, helpful, and efficient. One of my 2 tvs wouldn't come on when I arrived. I told the front desk and it was very quickly fixed. Room was spacious and clean. That along with the COMPLIMENTARY happy hour and the custom pancake and omelet station made this a great stay.
