Sonesta ES Suites Cincinnati - Blue Ash

Text: Love the rooms however room I had smelled like cat pee upon entering. Rolly Polly bugs all over bathrooms and around baseboards and near fire place. Cob webs and a big spider. Up keep on these rooms with cleanliness would be nice especially around all baseboards. Bed was a tad lumpy but layout was nice and kitchen in room was nice. Noise level was a bit high as can hear everything sounded like a party downstairs.  Breakfast was good though. Staff was nice.

Text: Room was fantastic. They seemed overwhelmed at breakfast and ran out of food and coffee well before the listed end time. Everything else was great!

Text: Great hotel. Bed was so comfortable that I am looking into getting the same mattress at my house. Grounds are very well kept. Employees are extremely friendly. Free breakfast was good. This hotel is set up kind of like a bunch of condos. You will most likely get your room from outside. The rooms are really nice. Full fridge with icemaker. Kitchen with sink and dishwasher. Couldn't be happier with my stay and will definitely come back!
