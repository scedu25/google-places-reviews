Michael's Motel
Rating: 3
Text: Stayed here the weekend of the total solar eclipse in August 2017. The staff were great - answered questions, made sure we had what we needed. The front desk wasn't always staffed, but if not, there was a number we could call. For a small mom and pop operation, that worked for me. Our room was everything we needed. Definitely just the basics. It was past time to replace the carpet - a good number of stains. But it was tidy, the ac worked great, the bathroom was good, the beds were firm. We're thinking about visiting Golconda again, and would keep Michael's on the list of options if we do.

Text: The room's are not "bad" but take this as a suggestion. Don't stay more then about a night. or two.  

Small town and unless you like a stiff back the mattress are set ontop of plywood. 

You'll get some sleep but your back won't thank you. 

rooms are clean and the owners nice.
