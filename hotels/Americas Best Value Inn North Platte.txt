Americas Best Value Inn North Platte
Rating: 5
Text: Small and older but impeccably clean and comfortable. I was warmly welcomed by the woman at the desk and she was extremely helpful and accommodating with making sure I had what I needed. I wanted to be on the road before their breakfast was available and she sent me back to my room with a selection of food so I wouldn’t leave hungry. I also enjoyed their alternative to the normal hotel room art (pictured). I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in North Platte.

Text: My friends and I stopped here as part of a cross country road trip. The place is a small motel, but in good upkeep. The rooms are basic and there is a free breakfast. It was a good value for the price. There is even a small pool.
