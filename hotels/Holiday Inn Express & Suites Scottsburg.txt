Holiday Inn Express & Suites Scottsburg

Text: This is a nice hotel close to the interstate, easy to access and far enough away from the interstate for a quiet nights sleep  and the rooms were nice and clean. Flat screen TV's. New mattresses, they were very nice and comfy. As of this post the hotel was undergoing renovations. And the pool was closed. Breakfast was great too. Staff very friendly check in quick. And minutes from everywhere in town. Rates were affordable too.

Text: Very nice, just has replaced all mattresses in all rooms along with all new bedding. Very nice and the most friendly young lady that greeted us from the front desk at check in. Amanda was very helpful and knowledgeable. Great call to my wife for picking this one out.

Text: Not a bad place to stop late at night. They have a swimming pool, breakfast bar and AAA discounts. This place is dog friendly but there is a charge. Try to get there early because the parking is not big.  Call ahead to make reservations this place fills quick.
