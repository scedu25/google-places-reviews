Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Jefferson City

Text: About a month and a half ago, my fiance and I stayed there for 4 nights. Our first room didn't have a microwave so we called and they gave us keys to a different room within minutes. That was probably our only issue, but was taken care of immediately. The beds were very comfy as we're the pillows. The entire room was very nice. The mini fridge was fairly decent, plenty of space for whatever we needed to keep cold. The breakfast is common breakfast foods, but I loved the choices we were given. The staff were awesome too, well mannered, courteous, and helpful. Overall, one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at, which says a lot considering it's located in a small city.

Text: This is probably the nicest 2 star hotel I've been to. I wish they had better breakfast options, but they aren't bad! The staff is wonderful and they are all so nice. The place itself is beautiful on the inside. It's close to Hyvee, so we got dinner there and ate in the hotel breakfast area, which was nice. The pool is great, the rooms are beautiful, and I've had no problems yet with this place and I've been 4 or 5 times!

Text: Room was clean. Desk clerk was courteous. TV in room seems a little small. But otherwise good. Did speak with one of the guests at breakfast that said they found bed bugs in their room last night. Our room was fine though. So just check room before you unpack to stay.
