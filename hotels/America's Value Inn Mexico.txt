Text: First off, I think it's clear that the 5 star reviewer is an employee or friend of an employee.  Because this was by far the the worst motel experience I have ever had.  
Upon arriving, I asked the female employee if they offered a AAA discount, was told no, but she would give me a discount anyways.  When I went outside and returned to check in (within 5 minutes), a man working the desk said that he would not give me a discount as their prices were already low.  I felt that they should have honored what their first employee stated.   And yes, it was cheap, however, you get what you pay for: There were holes in the mattress (which was well past needing to be replaced, I could feel every spring), stains on the chairs/floor and there is literally NO vent in the bathroom.  It was hot and hard to breath in it.  And smelly.  I would equate it to using a port-a-potty.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy,
