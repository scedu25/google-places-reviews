Text: If you enjoy drug bags AND Jerry Springer  type goings on's, vandal's, and Ghetto type music that upsets the (HEART) arrhythmia if you have heart problems as I do ! , by all means (MOVE) ther (JUST DON'T) call the (POLICE) to file a (COMPLAINT OR FILE ONE! ) because the local (POLICE ) and the people living there all (KNOW EACH OTHER!) and the ( OFFFICER RESPONDING!) will (TELL THEM WHO!! COMPLAINED!! SO MUCH FOR CONFIDENTIAL!!) WHICH IS (ILLEGAL!!) This place (WAS WAS NOT LIKE THIS WHEN WE MOVED HERE!) Next spring we are moving  our home (ELSEWHERE! THANK GOD). We were going to move it this last June but financially we were unable to the cost of moving and everything else would be too much all at once! I would have given an HALF an STAR but the OPTION is NOT there! forgot to mention the truck stop fully loaded semi tractor/trailers parking (THERE!) and the raised rents to pay for the damages they cause!
