Text: Within the first 5 minutes of being in our room we found a cockroach in the bathroom. Informed the person at the front desk, he wasn't even surprised!! DO NOT RECOMMEND AND WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!

Text: The hotel itself was ok. It was clean but very plain and had very few amenities. The person at the desk wasn't necessarily rude but was definitely not friendly. Not a bad stay for the price; just don't expect much.

Text: Very rudely talked too by a female staff member at the front drag who then refused to give us a room proceeded too not give us an explanation and wouldn't tell us her name or the name of her manager. Very dissappointed won't be coming back to this establishment!

Text: First, let me say that the employees were nice--but that was all that I can say that was nice about out stay.  The place has signs all over saying "No Smoking" but that was a lie. We stayed on the first floor and it seemed like it was basically "the smoking lounge" every time we walked in. It didn't matter if it was the morning or evening-- it smelled like someone had just put out their cigarette. SOOOO GROSS!!!  It was also really loud. The people on either side of us were loud (with a lot of furniture banging against the wall) and above us, it sounded like a herd of elephants!!! We didn't sleep well, at all. The true test---I left my million dollar pillow in the room. I called and the manager/owner/worker said he would ship it as soon as he could. It was my fault for leaving it--true!!! If he returns it, as he said he would---I will " forgive" all other negatives and give them a glowing review!!!
