Crazy Horse Campground

Text: Over-priced.  River rafting was cancelled.  Mini-golf needs updating.  Wood is over-priced for skimpy pieces.  Batting cage needs updating.  Jumping pillow is the main attraction for the kids, & there isn't really a good way for the kids to get to it except cutting through other campers sites who were charged money to use for the week-end.  Guests are over-priced as well.  My family came to visit late Saturday afternoon, 4ish.  The river was up, & rafting was cancelled.  Crazy Horse knew that, but still charged them the $25 fee, & the jumping pillow was all our 2 grandchildren used.  Seriously, $25 to jump on their pillow.  It could be a nice campground, but needs some pricing options, & a designated service road with signs or arrows for kids to follow to the jumping pillow.  It isn't right, to disturb campers in the SITE you paid for.  Or disturb your conversation around your campfire,  or disturb a bean bag game to let the kids go through to the pillow, or disturb a badminton game to let the kids go through.  Meanwhile, their parents are sitting in their lawn chairs enjoying their campsite, while their kids are playing at the jumping pillow.  On a side note, people really like to get rid of their kids, to have their own peace, but could care less if their kids are disturbing other people's peace.  I think I saw their kids that week-end, more than they did.  To be fair, I believe the managers at the campground tried to stop it, but parents & kids were not listening.  Hence, why, I think they need to designate & show people what to do.  Make how to get to the jumping pillow more visible.
