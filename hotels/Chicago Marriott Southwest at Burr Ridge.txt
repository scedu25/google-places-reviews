Text: This hotel does have beautifully redecorated rooms and main areas, but our room was not completely finished.  It  still had the old light fixtures and unfinished electrical.  Mastic/glue was not cleaned of all surfaces in room.  The restaurant is a hot mess. Had some bad food for breakfast in the restaurant which really ruined the experience for us. At this point,  we will seriously be reconsidering future stays at any Marriott establishments.

Text: Nice place. Remodeled. I do wish the rooms could get colder and de-humidified. It would allow for a more comfortable (less damp) stay.
Food is excellent, staff is great.

Text: Everything about the hotel was fresh and new. Looked like a complete renovation for 2017. Rooms were decorated nicely. Very comfortable beds. Extra Large screen tv. Only downfall was the lowest water pressure of all time for the shower. Price was the best around. Would stay again.
