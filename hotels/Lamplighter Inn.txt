Text: First, when I paid for my room and it wasn't ready they said they would call me when it was. After 1.5 hours of waiting I went to my room. The maid was still working on it and wasn't told I was waiting. The room was trashed and arrests were made the night before. Not a good choice of rooms for someone waiting. Went to office to change rooms. The next room wasn't ready. Had to wait for the bed to be made and the room vacuumed. THEN at 1am someone used a key and unlocked my door. Good thing I had the bar across the top. Obviously too many people/family members have pass keys. Complained the next morning and it went unheard. Office was locked at 8:30 to turn in key. The man who took my key barely spoke English. Unbelievable!

Text: The room  was clean and the front desk was very nice. For an older motel, it was okay. As with any motel, you will find little things but why complain about the little things... Thanks to the owner for working with the vfw and giving us a place to lay our tired head..the only recommendation would be to update the t.v so that PlayStation3 will hook up to it...
