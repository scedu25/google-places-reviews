Text: My wife and I stayed overnight while on the road. We booked using Travelocity, which went well. Arrival and check in went smoothly. Upon entering out room, we were greeted with the faint yet lingering smell of dog urine. The room seemed clean, to include the sheets, shower, floors, etc., but definitely a bit dated.
It's a cheap hotel, you get what you pay for.

Text: This property is so poorly run. They gave me a room with a broken window and dead roaches on the floor. The adjoining room's door was kept shut with a chair. I left because I felt unsafe and 3 weeks later, I still have not been contacted by the manager for a resolution or even an apology. When I call the front desk clerk Kelly hangs up on me. Inexcusable.

Text: The staff were unbelievably helpful and welcoming all well worth 5 stars by a landslide!!!! But unfortunately I am rating my overall experience on the decor and functionalities of the amenities as well and collectively those strives on their best days may equal a mere half of a point max!!!!
