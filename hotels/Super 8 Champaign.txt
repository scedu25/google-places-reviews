Super 8 Champaign

Text: It's a decent place to stay if you don't mind being sexually assaulted when you check in and when your checking out. The front desk clerk doesn't seem to see what's wrong with grabbing a woman's chest and her butt, even after you tell him no his words were " It's different where I'm from".

Text: Very nice compared to most Super 8 hotels. Room was clean and modern. I think it is totally non-smoking which I consider a major +.

Text: Lowest price in town, friendly staff, and a basic breakfast included. The room was a little musty and the bathroom was clean but not perfect. Over all for the price and the location being convenient to the rest of town I'd recommend this hotel.

Text: Room smelled strongly of cologne. Was fine but not great. About what I expected though.

Text: This hotel looks nothing like the pictures. It smells very bad inside and when we got into our room the blankets were dirty and nasty ?. The tub hadn’t been clean and the over all look of this room made my skin crawl. Evening staff is very rude but morning staff was very friendly. Will not ever recommended this place or stay here again due to the false advertising of out dated pictures and filth.
