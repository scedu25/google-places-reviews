Text: With only 2 choices in this town, this one is always available without a reservation. I originally planned on staying at the Alamo Motel, but no one is ever in the office when you drive by. The ladies in the office are always friendly and are helpful when trying to find anything to eat in town. Rates for Deer season ate only $45 a night. Perfect for me from 200 miles away. I will be coming back here again next year.

Text: I have stayed in inexpensive motels in the past and usually always say you get what you pay for but this place is a pleasant surprise. It's older but very, very clean and everything works like it should. Did I mention it is inexpensive. Will stay here again if in this area

Text: This is a nice and clean little place that is inexpensive. Don't expect a Hilton... it is very old and dated but does it's purpose.
*The maps for this area are off, so don't follow the given directions. The motel is on the west of town on 136, not North of town as suggested.
