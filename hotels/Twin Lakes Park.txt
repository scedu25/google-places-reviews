Twin Lakes Park
Rating: 5
Text: We have lived in our camper here since July 2017 (my husband working in the area) and don't have any complaints. Any minor problems we had were rectified without question. It is a family run campground. Bingo every Friday and activities with a theme every Saturday for the kids, large wooden playground including a sandbox with toys. This place is well maintained. Swimming pond is a beautiful clean feel and colored blue. Fishing pond is nice but isn't well stocked with big fish. $8 for a radio flyer wagon load of wood is a bit much, but it's good clean wood that will last your evening. WiFi goes in and out quite a bit, but not Twin Lakes fault, there's a tower by Watch Communications close by and doesn't have good internet. We will he more than happy to return to this place. We would, and have, recommended this campground to others.

Text: Fast and easy check-in. Lots of space. Main complaint - the showers were in bad shape - women's water flow (according to other half) was dismal. As for Men's, water fine but lots of black mold in shower enclosure, and shower curtain was a total disaster. Seriously nasty! With cleaned up showers I would have no complaints.
