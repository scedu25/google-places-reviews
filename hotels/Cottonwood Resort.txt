Text: Best kept secret in Quincy/Coldwater Region!  My family has been coming here for many, many years every summer and is Pure Paradise.  Curt and Carrie are the best hosts in the world.  They smile and wave everytime when we see them and make sure your stay is the very best.  Clean restrooms and showers. Make sure you make reservations way in advance since very popular for camping.  They have a great camp store to get all types of items, including the best ice cream.  Also, while on the water they have 2 floating rafts for burgers, hot dogs, drinks, etc. How cool is that!

Text: This campground did not have full hook up like they stated upon initial booking. They when said, when calling to confirm reservations, they had water and electric, but upon arrival they had a square lot in the back with only 20 amp electric hook up, outside a small building that blew a breaker in the middle of the night. The owners live just across the street from the campground and the male was seen moving around in the house but would not answer the door when we went to get help, we didn't have anyway of keeping the refrigerator running. Then when confronting the female owner the next morning she said their bedroom was in the back of the house and they cant hear the doorbell. I told her we seen the male walk around but he wouldn't come to the door. I ask if we could get our money back and she replied well you were here so I'll give you the primitive cost ($5 dollors back). We then upon return had a nail in one of our back tires of the camper. First and last time at the Cottonwood Resort, I WOULD NOT CAMP HERE EVER AGAIN! Seemed as if they were just trying to make a quick buck. They need to fix their outlets and just be honest upfront.
