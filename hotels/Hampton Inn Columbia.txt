Hampton Inn Columbia

Text: We stayed the night at this hotel and it was a great overall experience! We reserved a family package and they had popcorn, pool toys (not just cheap ones either! Quality goggles, a large swim burrito raft, and giant pool noodles), and soda waiting in our room! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool was clean and a nice temperature. The room we had was clean and easy to find the things we needed. It included a small fridge and single serve coffee machine. The only draw back was we couldn't pop the popcorn because there wasn't a microwave in the room, but we brought snacks so not too big of a deal to us. We would definitely recommend this hotel to families that need a place to stay while their children are being cared for by the hospitals. We will most definitely be back!

Text: Great hotel. Was a bit difficult to find the correct entrance to the lot initially. Front desk was awesome and we were able to check in early. Room was nice and clean. Breakfast was not as good as other Hampton Inns we have gisited, but still better than most other brand of hotels.

Text: A really great Hampton Inn with a super welcoming front desk, kind housekeeping, and hard-working breakfast staff. The rooms are kept nice & have been recently updated. Food delivery options are countless - they will give you a packet of options when you check in or in your room. Be warned that if you are carrying a truck with a trailer behind it, don't pull all the way to the front of the hotel because it does not come full circle and it's hard to get out. Instead, pull between the back of the hotel and the Burger King.
