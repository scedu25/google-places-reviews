Text: Good location- near a lot of restaurants and shops. Pet-friendly with no additional cost. Room decor was nice, but the room smelled a bit like dog pee.

Text: The front desk was always around if I needed help, they also offer free breakfast for the trucker on the go. However said breakfast is limited to make your own waffles or cereal. The rooms are nice and the beds are soft. You also cant beat their prices, both in bulk or just for a single night

Text: The hotel is right off the interstate with gas and food in the area. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. We will likely stay on our next trip to Kansas.

Text: Located conveniently right by several restaurants and stores. Rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. My only problem was the pillows were too thick, I had to sleep without one because it hurt my neck. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The price was right and it served its purpose well.
