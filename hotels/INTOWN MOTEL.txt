Text: This place is a joke! Overpriced and filthy! I'm pretty sure they gave me a used room. The bed had crumbs under the sheets so I requested new bedding. After that I went in the bathroom to find every towel on the floor with the soap wrapper in the garbage and used soap in the shower!!! Never again. 1 stay was too many!!???
As I was leaving I saw the "mother" in a room making up the bed...no new linen in sight.
And she's very rude!
