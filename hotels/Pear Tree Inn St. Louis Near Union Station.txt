Text: This hotel was very clean and accommodating.  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.  During a stressful situation due to a family member in the hospital they made this a little better.  The breakfast had a decent selection, rooms were very clean and smelled good.  I have no complaints I would recommend staying here and we will stay again when in Saint Louis.

Text: I really enjoyed my stay at the Pear Tree Inn. I always like any hotel by Drury, they really do a great job of making you feel special. I especially liked this hotel, they had a special garage for your car that was covered and protected. The hotel itself was very nice with a great restaurant for breakfast. The window in the hotel hallway gave me a great view of the St Louis Arch. The room was very cozy and I had a fantastic view of the city. There was a very comfortable queen sized bed, a mini fridge, flat screen TV and a coffee maker. This was a very good room at a great price. It was safe, comfortable and clean!

Text: Touring entertainers like Brandon Maddox are Ignite Hospitality Services' top priority, and working with hotels as great as this one is what we do! We would like to give the staff and management here a huge thank you for taking such great care of Brandon while staying for the evening in your clean, and quiet bedroom. And especially for the free breakfast in the morning before they had to pack up and get back on the road!
