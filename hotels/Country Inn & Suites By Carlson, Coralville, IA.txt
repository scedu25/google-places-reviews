Text: Nuce clean rooms. Most of the staff is nice. Only place to get ice is on the main floor which kinda sucks other than that A-1. Would definitely stay again if I ever end up in Iowa. Also plenty if stores and places to eat very near by.

Text: first stay was last night, so i have nothing to compare it to; room was clean and tasteful paint and minimalistic furnishings; breakfast was ample; you really need to check out the push-button pancake dispenser! did not get to use the pool but would have like too; all in all, nice place at a decent rate compared to others in the area; consider getting even-numbered room as the north side of the building is adjacent to a drive-thru
