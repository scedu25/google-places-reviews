Text: Last minute opening. Wish we could be so fortunate every time we travel. Excellent room, amenities, and all the extras. You will not be disappointed.  Friendly folk. Relaxing atmosphere.  5 stars is not enough.

Text: We stayed at Jass for a total 21 days whilst visiting family and friends. Johan and Justin were fabulous hosts who assisted us with all our needs. We given full,use of washer and drier, additional kitchen great and general knowledge of,the area. 
The room was a one bedroom unit which was neat and tidy, very comfortable,lounge area, cable,TV, aircon, ceiling fans, king bed and bathroom although a tad compact it was clean, and well,appointed. 
I have no problem recommending this establishment. Very central to supermarket - 2 min walk, town square was a gentle 7 min walk, Frosties the famous I scream shop was 6 min walk.
Overall....we had a great stay in a very quaint town.
