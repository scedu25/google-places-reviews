Tivoli Inn And Suites
Rating: 4
Text: The beds and linens were clean and comfortable, but the room could have used a little bit of a tidy up. I found some small pebbles and dirt around the bed frame when we first arrived but it wasn't a big deal. The hotel staff that i encountered were very friendly. The breakfast was your basic continental... bread, cereal, yogurt and juice. Nothing fancy, but I wasn't expecting it to be and was not disappointed. Overall, it was a good place to stay while visiting family and I will likely stay here again.

Text: For just staying overnight, the Tivoli Inn and Suites was sufficient. The rooms could be cleaner. The extra blankets we received were tattered, and the heater smelled like it hadn't been turned on in over a year. Other than that, the staff was nice and the beds were clean and comfy.

Text: Very disappointed!!! We booked a room 2 weeks in advance and had 3 separate confirmations of the room.  When we arrived to check in they didn't have a room for us.  They had overbooked and we were not notified that our room reservation had been dropped.  There was also no assistance in helping find another room.  We had planned to change for a wedding at the hotel but there were no restrooms available.  We were directed to a gas station across the street.  We were not the only ones that were rejected.  From the same event, there were 6 others that had no room even though they were confirmed of lodging for that night and we heard of 3 others the night before for the same reason.

Text: AWFUL!  It makes the Bate's Motel look like a day at the beach!  The pool is used for storage, no water there!  No telephone book nor any indications on the phone for assistance.  There was a coffee maker in the room, no coffee though; why am I not surprised?!
  The carpet was stained  and the place smelled musty at best.  Old and tired for sure.  The bathroom, Mr. Clean sure could have helped out.
   We paid $334.00 for two nights!  We just wanted a room, not buy this wretched place.   
  One star, it should be rated minus 10 stars.  Never again will I darken the doors of this place.  "Run Forrest, Run!

Text: So charming! Bed was very comfortable. Room was clean. The inn's decorations are lovely. If we find ourselves near Elk Horn, IA again, we will definitely stay again.
