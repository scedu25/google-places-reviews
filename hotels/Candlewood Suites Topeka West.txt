Candlewood Suites Topeka West

Text: This is our first time at this hotel chain. The room is large, including a rather large closet, a very nice bathroom area, good sized kitchen area and a wonderful sleeping/desk area.  The beds are clean and very comfortable. The pillows are cool and nicely firm.  Great to sleep on and watch TV on. Only complaint is the excellent a/c and heating system.  It's set to run at full speed but cools and warms the entire suite very quickly. The room stays comfortable with the system off for several hours. Highly recommend this chain.

Text: BFF & I decided to spend the night since we over indulged on adult beverages that evening. It was just safer that way.
We booked a room, showed up and had no issues checking in.
JORDAN S. at the front desk was so sweet and helpful! He is the BEST!
We will definitely consider staying here again, if the need arises.

Text: Nice rooms. I'm pretty sure my non smoking room had been smoked in, all of my stuff reeked of cigarettes when I left, and I felt gross because of it.

Text: Very clean and elegant. Staff was very kind. Rooms have a kitchen and stove and all the cook wear to go with!! Was a small condo and still cheaper than the cheap hotels.
