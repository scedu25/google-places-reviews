Text: Extremely friendly staff. The gal working at the restaurant bar was especially awesome, I had walked up to the counter and asked for soda, i had no idea she was closed for the night! But she served 3 other customers as well!! Rooms were very clean, bathrooms nice, neat and dry. Very pleasant atmosphere.

Text: Had an issue with the fridge in the room not working. Brought it to the attention of the employees and a new fridge was brought to my room in 10 minutes. Great service. Friendly. Clean rooms.

Text: By far my favorite place to stay in St. Charles. Their breakfast is healthy and REAL food. Rooms are always spotless. Staff is always attentive.  I normally sleep with a fan on so the fact that they allow you to keep the fan on continuously helps me sleep soundly. In other hotels I wake up every time the air unit turns on/off.
