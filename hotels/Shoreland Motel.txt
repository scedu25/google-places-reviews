Text: Place smells of death, dead animal in the bushes in front of the lake view rooms. Was quoted $66 for the room. End up getting charged $88 a room and then got moved to get away from the dead animal smell. With no refund, they never removed the dead animal out of the bushes. There's no Wi-Fi in the lake front rooms. Stay away from this place. Plenty other hotels in the area that are cheaper and cleaner. Had friends in the area stay else where, and there hotels where in better shape then here. Outdated and the staff won't do much to help. Would rate 0 stars if I could.

Text: Supposedly they have updated some of the rooms,  but ours was crappy.  Someone else's clothes in the dresser,  cobwebs,  spider coming down from ceiling and spiders on the floor in the bathroom.  Water leaking in sink,  paneling peeling up ect........or yea and a prostitute and pimp arrested in the room next to ours.

Text: I booked this motel to attend my brothers wedding. I was skeptical by the reviews, but my brother's bride recommended them. I was pleasantly surprised! It was steps from the nightlife and still quiet enough to sleep. This motel is quaint, cozy, and CLEAN!! My room was recently remodeled and tastefully done. My pillows were really fluffy, which I love! The beds were so comfortable that I melted into them! l definitely will stay here again for family reunions. They accommodated my Schnauzer without hesitation with a minimal fee. $50..The reason for the four stars is that the remote did not adjust the volume but did turn the channels.. No big deal for me! Cool place!
