Text: Front staff was very nice.  Old furnishings.  TV didn't work & took 3 people to figure out how to get it working.  They were doing some renovations in the hall and didn't start until 8;30pm outside my room--drilling, loud talking,etc.  What hotel does something like that close to rooms that are occupied at that time of the evening?  Carpet was old & stained.  Bed was surprisingly comfortable and I did sleep well.

Text: Clean comfy rooms for an overnight stay... Desk staff friendly and accommodating, property in good location. Obviously an older motel that has been renovated, so might be some minor issues pointed out by other reviewers, but to me the lobby is well decorated and inviting as was the breakfast area. Room was very nice, bed was really comfy and we slept great. Bathroom is a might small, being a retrofit, but certainly 'do-able' and everything was very clean. One thing of note, floors in our room were not carpet. but rather a wood laminate... took a bit to get used to, but gives a MUCH cleaner feel and appearance. TV, WI-FI, fridge (with freezer for my blue ice packs!) microwave, all worked well.

Bottom line, my daughter felt safe despite a late check-in and she thought the motel was clean and comfortable. My daughter is a 'tough customer'... but if she is happy, dad is happy!

Text: The hotel was in a convenient location. The staff was somewhat friendly. The room was spacious but the cord to the microwave didn't reach the outlet though the furniture it was attached to. The staff did remedy things by attaching an extension cord. Would stay there again.

Text: It was quiet during my midweek stay. They were remodeling so it may be nicer once that's completed.
