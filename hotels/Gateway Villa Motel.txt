Gateway Villa Motel

Text: Birds in the walls & the owners do nothing about it & just tell me that I'm hearing things. They let anyone stay here, even if the people are very loud and on hardcore drugs. Also, they do not have Wi-Fi. I do not recommend.

Text: My guest and I were treated very poorly at this motel. There were birds in the wall that would get so loud that it would wake us up early in the morning. I complained several times to the owners and they did nothing about it. After we complained about the birds, the owners started being rude to me and my guest. The whole experience was pathetic and I would recommend this motel to no one. You are probably better off living in a vehicle than this motel.
