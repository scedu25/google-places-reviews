Hampton Inn Cincinnati-Northwest/Fairfield
Rating: 4
Text: Very similar to any other Hampton Inn I've stayed at. They always have pretty comfortable beds, which is one of the reasons I keep coming back. This particular one was good and clean. The staff were very friendly. This location has an indoor pool and hot tub, but I was only there one night so didn't try either. The free breakfast is nice, but nothing fancy. Better than some hotels I've stayed at though.

Text: Super clean rooms, nice and cozy environment, and awesome staff. I always love being able to have a genuine conversation with the employees wherever I go and these people were very friendly. Breakfast was phenomenal. Definitely will be coming back for any mini road trips I may take in the future!

Text: The elevators are slow, so I took the stairs even when carrying luggage.  The staff was great, but unfortunately there was a distinct odor on my floor that, fortunately for anyone who reads this, I'm incapable of describing.  The common area and gym were pretty nice though.

Text: Not a bad stay, unfortunately the surrounding area is dull, right next to a lifeless mall.  Has a decent pool and hot tub, a small workout room, and paper thin walls...  Good breakfast though!
