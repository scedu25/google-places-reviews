Rating: 5
Text: COMFY bed!! COMFY room! The spa and pool were salt and a welcome relax after our long drive. Would recommend this Best Western to anyone traveling to Garden City or through. Easy to find, right off the highway. If and when we come back, we WILL stay here again!! Price was VERY reasonable for 2 queens....could not ask for more!

Text: Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip and found the people very professional and friendly. The room was clean and the indoor gym and pool/jacuzzi were a plus. Breakfast was good as well. Would definitely come here again. ?

Text: This hotel was quiet & clean, we felt we received a good value for the price paid.  Staff was excellent, especially the lady taking care of the breakfast area. Sausage, scrambled eggs (excellent home made salsa) and the usual juice, cereal & pastries were offered.  Internet seemed a little slow but still provided access to our connections.

Text: I owed this Best Western a 5-star review since my trip in March 2017. It's the best Best Western I've ever stayed. The room is super clean and elegant. The breakfast is absolutely amazing. Our family traveled from Santa Fe to Kansas City after spring break vacation. My son got sick at 3am and threw up. We did our best to clean the carpet and put the bed sheet and cover in the bathtub. We were charged a fee afterward but the fee was waived after the manager found out it's the boy who was sick. It's not because they waived the cleaning fee that we left a 5-star review; the hotel is worth all the good reviews. You are the best.

Text: Rooms where a bit small and cramped, but nice enough to say the least. Breakfast was nice and good. They have a pool but it's to shallow and small, only 4 feet deep. They stay over all was okay.
