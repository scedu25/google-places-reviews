Text: Room was nice and clean. Staff did a good job cleaning. The checkin and check out process was quick. Odd that they put sheet on top of comforters. Pool and hot tub were ok though pool was cold. Would stay here again.

Text: Great location. The hotel itself was beautiful inside. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The only complaints I have are that the water got cold quick and the breakfast was just ok.

Text: This place needs an update. Not impressed it needs a deep cleaning. Grout in tile is black in walkway of bathroom and gray under sink. Walls need touch paint. Carpet is starting to fray. They maybe replacing furniture as there was mismatched / too much furniture in my room. My lampshade was dented  in two spots probably should have been replaced. Most is cosmetic. Coworker needed sheets changed which they did right away when she asked.  It was odd that there was no clock. Another odd my full stand up mirror was covered 75% by a tall cabinet piece of furniture. Hotel smells a tad musty as you walk around halls. Maybe it is nitpicking but compared to other same level hotels for this price point these items are usually not seen. The breakfast service was nice along the fact that they have an airport shuttle. Nice setup for entrance and lobby and cute decorations. I liked the fridge and microwave with little sink in my room. A USB charging point would have been nice but There was one regular plug on a lamp. Not horrible  but not what I expected from the brand or the area

Text: Stayed 1 night only, 3rd floor. The woman at the front desk was really nice upon check in and had my keys ready in less than 3 minutes. The room was spacious and the bed was pretty comfortable. The AC worked well but had to be turned down to around 64 to really cool the room properly. The shower had nice water pressure but the tub was very slippery (no mat or rubber strips). The toilet didn't flush too well. The walls were a bit thinner than the average hotel and I could hear the next rooms (both sides) chatting quite a bit. Also got to listen to a guy face-time with his daughter while sitting in a chair in the hall (there is a really nice, open area for guests to lounge on the 3rd floor) - although I attribute half of that blame to the disrespectful guy who felt it was acceptable to be on a speaker-call at 10pm in a hotel hallway. The location was great with plenty of restaurants next door. The wi-fi worked really well, with no streaming issues whatsoever. I didn't try the TV but the fridge cooled my bottled water just fine. The iron worked extremely well, which you know is beyond rare if you stay in hotels much. I missed breakfast but I'm sure it was the average Baymont fare. Considering I got the room for only $75, I can't dwell on the minor issues much. I would stay again if the price was reasonable.

Text: I stayed Baymont Inn, and used their park and fly program. I like it because my car is safely watched while I'm on vacation. The rooms are clean, the morning breakfast is really good, and the staff are amazing.
