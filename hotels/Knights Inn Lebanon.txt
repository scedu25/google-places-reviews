Text: There was black mold on the ceiling in the bathroom . It is really out dated as well. Had to change the tv stations by hand, and just basic cable. They charge like it's a 5 star resort . 68$ for one night and to have black mold and out dated electronics , makes it really hard to give a good rating . It should be 40$ a night !!
