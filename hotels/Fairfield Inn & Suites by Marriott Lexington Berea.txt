Text: The room was great. Could not hear any sounds. The staff was great. We have a small dog and she was fine. We stayed on the second floor. We all slept soundly. This is our second time we have stayed at this Holiday Inn Express.

Text: The staff was great. Very nice and welcoming. We got an upgraded room and didn't have a problem with anything. Breakfast in the morning was good as well.

Text: Nice enough, but the deadbolt wouldn't lock correctly. They couldn't accommodate a different room, so we didn't really get a great night of sleep for our long trip. We did receive a token compensation, which is why I can't give a 1 star rating.

Text: Did not have a microwave in the room which was a problem. I have a bad back & I had to warm it in the kitchen. 
There is a constant drip in the tub.
Staff was wonderful!
