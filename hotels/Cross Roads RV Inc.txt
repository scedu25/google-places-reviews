Text: Nice get away from the city. Very reasonable rates. And a great outdoor/Great Plains vibe. Would definitely recommend this quaint park for anyone traveling thru Kansas.

Text: Wayne is the sweetest and the park is very reasonable and quite well kept. It's centrally located enough to get to Topeka, Emporia, Wichita and Kansas City within an hour or so. Cute little town 5 miles away with an awesome pizza place and a great bar and grill with BBQ.  If we're ever back this way we'll definitely stay here again!
