Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Cedar Rapids Airport, IA
Rating: 3
Text: The location was great just off the interstate and close the the airport. Rooms were pretty basic. Beds were comfortable but nothing fancy. The floor was a little dirty in the elevator and in the hallway.
Rating: 5
Text: I highly recommend this place. The staff was nice and greatly helpful. The room was clean and has great free WI-FI. There is a free breakfast with a good selection. The pool and hot tub were perfect size and temperature. Great place to go if you're in the area.

Text: The room is designed much better than most comparable motel rooms.  Plus it has great "extras," like hiding the mini fridge and microwave in a huge cabinet, and having a phone charger, on the table between the beds -- I didn't have to unplug the clock.  I'd truly recommend this place!

Text: The room was clean and the service was mostly decent. We were checking out just as breakfast was ending and decided to grab a quick bite before heading home. The employee cleaning up the breakfast area snapped at us about breakfast being over. She made us feel very unwelcome.

Text: We needed to be in Iowa City for the night, and this hotel was only a 20 minute drive away and it was a cheap option. The room was big and had everything a standard hotel room would have, including a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast was also included. The staff was also friendly and helpful.
