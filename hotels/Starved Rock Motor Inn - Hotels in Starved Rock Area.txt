Text: For the awesome price I give it 5 stars. It has everything you need plus more.  Super convenient location, near all necessities.  Excellent access to resources.  The owners and the staff are super nice and when I had an issue it was immediately remedied. I highly recommend this extra clean motel if you want above average value for your money.

Outstanding hospitality n relaxing atmosphere goes along with a martini on the rocks and a smile.... I will recommend this experience to anyone and all. Definitely an improvement for Streator and surrounding area..
