Comfort Suites Jackson-Cape Girardeau
Rating: 4
Text: Good hotel. They have cookies and chili/soup in the evenings. This hotel wasn't well taken care of a few years ago, but is better now. A/C units could use a good clean, and sometimes make the room smell rather mildewy. Good restaurant selection less than 5 miles down interstate.

Text: We spent two days in the area. That means two nights. Two nights either I or my wife slept. Aliitle here, a little there. The mattresses are hard as a concrete floor. The manager, even had the mattress chaned out.  Just not comfortable at all. The staff is excellent and the rooms clean. 
We'd given 5 stars, if we would of be able to sleep.

Text: We stayed for a little over a week here and made it so much fun and enjoyable! the breakfast was great and so was the staff. If we needed anything they never complained and were always very fast at getting what we needed. The pool was alot of fun and the cookies are off the chain! thank you guys for a great stay!

Text: While the beds were comfortable the location is somewhat industrial - but quiet. The pool area (which due to malfunctions might not show on any websites) is downright dangerous. Lights were off in the pool area, tiled floors were terribly slippery (My 6 y.o. slipped and fell). The staff were friendly, however the one young woman at the desk was on her personal phone when we needed assistance in the pool area. Overall, it was a fine place to crash, not very kid friendly, but clean. We were thankful for the doggie-bag breakfasts they had available when we got back on the road at 530am.

Text: Our room was decent, but the bathroom door had a giant hole in it. I didn't care for the bed and woke up sore. Most of the outside doors didn't accept our key and the lot was full so we had to truck all our stuff to the front door instead of the one we parked by. Breakfast was alright.
