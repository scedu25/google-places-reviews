Airport Park Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Nice little park. Well appointed camp ground with 50/30 amp power and clean water. Fees are by donation. A dump station near by is setup well. Concordia obviously takes pride in this park. Would like to see people pick up after their dogs both inside the dog park as well as out around the park. Nice 18 hole disc golf course that saw quite a few people during our stay.

Text: What a great find, the folks of Concordia are treating travelers right. They have about 14 RV spots with electric and some water faucets and trees! There are also nice bathrooms. They only ask for a donation, so if you stop here make a reasonable donation.
