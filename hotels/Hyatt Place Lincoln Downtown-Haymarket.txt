Hyatt Place Lincoln/Downtown-Haymarket
Rating: 5
Text: Great stay here. The room was large and had a king size bed and a kinda living area with a couch. Breakfast was good with French Toast and bacon. Location is right down town near a lot of restaurants and bars and the Amtrak station. Would definitely recommend a stay here if ever in Lincoln.

Text: *UPDATE: most recent stay was much more pleasant and enjoyable.  However, there was a 'caution wet floor' sign on every trip to the lobby.  I also enjoy the workout options and cleanliness of the workout room.*

Clean, modern, and bright. Free loaded breakfast buffet was the best feature! Service needs new management! Wife ordered room service from front desk and was encouraged to wait there for 'six minutes' while they make it. Cleaning staff uses main elevators instead of the service ones. Hotel has VERY thin walls. No room safe.

Text: I was very impressed!!  Staff was super nice and helpful pointing out stuff around town.  I worked in pest control for a few years and always check hotel rooms vigorously.  These rooms were perfect.   I was really blown away.

Also breakfast in the morning was great.

Text: Beautiful hotel, very quiet. Lincoln is always such a cozy place to visit, and this hotel made it even better. Was a little worried when we got to our room and found that we were positioned right in front of a glaring bright digital billboard but the blackout shades in the room did just that. Absolutely no light got in. Very pleased.

Text: Hotel was fantastic. It was very clean, friendly staff, all-washable bedding, and the best breakfast we had in our cross-country trip. They have a chef who is incredibly friendly, and provides more up-scale and delicious breakfast food. No cereal here! Instead there is breakfast casserole, bananas foster, oatmeal, homemade waffles with fruit topping, sausage and eggs. Incredible! Parking garage and hotel felt safe. No complaints here!
