Text: I visited the Comfort Inn in Pacific, MO, on 8/29/17. I was a tad concerned about traffic noise and late night hallway commotion because a travel plaza is located nearby. However, it was quiet, both inside and outside the building. The room was clean, and breakfast was good. I would stay here again without hesitation. -E

Text: Check in was easy! Front desk staff very nice.  The entire hotel was very clean! Pool was great for the kids. If I had to say one thing bad is that the sweet breakfast lady did an awesome job... made sure everything was refilled during breakfast with big crowds...poor lady needs extra help. I felt bad for her but she did amazing and with a smile on her face!  All in all....a great place to stay!

Text: One of my favorite places to stay. The beds are so comfortable, the room is very clean and the staff is so nice. The breakfast is the best breakfast I have ever had at hotel. You can make your own waffles and they have many other options for food. I definitely recommend it. If I could give this hotel 100 stars I would.
