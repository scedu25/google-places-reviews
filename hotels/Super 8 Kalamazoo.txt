Super 8 Kalamazoo
Rating: 1
Text: SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE!!! My family and I got two rooms here because I was checking out Western Michigan University but we quickly regretted it. The first floor clearly smelled like cigarette smoke when all the doors after posted no smoking. In one of our rooms, the toilet was leaking and the heater emitted a smell that smells like it was about to burst into flames (after turning it off you had to unplug it to shut off the system entirely). We complained and the only thing they were willing to do was switch us to another room which we accepted, that room was still dirty but just got done being “cleaned” by the cleaning lady. The fridge was very clearly missing it’s freezer (but that’s something so small for our larger issue). Our other room had exposed electrical outlets in the bathroom right near the sink. And smelled just as bad. 

Upon check out, we asked another guest how she liked her room. She said her initial room smelled like urine so she asked for a new room. My dad asked her if she was a smoker and she said no, he then followed up with asking if she smelled the cigerette smoke in the hallway and she said that she did. She also agreed that she would never stay in that super 8 ever again. 

The waffle maker consistently blew out fuses from what my dad said he saw other guests deal with when they were making waffles.

Text: This was the first time in my life I asked to check out 15 minutes after arriving.  My room was not clean: cob webs in corners and ceiling, did not look like a vacuum had been used in weeks, middle blanket had cigarette burns on it, bathroom floor had hair, bathtub disgusting and the smell was on an entirely different level.  I wasn't expecting complete luxury at a Super 8 and for the price, but basic cleanliness should not be a difficult expectation to meet.  Worst hotel experience ever.

Text: Only good thing about my stay was the room smelled good when I first walked in. 2 buses full of immigrant workers were staying here at the same time. Woke up next morning to find all the breakfast gone and nothing replaced. Lobby was trashed. Staff at counter was too busy on the computer. Came back later that night to find housekeeping never came. Went to lobby to get towels and was told they had none at the moment so had to wait 15 minutes for laundry. Next morning, no breakfast. Said they would refill waffle mix. Returned to lobby for breakfast 10 min later to find it hadn't been done. Decided to have cereal only to find that was empty as well. Lobby trashed again, along with the hallway that had candy wrappers all along it. I will never stay here again. Over priced for what I got.

Text: Affordable and friendly staff. Pets allowed and plenty of outside space if they need to be walked. Rooms are fairly clean.

Text: Avoid this place
  Rooms are nasty, lights broken, bathroom ceiling leaked, very noisy people selling drugs out front.  Pretty sure this is a good place to get bed bugs... seriously stay away!  Bums sleeping by a cinder block "stove"..
