Text: We've stayed in 3 different hotels this week. This one has been the most interesting.   The air conditioner did not work well. The toilet was leaking, and the whole faucet fixture for the bathroom sink was completely loose from te vanity.  There was not enough silverware for 4 people and the dishes were mix and match.   Not what I would expect from a Marriott property.

Text: Clean hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. A group of friends and I stayed in the 3rd floor and we had no issues with noise and the room was large enough to easily accommodate 3 male adults. The AC was a bit underpowered for the room (near the AC was freezing but across the room was mildly cool), but it wasn't enough of an issue to get in the way of comfortably sleeping. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Text: Room was well kept and clean. There was a full kitchen and desk to work. The lobby was small but had all the amenities needed. The only complaint that made this 4 stars was the fact that there was absolutely no parking. I had to park on the street around the corner.

Text: As with all Townplace Suites, this is a nice room with a kitchenette at a reasonable rate. However, this one is a bit older and is showing its age a bit. Our room smelled a bit musty and that detracted from our stay a little. Unless you need to be in this particular area, I would pick one of the other Townplace Suites around Columbus.
