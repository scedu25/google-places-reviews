Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Springfield, IL

Text: When it comes to the location of the hotel, it's kind of tucked behind businesses. For a smaller hotel it's very professional looking with rates that won't rape your wallet, depending on what's going on in the area. The meeting and breakfast area are considerably roomy. They're perfect for small parties. The pool is on the smaller side but a good size of you have little ones that would like to swim. The service at the front desk is one of the best I've encountered so far from the many hotels I've been to.

Text: Nice hotel.  Rooms clean as well as bathrooms.  Breakfast was good.  Down side, noisy hotel.  Ceiling/Floor is paper thin.  Room above us sounded like a construction zone or a herd of elephants being held in there.  Noise went on all night.  Each room door has a strong closing spring that you can hear a door slam every time some one left or enter a room, on the entire floor and even on the floor above.  Good hotel, but be aware can be very noisy.

Text: The hotel is incredibly beautiful and very well maintained. The staff are very hospitable and courteous. The breakfast was very good, biscuits and gravy, sausage patties, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, breakfast burritos, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, bagels and toast. Plenty to choose from. The biscuits and gravy were phenomenal and I plan on having them tomorrow. Great place to stay, I will definitely stay again.

Text: Newer property. Very clean & comfortable. Quiet. Slept well. My wife & I loved the fact that there were 2 treadmills in the fitness center allowing us to both work out at the same time. The only negative was that we had to drive > 6 miles to find a restaurant that we liked.

Text: Pleasant recent multi night stay. The front desk assistant mgr was very accommodating as we had to tweak our reservation. All the staff we interacted with were friendly - from the housekeepers to dining staff to front desk. Breakfast had a variety of decent warm/cold choices.

We had family staying throughout the building. All the rooms were consistently neat. The one bedroom suites varied a bit in size with ours feeling a bit narrow. In the future, we'd probably switch to an open king-sized room as the separating wall made the space feel a lot smaller.

In summary, a good stay & we'd be happy to return!
