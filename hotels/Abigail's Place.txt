Text: After a busy day in Charleston, Abigail's Place was the perfect setting to end our day. The cabin we stayed in was very cozy. The unit was well decorated, clean and several amenities were provided.  It felt like a home away from home. The surroundings were postcard perfect. A lovely meadow and pond provided a beautiful background. The proprietors, Phil and Brenda, were very accommodating and excellent hosts. I would highly recommend Abigail's Place.
