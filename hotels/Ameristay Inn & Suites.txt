Text: Nice pool area and staff.  However the rooms were not good.  The beds are not queen in the double rooms but instead are full size which is pretty cramped for 2 people. They were also very uncomfortable. I travel a lot and these may have been the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on.  Housekeeping wasn't very good either. The breakfast was pretty lame.

Text: Great place! Except when the police made everyone on the third floor leave so they could search. Next morning...power outage. Other than that, good breakfast great swimming pool and friendly staff.

Text: The pool and hot tub were nice, that was about it.  Don't expect much for the free breakfast.  Weak coffee, prepackaged Danish and donuts, cereal bowls.  However the Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches we're good.  Warning, mattresses were equivalent of pullout couch spring mattresses.  

However staff could not have been more present and even let us stay in pool a little later then posted hours.
