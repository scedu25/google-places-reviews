Oak Openings White Oak Campground

Text: Awesome little spot the men's room only had 1 fully working sink and no showers (not a necessity but I got pampered in Otis, MA). The wood is free and nearly fire ready but you'll want something to get it started. As for the site there are 8 and well have to say most are decent and have shade most if not all day. There's a hiking path down off the group camping, sadly no real place to swim or much else kayak or canoe would do fine tho.
