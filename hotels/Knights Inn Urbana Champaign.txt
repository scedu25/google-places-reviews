Text: Staying overnight. Last hotel available in Urbana/Champaign (UIUC grad weekend), and the location is convenient, but overall would not stay again. Rooms looked like they were furnished in the late 80's. TV was an old tube TV. While nothing looked dirty, everything smelled vaguely of cigarettes. Service was prompt for the most part. Breakfast was continental in only the loosest of terms - a handful of fruits, some store-brand breakfast desserts, and tea and coffee. Nothing particularly terrifying or bad (everything was clean) but I would probably not choose to stay here.

Text: Staff was super polite, but rooms are very antiquated and need more water pressure in the shower.
