Indy Hostel

Text: Had a great experience for using a hostel for my first time. It was easy to locate and not far from the concert I was attending. I had scheduled my check in at 10a.m., but I had missed my bus and hadn't gotten there until 6p.m. the owner was out, so I texted him that I wouldn't have time to really check in due to the concert doors closing at 7, I had only 40 minutes to get where I needed, the owner/manager promptly texted me back the code to the door and told me which room was mine, I dropped my stuff off and made the concert In time. When I got back from the concert I noticed there had not been power. The room was very cozy and the bed was one of the most relaxing beds I've laid on in a long time. The manager got there a check out time the next morning, she was very pleasant to talk to and she had told me that I would be refunded due to the power being out. All in all it was a nice, cozy environment and if I go back to Indianapolis for what ever reasons, I'm booking Indy Hostel

Text: I loved this place because I felt comfortable as soon as I walked in. This place has typical hostel style sleeping arrangements and even a private room.  You can tell some people stay for several days.  I stayed for a night and was so impressed.  Very clean and friendly environment.  If you are looking for an out of the box "hotel" experience I encourage  you to stay at this hostel. Remember to set up your check in time before you show up - there is no lobby

Text: Great little spot. The price is right and the stay was comfortable. My six foot three self was very comfortable in my bunk bed. Though was never quite sure who the staff was after my first night lol. Good way to meet other people traveling.
