Grayson Lake State Park
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed at the Grayson Lake Campground over Labor Day Weekend. The campsite size was impressive, the grounds were well maintained, and the Bath-House/Restrooms were decently clean. The lake itself is beautiful. There are several hiking trails that lead you around the lake. This park is massive, and it has many Shelter Houses and playgrounds for kids and families to enjoy. Overall our stay at Grayson was delightful and we would return.

Text: Sites are very accessible to rigs....there are even a few pull thrus.    Bath houses generally good but it took several minutes for hot water to come thru lines.   Start the water running a bit before you step in or you'll have a shock  : ).  Beautiful setting with a golf course adjacent.  We saw lots of rabbits & deer in the evening.    Our stay was a Wed.  night & park was not busy at all.

Text: Perfect for a weekend camping trip. The staff were friendly and helpful. There were 2 bath houses and a playground for small children.  Most of the campsites were flat. They took my walk up request for a site with a smile and even have me information on the nearby lake which is GORGEOUS.
