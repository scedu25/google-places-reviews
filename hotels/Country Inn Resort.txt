Country Inn Resort
Rating: 5
Text: The time we spent at Country Inn Resort was just what we needed. The owners, Rich and Mary, live on site and take great pride in their business. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The pool is nice along with grills and pavilion. They are located very close to Mark Twain Lake and just a few minutes from Hannibal. Rich makes great coffee and it is ready by 6 am each morning. Allow a few minutes to hear an interesting morning tale from Rich or ask him about the series of pictures on his wall! We could not stop laughing early in the morning!

Text: Stayed 6/10/16- 6/12/16. The people who run it are wonderful people. The rooms are clean and nice. One complaint I have at a lot of places I stay, is water pressure in shower. Not at Country Inn. Good pressure for sure. Not one con for me when staying here. The parking area is spacious which is nice for boaters. You are only minutes from the lake, the landing, and food. Not mention you will be staying at a family atmosphere. Definitely will return, and would recommend to anyone.
