Text: It's a beautiful space for festivals, events, weddings or cabin or treehouse or yurt rental.  Quiet and peaceful about 20 minutes outside Berea

Text: Really gorgeous spot with wonderful people and a ton of great stuff. First of all, the food is KILLER! Not only is it fresh and local, but Nathan is an extremely talented chef. The accommodations are amazing, from a treehouse (with another in the works!) to a teepee to a yurt, with plenty of space to camp if you prefer. And I haven't had the chance to attend one of their gatherings, but I hear they're amazing, too! Whether you're looking for an event space or a place to crash (they're on AirBnB!), do yourself a favor and check them out! Photo by Gerry James
