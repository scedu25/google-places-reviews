Echo Bluff Lodge

Text: Everything about this location is fake. The state demolished what remained of an old summer camp and built expensive and inauthentic  accommodations  while bulldozing history. They give false names to places and settings while charging the same as night at the Four Seasons, complete with kurigs and flat screen TVs. An opportunity to rebuild the quaint childhood summer camps of the region's youth became a gross example of an open checkbook with no balance sheet.

Text: We stayed at the Echo Bluff Lodge and our room was upgraded to a suite in the off-season. Our suite had a kitchen, 2 bedrooms, and a pull-out sofa. The room also had a gas fire place. It was located on the bottom floor, which made me worry that noise might be an issue. However, it wasn't. Despite the traffic outside our room, we did not hear anything throughout the entire night. We had dinner in the lodge restaurant, and it was delicious. Our stay was great, and I am excited to go back in the future!
