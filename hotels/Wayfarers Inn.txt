Text: Very nice place to escape too for peace of mind. Owners seemed really nice and the property was in great condition and made me feel at home. I would always come back and very reasonable pricing.

Text: I stayed here for two nights due to rough weather. The rooms were clean, simple, and quite notably, the owner(s) were quite kind.  This establishment is very traveller friendly.
