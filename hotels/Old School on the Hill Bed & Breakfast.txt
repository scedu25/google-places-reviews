Text: Unique and friendly b*b.  Debbie and Leroy are gracious hosts.  The room we stayed in was spacious and charming. Tour and story of the old school house is both historical and entertaining.  Also with vision and capital Chamois can become a destination city on the Missouri River.  Be sure to leave a message on one of the original black boards.
