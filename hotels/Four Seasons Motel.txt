Text: This is mom and pop motel. Rooms are clean and breakfast is scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy. Cereal and muffins. Rooms on the hill are large with a leather recliner. Some have 2. These are the nice rooms. Rooms on the lower side are not as nice. Single beds. Smaller rooms. Owners are sweet as pie and will accommodate you with all respect. I enjoy staying there and I'm there quit a bit for work.

Text: I've been staying here for about 18 months and have always been treated as a friend instead of a guest. I would recommend this motel to anyone who wants a great place to stay the night.
