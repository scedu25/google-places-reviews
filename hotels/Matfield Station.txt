Text: I was visiting from Australia, and the hosts - a wonderful family - were welcoming in the best prairie tradition.   Lovely comfortable Casita, a great night's rest and a magnificent landscape to be part of.   Bill is a sculptor with a fascinating oeuvre, some of which is on display right there!  Well worth a visit!

Text: Way more serene and beautiful than I thought. Trains pass very often but you get use to it quick. It's part of the novelty. The Tallgrass Preserve is just a short drive away and it's breathtaking.
