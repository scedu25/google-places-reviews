Text: Park owner David is amazingly kind and the park is wonderful. The people here for the most part are very friendly with one exception....the exception is easily ignored.

Text: This is the worst rv park I have ever stayed in. It is filthy, the bathrooms and showerhouse are covered in black mold, people live there in run down campers that should be in a junkyard, drug use among residents is rampant, dogs are allowed to run free to get into trash or attack other dogs. Dont waste your money there, there are way nicer campgrounds in the area to choose from.
