Text: We were there for "Girls Weekend" , there were 8 of us for our annual sister weekend. The grounds and rooms were beautiful! Most of the meals were delicious! We did have fun horseback riding and sip and paint.   My compalnts are this was a girls weekend you expect to pe pampered.  We had 4 ladies in each room, one small bottle of shampoo, no bar soap, only 4 towels. We asked for more  towels and were told she was only allowed to give us 1 per person.  We did ask   for more shampoo, she appolgized, and told us she only did what she was told, she did give us a few more. Most of the help there were kind and helpful, but the lady who runs the place was not. I felt she treated us like childresn. We had to take off our shoes to eneter the lodge. We were scolded when we sat down for dinner before the dinner bell, and when I asked when we could gon to the buffet she told she picked table.  Needless to say she picked our tabke last ( punishment for arriving to early) .
