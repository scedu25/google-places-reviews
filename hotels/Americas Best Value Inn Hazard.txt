Text: Staying at this motel was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. From the beginning of my stay until the end, something was always going wrong. I can recall no ice being available, shortage of towels and washcloths, dirty rooms and the air conditioning not working, just to name a few. If that wasn't bad enough, staff members questioned who every person that visited my room was. Yes, this is where I am from and my family often visited me during my stay. But that's not the worst part. I had a receipt showing my balance paid in full until the day of my check out. My balance due $0 on the morning of my check out. I let the guy at the front desk know I was checking out and double checking my bill. He said I owed $88. How is that? I paid for my room each and every day, even would say "what do I owe you today?" I questioned the bill and told him I don't think I owe this giving my receipt as proof. As the guy at front desk and I was trying to figure my bill out, the strange maintenance man approaches the desk as well. He began to very loudly scream and cuss at me that I was wrong. He is very unprofessional and creepy.

Text: The bed is very comfy which to me is most important and the location is good! The rooms need remodling pretty bad. Seems like it has been through alot. Has a shower and cable. Plus free grab and go breakfast always a plus!! Nothing to brag home about but meets the needs!! Although when I was checking in my room the lady in the front said they had to deal with a wife going crazy this morning cause she found her hubby here with a mistress...life has a way of throwing you curve balls huh!!
