Cherry's Guest House Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Warm comfortable place to stay. It's like going back in time when things were simple. I've stayed at Cherry's Guest House many times. It's always clean and smoke free. Plenty of parking. The neighbor is quiet and just off the square. There is a Italian Place right up the street. Get the pizza I know it's not on the menu but ask they have it and they have to go so you can take it back to the room and enjoy. I've stayed in all 3 apartments and like them all but I love the back one the best it's huge. It's like a house within a house.

Text: Cherry's Guest House is a wonderful place to relax. It's very similar to going to Grandma's house. Extremely quiet home just off the square in Pittsfield IL. It you want a off the grid experience without the hassles then this is the place for you. High tech here is cable TV. The great room is so roomy. Sleeps 10 people.
