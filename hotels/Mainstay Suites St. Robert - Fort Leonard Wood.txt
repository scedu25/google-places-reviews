Mainstay Suites St. Robert - Fort Leonard Wood

Text: I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There's a reason why the ratings are so high. I spent a little over three months here, and I was consistently treated with friendliness and respect by everyone. From the day before I arrived until the day I checked out the managers Belinda, Jo Ann, and Gilbert were accommodating on such a level that I have never experienced at any other hotel. Other employees such as Nick and Doug were always friendly and willing to strike up a conversation when time permitted. Joseph always made sure breakfast was out on time which was very helpful on early PT days. The room cleanliness was also excellent. I was always impressed with the amount of detail that Mary Ann put into the upkeep of my room. I will miss all the employees of this hotel as they made my three month stay away from my family much more enjoyable. The next time I come to Ft Leonard Wood I will definitely be staying here, and I will recommend it to all who pass through.

Text: After a very long 26 hours driving from Arizona to Michigan we needed to stop and get some rest. We were roughly 10 miles away and started an online search for a decent room close by. Every hotel we called seem to be booked or just didn't answer. We called Mainstay Suites and they answered the phone quickly, got us booked with a room and wished us a safe travel to their hotel. We got in and the gentleman working the front desk was  very polite and got us all settled to get some rest. The hotel room was gorgeous and served it's purpose for our overnight stay. We got up got ourselves a nice hot shower and were on our way. Mainstay won our vote for a room after answering promptly and being so kind to our family. Thanks for a great stay. BAKER FAMILY FROM AZ

Text: I was surprised with this discount hotel. All other big brand hotels had no vacancy and I was worried that this place would be terrible. I was wrong. I was really impressed!

Text: The staff at Mainstay Suites in St. Robert, MO are the nicest people and they have always helped me right away with anything I've asked of them.  Over several weeks of staying at Mainstay, my kids caused trouble at times,  and they were always professional and sincere when ever they approached me with their concerns. The hotel is always clean in all areas. They have all supplies readily available and willing to accommodate extras when i've needed anything.
