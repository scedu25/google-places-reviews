Drury Inn & Suites St. Louis Fenton
Rating: 5
Text: I love Drurys so much and this one is just as I expected. Clean, modern, friendly staff. Nice little pool and fitness area. Great heavy snack/dinner buffet and breakfast. Love the 3 free alcoholic drinks on those stressful days and the kids love the evening popcorn snack. I'll continue to make Drury my first choice because of properties like this one.

Text: Extremely quiet for being right over the lobby and breakfast area. Only hotel with indoor/outdoor pool and hot tub. Good location to Fenton and downtown St Louis. Highly recommended for location, food, and friendly staff.

Text: The hospitality has been incredible.  I'm used to a desk clerk taking my name and giving me a key.  Here, Cathy made honest conversation and recommendations for us.  The amenities at this hotel chain are second to none.  The pool is great and there is even a small kiddie pool.  If you take into account the breakfast ($10-$15) and dinner ($25-$30) savings, the value of staying at a Drury in is just stupid good.
