Red Roof Inn & Suites Danville, IL

Text: For being a new hotel, it needs  improvements. Wash cloths were dirty. Toilet seat was not properly secured. And the sink did not drain properly. Aside from those three things, the rest was not so bad. Beds and pillows were clean and water pressure and temp in shower was really good. The hotel lobby was clean and front desk help was friendly when we checked in. Was not able to  partake on breakfast as we were in a hurry. If it wasn't for the bathroom issues, I would have given them a 4-star rating.

Text: Good prices...the rooms have a peculiar smell and the pool was out of service.....day staff and evening staff welcoming helpful and friendly......Megha and Nancy were particularly kind. One night staffer was very unfriendly.....luckily every one else made up for the one desk clerk who was not so nice. Thanks for a good weekend...

Text: Stayed here back in Dec 16, and was very happy. Pet room was very clean and quiet, and the rooms open inside (which feels safer when I'm traveling alone). Front desk staff were friendly. Having stayed in a similarly-priced hotel in the area that was much, much worse, I will definitely stop here on my next trip home for the holidays! The only down side is that I didn't realize from the hotel's website that there is a fee for a second pet, but it's only $10.
