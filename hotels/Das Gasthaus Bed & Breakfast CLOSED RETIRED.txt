Text: A great little bed and breakfast with great host, and good breakfast. Unfortunately they are planning on closing at the end if the month after being in business for 10 years. They are hoping someone will buy the house and keep the bed and breakfast going.

Text: Was passing through and stay here 1 night.  Was the only guest that night.  House has been beautifully restored and the home cooked breakfast was great.  Would recommend to anyone in the area.
