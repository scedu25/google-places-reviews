Rating: 5
Text: Room was big and clean-- beds were comfy. 
Staff was friendly and helpful. 
Breakfast was the typical Holiday Inn Express breakfast (which I enjoy) and the eating area was large with plenty of seating. 
There is a pool and hot tub available, as well as guest laundry.  
Thank you for a great stay!

Text: Room was clean and spacious. The fitness room was a little small but served its purpose. The pool and spa were a relaxing area to be in. There were a lot of options to choose from during breakfast. Overall the experience was great!
