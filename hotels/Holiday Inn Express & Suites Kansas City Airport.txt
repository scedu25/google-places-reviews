Holiday Inn Express & Suites Kansas City Airport

Text: Nice hotel with annoying "Smart" features.  You have to put your key card in a thing by the door to power on everything.  There is also a sensor in the bathroom that activates the vent.  The vent stays on for a long time....the breakfast is average to OK.  The hotel is clean and nice.  Beds are comfortable.  The floors are loud though...I was woken up by the person above me at 6:30 AM.

Text: Opened in 2009, so still pretty new now (2017). A fun ars deco feel with friendly staff; a decent pantry; and close elevators (important to a massage therapist like me). Very close to the airport near I29. Under some construction but still plenty of parking.

Text: Nice room, very clean. Only 2 complaints: the floor is very loud. Can easily hear the room occupants above walking around. Also, not fond of the "key" that must remain in the energy efficient slot by the door to run all the lights. The bathroom fan runs alot.

Text: This hotel was pretty much exactly what I expected. It was clean and had great amenities. Two things stood out. First the breakfast was so good! There was a wide variety and it actually tasted great. The other thing that stood out was the pool. There was a great set up with the pool and the hot tub, but it was freezing! My toddler refused to get in!

Text: We had a wonderful stay in our very large modern room. Everything was clean and new. Staff was friendly and accommodating. It seemed like a great location to hit worlds of fun and some downtown attractions. Yes we will stay here for our next visit to KC
