Text: Room was a little bit dated. Fire smoke detector was missing and wires hung down. Lady at front desk was extremely helpful. After knowing that we had a terrible ordeal prior to our arrival, she saw us first thing and said she hoped we had a good night sleep.  Very nice lady!

Text: It's a great little motel and most of it's owned by a true red blooded American. it's the only place I'll stay if I'm within 50 miles of it.

Text: Hidden gem! My husband and I were wary of the low cost ($45) as our recent experiences with other motels were awful. I am glad we gave the Acova Inn a chance! 

The room (#10) was immaculate! It is obvious that the owner takes pride in her establishment. The room was HUGE, with two comfy queen beds, a separate kitchenette area, and a nice bathroom. Very quiet! The manager was very accommodating, staying well past the normal office hours to help us check-in @10pm. 

I highly recommend the Acova Inn Motel to anyone looking for an affordable, cozy alternative to the national chains.
