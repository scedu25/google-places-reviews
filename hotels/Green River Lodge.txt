Green River Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Very quaint and down to earth hospitality.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay of four days.  This motel is not the Ritz, so if you're looking for chocolates on the pillow, keep going; but if you're looking for a country/lodge type place, you have found it.  Every effort was made to see that any need was met.  Swing with table and chairs encourage good conversation out front.  Beds were comfortable, lots of tv channels, shower in room 102 was great.  I would stay here again and feel a sense of sadness upon leaving.  And don't forget to eat at the Farm Boy.  Yummy food with a trip back in time!  Happy traveling!

Text: Very nice place. Clean, friendly, just make sure you put the do not disturb on the door or the housekeeper will bust in your door two hours before checkout while you and your other half are in the middle of intimate things!! NOT COOL. then she goin to play like " no English"

Text: Recently spent two nights here. The manager Rolen was very friendly and hospitable. We had multiple rooms for family from Louisville and Forida as we were in town for a funeral. He accommodated all our needs. The rates were very reasonable and the rooms were very clean. Only downfall for me was the lack of coffee pot in room. Thank You  Rolen for your great hospitality . I would score it 4 of 5 only because of no coffee pot and lack of good internet . Thank You from Karen Bates and family.

Text: Really friendly and helpful manager! My room was clean and newly remodeled with hardwood laminate flooring and new bedspread. Reasonable weekly pricing. Only downside was stained sheets and WiFi doesn't work well.
