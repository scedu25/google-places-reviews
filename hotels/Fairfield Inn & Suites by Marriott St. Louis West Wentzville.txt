Text: I got stuck here while waiting for my work truck to be fixed over night. Hotel was clean and spotless.  Great little pool and workout room, a better than usual free breakfast, and a late noon checkout time! I had to wait a while longer for my truck and they had no issue with me reading in the lobby while I waited. Great hotel!

Text: Hotel was nice, little outdated. When I arrived in my first room I found a yellow substance in the bed. I went down to the front desk and noticed the guest representative and she immediately put me into another room. The second room was clean and no issues except a very loud shower head when the water was turned on. 

I would not stay at this location again.
