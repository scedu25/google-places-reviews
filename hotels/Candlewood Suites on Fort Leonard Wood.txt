Text: We stayed here on Fri., 9-01-2017.
The check-in was fast & easy.
The room was great: clean, king bed in big bedroom, very good living area, great kitchenette, full-sized refrigerator.
The breakfast was great. 
The outdoor pool checked the block. 
If you are going to stay for a while, there is a good outdoor grill space with the required tools available. 
It is walking distance to the PX, mini mall, commissary. 
We would definitely stay again. 
We stayed here because it was mid way between our home and our travel destination. We like these hotels on military bases in part because of the peace & quiet, and this place did not disappoint.

Text: Not bad for post lodging. Place was nice and room was very clean and modern. The only complaint was breakfast. Selection of food was great but it was cold and tasted like it had been cooked the night before. Recommend to at least keep it hot somehow better than you are doing now. But overall best place to stay when visiting this base.

Text: Everything about my stay here was great from the breakfast in the a.m. to crawling into a comfy bed at night. Kitchenette and laundry facilities made my stay so convenient.  The staff was great and when we were faced with a terrible weather storm the staff handled the evacuation from our room to a safe room in a calm and professional manner. Great location on base. I look forward to booking my next visit here.  Keep up the great hospitality folks!
