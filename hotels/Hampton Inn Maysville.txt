Text: Lovely place to stay. Staff is incredible. The hotel is convenient to everything, and their breakfast is just wonderful with several delicious items from which to choose. One word of caution: try to avoid a room near the pool. Some guests can be a bit rowdy.

Text: Traveled here for business, stayed in a king room. Everything was clean, pressed, and organized like it should be. Had to leave in a hurry and skipped what looked like a great breakfast, but grabbed one of their snack bags to go. Staff was friendly and exactly the right amount of helpful. If I find myself in the area I will be staying here again!

Text: The woman who checked me in was incredibly pleasant and helpful. Wish I could identify her. It was 9/20 after 5, but I don't remember her name. The room was clean and a nice size. Everything was comfortable. Only thing that could be adjusted is that the tv was on the small side and located really far from the bed. Good location with access to restaurants and stores. Continental breakfast was ok.
