Text: We had an issue with another hotel, and they gladly accommodated us on short notice.  Nick checked us in with no problems and offered any assistance we needed. The rooms were clean and had a mini fridge and microwave. The pool was nice and held at a nice temperature.  The breakfast was great, only wish they would have offered sausage as well as bacon. Will definitely stay here again!

Text: Clean rooms, marble counter tops, and the air conditioners across the room from the bed, making it quieter than some hotels.  A couple downsides are that the smaller rooms do not have refrigerators or microwaves, and the other side of the room isn't as far away as I would like (read, some rooms are pretty small).  It does have quick access to downtown, which houses some very nice places to eat, and a beautiful park.

Overall, I would still choose this hotel over many of the other options in town.

Text: This is a nice place to stay. The hotel is clean and in a good location one of the newer hotels in walking distance to Bob Evans, and a few other places to eat. This property serves  nice breakfast as well.
