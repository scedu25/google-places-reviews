Long's Retreat Family Resort
Rating: 5
Text: One of the most enjoyable family oriented venues in Ohio. Very friendly staff & eager to help with any problem. So many things to do from go karts to paddle boats. All the amenities are well cared for and the lots are well placed. We come here multiple times a year and enjoy it every time. Prices for spots are more than fair. Just make sure to secure a spot early on holidays.

Text: Loved this...in off-season. Nice, quiet, secluded. Even enjoyed the fact there was no cell phone signal and if you wanted wifi, you had to pay for it. Not many places like that anymore.  Great laundry facility and a bit less expensive than other places we've been (3.50/load vs 4.00). Also, expansive areas to walk... paved to gravel roads and hills to climb.  Lots ous permanent RVs set up but few were there while we were.  Only thing undesirable is the fact they accept no reservations. After a long day of travel, would have been unthinkable to arrive and there not be a spot.  However, with 600 sites, maybe this has not been an issue?

Text: We were so surprised how big this facility was and how many things there were to do here. We had a great time using this place for our family reunion and many of us stayed in onsite accommodations.

Text: Great fun place. Lots to do. Friendly helpful staff. They did not get a 4 or 5 because the loops where rv sites are have no gravel and they turned into a mud hole when it rained. I've been in many campgrounds and for the price these spots were lousy. One other good point, they have trash pickup.

Text: Lots of family fun things to do here. The owners have done a very good job. Lake swimming, 2 waterslides, mini-golf, arcade, several places to get food, large camp store with excellent selections, hand dipped ice cream, paddle boats, and more. I think there are also a carousel and inflatable bouncy house. It's like a mini amusement park in the middle of beautiful natural scenery.
