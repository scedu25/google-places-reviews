Text: This hotel was an amazing resource during my son's wedding! Blocks of rooms were booked for all the out of town guests and not a complaint from any of them. They all raved at how well they were taken care of. On top of that they allowed us space to host the dress rehearsal dinner which was very convenient for the guests coming in from out of town staying there. Kudos to your great manager Sue! She was of great assistance even contacting the bride to make sure everything was ready for our guests! Terrific staff and a central location to Liberty and restaurants you will love this Fairfield in & Suites by Marriott.

Text: Very accommodating to guests, clean rooms and comfortable pillows. My car had died in the parking lot and the manager was kind enough to offer her vehicle and help jump start my car. The rest of the staff was very kind. Hospitality is here! I had a two week stay.

Text: The front desk staff was hospitable and upgraded our room for an impromptu family vacation, however, the room didn't have light bulbs in the fixtures above the bed, and had a weird mildew smell. The breakfast was very nice but as soon as it hit 10, the woman locked the milk up and got rid of all of the juice and we asked for some for our 4 year old and were told no. I understand putting things away but the milk was in small cartons. She could have been a little more understanding.

Text: The rooms are tiny! Barely enough room for a king size bed. The water pressure in the shower is great though! Hot breakfast was nothing great. Good selection, but the quality of the food was lacking a bit. Super friendly staff. Easy to find. Right off the highway with lots of places to eat and easy access to gas stations. It was perfect for a quick stop to sleep on our road trip, but I doubt we will stay here again. Not worth the $140 we paid for 1 nights stay.

Text: Wonderful place to stay. Very comfortable bed. Very clean room. Bathroom was perfect. Good water pressure and shower height. The rest of the hotel was clean and comfortable. Good vibes. Be prepared to pay extra for city fees and a couple different taxes.
