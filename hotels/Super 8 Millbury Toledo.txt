Text: I stay here at least once a week. The rooms are always clean. The showers always work. They have a great TV/satellite system. Plenty of parking for big trucks. The bar across the parking lot has great food and cold beer (get it by the bucket, it's cheaper).

Text: For the price, it was a good place to stay. I think I got a good value. The place is a little worn down, but it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Don't expect a 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for, and I got my money's worth. The staff were very friendly, and the sheets, towels, etc were clean and newer. I have no complains!

Text: GPS does not take you right to it. Definitely needs lots of upkeep, but very cheap price for a night. Air conditioner did not work very well but bed was comfortable.

Text: For the price paid t be room was great. It may not look like much on the outside but the rooms are clean and everything works. It's in the middle of No where but it's quiet and cheap. Definitely coming back here on the next visit.
