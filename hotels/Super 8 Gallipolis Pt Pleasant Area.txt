Super 8 Gallipolis Pt Pleasant Area

Text: It is the cleanest hotel in 6 states, you can literally eat off the floors, I highly recommend this hotel, I stayed at a lot of places. The pool and hot tub was actually in working order and extremely clean. The staff, and I do mean all the staff's attitudes were very much outgoing and genuinely friendly it wasn't a fake just because they had to. You would be foolish to stay any where else. I have seen  4 and 5 star hotels that did not match this quality. Thank you for everything.

Text: This clean, friendly hotel has a great continental breakfast and the pool is bigger and deeper than the others on our trip. They treat veterans very well & the furniture in the room is locally made. I love that they support local businesses. I slept like a baby. ?

Text: We really like this hotel and stay here every time we come to town. They have ladies that will make your waffles for you on three flavors. Rooms clean and comfortable. Good location. Inside pool and hot tub are nice when you can get in to use them.

Text: Despite the 7 foot creature with glowing red eyes and no neck perched at the very top of the Point Pleasant Bridge across the street, this Super 8 gave me the Presidential Suite with a warm, knowing smile. No joke, my room is boss AF. #MM17
