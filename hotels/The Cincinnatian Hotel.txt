Text: Clean. Quiet. Nice, unique rooms. Helpful staff. Business clientele. Restaurant serves three meals and happy hour. No complaints which is rare for a hotel!

Text: Love the historic style, all the interior decor in the common areas was awesome. The furniture in the room was pretty cool, too, just not *as* cool. Big jacuzzi tub in the bathroom and his and hers sinks. Bed was comfy, though not my favorite pillows ever. Room was very dark which was nice, though it was because there was only one tiny window. There was a fake fireplace in the room which was kind of odd but a nice touch.

Text: My fiance and I spent the night at The Cincinnatian Hotel for a concert. When we got back, he proposed. The staff was very helpful by setting up rose petals in the room along with champagne. We are very grateful for their wonderful hospitality!

Text: Total pit! We were in the presidential suite. Over $1,300 per night. Heat didn't work, shower broken, phone broken, dirty! Manager gave us our money back and we checked out after one night. On the plus side the manager was nice and didn't argue, which leads me to believe I wasn't the only one to complain.

Text: We came to The Cincinnatian for an overnight stay and they exceeded our expectations. The staff was very friendly and the room was spectacular. Clean, modern, and comfortable are the words to describe it. It is close in relation to everything downtown. I will definitely return!
