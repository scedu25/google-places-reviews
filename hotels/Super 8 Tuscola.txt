Text: Nice reception, room appeared clean. Further inspection revealed small bugs in the bathroom. Then we saw a cockroach on the other bed. Manager moved us. They never "found" the bugs. Why would I make that up. They took nothing extra off the room for the bug inconvenience. We won't stay there again.

Text: The front staff was very friendly and got me checked in and out efficiently. My room was very new and super clean. The bathroom and furnishings seemed of high quality. Breakfast was plentiful even though the motel was fully booked. I had a great experience!

Text: I was driving to Tn from Canada with  26ft Uhaul. I stopped off at 8:00 am in the morning, I had been driving all night and was exhausted.  Normal check out time 11:00am . I believe the manager on duty was Allen. He was very nice and accommodating.  I asked if i could get a later check out time so i could get more than 3 hours of sleep and then take a shower   to get refreshed before I got back on the road. He asked if 2:00 would be OK. I said absolutely. He was able to see how exhausted I was and I believe that if I had asked to stay longer, he would have let me. The room I had was VERY clean and everything  looked new. I would stay here again if I were going this way. 
If you are looking for a place to stay in Illinois, make this a stop.

Text: Good looking room. Decent accommodations. Bed is comfortable, pillows and linens are good. Nice to have a microwave and mini fridge in room. Only 2 towels and a tiny tv, seem a little skimpy for around $100 a night. It was clean and is comfortable enough. Bonus, we could have our dog stay with us.
