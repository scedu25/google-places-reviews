Text: I was very impressed with this hotel. We were on a 6 day trip and this was by far the best hotel we stayed in.  The guest services were very helpful and courteous. I got the best nights sleep I've had in years! The pillows were ultra comfy too.  Breakfast was wonderful and even the cleaning staff was cheerful.  Plus there was a Starbucks right next door.  I will recommend this hotel to everyone I know and we will definitely stop here again!

Text: I can't imagine why any reviews above a star or two exist for this hotel. 
The staff are very friendly. That's the only thing good about this hotel. However, this place needs help - desperately! Our room was so musty smelling that 3 of us immediately started feeling congested and then the sneezing started. I checked a few other rooms as we were walking out, and they all smelled as bad. The breakfast was one of the least impressive I've seen at this level of hotel. They let us check out a day early without cost due to the condition of the room(s). We went to the hotel next door. A BIG step up for the same cost.
