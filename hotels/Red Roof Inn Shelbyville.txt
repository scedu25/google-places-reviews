Red Roof Inn Shelbyville
Rating: 1
Text: Highly dissatisfied. Room had only one working light. Cords cut off of wall lamps. Table in room but no chairs to sit in. No breakfast of any kind offered. Coffee pot in room broken. Air conditioner would only run for about three minutes then shut down ( thankfully it wasn't hot outside). Only given two towels for three people. No soap to even shower with. Every vending machine was empty. Every selection on every machine! Will not be back to this property.

Text: Booked a room. Checked in, went to room.  Noticed the non-smoking room smelled of smoke.  Then I started finding beetles and stink bugs.  They are bad this time of year.  I get it.  But if I'm paying for a room, I expect to be the only occupant. After evicting 10 bugs saw tons more,  went to the front desk and asked for a refund which I got without issue.  The front desk clerk told me that they need to call the exterminator.  I told her that was a good idea and left. Stay very far away from this place!

Text: It's honestly worth it to pay the extra 20 bucks to stay somewhere else. I stayed there a week ago. The first room had no a/c the second room the a/c barely worked and was covered in bugs. I went back and asked for a refund. While she contacted her boss to ask for a refund I heard her explain to him that she put me in the room that 3 other people had already complained about the ac that day. That's not in the least bit cool. Also it's been 9 days and my refund hasn't came threw my bank Yet. I used to stay there all the time when it was Days Inn now I will never rent a room there again.
