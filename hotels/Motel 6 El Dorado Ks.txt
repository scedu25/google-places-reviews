Motel 6 El Dorado Ks

Text: I really liked that the rooms were updated and clean! My favorite part of my stay was the insane water pressure. There were a few things I didn't like though. First off, we got a room with a king size bed and it only had 3 pillows, secondly I was in from out of town and had an early appointment. I woke up around 7 to get ready and there was no coffee maker in my room, my boyfriend said they had a coffee maker in the lobby, unfortunately the staff hadn't made coffee yet so we had to make a trip to McDonald's. Lastly, in comparison to other places I've stayed this place offers the bare minimum. Yes they have a microwave and fridge but no coffee pot, no shampoos, all that was in our room was a bar of soap... I travel light so I just packed clothes and expected to get a room that had toiletries. Luckily Walmart is a short drive. Other than that I slept great and this place is clean. My boyfriend didn't sleep very well at all and complained that the bed was too hard.

Text: Spent the night here while traveling from Ohio to New Mexico.  The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  The room and grounds were neat as a pin!  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd recommend this to anyone traveling or visiting the area.  Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay.

Text: The room was Spartan, but clean. You will need to bring your own toiletries and hair dryer as these are not provided. If you bring these then this is a good place to stay for the price.

Text: I stayed and could no have been more delighted.  Rooms were clean, modern, great location and the staff so nice.  The photo's need to be updated because it just does not do justice.
