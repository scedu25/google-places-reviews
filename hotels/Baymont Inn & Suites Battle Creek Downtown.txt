Baymont Inn & Suites Battle Creek Downtown
Rating: 3
Text: Room was OK. Clean with typical appointments for this level. I dislike the heating units under the window. Typically range from too warm to cool throughout the night and are loud. The continental breakfast is poor. Only dry cereal and waffle machine. No fruit or protein.

Text: My grievances are few, mainly just a loudly humming fridge that seemed to kick on randomly throughout the night. The room was clean, the food good, the staff helpful... I enjoyed my stay.

Text: Every time I come to Battle Creek I stay here, and I must admit for the pricing level this is one fine hotel. Never had much of an issue with my stays, and their breakfast puts other continental breakfasts to shame. Only comment I would make is close to checkout time the key card can sometimes begin to stop working, but that's a minor issue. Other than that it's a great hotel for the price!
