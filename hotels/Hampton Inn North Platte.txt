Hampton Inn North Platte
Rating: 5
Text: This place was clean, staff friendly, and the breakfast was good. I am used to staying at Holiday Inn Expresses, and for the same cost Hampton Inn is winning! The breakfast food is much better! After this experience I will be looking to stay at more Hampton Inn's.

Text: A beautiful hotel. Great breakfast area with wonderful selection of food. If you go hungry it's your own fault. Neat and clean. What rooms I did see could use an update but they were clean and that is top in my book!

Text: Well the room, people and services are great as expected.  The hot tub is ridiculously small.  The pool area is huge but has a hot tub made for children.  They have plenty of room for a 8 to 10 person tub but have one that is cozy for 2 adults.  We also had some equipment stolen off out trailer.  The lack of security is very surprising.

Text: The hotel is very easy to get to from the highway. The person at the front desk was very friendly. The temperature in the room was perfect. The beds were comfortable and the bathtub is much bigger than a standard tub, providing plenty of room to soak and relax.
