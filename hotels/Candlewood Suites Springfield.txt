Text: Great place to stay. Clean and a quiet place to get a good night's sleep. The front desk help is top notch. Tracy is on of the best. She and the other staff will go out of there way to make sure your stay is enjoyable and confertable. I spend many night away from home in hotels and this is by far one of the best.

-For a great price Candlewood feels damned just like home. The amazing staff has treated me BETTER than family. I've been staying here for 8 months and I have 5 more months to go. I never thought I'd say I will miss a budget friendly hotel.

-My room has always been immaculate all 32 weeks. Easily the nicest extended stay hotel I've ever stayed in. (I travel for work and stayed in maybe 20 or more so far.) The bed, sheets, pillows, cutlery, cookware, bathrooms, and appliances are all new and nice.

-Free restaurant-catered supper on Wednesday nights as a thank you to the guests.

You will definitely enjoy every aspect of your stay.

Text: The best hotel I have ever been too. My family and I were staying in Springfield IL while our father was in the ICU at St. Johns Hospital for three weeks. The staff and owner at Candlewood Suites could not have been more accommodating. During one of the most difficult times in my life the owner made it so easy for us to have a place to stay while we were in and out of the hospital all day long. The rooms are so large and clean. Everything you need for extended stay is either in your room or available for rent. You can even rent movies. The kitchenette comes complete with everything we needed to save money by eating in the hotel during such a financially difficult time. I am forever grateful to these amazing people and truly feel God place them in our lives during that time. We cannot say enough good things and advise everyone staying in the Springfield area to stay at Candlewood Suites.
