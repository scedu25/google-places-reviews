Text: Great people and good land. Had the best whitetail hunt of my life. Jeff has got his places dialed in. I harvest the biggest buck of my life and it was with my bow. I will be back.

Text: Lodging was horrible and Jeff was the worst guide ever for turkey hunting. This guy knows little to nothing about turkey hunting. I? wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy. He advertises about 20,000 acres to hunt on and truly only has about 25 acres. He does have a lot of land that he trespasses on that we found out about from all of the locals in Glen Elder. Me and 5 of my buddies wasted about $8,000 going to this place to turkey hunt. The beds had spiders in them and hair from what look to be the people that stayed there before us where it hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived.
