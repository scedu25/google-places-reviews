Text: Love our new home we got in March but moved in May. Very quiet neighborhood. Very homey and peaceful. Amazing manager who will work with you and ensure you are happy there. Wonderful community. Beautiful homes. Really recommend it to anyone and everyone. Affordable, beautiful homes and lots. Maintenance here is wonderful and always on top of things. This is the best place and my favorite place I have ever lived. Such a great community to be apart of. Feel very safe here. Has security people which makes my children and I feel safe. Kid friendly neighborhood.

Text: Wonderful community and the people that live here are kind and nice. Mike is such a wonderful landlord and great person and his maintenance crew are amazing as well. In my 49 years of living in all different places this is by far the best place as a caring community and caring people that run the community.

Text: Money hungry. Can't have pools or any big accessories outside. Can't let your dog out. They're always on to you for something. Takes them forever to fix any problems.
