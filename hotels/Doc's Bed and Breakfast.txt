Doc's Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Very reasonable rates for long term or short stays. All the perks of a beautiful hotel but feels like you are sleeping at home. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in wray. Guest for life.

Text: Wonderful historic home renovated to a BnB. The staff and proprietor are of the utmost respectful and helpful individuals you could want. Rooms are cozy with private baths in each. The decor is reflective of the history of the home with contemporary yet historic furnishings. The culinary expressions at breakfast are exquisite and unmatched by any in the area.

Text: Stayed there for business a few years ago, and I must say that despite having odd feelings about staying in a Bed and Breakfast for the 1st time, i was pleasantly surprised. the people were nice, the rooms were really nice and it was overall way better than i had set myself up to believe it could be. would highly recommend it to anyone staying in the area

Text: The room, service, and hospitality were fantastic.  I was in the area to work with a sales rep and he recommended staying at Doc's- I was glad he did.  I didn't partake in the breakfast, but it looked and smelled FANTASTIC.  Room was clean, comfy, and reasonably priced.  Very helpful/accommodating owners/staff.  If I'm ever in the area again for work or play, I plan on staying there and having some Creekside Tavern Pizza!!
