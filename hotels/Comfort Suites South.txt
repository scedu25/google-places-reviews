Text: Loved the lady that checked us in, sorry I didn't get her name.  She was happy and very friendly. We had a great night.

Text: For the elegant vibe they strive to look, there is a lot lacking. I was greeted by a woman beating me through the front door as she blew the smoke away from her face, but dressed well. The room was very clean. The breakfast was subpar. The cooked items looked like children's plastic food toys. The boiled eggs were rubbery and fake. But there was fresh fruit and other good looking items. The pool and hot tub looked good. However when they say it opens at 6am they mean the door is unlocked but the hot tub isn't bubbling or warm. They have an office center I didn't use but looked organized and clean. Comfortable stay, but not classy like they strive to show.

Text: There is not much around here within walking distance, everything is at least a 15 drive. But the hotel is in good shape and the breakfast offering standard. It is a good stay for a business trip.

Text: It was very clean and comfortable. We were able to bring our 1 year old and he had plenty of room to play around in the room so I'm very satisfied with the experience.
