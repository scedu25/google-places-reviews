Super 8 Omaha/West Dodge
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent and attentive staff. My girlfriend and I came off a bad experience at another hotel in Omaha so the owners gave us a King Sized room for the price of a queen. Didn't originally have a refrigerator or microwave so the owners brought them to us from another room. Room was clean and staff was attentive. 

Edit : 09/19/2017

Have stayed here again since due to an emergency situation leaving me homeless for the most part and the staff was again excellent and friendly. Better TVs than the last time I stayed. Haven't experienced the breakfast yet hoping to try that soon

Text: The room had an amazingly comfortable bed which was on the bottom floor. The air conditioning however was not working correctly by any means and if anything made the room hotter by adding humidity.. The constant surveillance is somewhat annoying especially with the prices as high as they are. They serve a complimentary breakfast but you are not allowed to serve yourself and take it back to your room which was also an annoyance. WiFi was slow if the connection lasted at all, and constantly dropped. The management is overall quite a few grumpy individuals. Having friends come by to catch up on what alls happened in the 4-5 months I had been in another state was not allowed. I am not a drinker and I don't thrash rooms, with that said, the constant eyes on me as though I was in the process of doing anything wrong made me feel like I was already doing something wrong. Which I wasn't. In all honesty I probably will not stay at that specific location ever again.

Text: No microwave, no coffee pot, no refrigerator. Hotel was billed as having said amenities. Reserved a room with a king bed was a queen bed. See pic. Manager tried to convince me that the bed was king. Owning a king leaves one to determine it wasn't a king from experience. The king headboard was left screwed to the wall. Air conditioner was weak the hottest week Omaha was ever on record, so that was okay ish for as hot as it was. Everything is outdated except the television. Won't stay here again, and  it can't be recommend to stay here.
