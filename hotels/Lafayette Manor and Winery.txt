Text: I am not sure why anyone would stay in a hotel in this area when they could stay here instead.  The hospitality is beyond measure. The accommodations are comfortable, spacious, and immaculate.  Perfect location.

Text: My wife and I visited the Lafayette Manor for a romantic getaway weekend, and we were very pleased.  We stayed in the Carroll Suite, and it was a lovely and comfortable room.  Les and Oksana were excellent hosts. They were very helpful, attentive, and sociable when need be, and very respectful of our privacy when we needed that. Oh, and the breakfast was superb!  My wife leaned over and whispered to me how "special" she felt by their care of us, and so I won major points there.  All in all it was a wonderful B&B, and we hope to come back again!
