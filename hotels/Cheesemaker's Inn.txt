Cheesemaker's Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This place is set in the Iowa countryside just a few minutes from Pella.  It's tastefully decorated and very warm cozy.  We had such a relaxing time.  Pella is such a unique community and there are so many things to do there.  We shopped and went to a museum and toured the working windmill.  You won't find a more relaxing weekend then a stay at the De Boerderij and a visit to Pella.  Don't forget to buy some Dutch pastries at one of the two bakeries in town!
