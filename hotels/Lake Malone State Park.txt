Lake Malone State Park

Text: We stayed here for the eclipse and loved it! They handled the extra people in the park very well. Everything was very affordable, from the campsite, wood, ice, and even ice cream. They have a nice swim area at the lake the we spent all afternoon in.

Text: Camped here for several days.  The restrooms and grounds were very clean at the campsite. The camp host and store clerk were friendly and helpful.  This is a very small park with a quiet campground.  There is no gate to the campground, so there is some traffic that comes through from time to time which I didn't care for.  The trails were nice.  The beach and beach house were just okay, not bad, but not great either.

Text: So happy they have the beach all cleaned up with brand new boat docks as well. They also have the concession stand open on the weekend with great prices! So happy to be able to bring the kids this year!
