University Plaza Hotel & Convention Center
Rating: 5
Text: Really nice hotel. I wish that my husband and I had spent more than one night there. The accommodations were spacious, although the bathroom setup was a bit different & smaller than what I am used to. The atmosphere both inside and outside of the hotel were awesome. The setup was very modern, relaxing, and inviting. It would also serve as a good venue for a conference if I had the opportunity to host/sponsor one in the Springfield, MO area.

Text: Although the convention food was better than quite a bit that I've been subject to elsewhere, it was cold when served. Not just at one station, or one item, but all of the food. Otherwise the only problem was having to travel between buildings for breakout sessions. The weather was great, so again, I have definitely been subject to worse. Definitely on the better side of standard or average.

Text: Beautiful hotel. Spacious room with a loveseat and desk. The bed was so comfortable, it felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Wait staff were professional and courteous. The food was delicious. I would recommend staying at this hotel.

Text: Was here for a work conference. Nice employees, clean rooms, comfortable beds, large meeting rooms. A good place to stay. Also has a nice lobby area to hang out in with a small bar.

Text: Expected more from such a hotel. Room was warm, no room service or onsite food after 10. TV viewing options were sparse forcing you to pay $17 to watch a movie to find something good .
