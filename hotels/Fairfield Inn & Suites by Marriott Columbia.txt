Text: Greeted by a cheerful and very friendly front desk clerk, room was clean and adequately supplied with towels,  and our stay ended with the best breakfast experience thanks to the attentive staff person. I didn't get her name but she obviously took extreme pride in making certain every guests needs were met. Best vegetarian breakfast sausage we've ever had, nothing ran out because she was cleaning and restocking before anything got low! She deserves a raise!!
