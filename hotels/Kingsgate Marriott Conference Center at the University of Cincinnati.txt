Kingsgate Marriott Conference Center at the University of Cincinnati
Rating: 4
Text: Great Marriott located on "pill hill". Staff is friendly and pleasant. Rooms are nice but are getting dated, especially the bathroom. The resteraunt and bar on the main floor is nice but a tad overpriced. Parking is plentiful in the garage underneath but be aware that it shares space with another building. Make sure to park on the correct side or you'll be doing some walking!

Text: The hotel is nice enough and the gym is a bit better than the standard Marriott fitness center. Parking is a bit weird with a shared use garage for the hotel and other stuff nearby, and hotel parking is limited to certain spots. It's not in a great neighborhood, though. There's food within walking distance, but I wouldn't want to walk anywhere after dark.

Text: Great hotel, so so as conference center. Rooms good and staff super friendly and helpful. Business center doesn't really allow for real work and hard to find places to use a laptop.

Text: Attended a conference. Everything was clean. Lunch was prepared on site buffet style. Staff was attentive on keeping food stocked and getting plates cleared from tables.

Text: Excellent hospital centric location, very professional staff, and comfortable beds. My only complaint is the air conditioning in the warmer months. The units are designed with the thermostat directly on the ducting, causing them to deactivate before fully cooling the room.
