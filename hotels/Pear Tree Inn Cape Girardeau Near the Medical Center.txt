Text: I've stayed here twice and both times have had excellent service. It's a great place if you're just coming in to crash for the night. During my most recent stay Eva was a Saint and helped us get checked in early. 

They offer a simple continental breakfast (cereal, waffles, donuts, muffins), which hit the spot before my drive back to St. Louis. Definitely not the most fancy hotel I've been too, but it does the job. My only complaint was that there wasn't a microwave in the room, but we were able to walk down to the breakfast area to heat up food.

Text: Nice, clean room,  friendly staff. If you like popcorn, it's free & makes area smell of popcorn. Location little difficult to get to, other than that, nice place.

Text: Good location across from dining options. Rooms were pretty good. Breakfast is just a true continental with some waffles and oatmeal.
