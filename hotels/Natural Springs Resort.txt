Natural Springs Resort

Text: We camp 2 to 3 times a year and we always end up here at least once a year if not more. Great campground, pool and beach. Campsites are good size and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is the best. Highly recommend it!

Text: Facilities are good, but some parts are showing their age. Limited number of chairs in the beach, so claim early. Pool and "lake" are nice.

Campsites were long, but fairly close together. During heavy rains, our gravel site experienced significant puddling, especially around the sewage connection, so that was kinda gross. I'd estimate 2/3 of the sites are seasonal/permanent with most being well maintained. Staff was overall helpful and did a good job. The wood sold on site is a good value and is stored in a shelter, so it is nice and dry.

Text: We have been taking our grandchildren to Natural Springs for three years. Once in our RV and once in UP cabin.  Very nice!!! However this year, all cabins were reserved so we rented their camper.  It had all we needed.  But very disappointed in the age and condition. Needs gutted or replaced.  It is a big-time negative for natural springs!!!  But love the campground.

Text: Very nice campground. A little tightly compacted next to other campers. Clean lake with beach to enjoy. Diving boards are fun to use at the lake. Nice pool for the kids. Our family doesn't camp that much but we had a fun couple of days there.
