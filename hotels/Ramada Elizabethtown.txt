Text: Wonderful stay. Pool was clean and warm.  Had an interaction with the maintenance guy who was amazing to my daughter. Made us feel like he knew us. My daughter even wanted to take him the donut he jokingly asked her for after cleaning up here mess but we were already on the interstate. Will definitely be back.

Text: Wonderful experience from check-in to check-out.  Friendly staff, clean rooms and common areas.  Perfect, probably not, but neither am I.  All my needs were met and I suffered not.  These folks care and try their best.  That's enough for this reviewer.

Text: Staff was super nice. The room was sub par. There was dirt in our bed. The remote was crusty. the side table was so gross the phone stuck to the table. The bathroom airvent was full of dust. The shower had soapscum on the wall. The breakfast was lacking and what was there was gross.
