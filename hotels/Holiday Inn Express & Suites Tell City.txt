Text: Very very disappointed.   Dirty,  dingy, stinky.   And they asked for our cash up front.     We had them switch out our first room because it was so disgusting.   Second room was better but will never stay at a holiday inn again.

Text: Beds were incredibly comforttable!  Only bad thing was that there was no hot tub.  I could have really ysed a hottub.
