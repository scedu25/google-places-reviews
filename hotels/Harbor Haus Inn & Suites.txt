Harbor Haus Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: This is our second time staying at Harbor Haus Inn. It's a cozy little place that's close to all the local restaurants, wineries and bars. The employees are so nice and breakfast there is so good! Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Hermann.

Text: We loved our stay. The room we stayed in and the office where breakfast was served were so cozy and made you feel at home. The staff is so friendly and helpful. We were warned when we booked about the stairs going up to our room being small and steep so that was upfront but they were not joking. The stairs going up to room 19 were very steep, more than what was expected. The room itself we enjoyed though, it had a covered private balcony that overlooked market street, which was a nice suprise and we enjoyed it. The location was also great. We would stay again when we go back to Hermann.
