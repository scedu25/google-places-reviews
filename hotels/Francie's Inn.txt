Text: What a great place to stay!  Francie's is a very warm and welcoming place with spacious yet cozy rooms and a very delicious breakfast. Feels like a home away from home and is a great place to go for a little get away.

Text: My sister and I stayed here on Saturday, October 22, 2016. This place is a gem! The owners were very hospitable and delightful. I loved the character of the home and the front porch with the rocking chairs. The food was exquisite! For breakfast, the first course was a belgian waffle topped with a baked peach with a cinnomon glaze and cream cheese whipped cream topped with a blackberry (and perhaps more, but that's what I tasted!). Second course was an omlet with cheese, chicken sausage, green peppers and onions and seasoned hash brown potatoes. All was servered with OJ, coffee or tea. The coffee was great! Please stay here, as all the rooms were clean, beatiful, peaceful and quiet. We stayed in the Ciara, which had a larger bathroom and beautiful clawfoot tub. With free wifi and cable tv, this place can't be beat for the price. We will stay again!! Thank you!
