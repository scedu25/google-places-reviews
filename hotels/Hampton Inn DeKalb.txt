Hampton Inn DeKalb
Rating: 5
Text: Well appointed Hampton. They were in sold out status, so I was a little concerned about noise. However, it was a very quiet night and we enjoyed their typical comp breakfast this morning. (Served between 6 and 10 on Sunday.) I feel like I can always count on Hampton Inn for an easy family overnight.

Text: It is a very nice hotel. Close to campus and restaurants. Has a convenient meet and greet space in the lobby for guests. The swimming pool is nice but small. Overall great experience and extremely nice staff.

Text: I can't speak to the rooms, but fron my time in the lobby of the Hampton, I can say it is quite fancy. Cucumber water and fruit were at a table and an enthusiastic, friendly staff greeted everyone exiting and entering the building. I'm sure the rest of their services are just as top-notch.
