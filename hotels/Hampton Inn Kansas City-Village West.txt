Hampton Inn Kansas City-Village West
Rating: 5
Text: My family and I stayed here for 2 night and had a wonderful time. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.   The breakfast had a great variety and everyone is always smiling. The next time we go to Kansas City we will definitely stay here.

Text: Decent, but horribly dirty floors.  My kids' feet were literally black before I realized the tile entry and carpets were so dirty.  Loved the proximity to restaurants and Legends Mall.

Text: Nice, clean, and modern. Downsides, low quality breakfast compared to other Hampton properties, small TV's, no concession area, and you can't make left turns out of the parking lot. Upsides, clean and modern rooms and lobby area, indoor pool/gym/laundry, and decent WiFi.

Text: Great place to stay- The GM is great to work with and will do her best to help you out. If I have ever had an issue there, the front staff is always quick to help and get it resolved. The Housekeeping staff is also very polite. I would highly recommend staying there.

Text: Came up for the Great eclipse.  Hotel had eclipse glasses ready for all its guests when we got there.  Rooms were spacious, and the morning breakfast was delicious.
