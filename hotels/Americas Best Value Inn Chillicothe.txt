Americas Best Value Inn Chillicothe

Text: While yes this motel is not the Ritz... The staff and management are amazing people... Very kind and understanding... We had a service animal due to my disability and everywhere else in town, even those claiming ADA compliance, refused us to have her in our room... The housekeeping staff were great to us, changed out linens and toiletries quickly and without hassle, even joked and played with my kids... I will stay in this motel EVERYTIME I need a room in this town!!!

Text: It was a nice enough place to stay. We didn't expect to have to stay in Chilicothe, but they had a room available for us. The woman at the desk helped us when we had an issue with the room. Is it the best place ever? Nope. But it ain't bad for what it is.

Text: Vary nice place to stay my only issue was the bathtub the handle to turn it on you pull out this flat metal piece and it will continually spin around with no way marked where hot and cold is. At one point it would get really hot so you think to turn it down a little bit move it back the other way a little but that would make it really cold.

Text: The employees are nice but one of them told us not to let my sister run around cause he couldn't vouch for some of the people there. Also, if you have more than a few bags of stuff in the room it's as if the world had ended.

Text: Breakfast consists of bagels, English muffins, assorted cereals, 2 percent milk, and an orange flavored beverage. Rooms are clean but the tub could be cleaner. Internet is decently fast. The front desk is friendly. The highway is noisy.
