Text: We rented two rooms and the one room was nice and clean but our room the bathroom shower was chipping paint really bad and was black on the bottom. The towels was dirty the floors were not swept comforter had stains all over it. Then we tried to the heat on an nothing but dust an dirt flew out everywhere. It was pretty dirty. Wouldn't really recommend it.

Text: Nice hotel with decent prices. Smoking and non smoking rooms, free breakfast, comfortable beds and decent sized TV with a good channel package (not sure if cable or satellite). The employees were helpful and nice. Pet fees are $10 for a small dog, $20 for a large one. Sign says no cats but in a joking way so I'm not sure. Breakfast is just the standard waffles, cereal, yogurt, coffee, milk Apple and orange juice, bread, front and pastries. Parking lot is kind of small, definitely would not recommend trying to park a semi there. But if you can find a way to park they have a decent truckers discount.

Text: Really 5 stars are not enough. The staff is friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. Made you feel like family. Will definitely be staying there when we go back through.

Text: If I could rate this any lower I would. Dirty rooms, hair everywhere. Staff is rude and doesn't want to help with problems. Found cockroaches as soon as we entered the room. Hopefully there aren't bed bugs, didn't see any but who knows. It has been a problem here in the past from reviews. The ice machine is broken, dryer is broken. Just disgusting, please save yourself some money, do your research and find a better place.

Text: Cheap room, but the rooms need work. Bathroom tile was missing grout. Stains on the comforter. I've stayed at better cheap hotels.
