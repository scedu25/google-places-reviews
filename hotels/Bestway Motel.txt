Bestway Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Considering the price, the motel is very good. It is located on main highway, hence easily accessible. Furthermore, the room features are flexible such that in some room smoking is allowed and other it isn't. Moreover, the cleanliness of each room including bathroom, bedroom and other is awesome. Feels like home. Service provider are quite kind in terms of offering extra soaps, towels and other daily things. I loved my stay here.

Text: I was visiting Windsor for the first time and My visit at this motel was really awesome! I have traveled lots in the USA and Canada. I have stayed in hotels and motels,the hospitality and care and customer service at this BESTWAY motel was really good and satisfying. The room provided just what was needed , the room was nice and neat, and I got the non- smoking one. Although meeting me for the first time, the kindness of the owners and reception blew me away. I will recommend them anytime and would visit again, especially if you are looking for real value for money. Its been over a year and I still loved it. Thanks guys!

Text: They placed extra ILLEGAL charges on my card! 

The internet was down during my entire 2 day stay. The bathroom of my room was filthy.

I would NOT stay here again. Sleep in your car instead. You'll be happier.

Text: meh is a compliment to this motel.like seriously the wifi speed was so slow it was 1 mbs per second.there was no bathroom exhaust so if i had to take a dump the whole room would smell.it didn't cost much so that's a upside.very small and cramped room.If you could afford a better motel or hotel definitely do.thanks
