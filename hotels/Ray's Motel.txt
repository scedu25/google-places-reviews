Text: Im constantly away from home and transporting expensive items for people. This place makes the trip less Home sick and my customer's items are definitely safe in your vehicle/room. Cute,  cozy, clean.  Comfy bed. Awesome living room/kitchen area. My only complaint is the sound of traffic (from the main road) which the owners can't help.

Text: Friendly and nice staff, but room smelled although old was otherwise clean, shower was is disrepair, scalding with almost no cold water, next day were given key to another room to use shower there, a bit but not much better, very hard to regulate the water temp, and no doors on the cupboards in that room. I like doing business with small 'mom and pop' local places, but I wouldn't come back here again, very disappointed :-( looked cute and cozy online. Linda was very nice and tried to accommodate us.
