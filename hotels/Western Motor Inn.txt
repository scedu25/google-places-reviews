Text: For what it is, it's okay. The guy at the desk was friendly and helpful, and the AC eventually cooled the room down well. They say "don't sleep in your van," and that's about what this is. A little more room than your van, and has running water. It felt very run down, a bit dirty, but it was okay for a quick night's sleep as a layover stop on a long multi-day drive.

Text: The attendant was incredibly nice and very accommodating for us, as we arrived past 2am because of a cross-country road trip we were doing. The room was very nice, we had a queen bedroom, and was well worth the money. If we ever make a trip out this way again I would for sure stay once again!

Text: This may be the best hotel bed I've ever laid in. It's not a huge fancy hotel, so don't expect a five star hotel, but it's a comfortable stay. There's free WiFi, breakfast, and lots of channels on the TV. Our room has some signs of wear and tear, but it was clean and smelled nice. There was also a mini fridge and a microwave. The night receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. It's a perfect stay when you're traveling on I-70.

Text: Great option in the budget price range. Room, bed, and bathroom were clean, wifi worked, the owners are super friendly.  No complaints here.

Text: You get what you pay for. Small and older rooms. Ductape holding some draft holes at bay. But was clean and adequate for what it was. Don't be expecting no chocolate mint on your pillow
