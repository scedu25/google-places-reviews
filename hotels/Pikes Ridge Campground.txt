Pikes Ridge Campground

Text: This campground lacks some features I thought I couldn't live without..but for our two days it was almost perfect.
Our site was lakefront. The camp host was the most helpful, as our RV had a flat as we were leaving and without all his help we would have had to travel to a repair shop for repair. He had plugs and an air compressor. Wonderful
