Columbus Airport Marriott

Text: Stayed for a couple nights on business. Close to airport. Easy off and on from highway. Not really close to any nice places to eat. Had to drive a ways for that but to be expected when staying at airport location. Rooms are average. A bit of an older feel. Nice bathrooms. Beds were older but pillows nice and new. Not a good amount of plugs for working and charging. M Lounge was nice with a good amount of goodies and snacks. I would stay here again.

Text: The staff is nicer than pie! So attentive, polite, and accommodating. 

The rooms are old-ish, though the bathrooms seem very modern. It's an interesting vibe. You can tell it was really fancy at one time (the 80s?). Everything is "good."

The food (room service) is very delicious and only slightly-ridiculously priced-- I mean it's room service, so duh. 

I would definitely stay here again, if only because of the staff and my trust in their customer service and reliability.

Text: Decent size rooms with some updates but not worth what they charge. Nice full breakfast buffet but it is not included with the price of the rooms. Will not stay there again and wouldn't recommend.
