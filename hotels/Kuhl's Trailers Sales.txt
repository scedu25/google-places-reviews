Kuhl's Trailers Sales

Text: Jason in sales is the most friendly person if talked to with RV sales! He knows he’s campers and if you have a question he doesn’t know he get the answer. Plus they give me a great deal on my TT! Hard to say but Chris in service exceeds the sale department in work quality and knowledge. Hats off to Kuhl’s staff, great dealership!!!
