Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott South Bend Mishawaka

Text: Still has old A.C. units which is either heat, cool or off. Not auto feature. Housekeeping lacks attention to detail. (Dirty toilet, mirror and desk). Besides that okay. Would give it a shot again in the future but would inspect first before settling in

Text: Medicore hotel... But the staff and the service make it up for! 
Good mattress, consistent service from maids and really clean rooms. 
. 
No real glass exist here(asked front desk too), drinking anything in plastic cup feels degrading!
. 
Complimentary internet speed is a joke, specially when most hotels in the area offer faster speed(speed proof attached) unless you want to pay 4 bucks a day for upgrade! 
. 
Tv channel selections are ok, some basics such as fox is missing, but enough good channels to substitute with.
. 
2 doors away from the elevator and the opening beep drive me nuts ever morning starting at 5Am.
. 
Parking lot lights shining to 3rd floor rooms and bothering at night unless shutting the shades which feels weird to me in the morning! 
. 
Overall, If you are here just to crash for the night or two, it's perfect, otherwise for a week or longer stay and planning to get some work done in your room, it's not going to work. :(

Text: Stayed 1 night recently. Room was very clean, well-kept and modern. Loved that the tv in our room could access Netflix. Breakfast had quite a variety of food. Didn't swim, but the pool looked small and clean. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Loud hotel. Many slamming doors at all hours, most times I wouldn't blame that on the hotel as much as the guests. But the doors could be adjusted so they don't slam so loudly every single time. Other than that it's a clean nice standard Fairfield

Text: I had a wonderful stay at Fairfield Inn! The complimentary breakfast has a great selection and is very tasty. The rooms were neat, clean and the beds are very comfortable. The location is great as well! There's a mall right down the street and any reataurant you can think of is so close! Great experience over all! I'll definitely be visiting again soon!!
