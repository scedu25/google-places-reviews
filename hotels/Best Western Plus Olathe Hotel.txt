Text: Very nice hotel, friendly staff!  Rooms were large enough we didn't feel like we were stepping all over each other, had a nice sitting area and nice big bathrooms.  Beds were comfortable.  The lady at the desk when we checked in was so nice, she opened up the eating area so that we could feed our softball team after a long day on the fields.  Will stay here every time we come to KC area for tournaments!

Text: Stayed overnight for a wedding. Even though there was a soccer team staying at the same time, we felt like we were the only guests. We booked a king suite and it was clean and spacious.  Breakfast was great and the check out/in process was easy and fast. Would definitely stay here again!

Text: This is a well located hotel to get places. However, it is next to a fast food drive through so if your room is close to it you will hear cars driving in and out all the time and it is near a truck stop so you will hear upshifting and downshifting of the gears of the big rigs early in the morning and late at night. The breakfast is good and staff are friendly. However, when we left a note for housekeeping for additional pillows, they were not left for us and nor was the complimentary tea replenished or the accompanying cups. It is always the details that make a difference to us and those details were not followed through on even after it was brought to their attention.

Text: Very nice place to stay! The 2 queen bed rooms have plenty of extra room for my walker and the shower had grab bars to hold and it wasn't even a handicapped room. Good price too. It also has a drink machine and an ice machine on every floor.
