Text: Ok'ish, if it haven't been for the road noise it would have been 4 stars. Very good rooms and swift service in the reception. The morning coffee is great.

Text: The rooms themselves were very nice. Was there to spend the night after a wedding, and they even opened the room for us. The staff was super friendly. Had a great time.

Text: we are from somewhere that doesn't require you to be 21 to get a room. we didn't get informed of this rule and as a result weren't able to enjoy our trip. drove 8 hours from the west end of iowa just to be denied a room and drive back. no compensation was given. the site should be fixed to warn you about this rule before you book.
