Courtyard by Marriott Kokomo
Rating: 4
Text: One of the best hotels in Kokomo. Most of the rooms are newly renovated and modern. The hotel staff was amazing but the room felt small. The cafe downstairs was nice but expensive and there was no complementary breakfast that I was aware of. TV and wifi were spotty at best as well. I still think the Hampton Inn down the road slightly edges this hotel out for the time being.

Text: Very clean,  friendly staff,  want very prepared for our wedding party despite advanced notice and reservations. The rooms are clean,  bed and pillows were comfy.  Breakfast is $5 with advanced purchase.

Text: The hotel has an updated check in/bistro which is nice, but the gym is on the smaller side. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet, but the layout is odd, with the TV to the side of the bed. There are plenty of power outlets throughout the room and near the bed.
