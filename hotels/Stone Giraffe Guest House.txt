Stone Giraffe Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I stayed at the Stone Giraffe  for one night, as we were driving through Missouri. The house has so many amenities, yet it feels like home and you can immediately settle in and get comfortable. We were welcomed immediately upon our arrival and given a tour of the house. We were also given recommendations of activities and food options in the area. The house has a full kitchen, although we didn't stay long enough to take advantage of it. Breakfast was delicious the next morning, and served at the time we requested the evening before. The view from pretty much any window in the house is beautiful, but the view from the dining area is amazing, of the nearby woods. I highly recommend this guesthouse to anyone who finds themselves in the area. My only regret is not staying longer! We will definitely be back to visit.

Text: Great accommodations. Love the shower, breakfast, and view of the stars from the bed, but the bed was a little hard.

Text: Great bed & breakfast, my wife & I stayed here after a friend's wedding. We ended up spending very little time at the B&B. The place was very clean, a bathroom in the room (a must) & breakfast was very good. 

I would recommend!
