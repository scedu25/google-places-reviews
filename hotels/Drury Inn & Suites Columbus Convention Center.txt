Drury Inn & Suites Columbus Convention Center

Text: Check in was smooth and we were able to check in early , which is awesome considering we drove 5 hours to get there. We had a king size room that was clean, smelled good and was on a high floor with a nice view. Love the security features: you need your room key for a lot more than just your room such as getting on an elevator into the parking garage. The kickbacks at night are awesome, 3 free drinks and food from 5:30 to 7. Favorite part is the free breakfast. Huge variety of foods including hot breakfast choices. We'll definitely pick Drury Inn every time if we can!

Text: Wow!  What a wonderful, unexpected stay!!  Joe was wonderful at the front desk, very kind and answered all my questions.  The parking was secure and easy to access.  The evening happy hour was quite unexpected.....3 FREE small drinks and great food (chicken, pasta, baked potato and salad)  Popcorn also, which I took back to my room as a late snack!!  I've never had that at any other hotel....so nice to be able to unwind right in your hotel and not have to shell out more $$$.  The hot breakfast in the morning was awesome, so much more than just crummy cereal and some fruit.  The room was wonderful, clean and quiet.  This will be my "Go to" chain from now on!  Even though I only stayed one night....the service I received was "over the top"!!  This is how a hotel should be run!!  Thanks so much Drury Inn....see you again soon!

Text: This is my 2nd time staying at the Drury Inn. I searched specifically for this chain because of my first experience. If there is one nearby I will never stay anywhere else again. This Inn is amazing. Their free breakfast and 5 o'clock kickback are exceptional. The rooms are clean. The staff was friendly. I will definitely keep coming back.

Text: The kick back was nice but the whole room filled up quickly. We enjoyed the 3 free drinks and popcorn. The room was clean and we have a great view of the city. It was a bit loud as a conference was being held next door.
