Holiday Inn Express & Suites Columbus Easton
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed overnight and was pleasantly surprised with the room and amenities. I had a king bed, the layout was great, had a huge desk and sitting area to do work from, free WiFi, an indoor pool and a fitness center. My room was very clean, the bedding was fresh and the toiletries were nice. Overall my stay was very nice and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone doing business near Easton as it's very close to the Town Center!

Text: My husband & I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Columbus-Easton. We were there for 2 nights. My husband was on business, I tagged along. First, the hotel, grounds & inside were very clean. Second, the staff was incredibly nice. They made a "regular" stay into something much better. Everyone I met was super helpful & kind. The service simply could not have been better!

Text: The staff here is hands down the best. The rooms are nice and the location is great too, but the people make this place shine! I will always stay here when I'm in town!

Text: Got the executive suite. Room is LARGE and the bathroom is HUGE. Im not a small dude and could easily float in the massive tub. The shower stall is equally impressive. No complaints about room or service. In my opinion this is the best in the columbus area.

Text: Hampton inn down the road is much nicer and only slightly more expensive. This place has little parking, didn’t give me the room I requested, thin walls, and uncomfortable beds.
