Grand Island KOA Journey
Rating: 5
Text: Nice campground surrounded by cornfields, lots of trees, picturesque. Staff was very helpful. Has a small laundromat, 2 pet walks, small pool and playground. Main building showers were clean but the second smaller bath and shower was not so clean. Little pizza delivery located in main office building. Lights on low at night for a nice view of the stars.

Text: We arrived here quite late and having the large trailer that we have, we were a bit worried about the back in spot that we had booked. They had someone here waiting for us even though their office was closed. 
They escorted us straight to a pull through spot and made sure that we were safe for the evening. What a great place to stop! Beautiful playground for the children. 
Very nicely kept grounds. Very very nice five star stop again spot.

Text: Very rude and impolite workers. Out of all the campsites we've been to, this is the worst. Even though there is a pool and playground, it is over all NOT KID FRIENDLY. Most campers here are older and disrespectful. Calling ahead of time, we made sure we could have a 16 year old watch over sisters at the pool. We were told it was totally fine. So we bring the kids to the pool and they are playing and having fun. Now keep in mind this is 1:00 in the afternoon. An old cranky gal then proceeds to YELL at the girls for being too loud. And living with all girls, I know what loud is. And that wasn't it. It wasn't as though they had been yelling continuously. Or even being loud. We notified our parents who then went to speak to management. The guy wouldn't even shake my mom's hand. Treating her like trash and laughing at the fact she found it an issue. There was a gal cleaning the showers as this happened and said she didn't hear a thing. But as the guy was talking to the old cranky gal, she ADMITTED to yelling at the girls. So this gal shouldn't have gotten involved when she didn't know the situation. Then realising that the old gal admitted to it, then tried to look for any reason to say something back. Two workers, one I'm assuming was in charge/the owner, then proceeded to tell my dad that the old gal right and that they shouldn't be loud. When my dad then said that she shouldn't raise her voice to kids whom she didn't know, the nasty worker continued to tell us if we had a problem then to "Pack your bags and leave! Just leave then!" How disrespectful and nasty to treat a paying customer in such a way. They didn't even apologize for our kids getting screamed at by the old gal. I've never seen someone treat my sister's and parents in such a way. Oh, and when the old gal was asked as to why she said something to them in the first place, she said that it was because she didn't realize there was someone watching the girls. As if that justified yelling at young kids. So this was for sure an issue. A couple days before this, a KOA worker and another different old cranky gal came to our camper while the 16 and 17 year old teens were babysitting the two younger kids. They then ACCUSED US OF STEALING from the old gal. The worker let this old, rude, cranky lady rip my sister's ass for supposedly stealing from her. Which I can assure you we did not. The gal in charge then said that they didn't notify the parents and just talked to the oldest because, "She's in charge of the kids therefore its her responsibility." Definitely wasn't worth it AT ALL. Unless you're okay with old, impolite, nasty people yelling at your kids, DO NOT STAY AT THIS KOA.
