Text: Nothing but great experiences every time I've stayed here. The staff are always very  friendly and helpful. Rooms are well maintained and the breakfast is good with individual tv's in the booths to keep the kids entertained. I haven't stayed at any other hotels whenever I come to visit my mom and I don't intend to. By the way, I have never rated anything before but my experiences here have compelled me to let you guys know.

Text: Probably one of the better extended stay hotels in the area, however the walls are fairly thin. Clearly could hear the alarm and radio of the room next to mine early in the morning. Only occurred once after multiple stays.
