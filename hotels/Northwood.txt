Text: The "manager" wasn't even polite enough to come out of his office when we walked in.  A quick drive through showed that the trailers are nowhere near worth what they're asking for them (upwards of $20k) considering they are dated and many in disrepair.  The manager on duty was rude, aloof, and entirely unhelpful with any questions.  The park itself is seedy.  There are definitely better options in the area and I'd avoid this place like the plague.
