Text: Every time we stay at the Great Bend Best Western it is always a great experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooms and common area's are always kept up and clean. I would recommend this motel to anyone.

Text: We've stayed in Great Bend 20 plus  years.  The rooms have always been clean, and anything that needed fixing was done immediately.  The management even helped us with the Internet this year.  We last stayed there 2/17 for a family funeral.  Since then, they completed a gorgeous remodeling.
New couch , bigger shower,  and handicap accessible bars--very comfortable!

Text: I have stayed here for the last 13 years during business travels thru Kansas. I have seen the hotel go through changes as the owner/staff do their best to keep all the amenities and appearance of the hotel up to date with the times. They have a very friendly and helpful staff that takes care of any minor issues you may occasionally encounter. The restaurant next to the hotel called "The Page" is a good, convenient place to eat or have a cold beer or cocktail after a long day of work. In fact many of the locals like to eat there as well. Good hotel, good restaurant, clean rooms, good value for the money and a GREAT STAFF!

Text: Staff was great! Helpful, professional, and went out of their way to help cover an issue caused by a booking site. The room was clean, and we'll kept. I would recommend this establishment to anyone.
