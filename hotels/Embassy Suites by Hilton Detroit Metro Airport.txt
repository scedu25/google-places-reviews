Text: Love this hotel. Beds are really nice and pillows are big and comfortable. Every time I've been there the staff has always been great and the free drinks and snacks for happy hour really can't be beat. Restaurant good is also pretty darn good, my last trip there I think I had 3 orders of their wings as they were that good.

Text: The staff was very friendly.  Breakfast was good.  The pool was really neat.  But, there were some issues, especially since the room rate to stay to play hockey was $143 a night.  There were no bath towels when we got there.  I called and about 15 minutes later, they brought some up, which was good.  Also, the first day we were out all day and when we returned, the air freshener in the room was so over powering that I got a headache.  I called and they sent someone up and removed the air fresheners from the duct.  They said there were two in each duct and there should have only been one.  Another family also noticed very strong air freshener.  Then, there was no toilet paper.  I called and they said we would have to come down and get some as they had no one to bring any up.  I would expect more for the price.  Kleenex worked just fine.  Then, I found the attached finger nail on the floor with my bare feet and my son found a staple on the floor that looked like it was from a cardboard box.

Text: Awesome experience! From an 2am arrival that was one of the easiest I have ever had, to a front desk desk check out that remembered my name after an hour despite the busy atmosphere. Room was clean, comfortable very roomy. 2 tv's, separate sitting area, closed off bedroom. Breakfast was awesome, chef making eggs and omelets, pancakes and waffles was engaging and joking with people, yet moving line along. Other selections fantastic. Hotel had manager walking around chatting with tables in the morning, other staff clearing plates and wiping tables making sure all guests were accommodated. Totally impressed with my unplanned 1 night stay!

Text: Front Desk did welcome me as a Silver Member with Hilton and did provide a welcome gift.  We stayed in room 261 and is located by the stairs in the lobby. If you use the elevators, the signage only shows the rooms go to 260 (there is a 261).

Room was clean and loved the spacious room. Bed were comfortable and we all slept well. 

Didn't get to enjoy the pool. Breakfast was amazing and hard to believe it is free, which is a great thing!

If you can find a great price, it is worth the stay here!
