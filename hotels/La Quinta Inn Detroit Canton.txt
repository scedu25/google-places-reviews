Text: Just a decently price place to rest your head. Place is clean but nothing special. I was not a fan of the mattress. I love that there is no extra cost for pets brought two dogs with me and this was a huge bonus.

Text: So many things wrong!  Horrible lighting in the room. Dirty, dingy curtains, might have even been moldy. The breakfast was sufficient in what was offered, but the butter wouldn't melt on toast or waffle. You had to peel your own hard boiled egg(s). The hot tea was the only good thing. In the lobby, they kept mopping with a dirty mop which left the floor sticky. Old heater/AC unit, couldn't tell temp and when used heater it smelled like something was burning. Shower head is very stiff and hard to move. Won't be staying here again.
