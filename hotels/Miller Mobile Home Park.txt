Text: The owner is a very friendly, very involved individual. The lot is quiet and has a great view. Less than three minutes to the nearest Fort Riley gate. The only issue I had was the wood roaches kept coming into the house during the summer and I was told they are just water bugs when I requested exterminating services.
