La Quinta Inn & Suites Effingham
Rating: 2
Text: LOTS of pets at this place. One man was carrying his dog while filling his plate in the breakfast room. You had to walk through a cloud of smoke at front door because of people smoking. I got some sort of bite on my face during the night. We booked through a third party and ended up with a handicap room. It was clean and the bed was firm but we like it firm. Got a receipt under our door stating we would get more room type choices if we booked through them. Breakfast was nice.

Text: We had booked a suite but ended up in a regular room. It was still nice enough and breakfast was good. Wish breakfast ended a little later in the morning than 9am though. Lobby was very nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
