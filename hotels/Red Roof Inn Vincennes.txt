Red Roof Inn Vincennes
Rating: 5
Text: Have been staying at, and reviewing, Red Roof Inns for years now.  Best Red Roof Inn to date !  Outside well maintained and landscaped. King Superior room, large, well furnished and clean. Large and well lite bathroom areas. Good WiFi !  Super easy to operate card, door unlocks. Friendly desk staff.  Would recommend, and return.

Text: Hotel was great. Room was clean and service was friendly. Locations wasn't terrible, easy access to highway, however, if you're a light sleeper, it may be too close to the highway.

Text: For the money I thought it could have been a little nicer. Not much healthy at breakfast. Help was grumpy or down right rude if you just cant go any farther its good clean seemed safe
