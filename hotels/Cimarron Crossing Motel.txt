Cimarron Crossing Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I deal with a lot of hotels in Kansas for my job & I love the people at Cimarron Crossing! They are so helpful when I am sending crews out in that area & go above & beyond for our guys. The guys never complain & say the rooms are clean & comfortable, which is rare coming from them!

Text: Rooms cost $80 roads are closed due to blizzard and no breakfast let alone the Mexican restaurant closed early and nothing else open other then grocery store. But come on one way to keep a business open I guess.

Text: Score! This place is very nice! Very clean. The bed was super comfy! Shower was perfect! I found this on Google maps! It didn't show up on Expedia. I read the reviews and gave it a try. Again... I feel like we scored! 6 stars!
