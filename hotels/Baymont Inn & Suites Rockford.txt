Text: Decent place. Kind of dated, but the staff was very charming and helpful. It was clean and there were no bed bugs. It was affordable and within our budget, so I would definitely stay here again.

Text: I spent two nights on my way to and home from another destination. The staff were great, friendly, and helpful. The rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. And I love that there is an indoor pool. After a long day of travel, it's the perfect end of the day to a good night's sleep.

Text: Regularly Terrible Experiences!  For the past few months I've been traveling for work, and they often have me stay here.  I will be sure to ask for a different place going forward.   The staff was incredibly rude, and they charged me almost double their rate for checking out a few hours late due to a sickness.  Only two floors have ice machines, and the elevator is definitely in need of some TLC.  If you want a comfortable stay, look elsewhere.  This place doesn't appreciate their customers, or have competent maintenance available.

Text: The staff was excellent! They know what customer service is. Very friendly and helpful. I'm pretty indifferent about the room. It's pretty much what you would expect. But I would definitely choose this hotel again over any other in the area because of the positive experience with all the staff!

Text: This place has gone down hill in a hurry. The large outdoor sign is laying on the ground. They filled the spa with cement. The breakfast is terrible. Won't be back which is disappointing because we have stayed here for years.
