Holiday Inn Express Merrillville
Rating: 4
Text: Convenient place to stay while traveling around Chicago. Good, solid hotel. Nothing that will blow you away, but it was clean and the breakfast is decent. Coffee was always available and the staff was friendly. Rooms are nice with new beds. A couple lights were out in the room but no big deal. Staff gave us a couple complimentary bottles of water. Overall a good stay and would return.

Text: I clearly remember leaving an item in my room during my stay here and its exact placement in the room.  I left the hotel to drive all the way home and called the same evening to report a lost item once I realized it was missing.  I was told there was nothing left in the room and that I could not speak with a manger.  Very fishy as I am 100% positive of the location of the item and where it was left.  I realize I left an item, but the fact that I was not given any support via management or the hotel staff leads me to believe this item was stolen by the hotel staff.  Am frequently in the area on business and I will never be staying here again.

Text: Unfortunately, first non-smoking room smelled otherwise. Staff was accommodating, though. Spotlight shining into room window didn't help sleep. Overall, a standard mid-tier hotel

Text: Dated decor and amenities.  Air Conditioning in room was not effective.  Breakfast offerings were poor.  On the positive side it is in a good location for the many youth sports events in the area and the staff was very friendly if not overly helpful. 

We won't be back.

Text: First off staff was great and I had a bed to sleep in. All down hill from there. Old holiday Inn express with a new sign I hate that. Only ice maker is on the first floor. No vending on floors. All that's minor but this hotel needs to be knocked down. It was a smoking hotel for years. No matter what you do you can't get rid of the smell. The smoke smells sucks will never be back here
