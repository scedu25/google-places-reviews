Super 8 Ionia MI
Rating: 1
Text: Asked for an accessible room when booked because one guest is wheelchair bound. At check in he tried to put us on the second floor with no elevator-and looked annoyed as he scrambled to find us a room on the first floor that was apparently full. 

The room we got was not clean-the toilet was filthy honestly. Thankfully the beds were fresh so we could sleep and get out of there as planned. Thank goodness I will have no need to stay in Ionia again.

Text: Right off of 96 in Ionia. Pulled up n looked scary. Almost pondered not to stay. But inside was really nice. Had a very sweet lady from India get me settled. Room was beautiful, clean n very comfortable. No amenities like pool or gym.

Text: Stayed 2 nights for work. As for as a super 8 goes it's pretty nice. Staff was helpful and Pleasant. Beds were stiff but that's normal, breakfast had cereal, oatmeal, and waffles. I didn't like the fact they didn't have hot water for the oatmeal and the microwave says "don't use for oatmeal". I had a trailer so the parking here was very convenient. It's right off the high way and has a huge gas station\ subway next door.
