Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Kalamazoo
Rating: 4
Text: Room and accommodations were comfortable and attractive. Price was very good. Location is not quite central but close enough that it is still convenient. Service was good, though breakfast is quite limited.

Text: I was hesitant to stay at a Microtel after a bad experience in a different state, but this hotel saved my opinion of the brand. The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was very nice, and the staff was friendly and very helpful. This was pretty much a perfect hotel stay!

Text: Clean, inviting property. Typical Microtel room... SMALL! Room could have been more brightly lit, but it was clean and comfortable. Typical continental breakfast, but items were well stocked and fresh. Only complaint would have been the really low water pressure in the shower.

Text: Great place to stay. We don't tend to spend much time at our hotel on vacations so the room size doesn't matter so much. And the lower cost fits the budget better.
