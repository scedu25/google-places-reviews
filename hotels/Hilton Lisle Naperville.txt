Hilton Lisle/Naperville
Rating: 5
Text: We had a very nice stay. Room was well appointed. It was weird that there was no mini fridge in the room, but otherwise we had no complaints at all. Bar was nice and we were able to catch some of the Bears game there.

Text: Nice clean and professional hotel. Staff is courteous and available. Room felt a bit old (fourth floor) but was still comfortable. Restaurant menu is a bit lacking and the pricing inconsistent but I'm grateful they have a restaurant at all given the scarcity of nearby food options.

Text: Hotel and restaurant were all the best with one exception; Saturday morning, my last morning there, I tried to call room service three times between 6:30 and 6:45 (room service is advertised as beginning at 6:00).  Never got a reason why from the front desk.  Therefore, four stars, not five.

Text: The hotel was beautiful! Rooms were very clean and friendly staff. No complimentary breakfast, but the comfortable and clean rooms more than compensated for that.

Text: We just had a wonderful wedding reception in Hilton Lisle! Taylor has been very easy to work with and very helpful. Everything worked out perfectly during wedding night and all the guests were pleased by the food, service, and surroundings and everything else.

Highly recommend Hilton Lisle/Naperville for wedding reception.
