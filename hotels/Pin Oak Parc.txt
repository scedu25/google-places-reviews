Text: By far the worst place I have ever lived. Teenagers roam the streets all day and night. A 12 year old got stabbed in his own driveway not too long ago.  The cops sit at the entrance nearly daily because the place is so out of control. This place is disgusting. Management is terrible. The people who live there are trash and proud. I bet its the worst place in Ofallon.
