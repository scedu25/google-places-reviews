Text: Fabulous hotel! Beautiful lobby area and extremely courteous staff. Desk clerk wore a suit. Coffee and iced lemon water available at all times. Forth floor room was immaculate, bed super comfortable, nice and quiet. Breakfast was one of the best; included hot and cold choices. We were highly satisfied!

Text: This review is not pertaining to the room itself; once we got the room we paid for, it was great. We reserved the king size larger suite online-love the fireplace and whirlpool tub-we wanted to treat our granddaughter. As we had stayed at this hotel and location several times, we thought we knew what to expect. Upon checking in, we were given keys to a room but quickly discovered this was not the deluxe we paid for-smaller room, no fireplace, no extra room. My husband went back and pointed this out and was told not all suites have fireplaces. When it was pointed out that we reserved the larger suite and our confirmation details stated fireplace, whirlpool tub, sofa sleeper etc, there was no apology for their mistake although they did give us correct room. We have never had an issue anytime we reserved the larger suite, was disappointed as we had always been well treated with great service before. Hope this isn't a downward trend in our favorite place to stay in Des Moines!

Text: Great hotel, friendly staff.  We stopped unplanned on a late night road trip and they got us a room quickly and we're super helpful with extra toiletries.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  We all enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.

Text: Exceptional customer service, spacious rooms, great breakfast spread, and staff seemed to be very engaged in guest experience. Mattress had its ups and downs, yet was overall comfortable.
