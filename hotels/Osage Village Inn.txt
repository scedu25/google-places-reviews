Text: ***Fishermen beware*** booked room months ago, checked in sat oct 7, 2017 for an 8 day stay. Hotel was aware that I was pulling a boat; they assigned me a handicap room for whatever reason the only parking spot in the hotel lot when I checked in was the handicap spot in front of my handicap assigned room: 10:30 pm got a call from the manger telling me I had 5 min to move my boat from the parking spot; I told him there was no other places to park; he said that wasn’t his problem. I got out of bed walked outside to look for a place to move the boat only to be met by the manager and a Osage Beach Pd officer, that the manager had called before even calling my room. PD officer said to pack up my belongings the manager is kicking me off the property and I wasn’t getting a refund on the night(3hrs) that I was there. I said your kidding right? Said if I didn’t move I was going to be arrested for trespassing. So fishermen book at your own risk, no parking for a boat much less your vehicle. And getting kick off the property which is illegal by the way and charged for a night that you were removed by police for parking in the only space that was available. And the room was terrible no microwave no fridge, nasty sheets and air not working right. GO SOMEWHERE ElSE , trust me!

Text: This hotel was gross. Smelled terrible when we walked into the room. We went out for the evening came back and crashed. When we woke up we realized there was only 2 light bulbs in the entire room. The toilet was clogged. 2 maids brought me plungers and told me i had to do it. We were in a non smoking room and yet there were ashes behind the toilet paper holder. The tv was all jacked up. When we went to the office with the complaint. The man who claimed to be the owner got very mad he had to deal with the room. Just threw the plunger down after plunging the toilet himself. Very rude and bad hotel. I would not stay here again and would not recommend it

Text: So many issues. Overpriced for quality of room. Jaquzzi tub wouldn't work but when they got it started, it would go on and off by itself. No working telephone in room. Breakfast was horrible. Don't stay here. Air conditioning worked great.
