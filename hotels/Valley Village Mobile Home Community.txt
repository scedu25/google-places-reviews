Text: Management is rude, the old ones use to take great care of the grounds and it was always well kept, now there is places that aren't mowed, or half mowed, trash everywhere. Old management use to keep up on how renters maintained their lots and now they don't cars parked where ever they want, junk and trash sits out in some people's yards but, they get after those who keep their place nice and clean. They need new management ASAP!
