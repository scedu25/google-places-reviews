Rating: 5
Text: Room are nice have everything that you really need for the night. And room service is amazing
Rating: 3
Text: Cheap monthly rate. Staff is decent, nice pool, rooms are great, although tv's need to be updated. Don't come during high school football season; slack-jawed football kids with overly aggressive body odor everywhere.

Text: Clean, comfortable, and easy to find. Breakfast was late, however, and were only carbs. WiFi is painfully slow and borderline useless. Some repairs are needed in the rooms, but overall the place is okay.

Text: Weird apartment like rooms, although large. Old tvs, mismatched furnature. Everything in the rooms is clearly not new. Indoor pool and hot tub. Breakfast lackluster.

Text: Great, cheap place to sleep at especially if you are going to anything at Gordyville. Clean rooms, courteous staff.
