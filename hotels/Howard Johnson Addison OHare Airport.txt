Text: If I could give it zero I would. Horribly rude staff - waited over an hour and twenty minutes for a shuttle (a group of us- 10 people, strangers, all waiting) - shuttle never came. We gave up.

Text: One star or less.   No cameras, broken locks on outside doors.  Broken locks might be forgivable if....and only if, they locked rather than let anyone in.

On the positive side, they have a working table top Ms. Packman.  I do not know if it is still there because nobody moved it.  

I paid for the room with points... I want them back.

Text: The people at the front desk were wonderful and helpful. The room was another story, very slow cooling ac that maybe got the room to 78 degrees running all night on Max power. And the worst TV channel selection ever. Only 1 clear channel and that was the cartoon Network...

Text: It's good value for the price. The breakfast was less than great, tv and channel selection was subpar but if you don't plan to spend much time in the room, go for it. The only positive was the price.

Text: The location is inconvenient, it is set behind another building and very difficult to find for taxi and rideshare drivers. Front staff was very rude when checking us in, and ran our card three times without asking, locking us out of our account. We also requested a room with a fridge and microwave, but did not receive one. The room is mediocre, not very visually appealing. Peeling wallpaper, a few bugs, etc. Continental breakfast is a smaller variety, but satisfactory. There doesn't seem to be concierge service. The elevator is almost too small to fit yourself and luggage. Overall not the worst place, but definitely would stay elsewhere.
