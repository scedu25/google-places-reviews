Text: Good spot for camping if you have a shower/restroom in your camper. Very dirty facilities. Showers were covered in hair and used soap bottles & loofahs. Slimey walls. Foul smelling restrooms. Would rather bathe in the lake than go in those restrooms and showers.

Text: Illinois' Coon Creek COE Park sits on the west shore of Lake Shelbyville. Simply  beautiful park, wonderful pull-thru's, and great facilities. We have never been disappointed staying at COE campgrounds. Decided to stay two nights before going on to Indiana.
