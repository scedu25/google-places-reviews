The Mount Vernon Inn

Text: Fantastic place, the gardens are so relaxing to sit in at one of the many areas with tables and fans. The Inn is beautiful and the breakfast superb. Rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities. A return trip is definitely warranted. Loved this place.

Text: A wonderful garden with plenty of seating and fans outside to keep cool. Food was fantastic with bacon, sausage, coffee, and other items. Bed was comfortable and no neighbor noise. Highly recommend to get away with friends and enjoy.

Text: If you would like a quiet place to sleep by renting the cottage, go somewhere else. 18 wheelers, no exhaust farm trucks, and loud pedestrians are abundant even on Sunday morning. Need or want water pressure, nope. You have to use valve to switch between both shower heads to build up pressure. It's not the loss of hot water, but all water pressure. 7 streams of water on a 49 steam water head. How about a TV in the front room that works for the kids while you get ready in master... Nope. How about some modern amenities or upgrades so you can justify the $741.00 for 4 nights. Nope. Pictures are what you see and hear through the single pane windows; car dealerships, liquor store, and gas stations. Oh, that is a grain elevator in the back. You're looking at a major thoroughfare and highway for town traffic, 6 ft away. Painted over peeling wallpaper is in the master bath, burned out light, inoperable dimmer switch, and clogged dirty bathroom vent. Uncomfortable old beds and pillows. Wood paneling, old window air conditioners, and old inadequate lighting. The steep stairs are a concern for parents with small children, or just about anyone. I asked on the first morning to address the light, dimmer switch, shower head, and pressure seeing as how I had to turn the keys in since they were changing locks..... No communication nor any improvements.
