Text: Steve is a very welcoming camp host. Found this place 2 years ago with a friend. Came back this year, and Steve always has good stories and advice. Seems more geared toward atv’s but also accommodating to tent camping. Some good hiking trails and friendly people. Definitely recommend checking this place out!! Thank you again for everything Steve!!!

Text: What a great place to camp. Everyone was so friendly and the camp host "Steve" is the best. Listed as an ATV park,  my daughter and I were the only campers without a "four wheeler" but all the other campers were so nice and were never loud in the campground!  Try it - you'll like it!

Text: Steve has been doing this for a long time. When you frequent this campground as much as my family and I do it's really nice that Steve knows us by name. Steve makes his rounds every evening to make sure everyone is having a good time and keeping that good time within reason lol. So if you want to bike, hike, camp, glamp, swim, ride atv's, view wildlife, or just relax then you have found the right place. No cel service in camp. You have to drive 3 miles up the hill for a signal, even though I was on the creek near camp and got a call on Saturday and surprised everyone don't expect a signal. 
They have a really big beautiful pavilion for rent with a large grill and electric that we have been renting for the last 3 years for our cousins weekend. There's at least 10 picnic tables under the pavilion. 
If I could change anything about this camp it would be to add a playground and just a couple updates on a few other things. But for a camp of that size to be operated by one camp host, Steve is doing an excellent job. 
BTW Steve doesn't read these reviews lol. So if you go there tell him I said hi.

Text: Quiet, clean campground with good facilities. The campground host and his family are friendly and helpful, and they keep the park family friendly.  We keep coming back each summer.  A great place to camp and swim in the river with the kids.
