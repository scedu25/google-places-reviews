Text: My husband surprised me for our Anniversary and we stayed 2 nights at Castle in the Country.  It was a beautiful B&B, the food was delightful, the staff was more than accommodating and friendly, and we will absolutely be back.  This was by far one of the most relaxing atmosphere's we have been surrounded by yet.  We highly recommend staying if your looking for a laid back type of vacation.

Text: Loved the grounds, the staff, and the breakfast.  The rooms were beautiful (romeo and juliet), loved the fireplace, jacuzzi, and lighting.  Very quiet and peaceful all around.  Loved talking walks through the wooded trails.  Breakfast was relaxing and delicious.  I really appreciated how the staff led so well and didn't make us guess where to go, or what to do.  Cookies and milk, and snacks were a great touch.  We also loved the lights outside and the fireplace on the patio.  Truly an experience, and set the tone for our peaceful weekend away from our 4 young boys!  Loved it and I'm already recommending this place to friends!

Text: My husband and I stayed in the Camelot room.  The whirlpool and shower are heavenly.  The food is scrumptious, the grounds are lovely (walking around is a pleasure) and Ruth made sure we were satisfied with everything.  Would recommend this place for anyone who wants to get away from it all.

Text: Castle in the Country thought of everything!  We very much enjoyed our stay.  Ruth was very welcoming and professional.  The room was very clean.  The whirlpool tub was wonderful!!  We had a little trouble with the lock on the paddle boat and kayaks, but were still able to take the boat out for a spin.  We will definitely return!

The comfortable rooms, delicious breakfasts, friendliness of staff and gorgeous setting in the Michigan countryside helps the stress to fall off. Highly recommend!
