Text: Very nice place to stay. Excellent huge room. Feels like your at home. Kitchen area. Living room area. Serves great breakfast but should have a variety of meat selection because not everyone eats pork. Offers free social and dinner 3 nights a week which is great. Great outdoor area. Friendly staff. Will.stay again.

Text: We have enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious. The customer service was awesome. Two top reasons we stayed here was because of location and because they are pet-friendly. I would recommend this hotel.

Text: The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the bed wasn't up to par with other hotels. The courtyard is AMAZEBALLS! Great customer service. The rooms were nice. I'd definitely stay here again. Great place for a long term stay!

Text: My husband travels to Indy a lot for work and we always choose this hotel. The staff is very friendly and professional, the rooms are spacious and well kept and the location is perfect. There's free breakfast which is great for early meetings and you're running behind. They also have coctail hour and an evening meal on weekdays. The only downside is the workout room is a little small but the equipment is nice. All in all I love this hotel and wouldnt consider anywhere else for the price.
