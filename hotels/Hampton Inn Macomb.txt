Text: Very polite, helpful staff. Clean rooms, hallways, and lobby. Breakfast was good. There was something for everyone. The pool area was nice and had a bonus outdoor patio that was really nice on a fall evening! Pics of the 24 hour snack bar area are included.

Text: The elevator stopped going to the 4th floor at one point. The TV defaults to Fox news whenever you turn it on. Our first night we heard doors slamming in  the hall the whole night. They do have a decent breakfast included and the rooms are fairly updated.

Text: Salt water pool and jacuzzi are nice. I really liked there breakfast items. Waffles had quite a few choices. Denver and other omlets were good. Had quite a few other options as well. Best place to stay in Macomb.
