Text: Great place to camp. There are any type of sites you need from text to 50 amp. they even have cabin's. The owners are Wonderful People!!!  This is a great place for family's they offer a stocked pond with Catch and Release, for the kids.  They have an on site store that offers: food, ice, bait, gas, and propane.  The rates are very reasonable.  My family has been there with a permanent site for several years, there are even campers that have had there camper there for over 20 YEARS if that doesn't tell you some thing.   They also have the BEST 4 of July Fireworks display I have ever encountered. So if you want a peaceful getaway that is close to the lake, and boat ramps.  This is your place.
