Holiday Inn Express & Suites Columbus - Polaris Parkway
Rating: 4
Text: Holiday Inn Express & Suites was great for our family of 4. The hotel and room was up to date with a modern style. The room, loby and pool we're clean and inviting. One of the perks of this hotel is the pool. It offers a little of everything for all ages. The kids really enjoyed the tipping buckets and basketball hoop; while my husband and I watched from the hot tub. Breakfast in the morning was nice. There were many options for my picky eaters. Over all this was a great overnight stay, I only hated the pillows. Next time I'll have to remember to pack mine.

Text: The desk clerk named Will was beyond rude from the first hello.  I was shocked by such behaviour. My wife and I have come to think of every holiday inn as a home away from home. And every employee extened family. Not this one. Even as we wished Will well on our way out of the door his rudeness continued. There is a much nicer hotel one exit north.

Text: My experience was odd, but acceptable experience at this hotel. When we first got there, everything seemed pretty normal, check in was fine. When we first got into our room, the floor was littered with various food particles. It was odd to see something like this at a place like? this, so I mentioned something to the staff. Immediately they sent someone to make things better. Breakfast was acceptable, nothing special. In the end, I slept in a bed, but a few things could have been done better.

Text: Absolutely awesome. We called expecting them to say they were sold out and they had a cancellation. They could have jacked up the price of the room on us, but gave us an amazing price instead. The room was super clean. Bathroom was as well. Chad and Joe, at the front desk, were 2 of the best front desk workers I've ever encountered. Would stay there again in a heart beat!!
