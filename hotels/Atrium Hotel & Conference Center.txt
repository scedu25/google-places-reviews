Atrium Hotel & Conference Center

Text: Nice place,  they're replacing all carpeting. There are refrigerators and microwaves in each room. They have 2 floors but no elevators. You will have to carry your bags up a flight of stairs if you're on the second floor. The best things about this hotel is the staff. Joe the maintenance man does everything including bringing extra towels LOL! He was awesome! Great place, nice pool, breakfast on the weekends is better than the week days and, they have a bar and grill restaurant.

Text: Stayed for a family reunion for 2 nights and it was great. Rooms are pretty nice, not fancy but really comfortable. Beds are nice and comfortable, lots of pillows to choose from. Some of the bathrooms in some of the rooms are smaller than others. Pool is awesome. Kid pool is a little cold but kids love it anyways and they had a blast. Staff is friendly and helpful. Grill/bar is nice too with affordable food and drinks.

Text: Hot Tub out of order for two years now, sell smoking room option but it's a smoke free hotel; was not informed of either ahead of arrival. Inner rooms have no temperature control; was still in AC with a night temp of 36°, not a pleasant stay.

Text: This hotel has a great fitness center!! Except for the fact that the walls are clear.  The bed was comfortable. Furniture was a little dingy. The hallways smelt kind of weird. There were stains all over the hallway carpet. This hotel has no elevators. The breakfast wasn't the best variety. And the housekeeper walked in on us getting ready. She knocked and didn't wait more than 2 oseconds for us to answer. It was an alright stay. Definitely wouldn't have my wedding here. Probably wouldn't be my first pick.

Text: Rooms are ok. Would be nice if hot tub worked. It has been broken for more than 3 weeks now. Price is reasonable. Restaurant opens at 5pm. Would be nice to have lunch on site too.
