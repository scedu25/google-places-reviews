Text: Only has the basics, but cozy, clean and comfortable. Can't beat the rates. Half the price of the cheapest hotel in downtowm Quincy. Owners were friendly and accomodating. Definitely would stay again. Tic toc doc.

Text: Another un assuming motel from the outside but the rooms are really nice. Newer tv's. Beds feel like the ones back home. The staff will give you anything you need there really friendly. Will defiantly stay at this place again if coming thru there. Only thing is it's out in the middle of nowhere so I recommend bringing snacks and drinks to the room. The eighteen wheeler is a good restaurant back up the road
