Text: This was the last stop on an extended road trip and a welcome oasis in a sea of common accomodations.  Elegant and casual...two words that would not normally appear in the same sentence...best describe this lovely, beautifully furnished, and decorated home.  The owners are delightful and serve the most wonderful breakfast you will ever taste.  We left feeling refreshed and blessed. Thanks from the bottom of our hearts!!

Text: This was my first stay at the Spencer House, located in my mother's home town.  My parents have stayed at this B&B a few times and just haven't stopped raving about it.  Now I understand why.  It is a beautiful, peaceful home, maintained and decorated by Kate and Carl themselves. Their love and joy is built into every square inch, a testament to what seems to be their mission in life -- to share that same healing love and joy with everyone who stays there.  The food is wonderful and they creatively modify it for special needs. From the cozy living room, to the delightful tea room, to the unique decor of the bedrooms, it is a place that feeds the soul and calms the rattled senses of busy lives.   This is a B&B to go out of the way to visit!  Body and soul will go away filled up with their genuine friendship and kindness.  J. Showalter

Text: As retirees, we have just returned from our 5th cross-country drive ~ Spokane, WA to NY & VA.  This trip also marked our 4th visit to The Spencer House!   While traveling, we have experienced many types of lodging - B&Bs, Airbnbs, hotels, motels and even KOA cabins/deluxe cabins.  Our very favorite of the favorite places to have reservations for the night remains "The Spencer House."  This beautiful B&B is consistently 5  shiny gold stars perfect.   We say "Ditto!" for every single,  wonderful review listed.   Kate and Karl's countenance reflects a joy deep within which includes serving others.  They do it with the utmost style in every area.  There is nothing I would change.  Others may try to imitate...but they will never duplicate "The Spencer House!"  Thank you Kate & Karl!
