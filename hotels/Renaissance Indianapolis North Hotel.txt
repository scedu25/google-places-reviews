Text: Beautiful hotel. Lovely rooms and well appointed. Food at the hotel is very good. Pretty quite rooms, I heard a few footsteps but not too bad. Unfortunately there isn't a lot within walking distance but plenty close by if you have a vehicle. Really nice place, would stay here again.

Text: I was there for a conference. The ball rooms were pretty standard for a hotel. The lunch was great where they gave us tacos. The place was very clean and easy to get to. I can't say the same for the rooms as I didn't stay there.

Text: Beautiful hotel. Staff was very helpful and the room was great.  Beware of prices in the restaurant though.  When ordering breakfast I was offered a side of bacon.  Sounded good so I accepted.  The side was $7 which seems pretty outrageous they also charged the table $9 for a pot of coffee.  Two people were drinking coffee, so that cup of coffee was 4.50 each. I paid 33 for French toast, bacon and two cups of coffee.  There are plenty of places nearby to eat at. Save some money and look around.

Text: Best hotel customer service I've ever had. We extended our stay, and they were able to keep us in the same room, they gave us mimosas at breakfast cause they knew my husband and I had just gotten married, and all the staff were really great! Couldn't have asked for better service.
