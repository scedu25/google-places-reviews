The Blue Heron Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed in a top floor lake view room and we're very happy with the stay so far. The room is spacious, view is nice and the room is clean. The furniture and fixtures are outdated but clean. The staff is also friendly. It's a great location as we're 5 minutes away from a nice small town that offers some great places to eat. We're also 30 minutes away from the sand dune beaches in Michigan City Indiana. You get a lot of amenities for the price (jacuzzi in the middle of the room, fireplace and nice balcony). We'll likely be staying here again!

Text: Unique independent hotel on Pine Lake.  I stayed in a romantic second floor lake view room that was large, light, with a comfortable king bed and a jacuzzi tub. The breakfast was simple and included an excellent scrambled egg and quality sausage along with fruit, waffles and toasts.

Text: Beautiful views. Nicer rooms than your hotels. Very quaint and the sunset on the lake is magnificent.

Text: Just spend 3 nights at the Blue Heron. Had room 204. Jacuzzi, fireplace, king-sized bed, refrigerator, plenty of room. Patio maybe 30 feet from the water. We have stayed here twice. Love the place, the owners, the breakfasts. Anniversary of visiting the first time will be in August. Hope we can stay again at that time.
