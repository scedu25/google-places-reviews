The Inn At Harbor Shores
Rating: 4
Text: The location is great as it is right on the Harbor and minutes from St. Joseph and the Lake.  Room is nice.  Nice amenity in that it offers free coffee from Uncommon Grounds to guests.  Restaurant is phenomenal.

Text: clean, biggest kitchen around, cozy to the lake. They refurbish their hotel about every year, so the keep up to date with our lives. they have a nice pool, and the cutest little coffee shop. I would definitely recommend.

Text: My group of 5 was seated quickly after a short wait in the comfortable lobby. We were given menus, water, and silverware almost before we sat down. That's where the prompt service ended. Our wait staff seemed to have too many tables, but was trying their best to keep up. Despite the impressive hustle, it took a long time to submit our drink order and even longer to get them and a water refill. When we finally got our food, it was good. However, it was slightly overcooked like it had sat under a heat lamp for to long. My scrambled eggs were a little rubbery and my friend's eggs Benedict were nearly well done instead of easy. I will chalk up this visit as a fluke and visit again when I'm in the area.

Text: Beautiful location! 2 restaurants and spacious rooms. Couldn't be better. Shuttle facilities for local areas. The only thing I could recommend is that the restaurant should open a but early.
