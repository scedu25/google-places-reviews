Text: Room wasnt ready at check in. Had to check in super late. First room we were put in I found a bedbug in the curtains. Moved from a double bed to a king. So me and the other person rooming together had to share a bed. Elevator did not work properly at all. Took 20 minutes to get us to the right floor even though the floor we were on was the only button pushed. It kept going all the way to 10 and back to the lobby. It actually jolted to a stop and opened between floors. Second room was okay. Wasn't offered any compensation for having to move to a new room after bedbug incident. Staff were decent.

Text: Very gracious friendly staff. Clean rooms and nice quality bathroom soaps. Great breakfast. Small indoor pool isn't suitable for swimming laps but nice to lounge in. Rooms have fridges and microwaves. Close to movie theatre and restaurants.

Text: There is a $50 pet fee that is not noted anywhere on the mobile site. When I complained to the assistant manager and then manager, I was treated very rudely. The managers were not able to show me where the mobile site noted the fee but refused to take any responsibility. There are many other hotels in this area, i would recommend choosing one where you will be treated with professionalism and respect.
