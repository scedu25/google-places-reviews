Three Springs RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: Peaceful & pretty setting in the country but highway noise can be a problem if you are light sleeper & windows are open. Easy access to US Highway 63. There is a pool but it was closed for the season during our visit. Friendly managers. Reasonable price.

Text: Clean and quite, off Hwy 63 between Rolla and Licking, MO. Access to Fort Leonard by way of East Gate (limited hours, closed on weekends & holidays). 15minutes from Rolla. Sites are 30 or 50 amp service, water and sewage. Ask for fire pit ring and enjoy a campfire under the stars. Clean restrooms and shower facility as well as laundry. Convince store and gas station are 3 miles away off Hwy 63.

Text: Owner goes out of his way to keep park a friendly place. Clean bathrooms, well kept grounds. He even gave us some steps to put in front of our camper and leveled it for us.

Text: We stayed at this park for a little over 2 months (late Oct - Jan 3), and were very happy with our stay.  The park is owner operated and the owner is very nice/helpful and his on site full-time camp host is also very helpful and hand delivered packages to us very often (it was Christmastime).  Another reviewer mentioned that the sites are narrow, and although that is true, they are also very long, allowing you to park your rig staggered rather than right next to the next rig (provided your hoses/cords reach).   The laundry & bathrooms were clean the handful of times I used them.  We had an excellent signal with Verizon and Cricket (TMobile was spotty).  We had 50 amp service, and I have a circuit analyzer and it was a clean connection. This park doesn't have a lot of amenities but it is clean & quiet and I'd definitely return if we are in the area again.

Text: Not a wonderful time. Sites are narrow. Bathroom, laundry room and office all locked. Was hoping to do laundry. Dog barking next door 24/7. Cost was $24.
