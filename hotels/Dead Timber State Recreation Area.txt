Dead Timber State Recreation Area

Text: Good primitive camping.  We were the only campers there, so if you want out of the way and remote this is for you.  No reservations but none really needed as there are usually not many people there.  We paid for an electrical site but the electric sockets did not work.  Not sure if they had them turned on.  The fishing was not great.  But perhaps with a small boat it could be better.  It's mowed every two weeks and has a relatively clean outhouse.

Text: We love to camp & RV when we can. Driving down Nebraska 275 towards West Point & had to stop & check this Nebraska State Recreation Area out. It made me utterly sick to see such a camping area so run down. Nebraska Game & Parks should be ashamed. It needs to be closed, permanently! Life after People... What more can I say.
