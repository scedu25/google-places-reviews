Kearney RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: Clean, nice employees, quality. Nice pond but the rest is pretty bare. Water in shower temp not consistent. Lots of sandburrs. But over all great for night or two.

Text: For the amount they charge I have to disagree with the value. The park is new and clean yes, but there's no shade and it's very loud. Really no amenities like most other parks we've stayed at. Cable tv is a simple hookup, internet was claimed to be there for "very simple minimal" use but it was extreme garbage. Internet at this facility could be a big seller and simple to set up. 

Pros - clean and new
Cons - no value for the price you pay go down the interstate for cheaper spots with more to offer.

Text: Well kept park. FHU but you're jammed in like sardines. Staff was very friendly. Nice for just 1 or 2 nights
