Davis Creek Dam Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Nicely kept campground, clean and quiet.  Obviously the local community takes pride in this place and it shows, my wife and I have stayed here twice when paddling local rivers.  They have potable water, pit toilet, best of all separate campsites for tents vs RVs so if you tent camp like us you don't have to listen to generators or AC noise all night.  My only complaint is they put street lights up and it is too bright to enjoy the stars and too bright to sleep in many sites.  If you run this campsite please consider getting rid of them, most of us city folks go camping to get away from light pollution and the stars are great out there but the light ruin it.
