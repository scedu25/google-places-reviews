Staybridge Suites Omaha 80th and Dodge

Text: Arrived late in the middle of the night. Added do not disturb sign and requested late checkout. Housekeeper repeatedly tried loudly forcing the door open several times. After opening the door and telling her we were still in the room, the front desk called and said the maid was asking to get in our room. It was still earlier then regular checkout time. Then as we were leaving the maid rudely asked repeatedly if we were finished and if there were more people still in the room. And she asked other people in my party the same thing. Rude and irritating. Will not be staying here again.

Text: Staff is very friendly and the rooms are spotlessly clean every day. Free dinner Mon-Wed made it even better!

Text: Staybridge is always a great place to stay. The social hours on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are great meals and always a very good morning breakfast!

Text: The hotel is quiet, clean, and the staff is friendly. A great place to stay if you want a little more space or want to bring the dog.

Text: The best hotel I have stayed in with excellent and friendly customer service.  Only bad thing is finding out there is an 18% tax which ended up costing me $266 for a 1 night stay when I was told $225. Nonetheless,  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and again. Also, the continental breakfast is superb!
