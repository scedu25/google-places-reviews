Windsor RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: Windsor RV park is mixed use, (mobile homes and RV lots,) which it clearly states on the website, and Passport America. The lots are level, have full 30/50 AMP hook ups, and the neighbors are friendly. It's also located close to downtown. There are three lots for RV's in the park; one at the South end, one in the middle, and one on the North end. This park is fine for a quick one or two night stay, or extended stay for the working person. If your looking for a nice view of the lake etc. You may be better suited to stay elsewhere. I have no record that you ever stayed at this park Mr. Henry, maybe you should try it before you knock it or just go stay at a park of your liking.
