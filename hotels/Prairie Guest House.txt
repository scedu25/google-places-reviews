Text: I took a yoga class last Friday at 4 with Olivia as my instructor. She was such a good teacher! I felt very relaxed. As a first timer, I felt very comfortable and the yoga moves were good for people who had never done yoga before, like me. I highly recommend it! Olivia is a great teacher!

Text: Absolutely lovely bed and breakfast. The beds were amazingly comfortable in rooms that are tastefully decorated. The breakfast is exceptional! The food is accented by herbs and spices grown on the property and is is delicious! This place makes me with there was a 6th star category for Google reviews. Highly recommend.

Text: This place was such a gem-- stayed while here for a wedding nearby, and we loved it! The owners are kind, the food is wonderful, the facilities are impeccable and beautiful. And my dad, who is rather picky, described his bed as a "10/10-- best night sleep I've ever had"! If you get the chance, definitely give this place a visit.

Text: Checking out suburban Indianapolis for retirement spots, my wife and I stayed two nights at the the Prairie Guest House.  Very nice stay.  John, Karen, Amber (and B&B kitty Fiona) were very welcoming. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and nicely appointed and decorated.  John served delicious breakfasts, of omelets one morning and quiche the next. And although Prairie Guest House is convenient to many places in a rapidly developing suburban area, it is located in a quiet and sheltered little spot near Connie Prairie.
