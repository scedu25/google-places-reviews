Holiday Inn Express Washington
Rating: 5
Text: The staff was extremely helpful with every need we had.  It was clean and fresh smelling in the room and through the halls.  That rarely happens anywhere you stay.  Prices were normal and breakfast was simple but plentiful.  Great job!

Text: Other than the breakfast, this hotel was NOT worth the price. We had 2 rooms. The first room looked like the ceiling had caved in and black mold could clearly be seen. The room also stunk like dirty socks. Our 2nd room had not been cleaned well at all. The sink and bed spreads were dirty and the shower head was rusted.  The toilet line was broken out of the wall and had been plastered with some type of sealant instead of it being properly replaced. The carpet was also littered with unknown stains.  This room also stunk. Also the night staff was not very helpful. The guy was too busy on the computer in the office to get up and come to the desk. He left his 'innapropriate' internet video running loudly and acted as though I had disturbed him when he got up and didn't even apologize for the room issues. It was 10 pm after all. I would only stay here if there were not other options since the basic room was $167/night.

Text: Lock on door did not lock.  It was reported by housekeeping, but never fixed.      No one offered another room.   Bathroom seemed unusually dark.  Coffee was exceptional in the breakfast dining room.

Text: The hotel has some wear but is nice. The staff is very friendly. I also like the number of stairs and elevator to go up and down on the floors. Breakfast was also very filling.

Text: I would give this 4 stars for cleanliness, housekeeping, location, and service. The biggest issue I have are the beds and pillows. These two items would rate a 2.
