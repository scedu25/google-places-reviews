Text: Absolutely terrible. I've never stayed here but the motel charged me anyways. We called and cancelled and were informed that there would be no fees associated with the cancellation. A few days later I seen I was charged by them. I politely called to have them take the charges off and the MANAGER refused. They are the most unprofessional motel I've ever associated with. BEWARE!!!

Text: Right off the highway so conveniently located, several stores and restaurants nearby. Room was relatively clean, however, our "smoke-free" room smelled of stale smoke quite strongly and there were a dozen marks on the bathtub where someone had left a burning cigarette. We had a jacuzzi room, which was moderately priced, but the knobs for the controls had been removed, so operating it was difficult. WiFi was provided, but weak. Advised front desk staff of these complaints upon check out and staff was indifferent, but did state she would advise management and return to the call on her cell phone that I interrupted.

Text: The room was clean and taken care of it. The bathroom is small but usable. Location was hidden behind a car dealer but easy to get to. Internet is slow and you have to click sign in every time you come back to the hotel and sometimes more.
