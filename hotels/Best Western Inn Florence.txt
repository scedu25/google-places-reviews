Best Western Inn Florence
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I stayed at the Best Western in Florence, KY for 2 nights. We were greeted by the front desk personnel named Jessica, what an extremely delightful person with a great sense of humor!  She made us feel so welcomed and special, and went beyond the call of duty to take care of us.

In the morning we were treated by a wonderful hot breakfast and had great conversations with Jeff the Chef. What a super nice guy!  He too made us feel so special. The next night Myron was working the desk and he was very willing and eager to help us out, no matter how much extra work he had to do for us. 

Because of the rain (in light of outdoor activities) we did head back home one day sooner than expected - but it had nothing to do with our stay at your hotel.  We will be back. What a great crew of employees there are at Best Western in Florence, KY. Thank you Best Western for your warm hospitality!   Dan Pawlak, Ohio

Text: Very enjoyable stay at this motel.  Room was quiet and comfortable.  I slept really well which is unusual for me in a motel.  Check in and check out were smooth and easy transactions.  Looking forward to another visit sometime in the future.

Text: The Best Western Inn in Florence, KY is a fine establishment with very professional and caring personnel.  We had to be in the Florence area for care at the Cincinnati Eye Institute facility in Edgewood, KY.  The Best Western Inn Florence in located just off Interstate 75 and only approximately 20 minutes from the Eye Institute location.  It is also close to shopping and many great eating places.  The staff are better than we have seen in many of the finer hotels we have stayed at.  I would recommend the Best Western Inn Florence to anyone.  A great place to stay.
