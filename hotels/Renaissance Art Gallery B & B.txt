Text: Bathroom was dirty, there were no working locks on the bedrooms.  In addition room service was listed as an amenity, but I was the only person in the entire building so there was no room service.  The owner checked me in, gave me a key to the building and a quick tour and left. I checked out after two days because it was so bad and I hadn't slept for 2 nights.  The owner still charged me for 4 nights.
