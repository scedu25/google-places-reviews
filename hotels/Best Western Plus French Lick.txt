Best Western Plus French Lick
Rating: 5
Text: Every staff person was happy and helpful. The breakfast was good. The room was large. The bed was too high off the floor, but very comfortable. We were here with a large group and they had all our rooms ready when we arrived so our guide was able to hand out our keys immediately. I would stay here again if in the area.

Text: Location was convenient. Breakfast was good. Better than most continental breakfasts. Had a good variety of choices. The rooms were nice and clean. The pool was a little small but still nice. Do wish though they had a hot tub. Overall it was great and I will return if I go back to French Lick.

Text: This was hands-down, one of the nicest BW hotels, I’ve ever stayed in.  The staff was amazing... courteous and professional!  The room and the entire hotel was well maintained and clean.  The front desk staff, was great, as was the breakfast serving staff.  I would definitely stay here again!
