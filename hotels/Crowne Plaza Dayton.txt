Text: Rooms are nice. Decently priced. Food isn't bad. Some of it is really good. Drinks at the bar are great. If you like music it seems that they keep bringing in bands.

Text: The rooms are very basic and there is no cable television. The bed is pretty hard. I was woken up multiple times in the night by the air conditioner rattling but we couldn't turn it off because it's really hot in here even though it's below freezing outside. My partner took a shower and the drain was clogged. There was also nowhere in the bathroom to hang up the wet towel. We spent some time in the bar last night and one bartender was really nice to me (even though he also kept touching me, which was bizarre and unwanted) but rude to my friends. The food was as overpriced as hotel restaurant food normally is but it was pretty good. I got a burger from room service and it was pretty good, too. It came quickly and the food tasted fresh. I wouldn't stay here again if I didn't have to.

Text: Room was nice and clean. It would have been nice if breakfast was included with our rate. There are not a lot of food choices in winter walking conditions. Great access to the convention halls and free hotel parking is a plus.

Text: Great spot in the middle of everything, very clean rooms and friendly staff. My room didn't have a microwave so if you plan on taking microwavable food make sure you check first. Elevators are a little slow as well but overall the experience was great. Lot of bars and pubs within walking distance.

Text: Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, well equipped fitness room, dated furnishings, maintenance could be better. The parking situation is convenient but ask for details at front desk don't ask valet. He twisted the explanation so I nearly agreed to $15+tip per night when it turns out parking is free.
