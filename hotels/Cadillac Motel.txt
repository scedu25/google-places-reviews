Cadillac Motel

Text: Rooms are clean and bug-free. Service is efficient and pleasant. We arrived very late (4am) from hospital and they checked us in immediately so we could get some sleep. Decor is a little dated, but good water pressure in the shower and nice TV in the room. Bed was a bit soft for my liking. Good value in Windsor, centrally located.

Text: The plus side are the staff and location. They Definately have a lot more work to put in. Shower has suspicious looking mould like substance in the grout. Toilet is positioned very awkwardly, a tall person like me has to sit on it sideways to use it. I imagine once they do some major renovations this place will be well worth the money.

Text: Place was an absolute s*it hole...posted numerous reviews and aren't afraid to say the place had bugs( all over beds and bathroom) dried blood on shower curtains and on towels. Dirty rags in the window sills..burn holes in bedding.room didn't look like it was cleaned in weeks... and when we complained the owner was an ignorant man.refused to give us a refund..too bad as we're worldly travelers.

Text:  It is a really good place to stay. I would stay there again. It was quiet and the room was very clean. I liked that it had a couch and chair made it feel like I was at home. I would recommend it to other people.

Text: It has improved drastically but there is still lots of work yup be done. Rates were very reasonable.
