Text: Great staff! They helped me so much. I am disabled and in the midst of moving but had to wait for my husband to be well enough to get out of the hospital. They were all so kind and helpful with absolutely everything.

Text: The employees were nice but the man at the desk was unprofessional.
To start with they over charged us to what the person said when taking  our card number over the phone.
Our room smelled old but looked clean except for at the end of the bed. 
There was no where to hang our clothes 
NO cell phone hook ups
NO safe in the room
They said they had movie channels but we went through every channel no HBO or any other movie channel.
We paid for 2 nights but I'm not sure if we'll stay the second night.
This room is not worth what they charge by any means.
Worse experience we ever had at a hotel.
