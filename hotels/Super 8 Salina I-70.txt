Text: Very cozy rooms to stay over and rest overnight. detailed and organized rooms for you to feel almost like home. Only problem we had was the spa. It was a bit less of what we expected for being more warm than hot.

Text: Room assigned #203 - We choose this location because we had stayed here 2 times previously and were quite pleased with this place! After a long drive, we arrived tired and ready to stretch out and sleep. Upon checking in, we were assign a room on the 2nd floor. The 2 times we had been here we had a room on the 1st floor. We always want a non-smoking room, and when we entered we were hit with 70s looking carpet and a odd smell that maybe could be a slight smell of smoke, more like when a match is lit and then blown out. We had some Frebreeze with us, so we sprayed it around the room - helped a little... the carpet was riddled with stains [so much so we wore shoes to walk around], some of the wallpaper peeling off the wall by the ceiling, hole in  one of the bedskirt, top electrical outlet by bed, closest to window, has no power to it, and the window was cracked. The beds themselves seem okay enough to go ahead and sleep in. The bathroom was clean! The furniture is outdated [couch sagged towards the middle] and we don't want to sit on it, and there were a couple stains ceiling.  Maybe this place only updated the 1st floor? Again, we really did enjoy this place the last 2 times we stayed.

Text: Very close to the interstate and easy to get to. The bed was comfy and the room was nice and large. The free breakfast had hot gravy for biscuits and a waffle maker. There was trash in the trashcan when we got to the room but otherwise the room was clean. I'd stay there again!

Text: This location is easy to get to from the highway. The hotel is dated. Older bed linens and beds. Cable worked fine. WiFi did not work well. Rooms were clean. Kids enjoyed the pool. Breakfast was good. Staff was very friendly! I talked to one of the workers for a while. She was sweet, knowledgeable and helpful. She made the stay good.

Text: Ok place to rest your head for a night. No elevator to upper floors. Hotel could use a good upgrade, some cracked tile around toilet base, carpet needs shampoo'd, and a couple of dust bunnies on the ceiling. But bed was comfortable, sheets were clean, room was nice.
