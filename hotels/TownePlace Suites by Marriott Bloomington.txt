Text: Very clean, nice big suite rooms. The pillows are extremely comfortable and the blankets are very soft. The staff is very friendly and house keeping always provides you with great service. The pool is a little smaller than I thought and b it is outside but it's still clean and nice. They have a waffle maker for the breakfast so that was awesome.

Text: Excellent staff and accommodations.  A large selection for breakfast although hot and well prepared you have understand they don't control the quality.  It's a bit on the order of precooked, heat and eat style. They DO have a good selection of fruit, cereals,and "you make" waffles. Failing that, they are with in walking distance to McDonald's, Chedders,Texas Roadhouse, Golden Corral and Domo Japanese, etc. Housekeeping is excellent as well. A convenient location with access to the interstate.

Text: Staff was great! The desk clerks were polite, cleaning very courteous, breakfast ladies were very nice & maintenance was nice also even though we didn't need them. My husband & I were there for two months so I meet a bunch of staff. They had yummy warm cookies in the evening & had dinner catered on Tuesday nights. We had our dog with us. They treated her very well also. They gave her treats & offered to take her out if we needed. I wanted to stay until we found a house, but my husband's job wasn't going to pay for our stay anymore. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.

Text: I had a great time when I passed through Bloomington. Check in was quick and easy, and I appreciated the mini snack shop in the lobby. The staff was friendly and helpful (I needed directions, I didn't plan ahead). The room was spacious and clean, and the location was fantastic. It was just off the highway, there were plenty of restaurants of various types for whatever I was hungry for, which was convenient because I overslept past the breakfast.

The only complaint I really had was how small the space for the toilet was. That's a weird sentence to type, but I don't know how else to say it. When sitting on the toilet, I felt cramped and had to twist a little awkwardly to get toilet paper. That being said, it was not a serious problem. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
