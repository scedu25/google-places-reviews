Text: Hotel Staff was super friendly. When i got there the Manager had written me a card and had brownies and cookies in a plastic container for me. Bed was super cozy the AC worked really nicely. There is a restaurant connected to the hotel (bit of a walk) that has amazing food (bit pricey but worth it). This hotel is right by a full golf course and there is planty of parking. I will definitely stay at this location again due to all of the positives above.

Text: The Candlewood Suites is situated around a beautiful golf course. Lots of trees and greenery provide a great ambiance upon arrival. I am quite happy with my queen suite, which can be described as decent sized one bedroom apartment. It has a kitchenette, nice size bath, large working desk, comfortable living room and two TVs. I've not had any issues with noise other than a few creaking sounds from the floors. As for amenities, you have access to the Michigan State University Club, which has a fitness center, spa, and restaurant. Overall my stay has been swell and I'm sure you would enjoy it too.

Text: The rooms looked nice, but some mattresses had stains. The blankets were low quality. A few people staying in other rooms reported cockroaches and other bugs. I would not stay here again.
