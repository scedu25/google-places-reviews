Aldrich Guest House Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had a wonderful stay at the Aldrich Guest House. Robert and Douglas are wonderful hosts that really know what they are doing. The room was extremely comfortable. We enjoyed wine each night and the breakfasts were delicious. We really appreciated the tour of the home and learning all of the fascinating history. We look forward to another stay here.

Text: Amazing stay over the weekend!  The house is amazingly clean & the food was fantastic.  Robert & Douglas are incredible hosts!  Would encourage you to stay here.  Very easy walk through the park/over the walk bridge to downtown.  No worries about parking!

Text: We had an amazing experience here! The location is absolutely perfect. You are close enough to downtown to walk, but tucked away in a quiet neighborhood full of small town charm. There are a few large parks nearby to spend time in, but who would want to leave the property with the beautiful garden that they have? And if you get a chance to see the cat which likes to help with gardening sometimes, even better! Breakfast was delicious and catered to our dietary needs. All of the rooms are clean and styled well. Robert and Douglas are wonderful hosts and I can't wait to stay again!
