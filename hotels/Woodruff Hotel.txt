Text: We had a wonderful experience staying at the Woodruff Hotel. We were there with a group of friends and our rooms were excellent, they were clean, comfortable and well supplied with everything we could ask for. We were met with pleasant and friendly staff including the owners who went out of their way to assure that we had a great stay. It is a perfect location and I would highly recommend this this Hotel to everyone including my family and closest friends .

Text: Beware when booking on their website. It is a request not a reservation. Their site will show you that they have availability but that is not necessarily the case. Do not book through their website! It is a better bet to call. We booked through their website because it showed availability. We cancelled our other hotel reservation. Then the next morning received an email from them that they had no room for us. Very frustrating. A simple one line, This is a request not a reservation, would be really great customer service.

Text: Quaint hotel, feels like staying with Grandma. Lots of squeaks and creaks, a nice homey place. I had a view of the Temple, so beautiful!

Text: Due to traveling with family I was able to stay in two rooms. Each room had its quirks. For being a building built a long time ago and modernized as they went, it is in awesome shape. I had to check in after hours so I didn't get to talk to anybody as I checked in but I got into my room just fine. They got the wrong room for the crib so I called the listed number and they got us a crib right away. Overall the rooms felt nice and we were able to enjoy ourselves. The TV's were modern. One bed I was in was creaky. The hot water could take some time but in the end it was there. Great overall experience, would stay there again when visiting.
