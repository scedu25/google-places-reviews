Green Acres Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed in the hotel section of this hybrid hotel-motel, which is newer than the motel section but slightly higher per night. The room was very clean and well maintained, the staff were extraordinarily friendly and accommodating. I will definitely consider this establishment for future visits to the Pittsfield area.

Text: Expensive to comparative hotels. Rooms were clean, breakfast was pretty good! Staff wore shorts to work. We were there two days and the room was not re-stocked. No pool. FREE WIFI.
