Text: When we got there, there was a used soap in the shower, they didn’t change the shampoo bottle, the wet towel is still hanging on the shower curtain, the towels are still dirty, there’s ashes on the bed, smells like old people & cigarettes, the AC smells like someone was smoking, those maids are not doing a very good, that WiFi doesn’t exist, my husband and I are never ever coming back in that place again.

Text: The place is trash. Over charge for a room where the wall paper is pealing off the walls raggidy funiture out dated tvs "tube" they reheat the same gravy for breakfeast every morning sometimes 3 or 4 times in a row maintenance dont care about their job. I requested that they fix my shower cutin for over a month and a new AC unit for 2 months they refused to move me to a different room. I had to beg them to move me to another room. They refuse to give refunds if you are disatified weather you stayed the full time you paid or not. Its a good place to be if you are a drug addict or have absolutly no other options.and my new room is not any better as you can see from my posted pictyres.
