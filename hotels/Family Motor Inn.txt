If the choice is staying here or driving to Tulsa, grab a coffee, crank the radio, and go.
Afghanistan has better accommodations. 
Owner lost our 'reservation ' in the 15 minutes between when we called and when we try to check in.
Room is 100 degrees when we arrive.  Spent an hour with the door open trying to cool it down to little effect.
Toilet broken.
Shower leaks.
Stains on the carpet.
I'm fairly sure there are bed bugs. 
Back parking lot of this place looks like an old set piece from "Apocalypse Now".
Laying in the dark on the bed should be the final challenge in some sadistic Japanese game show.
To borrow a quote,  "Nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure."
If you've read this far and are still seriously considering staying here, I would strongly suggest psychological counselling and a heavy dose of medication.  No, just no.
Google, seriously. Consider an option for reviews LESS than one.  I feel like I'm being robbed to have to rank a one.

Text: The motel is older and could stand to be updated, but was clean and comfortable and reasonably priced. I'll stay there again.

Text: Quite the disgusting little place. Mysterious wet spots on the excessively carpeted rooms. Not a thing has been touched since early 1980s. The characters in the parking lot make you question whether you'll get murdered or get  your car broken into.
