Text: Wow!!!  We called ahead while traveling on Interstate 80...very nice man answered the phone and held a spot for us. The campground itself is basic with water and electric. There is a dump station near the office. Older, but very clean, keyed, restrooms and showers.  It is right across from an outdoor horse arena where we walked to and watched a barrel racing competition for free!!. Best part...the site cost $15 for a pull through with water and electric!!! Very nice park, safe and friendly. This place is definitely a hidden gem!!

Text: $15 a night, 30amp and water.  Dump near by. We're in a 38' motorhome. Lisa's Kitchen in the other side of the tracks is very good. A nice Pony Express museum in the main city park.
