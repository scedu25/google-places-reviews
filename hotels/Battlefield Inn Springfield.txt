Text: Great place to stay if you are on the run, selling your body for the night or just looking for a convenient place to shoot up your smack, and major bonus if you forget your needles you can always check under the mattress or carpet! The roaches, leaking pipes, unflushable toilets, cum blood and cigarette stains are easy to look past when your high as a kite. And if your run out the friendly crackhead next door are always eager to help!??

Text: Zero stars would be more accurate.  This place is disgusting!  The door to our room had recently been knocked in by a police battering ram.  There was what appeared to be blood spatter on the bathroom door and cum stains on the walls.  Saw several drug deals and prostitutes in 1 hour. No refunds!  Avoid this place!

Text: Good place to go if you want to have your car broke into or get harassed by manager or ? police. I heard the staff has taken things from rooms. Lock up your valuables. Low rent older motel not well maintained. Our lock didn't work well. Rooms have that smoked in smell, even the no smoking ones. Be sure to check for critters under your mattress.
I wouldn't recommend this place, rude desk guy and high rates for what you get! Much nicer one a couple blocks to the North off West Sunshine St.
