Text: Delightful campground! Very family centric with the amenities such as a pool, playground, dog park, massive trampoline style bubble to bounce on, a mineral mining station, recreation room with games, etc.

Only problem with the campground is that it is directly off a main road with a lot of engine braking from semi trucks, the road noise level may pit off most people. Staff was very nice, gift shop was great with snacks and even locally brewed beer.

Text: Excellent.  I was on a quest for a quiet nights sleep and I found it.  
This is a nice family oriented campground with plenty of things to occupy kids all day long. A Hay ride in the evening with a fire and Marshmallows,  ahh. 
The owners care about this campground and it shows. Some needed additional sites and bathrooms are going to be ready for the Spring 2018 season. 
The bathrooms are clean and the camp store, well stocked. 
The Kamp kitchen offered 3 stoves, sinks and a large counter area,  all under a roofed enclosure. 
Several day activities and places to see are near by. 
For us, it was easy to get to but far enough away to feel like we were out in the country.

Text: Once again the Long family and staff provided an amazing weekend.  The campground was clean and staff friendly.  The sites are nicely graveled, fire pits were cleaned and grass cut.  Very well maintained.  Can't wait to camp here again.

Text: Great Place for a Special Family Weekend!

This place is near my grand-kids so we have stayed here about 4 times .  The kids love it and are always busy.  Pool is in great condition, bouncing pillow is loved by the kids, bathrooms are super clean no matter when you are in them, and the camp sites are well tended.  The owners really have a high standard for their campground, are friendly, and seem to really enjoy themselves.
