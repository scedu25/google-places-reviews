Red Roof Inn Kentland

Text: We expected a good night's sleep with few amenities and that's exactly what we had. The well water had been softened a lot but still smelled slightly of sulfur. That was the only thing that kept them from being a 5-star version of a rural hotel with no amenities. The sink, located in the room not in the bathroom, would create an odor just by running the water.

Text: The desk clerk was very friendly. The first room we had, had no remote for the TV. That room also had spiders in the tub. The room we were switched to was much better.

Text: This place has mold, bugs, no pool. The air conditioning doesn't work. Rust on the doors bathrooms etc. Place needs to be shut down the worst nightmare I walked in too and straight out of we did not stay here would not stay for millions. I was afraid to bring anything in bc of what would have came back to my home. Broken windows,garbage cans, weeds everywhere.
