The Castle Inn

Text: The food and service were really good. The room we stayed in(304) was very pretty the only thing that was a pain was the jets for the tub. Every time we wanted them on or off we had to flip the breaker on the outside of the room. We do plan on staying again just in a different room.

Text: Daughter  had a wedding receptipn there .great place to have one. I was dissapointed on the appetizers  they served for this event.   they paid a couple hundread for food for 50 people and the got ..ravioli on a stick chicken on a stick stuffed tomatoes some fruit  and just a few other things... we supplied all the drinks, dessert... we were not impressed ... make sure you know what exactly your getting for the price  I could have made a better selection for  that kind of money if I knew what we were having I would have brought in our food and save a couple hundred dollars .
