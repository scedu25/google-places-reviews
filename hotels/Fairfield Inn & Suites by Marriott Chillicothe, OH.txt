Text: Here on a business trip and the front desk people have been awesome. The building is really new and modern. I went over to the Hampton and it looks like its from the 80s. The Fairfield is comfortable, best beds I've slept on in any hotel. Ill stay here everytime for my business trips.

Text: This hotel is the perfect place to stay in Chillicothe. The people at the front desk are so nice and accommodating. The room was very clean and the beds are super comfortable. The hotel offers a great breakfast for free and other amenities I wish I had had the time to take advantage of, like the gym and pool. Overall this is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at and will be staying there every time I travel through the area.

Text: Great freeway access. Had some special requests and staff accommodated us perfectly. Rooms are spacious, clean, and luxurious. Showers were very relaxing. Only thing I didn't like was the sausage at the free breakfast was a veggie sausage instead of real sausage :) that's my only knit pick
