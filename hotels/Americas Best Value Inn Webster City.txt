Americas Best Value Inn Webster City

Text: Rooms are ok but the attitude of management leaves a lot to be desired. We asked for a room for 2 adults 2 kids when we made reservations. They tried to give us a room with 2 twin beds. Switched rooms and price went up drastically. We were threatened with eviction after someone two doors down said that the motel smelled. We had paid for a week. We left with a night left on what we had paid for. Do not recommend this motel.

Text: I loved the location, in the center of all activities I was there for, the rooms are a bit out dated and the service was not really friendly

Text: Very nice management and the rooms were in ok shape.  Could use some TLC cuz there was some garbage out in front of the hotel entrance and I'm sure that it was thrown there by guests but if management didn't want the place to appear run down at least they should keep it clean.
