Historic Buxton Inn

Text: We went to the Buxton this evening to eat, We waited about 5 minutes for somebody to show up to seat us. The wait staff was good but seamed understaffed. We ordered 2 filet's  and the prime rib. Filet's came out as ordered the Prime Rib came out like leather, dry and over cooked. It clearly wasn't freshly cooked. I then ordered the chicken cordon bleu which was very good. Desserts were also very good.  I would recommend they take the Prime Rib off the menu unless they are going to cook fresh each day. There is no way the Prime was fresh. The color would be the same all the way through.

Text: A gem of a hotel in one of the more charming towns I have ever seen.  If you have ever been to colonial Williamsburg and wished that you could have the same experience in a more authentic setting then this is your place.  Tons of history and charm with an enthusiastic staff.  Great stay, great value.  I highly recommend it as a place with character that the big chains can't match.

Text: Thus far I have really enjoyed my stay here. The room is nice and everyone on staff has been very friendly. We enjoyed a drink in the Blue Bar last night and are looking forward to dinner in The Tavern tonight.

Text: We had my son's rehearsal dinner in the garden room on a summer Friday evening.  The room looked lovely, the food was delicious and the servers were very attentive.  The entire Inn looks beautiful following the recent renovations.  Didn't have any ghostly guests for dinner, so I guess we'll have to go back & try again.

Thanks for everything!

Text: Stayed one night in 'haunted' room 9. Didn't see any ghosts, but my stay was still very enjoyable. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Secret paths, a basement tavern, a gorgeous greenhouse, lots to explore. Loved that I could leave my car and just walk , or take one of their bikes,  into town. I would definitely stay again, and recommended to others.
