Candlewood Suites Kansas City-Overland Park
Rating: 4
Text: Decent rooms, very antiseptic smell tho. Reminded me of bandaids. Thin walls, noisy guests are a concern, and there were many. Good value for the price.

Text: It has a great location, there are a few parks nearby, had great restaurants for breakfast and lunch in a less than 10 mim drive, the mall is also close. To me the best part is that is quiet and peaceful, I have not heard any noise from the street at all. Very friendly and welcoming staff as well. The room and bathroom are comfortable. Does not feel crowded at all.

Text: Seems like one of the oldest facilities in Overland Park. Our room has a moldy odor and there where no king beds in the property. The front desk appears to be severely understaffed during normal business hours. I recommend a newer place for a restful night.

Text: I stayed here because of my previous experience with candlewood suites. This one is in desperate need for a remodel.  The kitchen in my room is filthy.  An inch of dirt on top of the refrigerator and food dripping down the side of the fridge. Crickets chirping all night in the kitchen light fixture. 

The bed is new and pretty comfortable and I guess that is the most important thing in a hotel room.

Pretty disappointing there's no hot tub or swimming pool. 

I feel it is overpriced for this compared to other hotel suites in larger markets in this country

Text: Good location, not well kept, but a decent value... Laundromat, gym, kitchenette & pantry are all nice conveniences offered. No breakfast, the staff is less friendly than I remember during our 1st two month stay. I would say this location is going down hill and that you should consider Hilton Homewood Suites or another extended stay option if you want the atmosphere you come to expect from that type of place, they just don't seem as concerned with customer service here as they of were.
