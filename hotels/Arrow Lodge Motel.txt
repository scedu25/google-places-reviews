Text: This place is a dump.  The pictures on the website are stock photo's and are NOT representative of this motel.  My buddy and I stayed here summer of 2016 in a room just a couple doors to the north of the lobby (counter where you pay... no real lobby).  the room was filthy with cobwebs hanging from the ceiling in every corner.  We killed two HUGE spiders within an hour of checking in.  The sheets and pillow cases were totally worn out.  Carpet was dirty and severly worn.  I could go on and on.  Stay somewhere else until the owners either clean and fix this place up or at least accurately represent it on the web.  What a scam.
