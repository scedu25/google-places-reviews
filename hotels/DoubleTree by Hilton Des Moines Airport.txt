DoubleTree by Hilton Des Moines Airport
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is beautiful. Rooms are clean and well-decorated. Service in the restaurant is also very good. They don't have a Continental breakfast, but we added breakfast from the restaurant to our room bill for a nominal fee, and the breakfast was nice with good quality food. We stayed with a 3-yr-old and a 3-mo-old baby. The staff were friendly with the kids. It was an excellent hotel experience.

Text: Highly recommend staying at this hotel if you need to catch a flight out of the Des Moines airport. The building appears to be new with nice lobby and modern rooms. Being a HHonors member is a plus since you get a free drink at the lounge in the attached restaurant. The pool and hot tub were nice, but the gym looked small. Staff were very courteous and professional. Very close to the airport and great if you need to get out for an early morning flight. Would stay again if I'm back in the area!

Text: The room is small but great for me since I am traveling by myself. The Italian steakhouse is amazing and it is attached to the hotel so no need to drive. They have a shuttle to and from the airport which is close by (5 minute drive) and you don't hear the airplanes. Hotel employees are friendly and room service is top notch.
