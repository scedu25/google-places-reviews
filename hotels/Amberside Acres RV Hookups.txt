Text: I stayed here for about a month I travel the USA for work.  Nice quiet place to stay travel lots that are more level than some concrete spots.  Wi-Fi worked for me steady signal. Owner is super helpful and as small towns go he knows who to call to get things done. I pulled in on a Flat tire he gave me the number for the local tire man and even left him a message for me.  Located convient to witchita but far enough out you don't deal with the city nonsense.
