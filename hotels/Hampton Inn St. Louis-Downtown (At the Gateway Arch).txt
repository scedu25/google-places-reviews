Hampton Inn St. Louis-Downtown (At the Gateway Arch)
Rating: 5
Text: Overall the accommodations were standard. Nice sized pool but no hot tub. Room was clean and we had a great view of the arch. What made the stay a 5 star experience was the customer service from the gentleman with the fancy moustache.

Text: After arriving in St. Louis were 24,000 women were attending the 2017 Joyce Meyer Conference, we found out that our condo had been double booked.  With 6 ladies and no place to stay at 4pm on a Thursday night, were originally all downtown hotels were booked, we Called Hampton Inn and thankfully they had two rooms!  Within 10 minutes (our drive time to get there) they not only greeted us with the best customer service, they already had our rollaway beds in both rooms and quickly helped us get our things upstairs so that we could make it on time to the conference!  Everything and everyone was amazing including the breakfast.  Thank you all so much for taking this terrible situation and going above and beyond to help us!!!

Great clean rooms and common area too!  :-)

Text: It was the best place. Within walking distance to downtown areas, nice warm swimming pool and a play area for kids in the breakfast lounge. Would recommend to others.

The staff was very help and friendly!  We left two items in our room when leaving, not only did they track them down but they made arrangements to send them to our house!

Very thankful and appreciative of their efforts!

Text: One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. The front desk staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. I forgot toothpaste and they were nice enough to bring some to my room. Also, the Irish Pub in the Lobby has great happy hour specials and delicious food along with really personable staff.
