Text: Was at this place for a Concours show and they were extremely helpful. They allow us to get in our rooms 2 hours early because I had been on the road for a while. Really went beyond expectation. GREAT PLACE TO STAY!!!!!

Text: Gem of a place in the greater Detroit area! Spent a couple days here for a work conference, was pleasantly surprised at how much it had to offer in terms of service, comfort, classical/anglical decor, and food. Lots of exquisite gardens interspersed throughout the property.

Text: It is a beautiful set of buildings, with a Spanish /Vatican feel. The apatizers we're fantastic. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I was surprised to fine "Cardinal parking", and a golf course in the same place, but it wasn't a bad thing at all. Over all it was a beautiful location.

Text: Was upgraded to the executive sweet and given free breakfast. Was an amazing experience to say the least. Rooms are immaculate and staff is great. Food in the restaurant is 5 star as well.
