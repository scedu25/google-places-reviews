Text: This place is HORRIBLE! It was just like staying at your mean grandma's house with the mean grandma's rules in full effect. The picture of the nice gazebo? It's right outside grandma's back door, and you better not have a romantic conversation with your spouse in there or laugh with them after 9:30, or grandma's full wrath will come down upon you. Seriously though, this is not a joke. The proprietor yelled at us and made us tremendously uncomfortable our whole stay. We couldn't even hide in our room and watch the "cable"... it is NOT cable, rather over-the-air TV. After cowering in our room watching Gilligan's Island at a near-silent volume for a few days, we vowed that next time we come visit family in Aledo we will definitely stay in the Quad Cities and make the half-hour commute as opposed to staying in the Blue Spruce Correctional Facility/ Lodge. All I can say  is GO TO THE NEXT TOWN. DO NOT STAY HERE!! I can only imagine how miserable she would make her guest if they actually had kids, an alarm clock, phones not on vibrate, or anything else that might make noise and bring her anger down upon you.
