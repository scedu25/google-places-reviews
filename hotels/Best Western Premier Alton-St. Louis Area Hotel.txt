This tastefully-appointed hotel is easily the best Best Western I've ever stayed at. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff were courteous and professional and very attentive to the needs of their guests. The breakfast was great - a full hot bar, waffle maker, and several cold options -as was the 24 hour sundry shop. The shop had very reasonable prices, much better than at other hotels I've stayed at. I did not get a chance to spend time at the bar and restaurant in the hotel however it looked very nice. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: I stay at this location every time I visit St. Louis. Only a short drive to downtown. Over the last 3 years I've watched this hotel turn from a basic hotel to a 5-star joint. With every visit it gets better and better. Rooms are huge, breakfast is amazing, staff is professional and helpful, plus they have a full bar. Overall great stuff!

Text: Where to begin... pulling in you might think "hey this looks like a nice hotel!"  Then you walk in and you realize it is even nicer than you thought! An unassuming Best Western from the street turns into a luxurious hotel upon entry! Recently given a makeover, the rooms are well laid out with incredible beds, linens, modern bathroom...all very clean and well maintained! Also, the breakfast is top notch...LOCAL BACON!! I will be back!

Text: I went to law school in Saint Louis many years ago, and I'd never even heard of Alton, IL, until I came to this hotel. What a beautiful hotel standing tall only minutes from Granite City, which is exactly what it sounds like, and, of course Saint Louis. The staff was friendly, the restaurant excellent, and the room was superb. They even went above and beyond by helping me fax something to my hometown Clerk of Courts because I forgot I had a traffic court appearance the same day I was staying in Alton.

It was a quick 20-minute ride to Saint Louis (unless it's rush hour, in which case just chill in the awesome bar/restaurant for a bit before you head out). I would definitely stay there again.

Text: Had a nice stay at this hotel, they have built a huge atrium area for the lobby, pool and business lounge areas complete with funky art installed. The room was very clean and had a fresh feel to it. The flat screen TV was probably the biggest and clearest picture I've ever had in a hotel room. The shower head was moveable which is great for very tall or short people. The staff was kind, the lobby had fruit infused water and coffee available all the time. Complimentary breakfast includes a chef making omelets to order!
