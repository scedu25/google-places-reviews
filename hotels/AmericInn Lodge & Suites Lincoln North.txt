Text: Very clean and well taken care of hotel.  Limited continental breakfast.  Knowledgeable staff with friendly service.  They have a pool and hot tub but no fitness center.  A small meeting room is also near the pool.  This is located in a very busy area.

Text: We were assigned room 211. It was an updated room with two queens, a microwave, and a mini fridge. The hotel is located amongst car dealerships, so no view. The continental breakfast was typical, they could use a new (and additional) toaster. The pool and tub were nice enough. Staff was all very helpful and friendly. My only complaint and reason for docking one star is that the water pressure just isn't there in the showers. I have thick hair it took forever to get it rinsed clean. For the price point that we paid via an affiliate site this hotel is pretty much what I expect.

Text: Nice new and clean. Matched internet price for room, very reasonable. Away from interstate so much quieter. Walk to dairy queen or cracker barrel. Nice pool, hot tub and pool table.

Text: I loooove this place. I will stay here absolutely every time I visit my son. Its so comfortable everything worked (pool,spa,pool table,business center) it was clean the staff were great and kept everything neat and were helpful. The ONLY thing I found wrong was the soda machine was warm but the free ice machine was next to it. Good deal
