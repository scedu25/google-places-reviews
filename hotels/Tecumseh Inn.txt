Tecumseh Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We always enjoy our stay here. Been here a couple times this year and plan to go back. Rate are reasonable,  proportional to the type of hotel.
Rating: 5
Text: Has a Up-North feel to it complete with Pine Trees, my wife and I stay here often and have never had a bad experience. Not the Crown Plaza but it is what I expect from a small town Mom & Pop. We usually rent the suite with the Jacuzzi for a stay-cation.

Text: Had relatives from out of town staying here. The room is nasty cobwebs all over, it also smells funny. They have to clean there own room because this place only cleans every 3 days. Unprofessional in my opinion.

Text: Nice and helpful staff. First room we checked into smelled funny but they happily moved us. Was hidden off the main roadway in a weird way but once figured out how to get into the parking lot the first time. Complimentary breakfast had little snacks that you could take for the day.

Text: Staff was very professional and courteous in helping my roofers obtain rooms sporadically during a recent project we did in tecumseh. Will use again next time we have a project out that way.
