Fort Niangua River Resort
Rating: 2
Text: I'm a frequent visitor to the Niangua River and have used a variety of outfitters. Not impressed with Fort Niangua. While they were very friendly, office staff seemed to struggle with logistics and basic customer service skills. Do not get the front cabin next to the office - one guy barged in at 7am wanting to buy coffee.

Text: This place was pretty pricey for a mediocre cabin that isn't on the river. It was reasonably clean mostly but bed sheets were not fresh. The cabin we stayed in was connected to the office, so we had to keep the door locked to prevent people from just barging in. The eight person cabin does sleep eight, but just note that four people are sleeping in the front room on a bed and very uncomfortable pull out couch. Also, they have a confederate flag  on their official "fort niangua" mud truck. Fly it if you want, but if you're that proud of it, post pictures of it on the website or Facebook so potential customers know that.
