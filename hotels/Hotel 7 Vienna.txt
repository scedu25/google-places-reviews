Text: Crashed here one night during a long road trip. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was nice and clean. Area quiet. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Update to my first review, now that my stay is over...while the condition of the hotel is questionable, the staff is incredibly friendly! Every interaction I had with them was pleasant and they were always smiling. This brings my rating from a 1 star to a 3 star!

Text: First impressions...literally I don't even know if I will be able to sleep tonight, this place is so sketchy. Holes in walls, broken door locks, shower towels draped over back of toilet. Air conditioner is covered in dust. Outside door key swiper is broken so building appears to not be secure. All windows covered in a murky film. Bathroom light is hanging from dusty abyss in ceiling. Staring at a random hand print on the wall right now while wondering what the brown splash stains on the telephone are. Yikes.

Text: Not very classy. Shady people hanging out in the parking lot on a Saturday night. Very basic hotel experience. Great location, but the owner needs to put maintenance higher up on the list of priorities.
