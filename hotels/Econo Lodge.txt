Econo Lodge
Rating: 4
Text: My fiance and I have stayed in many hotels and the econo lodge, although costs a little more,  its definitely worth the extra money.  Its even better than the motels in its same. Price class.  We've both agreed we've found our new vacation spot.

Text: Room was clean and staff friendly and prompt. Shower heads a bit low (I'm 5'8") but other wise for our purposes it worked for us. It does sit by a busy road so noise might be a problem for some mainly early to midmorning. From the outside it looks like it needs freshened up but our room was fine. Had a pool but it was covered so I assume they probably don't even open it. Restaurants O Plenty either close by or a short mile and a half to the touristy part of St Joe. Restaurants that we are at were good to very good but we felt in all cases a bit overpriced. All in all we were happy and would stay again.

Text: Old facilities,  not up to date, unfriendly staff, dirty rooms. Too expensive for location

Text: Staff at check-in/check-out (I assume was the owner) was so friendly and helpful! We arrived about an hour early and our room was not ready for us yet. We had a few perishables with us, and the staff allowed us to place them in the room's fridge while we went out to our event that evening. Great value for the area, as well
