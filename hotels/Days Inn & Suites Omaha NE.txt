Days Inn & Suites Omaha NE

Text: Little bit dated, but they are remodeling. The breakfast is nice... Nothing too fancy, but for a free breakfast, it's not bad. Should be a nice hotel once they finish the updates. Just be careful with Google maps... It may have you turn too early and then you be in the back alley of an abandoned shopping center.

Text: It was good but our room wasn't as clean as reviews I had read online. Dead ants in the bathroom, the carpet outside the bathroom smelled like wet dog, the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. On the  bright side the bed was clean and smelled like they had been washed thoroughly. It would be good in a pinch but not for special occasions

Text: My wife and I stayed in room 132. Upon arrival at about 4pm, we could see the carpets in the hall way was stained and warm down. In a couple of spots the were small holes in the floor along the hall. Once we got down by our room the hallway reek of cigarette smoke. This was was suppose to be a smoke free hotel. Fast forward to 2 am and the fire alarm sounded wake us from a deep sleep. We go to the front and the front desk guy said he silenced the alarm but was not going to call the fire department. We called them because he wasn't going to. Turned out to be someone smoking in their room. Finally get back to sleep only to wake up to ants all over our stuff,. We didn't have any food so nothing we had would of attracted them.

Text: This is the second night I've stayed here and it is a great place for the price.  Slightly dated but the rooms serve the purpose.  The staff are helpful.

Text: Beautiful hotel with the most comfy beds. They serve a small but good breakfast and the hotel is on a hill which over looks part of the city and is very beautiful. Everything you need is near by.
