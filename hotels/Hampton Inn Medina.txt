Hampton Inn Medina
Rating: 5
Text: Located close to downtown Medina, and right off the freeway. Complimentary breakfast was great, and had plenty of options. Located close to several quick restaurants. Staff was very friendly, helpful, and courteous. No complaints from our stay.

Text: I stay at Hampton Inns more than 120 nights a year. I typcially ask the front service people for a bottle of water during my two night stay. When I asked the front desk for a bottle of water they said their manager is cracking down on free waters so she couldn’t give me one. I only get one at check in. I spend $18k/year at Hamptons and can’t get a bottle of water?

Text: The hotel was pretty nice. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. They have a pool. I didn't use it, but it's there. All I did there was sleep, but for that it was perfectly fine.

Text: Horrible place right now. Heavy booted construction guys with screw guns above you if you’re on the third floor. And if you’re from the west, they’re goin at it at 6 a.m. btw, “ there may be falling debris “.  Pool was closed for one day for maintenance... not sure why they wouldn’t choose night time for that.  Also there is no hot tub, as in all the advertised pictures. On the plus side, most of the non suited staff were very friendly. Not the best place
