Magnuson Hotel Florence
Rating: 5
Text: Had an awesome stay, easy to get to. The staff were very nice and helpful. Clean room, pillow top mattress, microwave,refrigerator, iron and board, no hair dryer? Close to many restaurants and entertainment. They had Direct TV so I was able to watch TV like I was at home. Plan to stay again next time I'm in town.

Text: Stayed at a rate of 250 from Sunday to Friday morning 2 weeks in a row.  Tried to stay again they tried to charge me almost 400. That's ok. Took my money else where.  Found many nicer places and cheaper rates! Bottom floor rooms stay wet by the windows when it rains. Probably full of mold.  Remodeling and trying to charge a 5 star price for a 1 star hotel.

Text: Not a place I'd vacation with my family, but wanting an inexpensive solo place to sleep, just fine. Desk chair dirty, very worn in the room where I stayed. Sheets, bathroom, towels clean. Strong smell of smoke in the hallways. Mexican restaurant and bar attached. Great desk service. Microwave and fridge in room. Low cost. I'd stay again, solo, when just needing a place to sleep.

Text: Best hotel in Florence for the price.  Secluded and peaceful even while they work to remodel it. Great staff. Did not have 1 issue.

Text: My stay there was quiet enough, but not necessarily clean.  I made a few finds.  First, a curly hair about halfway down on the sheets let me know that they may not have been cleaned.  Second, I found a child's toy under the edge of the bed just covered by the comforter.  Third, an entire roll of aluminum foil hidden under the edge of the other bed confirmed my suspicions that the rooms were not thoroughly clean.  Everything else was okay, just not that good on cleanliness.
