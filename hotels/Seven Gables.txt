Text: My first visit to St. Louis was amazing while staying here. The ambiance of the inn is something out of this world. They offer complimentary wine when I checked in and breakfast early in the morning. Being a woman, I love bathrooms and omg the one in our room was fantastic. There is a lovely courtyard where I could enjoy a cigarette after dinner and valet parking.

Text: Went here for a work event. Overall it was a really good time. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food was also really good, and a good variety for a buffet style event. I would recommend using them for professional events in the future.

Text: We checked in 4/29 5AM. It was an emergency check in. We were staying at a family home but one had to find another spot due to a bad allergic reaction from pets.

This was the only hotel with vacancies at the time. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by George, the front desk rep.

George was helpful, kind and respectful. He gave us a great room with great rates for our 5 night stay. George was understanding about our situation and made our stay a pleasant experience.

We come down to STL often and this is definitely the place we will be staying at.

Text: This is a wonderful place to stay. A classy hotel right in the business area with great places to eat.  This updated 1926 hotel is beautiful. The room was spacious with a wonderful bathroom. The staff was helpful and friendly. The breakfast that is included is waiting for you in the morning in a beautiful setting. The breakfast was not the make your waffle, it was the best sausages I ever had. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Melvin, a staff person was outstanding in his help with my cousin and I in anything we needed. There is one draw back. Our room was on the third floor and there was not an elevator. After the first hike up the to our room it did not feel so bad. There are landings that you can stop for a rest. It was a wonderful place to stay and we will go back.
