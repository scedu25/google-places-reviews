Text: That Pretty Place Bed and Breakfast was was adjacent to the Pumpkinvine Trail, but still offered a good amount of privacy. The area was sparsely wooded, with a garden and a small pond near the trail. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Overall, staying here helped make the weekend wonderful.
