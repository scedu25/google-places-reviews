SMWC Goodwin Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: This is a boutique guest house that feels like a home right on SMWC's campus. It's a great local hotel for all visitors of the College, Saint Mother Theodore Guerin Shrine, and White Violet Center. It's great for prospective students, grad students, parents and folks just looking for a quiet retreat - this is a great option.
