Text: Horrible! This trailer park owner doesn't allow dog fences outside, can't have any kind of pool outside, any items on your porch (will get stolen by management), can't have a clothes line outside, can't have a hammock on a tree (it will get cut down by management and stolen), can't have a fire pit, you literally can't do anything living in the mobile home park in Lincoln Il on 21st street and I'm sick of the owners harassing everyone. We have lived here over 10 years and have no freedom!! this trailer park is a joke and we are owners of our trailer!! Don't move here!
