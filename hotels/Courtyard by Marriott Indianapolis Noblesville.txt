Text: Great room with large shower. Indoor pool was warm and clean. Staff was attentive and very polite. Only negative was that there was no complementary breakfast.

Text: I am not familiar with the area but it is easily visible from the main road. The drive way entrance comes around the back of the hotel. The rest of the experience is typical Marriott. It has a small snack shop and a small bar that does serve food and doubles as a coffee shop in the morning. The room was clean. It was large enough for two people. The staff was courteous.
