Williams Hill Pass OHV Park

Text: Highly disappointed! Really thought this would be a great place to ride with my family but found that it was not. Very rocky and rough terrain. High inclines on "family trails" and sharp turns. Roots sticking out everywhere. The map that was provided was very deceiving. Was not as big as we were told. Not marked well.

Text: Neat and secluded campground, with clean bathrooms and hot water. Shaded areas, air conditioned main house. The owner was sweet, sold us some firewood for super cheap. Excellent at giving directions and communicating once I booked
