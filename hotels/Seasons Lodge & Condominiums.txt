Text: My family stayed in 2 2-bedroom 2 bath condos. Spacious bedrooms and living area. Fully stocked and had maid service each day. Pool was great and enjoyed our meals at Birdies. Husbands said golf course was in excellent condition and reasonably priced. We will go back.

Text: What a great place! Can't believe it's not packed. Beautiful pool and plenty of space for kids. Golf course was in great shape. Restraunt very good service for our group of 8. Short drive from Eville well worth it.

Text: My family reunion stayed there last week (4 Days). The rooms were perfect. Very clean. The maid (hispanic) was spot on getting us whatever we needed. Jaime at the front desk was more accomodating than most front desk clerks at 5 star hotels I've visited. She went out of her way to make sure my family was comfortable. She is one reason we will return.
