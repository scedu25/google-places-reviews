Winfield West Bed & Breakfast

Text: Lovely piece of small town history in this  charming restored home. Hosts were amazing as was the homemade breakfast! Our room was very comfortable, bed was great and bathroom remodeled in vintage style. Our only regret was not asking to take home another delicious and gluten-free blueberry scone! We thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay!
