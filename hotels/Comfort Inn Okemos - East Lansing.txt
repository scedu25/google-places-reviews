Text: We stayed here two nights during a recent trip. The staff was extremely friendly and rooms were very nice. Breakfast was very good and they had an attendant cleaning tables and replenishing food to make sure there was food and places to sit for all guests. Located near the interstate and a McDonalds makes the location very convenient. The reason for only 3-stars is for value. We paid $170/nigh which for the accommodations you get and lack of pool is not worth the money. If you can get a better deal and don't mind there not being a pool I would highly recommend staying here.

Text: It's location is pretty close to the highway but getting out onto Okemos Rd is almost impossible during commute hours. You definitely have to go out the back way and get onto jolly further down. The room itself was nice, although it did smell a bit funky after coming back in after it being closed up, I think the culprit was the ac not filtering the air around well. The breakfast in the morning was very good, definitely try their maple and cinnamon waffles!

Text: The room is comfortable, clean-smelling, and includes a fridge, microwave, desk, chair, flat screen TV, wardrobe, plenty of towels, and optional adjoining room, in addition to two double beds. For the price listed, it's not exactly a bargain, but the bargain we originally booked was old, shabby, and smoky smelling. The next place we looked at was struggling to keep up, but smelled musty from the a/c unit. This was our third and last attempt. We paid a premium here for booking at the very last minute, unfortunately. However, no itchy eyes, no post nasal drip, nothing allergenic for me to react to. My only complaint is the relatively quiet noise of the a/c and the torn screen that makes opening the window not an option. The lemon water provided all day and evening in the lobby is delightful and as breakfast buffets go, this was not bad. Chobani yogurt was available in addition to the usual junk yogurt, which I never eat.
