Text: The beds were very comfortable, the food was excellent! The only issues I would have were the showers and the a/c unit would not turn off when I wanted, but other than that, Ioved my stay.

Text: I don't care for the stains on the carpet, walls and furniture. The place just seems dark and not quite as clean as it should. The TV didn't work right either. There also was no channel guide in the room.

Text: Great service and friendly staff.  The hotel itself could be in better shape but the friendly service made up for its physical shortcomings.
