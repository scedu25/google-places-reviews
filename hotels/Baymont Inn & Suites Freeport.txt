Text: The staff is very nice. It's like the typical hotel. They have a vending machine for beverages but none for snacks. Not a major factor. The hot tub could be a few degrees hotter. It's not very hot. But all in all its a good place.

Text: We were put in a room next to the side door leading outside. Every time someone exited/entered the building the door would slam and our entire room shook. Because the front door is in a weird location, it seemed most people used this door so every few minutes this would happen. We called the front desk after trying to sleep through a couple hours of this. Then we mentioned it the next morning (having gotten very little sleep) and they said they've received many complaints about it. Why wouldn't you do anything then!?!?! Do not book that room if you know this is going to happen. It would cost $20 to fix it. Worst sleep I've ever had at a hotel and I sleep through everything. I would not recommend this hotel.
