Embassy Suites Columbus - Dublin
Rating: 4
Text: We are a family of 6. Stayed from Saturday to Monday. Checkin was quick and simple. The hotel is beautiful and inviting. The room was clean and we fit comfortably. Would've been better if two bedrooms were an option. There was a little noise from atrium but wasn't unbearable and we were able to sleep comfortably. The children loved the breakfast buffet and omelets. The happy hour was a nice touch as well. Also loved the late checkout time. Whenever we are in town again this will be our first choice.

Text: The price was great, and the room exceeded my expectations! The beds were extremely comfortable. I haven't slept that well in a very long time. The complimentary breakfast was amazing and the omelettes were delicious. Staff was courteous and went above and beyond to please guests, even finding an empty conference room for some guests in the lobby to move their extended party into so as not to wake other guests. Very pleased and will stay again soon.

Text: Everything about the suites were wonderful. The rooms were nice and big, with a thermostat to change the temp of the room. It was easy to get to and the breakfast was awesome. Has a omlet station. The only down side was there was no syrup for the French toast sticks. All in all great hotel!!

Text: It was great except the fire and evacuation. The room was great. Was told we would have milk provided in-room in our package by the front desk (they upsold us on this point as I have a toddler) and we got no milk. Had to keep going to get some.

Text: They have a full breakfast every morning and a grab bag for those of us that are on the run. The suites a large and comfortable with a giant screen TV in the living room and a large TV in the bedroom. They serve free drinks and snacks during happy hour. I hope to stay here again.
