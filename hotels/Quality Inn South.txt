Text: This place is awful. Cleaning people will ask what do you need done. When you tell them they get an attitude. This is a pet friendly hotel. Yet this woman is terrified of dogs. Plus she really doesn't clean good. To top it off I caught her antagonizing my dog! Most of the employees are friendly but very unhappy about working here. This is my third week of coming here. It will be my last.

Text: Staff is not very friendly nor biker friendly. Worst breakfast of all of the choice hotel's to date. Upon arrival, neither room key would work. Receptionist blamed it on us even though our room cards were just handed to us. Property is littered with beer cans outside from construction workers staying at the hotel drinking in the lot all evening.
