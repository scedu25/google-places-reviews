Text: The lobby smells faintly of smoke, but the rooms are clean and decent. There is an obvious effort to update.

Text: Didn't stay they had 1 room and once they saw I had a service dog said I couldn't have utt because the guy that normally rents it for 4 days a week had allergies.  I explained that they were breaking federal law and if I called the police right now they could be fined for breaking federal law.  He said he knew that but I still couldn't have the room.  I said fine if rather sleep in my car with my dog. He thrn called someone and started speaking whatever language Indians speak i finally got fed up and left.  I did not a disability that is obvious and felt like they did not believe me.  Its going to be a long few hours but at least I have my dog and I'm not being judged.
