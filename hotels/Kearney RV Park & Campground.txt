Kearney RV Park & Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Google routing takes you in an odd way, but we got there.  Good overnight or two park.  Should be much nicer when the trees grow up.  There's a nice pond or river backwater (couldn't tell which) with a beach to play, watch the boaters and duck.  Utilities are arranged oddly, but workable.  Overall, a nice place to stay.

Text: -Convenient location
-Friendly staff
-Concrete padded sites 
-Full hook-ups
-Pond to play in with beach
-Only two bathrooms, and the water pressure is borderline painful
-At least one of the bathrooms tend to allow water to sit, and make for a messy shower
-Address to the office coming from the East is a bit unclear through Google

Text: Late night arrival, easy to find (unless you use GMaps, then you get routed the long way 'round). Check-in materials were easy to understand. Found the campsite. Easy to set up (didn't hook up, but did unhitch from the truck).

Text: Very friendly owners and good monthly prices. They do have some sites that are only gravel and dont have any grass and that's the only downside
