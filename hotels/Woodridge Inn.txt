Text: Best choice in town. Would not even recommend the other 2 in town so not hard to be #1. Rooms are clean but wore shoes on carpet. Clean sheets and bathroom. Thanks hot tub room is a bargain for 100 bucks...has a couch. Did not like the Continental breakfast. Stacks is around the corner.

Text: This is a nice hotel. It was the same price as some better known competitors but WAY better accommodations.  The front desk staff were helpful and friendly.

Text: This is an ok hotel. Seemed pretty clean. Our room the shower was great but the sink developed a Washington DC sized swamp and hissed and spit water at you. Main thing is, if you have remotely sensitive skin bring your own towels. While I somewhat enjoyed a cats tongue rough towel to dry off the ladies in the group did not. @WoodridgeInn - invest in new towels please.
