Text: Solid overnight stop. Rooms in good shape. When I asked to switch to a non-smoking room, the desk clerk said my room was non-smoking already. I told her they should probably take the ash tray out so people aren't confused.

Text: The room was very clean and nice. The only complaint that I have is that the variety of items at breakfast left a lot to be desired. But everything they did have was fresh and fully stocked at all times. It was a good place to get a night's sleep that wasn't breaking the bank. If you're looking for something a little more fancy, look somewhere else.

Text: Repainted room and newer bath/shower, otherwise pretty dated. Was very clean and great wifi; biggest downer was NO electrical outlets  -. Easy to fix, just replace the two lamps with ones that had a couple in the bases.
