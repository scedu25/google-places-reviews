Candlewood Suites Olathe
Rating: 5
Text: Nice place to stay. Room is spacious with a small table and chair, mini kitchen (supplied with dishes, pots, pans and Tupperware), and comfortable recliner. They have a lending library where you can borrow appliances and other useful items. No pool or breakfast, but it's within walking distance of a small target and they do sell small snacks in the lobby. Overall great place to stay.

Text: I still here would just like to say that I have stayes at a lot of candlewood facilities. The staff here is polite. Unfortunately this hotel should be a lot cleaner. Possibly might think about getting outside cleaning source to help them with cleaning!!! Have seen worse hotel but did not stay! Help needed here to get them on track!!

Text: The location was a bit off the beaten path and there were bags of trash in the hallway but the room was decent. The bed was comfortable, the room was spacious and I always appreciate a coffee maker in the room.
