Fairfield Inn by Marriott Joliet South
Rating: 3
Text: Top top top notch staff.

But terrible room conditions.  Room reeked of smoke and the bed was way too soft for my taste on the first try.  Asked for another room and they accommodated (although had to go from King to dual queen) and the room was better but one could still tell it was old.

Due to the building's condition alone, I'd urge long stay travelers to avoid.  However if you're judging solely on staff, I'd give it 5 stars.

Text: Traveling with senior citizens on this trip. Check in was quick and easy. Drop off and entry to hotel easy. Rooms were spacious enough and clean. Breakfast was adequate. This was a travel business stop.

Text: Certainly acceptable, very clean, but an older worn out Fairfield.  Hospitality was nice, but not overly friendly.  A place where you had to ask, not going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.
