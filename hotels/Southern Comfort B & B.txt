Southern Comfort B & B
Rating: 5
Text: What a lovely stay our family just had at the Southern Comfort B&B in Bloomington. Carole and her three dachshunds (Heidi, Copper, and Penny) made us feel right at home. Each morning Carole puts out quite the breakfast spread for all of her guests. She is kind, sweet, and welcoming. Her B&B is clean and comfortable. We are already looking forward to returning for a visit and relaxing in her beautiful garden on the porch swing.

Text: Carole is a great host!  Nice clean rooms and a very hearty breakfast.  (if you have allergies to dogs, this is not the place)  I took off a star, because when we got home we realized all our clothes had a musty smell.

Text: Great alternative to a hotel room; cozy accommodation and wonderfully worldly company!

Text: This place is very special and relaxing, in a lovely setting. The owner takes every possible care to make sure you are comfortable, well fed, and happy. Clean and charming, a great get-away. We love going there after the long trip from Vermont and seeing Carole and the pups. Nona and Charles
