Text: Check in took a bit as there was only one person working the counter. 2 guests on a queen size bed only got 3 pillows. The TV was bigger than advertised on the website. Rooms could use a slight remodel. Tub/shower didn't drain very well, as well as the bathroom vent didn't work efficiently enough and bathroom was soaked after shower. Hotel offered standard breakfast fair, however I didn't get an opportunity to try it. It was decent as far as hotel and price though.

Text: Clean. Nice included breakfast. Good beds. Friendly staff. Only negative was smoke smell in hall, but non-smoking room was pleasant without any smells. Great for what it is, a good place for a rest during a trip.

Text: Fairly cheap room, you get what you pay for but if all you want is a decent bed and bare bones kinda hotel room then thats all you need here. If your looking for sonething a little bit better quality then a motel style room then i would suggest going somewhere else.
