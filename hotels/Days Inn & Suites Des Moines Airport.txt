Days Inn & Suites Des Moines Airport
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel and rooms are a little dated but everything was impeccably clean. Bed was comfortable and there were cable channels with HBO. Good water pressure and an abundant supply of hot water. Didn't try the fitness center or the heated indoor pool but it looked nice. Breakfast was simple but adequate. There was a waffle station as well as breads, cereals, juices, yogurt, etc. Overall, worth the price and can't beat the location as it's right across the street from the airport. I enjoyed my stay.

Text: Breakfast was good.  The undercover on the bed had not been changed and was dirty.  Heat would come on hot and then turn cold.  Pool was nice.

Text: If I could give this place a zero, I would.  First, the breakfast they offer consisted of a pot of sausage and gravy that was horrific.  Some fruit but mainly old sweet rolls.  Next, only one light worked in our room.  The worst was the pool.  It was filthy with scum on the sides and steps.  Rats wouldn't want to swim in it.  Never never again!!

Text: This is an old hotel, worthy of its 2 star classification. It was fine, and clean. It had a continental breakfast, although there was little there, and the drinks were out. I didn't do much exploring, I arrived late and got up early to catch a flight.

Text: All in all a nice place. Exterior looked a bit rundown. Desk staff were pleasant and efficient. Room had been remodelled but showed a few minor signs of age. I would stay here again.
