Text: Good clean room, a/c great when running, happy fun helpful staff, smallish pool: no stairs, just step ladders, well stocked Continental breakfast. Located right next to 7 eleven so it is easy to pick up something your missing from your bag.

Text: Arrived around 10pm on a week night and was surprised that the front entrance door is locked with a phone so you can call the front desk to be let in. Not sure how I feel about this...safe?

The room is clean, but it's old. The pool is tiny and breakfast is ok.

For me, it is a reasonable stay, but more like a $50 hotel rather than the advertised rate of $109. Only passing through, so don't have feel for comparisons...but there has to be better values in the area.
