Artist's Inn & Cottages
Rating: 5
Text: I planned a Girls Weekend in French Lick and three of us stayed in the Amelia Cottage at Artists Inn & Cottages. The cottage was great. It is exactly what was described on the web site. Everything was clean, the beds were comfy, and we had access to a kitchen with everything needed (plates, cups, puts, etc.). The place is very local, easy to get to, and near enough that one could walk to everything downtown, including the French Lick Resort & Casino. The only down side was that my phone did not have good service (my phone's fault, no fault of the location or cottage) so I was unable to text the owner as requested. This place is highly recommended.

Text: Do not waste your money. My friend from California bought my husband and I a $400 gift certificate for our wedding gift. She wanted us to be able to book the spa package. When I called to book, they told me that they no longer had a massage therapist and did not offer that package any longer. However, it was still being advertised on their website. So basically, my friend ended up spending $400 to buy us a one bedroom cottage with a peeling shower ceiling for two nights. We did not get breakfast or wine and chocolates.

Text: Beautiful portch to chill out on; individual room controls, big enough to comfortably fit six women who want their own space. Lovely!
