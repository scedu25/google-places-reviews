Ranchland Motel

Text: Was coming to town to look at a car. The gentleman from whom I may be buying told me to stay here. I got in late (11:45 PM), and the lady (Annette) that answered the phone and took care of me was wonderful! Sweet, helpful, friendly, funny, kind and helpful. That kind of customer service is as much a throwback as this type of motel! Don't expect the RITZ, because you won't get it out this way. But the place is one of those timeless little privately owned motels from an era where people went on vacation to see the great outdoors and the rooms were small but serviceable places to sleep! I stay at a lot of these places as I get to travel by car a lot and explore. And though you may not know from the outside, this was the cleanest I've been in. There was NO must old building smell, which is difficult to control in one of these old buildings no matter how many costs of KILZ and paint you use. The room was neat and clean, the bathroom a perfect time capsule of days gone by, and the beds were made well, the linens and toiletries presented well, etc. And don't get me wrong-there is nothing wrong with the outside! But this is a remote small old farm town in Western Nebraska, and the whole town just had that old, comfy, work, aged look. But, again, the inside was surprisingly nicer than if have guessed. For all of these reasons, as Annette hooked, I'll be tempted to come back if I'm ever remotely in the area again. Maybe spend a couple of days just seeing what else DOES happen in this little town. Thanks to the owner's and staff for such a great little place!

Text: Owner went above and beyond for a friend and I; without him we would have been stranded. Had a great sense of humor and a great room, too. Clean, spacious, and the shower water pressure was good, too. Extremely happy to have happened upon this little place.
