Text: My fiancé and I had plans for a little get away that did not work out, so on spur of the moment we came here instead and were very pleased. Our cabin was clean, cozy and convenient to where we wanted to be. Turns out, Plan B was better than Plan A! We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.

Text: My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights after hiking in the Daniel Boone National Forest. It was an excellent experience! The cabin we booked was clean, comfortable, had everything we needed, and was in a nice secluded area. We can't wait to come back, thank you!
