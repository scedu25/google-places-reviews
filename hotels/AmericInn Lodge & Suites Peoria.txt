Text: I love this place.  I stay here when I come to town for work training.  It's clean, quiet, the beds are super comfy with lots of pillows, and I feel safe and secure which is important since I am usually here by myself.  I highly recommend it. ?

Text: Overpriced for services offered and overall comfort of room. I would describe this as an old hotel, trying to look new. Felt we could have stayed at a choice hotel for less and have much newer ammenities and nicer room. Friendly staff... but we had family emergency and owner not Very flexible with checkout time. Would find cleaner and newer hotel for less next time.

Text: We are from Peoria however this hotel is out north.  We rarely go this far north of Peoria so when I chose this hotel close to home yet far enough away from home it was amazing.  The hotel gave us a sense we were actually in another town and felt like a real get away from work, kids etc.  But close enough to get back home if the kids needed us.  The hotel staff were amazing and very accommodating.  The hotel is clean and refreshing.  The bed was comfortable and the water pressure was great in the shower.  We stayed in a suite and had lots and lots of room.  The only downside was that the drinks from the vending machine were barely above room temperature, the small refrigerator did not work really at all, and the breakfast was nothing special.  But I knew the breakfast was nominal before booking.  For $115 this hotel was better than expected and we will return for a short get away :)
