Text: This is the first time I stayed in this hotel. Didn't have the best feeling going I to the hotel since it is so close to the main roads. Specially highway 35. Out look of the hotel is not that appealing either. Seems the hotel is recently renovated and interior look nice. Everyone at the hotel is nice and friendly including front desk and breakfast area. Room is clean except the one hair we found on the bed. Overall it was a nice stay but might not stay here again since I didn't like the location much. There are so many other hotels away from I35 towards convention center. It is just a personal preference than anything bad about the hotel.

Text: So only stayed for a night, but it's a nice enough hotel. 

Pros: Clean rooms. Fridge and microwave in room. Reasonable prices. Breakfast included. Pool, hot tub, and fitness center. Pets welcome (with fee). 

Cons: Front desk clerk was not really friendly and seemed very uninterested in being here. Rooms (especially bathrooms) are very dated. Pretty thin walls.

Text: Very happy with my stay. Room was clean and spacious. My window opened a bit to let in air, and I had a view of a pond. The TV was fantastic and actually had a guide! Very happy with my stay
