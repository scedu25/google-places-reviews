Text: Very clean and well maintained hotel. I enjoyed my stay- my one and only issue was that the bathroom door in my room (302) did not actually close all the way do to a hardware issue. All staff were polite and helpful!

Text: Only decaf coffee in room. I go to desk. Only decaf behind desk. Desk clerk takes me to maid closet. Only decaf in maid closet. No in room coffee drinking on this trip.
But there is an interesting art installation on the shower ceiling. I took a photo of it.

Text: Be sure to request a room AWAY FROM HIGHWAY, TRAFFIC NOISE OUTRAGEOUS.  Spoke to front desk evening of 11.7.17 and she said, oh well sir, "Im a sound sleeper and dont have that problem".  NOT so CLEAN, NOT so NICE.

Text: NOT RECOMMENDED! RUDE STAFF!  Neighbor's downstairs complained 3 times for noise, which is the magic number to get kicked out.  We have a 3 year old with us and yes he gets rambunctious at times.  A side from footsteps there was no real noise coming from our room.  Front desk won't refund my money so looks like I'm here for 2 whole nights.  Even though we were interrupted at 11:30PM and forced to move rooms, which got both of my kids wound up again.  Currently heating my pizza up with the hair dryer also because the room has no microwave? And it's 12:30am.  Will definitely not stay here again. Lesson learned.

Text: My family met here for a reunion and it proved a good place for the occasion. The pool is great for kids with a solid amount of seating in the lobby and breakfast area. Accommodations were good for the price. The staff had a few members that were particularly kind.
