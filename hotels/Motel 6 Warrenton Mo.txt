Motel 6 Warrenton Mo
Rating: 2
Text: I found the hotel room clean but it was creepy. It was completely dark when I arrived about 7. Then the next day, another guest told me he woke up at 10 and looked outside and all the lights were again turned off. Saving money by keeping the lights out is not at all welcoming. I stayed at Motel 6 throughout my entire two week trip and this one was easily the bottom of the list...and interestingly the most expensive one. When asked where the ice machine was, I was handed an ice tray from a freezer. The mirror was so damaged I could hardly see anything.

Text: Everything in the room was sticky, from the tv remote to all the counter tops. The bed linen was clean and great. The manager was friendly and helpful. The AC unit was loud. The toilet was loud and took forever to refill. The rooms were very large. The tub had what looked like stains or mold. I would never stay here again, but I do like most motel 6's.

Text: Worse hotel I've ever stayed at. The gentleman that worked the desk did not speak much English or understand it. I'm surprised we managed to book the room. We were desperate and it was late. No other vacancies. Very run down.
