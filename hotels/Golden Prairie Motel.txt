Golden Prairie Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Very spacious rooms with modern amenities like flat screen TV, mini fridge and microwave. Comfortable beds, great shower pressure with plenty of hot water. Definitely would stay here again and recommended it to anyone. Also great value for the room! Bathroom a little small and the towels could've used some fabric softener, but overall a very pleasant stay.

Text: Talk about a gem. I live on the road in hotels and this was such a pleasant experience to have. The rooms are clean, good wifi, flat screen TV,  and sleep number beds to which I had several great nights of sleep on. The couple running this place are very sweet and the price is actually reasonable compared to all other hotels in this day and age. I will defenitly stay here again when I am working in this area again.
