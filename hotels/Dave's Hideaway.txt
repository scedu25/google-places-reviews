Text: What an awesome place to stay!! You feel like your all family there, rooms are very clean, beds are so comfortable,  breakfast is wonderful with variety to choose from, the owner treats you like your family. We stayed in the cabin this time,  owner already had wood in the fire pit for us, with charcoal & lighter fluid waiting  for us to grill in our own private patio. We will always stay here every time we go to the lake!!!! 
Thankyou so much Tim (owner) for the great hospitality!!!!!

Text: This place feels like staying at a friend's house. The rooms are clean, extra supplies are laid out if you need them, breakfast is excellent, he provides grills, charcoal and lighter fluid if you want to grill out, pool and fire pit area area vey nice. If you're looking for fancy, this might not be for you. If you're looking for reasonable rates, clean, comfortable and very relaxing this is your place. We travel more weekends than we stay home and this is one of the most overall comfortable places we've ever stayed.

Text: When we underestimated the time between Texas and Missouri a few months ago we found out we needed a place for 2 nights. Not only did they help us out after regular operating hours, but they let us change rooms due to a special request. We were worried but it ended up being a very nice stay and couldn't have enjoyed it more.
