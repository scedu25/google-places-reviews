Text: I'd like to start by saying this was hands down the best experience. My wife and I had a great stay clean and comfy rooms yes but the best part was shawnna at the front desk she was so helpful and sweet to us if we are ever in the area again we would definitely hope to be greeted by her and will recommend the stay. 

Thanks again.

Text: Holiday inn Express is my new go to work hotel.  The beds are always awesome along with the selection of varied pillows.  The TV was new and the place was very clean.
The breakfast is where they really stand apart from the rest of the chain lodging. 
Highly recommend.

Text: Wonderfully accommodating, I was travelling with my 90 year old grandmother. The suite was ADA accessible and spacious enough to easily accommodate her walker. Location is easy to navigate off the freeway.

Text: Very friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean. Only issue was being so close to the highway, the cars and semi's were a little loud.
