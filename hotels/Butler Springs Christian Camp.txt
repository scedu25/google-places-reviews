Butler Springs Christian Camp
Rating: 5
Text: Our church youth group has been coming to Butler Springs for many years and we love it. We bring groups out for weekend retreats, staying in the approximately 60 person cabins, eating the meals prepared (that are actually really good), doing some of the activities like the high ropes course and the zip line, meeting in the large room and around camp fires, playing games in the gym and enjoying the surroundings. Cell phone service is spotty but that is fine, it makes it a great place to unplug and focus on real people.

Text: Good facility. Nice people. I think we learned a lot. Once the mold/mildew issue in the gym is addressed, I would rate it highly

Text: Went as a kid myself and send both my children every summer. Could not ask for a more open and loving environment. One of my children is very shy but he comes home with new "best friends" every year. Butler Springs really encourages kids to be their best selves without pushing an agenda. Saw a review on here about food portions - bring protein packed snacks, my kids didn't eat any of theirs they were always full, but everyone's metabolism is different.

Text: We started attending Pricetown Church last year and the preacher convinced me to send my (then) 9 year old son to the adventure 345 camp. My son is a cub scout so has been to camps but never alone without me. So we were both very nervous. He absolutely loved it. He was able to bunk with friends, had fantastic leaders and loved everything. They have a pool and tons of activities. He is a big boy and is a little picky with food but had no complaints there either. He didn't miss me (much) and said immediately at pickup he wanted to go back. I will send him every year we can. This is a great place.
