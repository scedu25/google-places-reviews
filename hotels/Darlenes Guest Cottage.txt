Text: Darlene is lovely! The historic home is filled with antiques and amazing architecture. Bedding is luxurious and the mattress is very very good quality. No skimping here! Enjoy your time exploring the gardens and sitting areas. Her hydrangeas and roses are extraordinary.  Now breakfast will be over the top with eggs in a secret recipe pancake and homemade pastry rolls, grapefruit and French press coffee....I could go on but you will be touched by her consideration and thoughtfulness. Ask to see the Madame Alexander doll collection or the pristine linens. I am grateful for the time spent with her and in the main house. Go. You shouldn't be disappointed!!!

Text: The "cottage" was ca 1960-70, homemade construction with many layers of paint.  Very amateurish.  It was awkward and uncomfortable for us.  Rust on faucets and drains, rust on old style towel racks. Lots of rust.  Much more like staying at Grandma's family farm than a "guest cottage". Decor???  It was a hodge-podge of furniture.  Floral patterns and ruffles EVERYWHERE.  Maybe they were left over when they redecorated the main house.  That's what if feels like.  BEWARE It has a programmable thermostat that drops the nighttime temperature in the winter down to 50 degrees.  We almost FROZE.  The outside walls don't appear to have insulation, because the wind blows through them.   Single pane windows had frost on the inside.  I expect that the summer will be the reverse with a small window a/c unit in the living room.  Instead of the beautiful flower gardens in the photos, we had farm tractors sitting on the grass at the front door of the cottage.  The prices were the same as a nice hotel.  It's not even close as a value.  Pick the hotel
