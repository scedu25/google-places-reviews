Text: This place is an awesome get away.  So convenient to the Katy trail and rock island spur for biking and hiking.  We came to Windsor for a family wedding and this cabin is such a peace flu place to come after all the festivities.  It's a home away from home.  Kim has everything provided. Coffee for the coffee maker, plates, glasses, bowls, cookware, creamer and sugar and everything.  Really e,cited and will stay here when we return again....

Text: I injured myself about 10 miles from Kim's Cabins on the Katy Trail, and actually met the mayor of Windsor. He offered to call Kim and ask if she could pick me up, and she not only did that, but offered me a ride to the Amtrak station in the morning because I couldn't ride my bicycle anymore.

One of the best experiences I've ever had in Missouri period. The cabin was really nice and she was a dream to do business with. I'd recommend Kim's Cabins to anyone.

Text: Great customer service. Clean, plenty of hot water, kitchenette stocked with pots and pans, comfortable beds, fire pit and convenient location next to both the KATY trail and the Rock Island trail. Perfect place to stay if you are riding the Rock Island trail and want a turn around location. Good local restaurants near by to walk to at then end of the days ride. Very affordable.
