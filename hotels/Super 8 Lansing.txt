Text: I like this place. Clean comfortable. The pricing is different depending on who you talk to. Watch how they charge you. The rooms are small but well kept.

Text: I booked. Then had to cancel. They charged my credit card. Then wanted to know the exact date I called to cancel. My photographic memory didn't remember the date.

Text: The worst service ever. We checked in at 7am. They had no breakfast as they advertised. They called and woke us up at 1am to leave their motel. After a speedy shower I went to the front desk and complained. They then said that we could stay. Already up and showered and packed up. No, I don't want to stay. I hate their service.

Text: I would give this place a zero if it was possible. I sent 2 of my young adult children to this hotel thinking that it was still a Super 8. This place was a dump! Staff is extremely unprofessional and no one would even let me talk to a manager. Terrible, terrible place! BED BUGS!! BED BUGS!! BED BUGS!! The worker on duty offered to change the sheets. This place needs to be shut down! Headed to the health department Monday. My kids did not end up staying and had to pay for this nasty room. I can't believe anyone with any kind of morals could work there.
