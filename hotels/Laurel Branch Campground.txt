Text: Our site 57 has a great view of the and we're close to a small playground. The attendant was super nice and rates per night aren't bad. The water pressure is better than most campgrounds we've visited. The beach is small and only one true "bath house" and it's at the front of the grounds. Near us is a bathroom, but no shower. ? We've enjoyed our stay but rather have a view of the lake and bathhouse near by.
