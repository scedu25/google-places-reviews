Text: Inspiring and romantic.   The lodge is a constant puzzle to the eye!  We loved paddle boarding on the lake and the strolling  walking trails.   The yoga room is perfection.   And Emmett's Restaurant!!

Text: Great people running it, fresh breakfast, interesting building  with nice rooms and many lounge  areas, quiet surroundings with owls and geese making the most noise. An unique experience a bit on the funky side. Check out the yoga weekends.
