Holmes Student Center Guest Room
Rating: 4
Text: I have been staying at the student center hotel for many many years.  It is a great place in the middle of campus and walking distance to many resturants, bars, and sports stadiums.  Beds are always great, staff is always helpful and great.   This past weekend, 09/09/17, I only had one issue with my room.  The outlets did not work very well.  The charger for my phone would not stay in any of them.   I am not sure if this in all the rooms are just the one I happened to be in this past weekend.   Overall, I recommended staying here to anyone that visits Dekalb or NIU

Text: Room look clean. The bed is very uncomfortable. We woke up with back pains. We asked for a King size and they gave us two twin beds place together and they covered it with blankets to make it look as it was a king size. Very disappointed.
