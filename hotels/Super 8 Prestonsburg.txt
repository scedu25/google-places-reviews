Text: The breakfast doesn't have much variety. The beds aren't very comfortable and I doubt they've been washed since the last guest, due to some stains, but maybe they just didn't come out in the wash. There is some broken tile in the bathroom, it is apparent that all the walls are in the middle of getting fixed. It does allow pets, which is nice. My nonsmoking room smelled of smoke. The ac unit needs a filter change, and probably has gor some tume. Overall, it was an okay stay and expected of the cheap price.

Text: The room wasn't real clean. Cobwebs in the corner of the shower. The shower curtain was barely on the shower from the holes in it. Hairs on the top of the toilet tank. Exhaust fan sounded like a airplane, it was so loud. The curtains wouldn't close completely. Not worth the $75 it cost.
