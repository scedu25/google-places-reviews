Text: It was an okay Hotel. We stayed for two nights. Came to the room on the second night, and they never even cleaned the room. Went to the front desk explain this to them, they handed me a bunch of towels. Never apologized. Would not stay there again.

Text: Counter people are rude!!  Visiting with daughter stay at this hotel. Want to charge us 10.00 per person visiting. Plus wife has to have service animal with her at all times. And charged 25.00 for the dog. We were just trying to visited with out daughter for a couple of hours. Rooms are nasty and out dated. To Begin with.

Text: I didn't appreciate being told one price, including a pet fee and when I received my receipt in the AM, the tax took it up another $12.00, which put the bill over $90.00.  When I checked my online banking, the amount was yet again higher....over $106.00.  When I called, I was told it was the pet fee, which had already been added in the price I was given the night before.  It was a shock, and beyond what social security allows us to live on.  That will have to be our last visit with you.  Whenever I see a Baymont Inn, I will think about the undisclosed charges that we received.  Don't tell your customers one price, and then start adding in other charges.  We can't afford you.

Text: The hotel is acceptable. All of the hallways smell a lot like smoke but once you get in the room the smell goes away. The room I was in was in good shape and was comfortable.

Text: Room was ok. Bathroom was a bit nasty. The shower was old and slow draining. The AC at least was adequate.
