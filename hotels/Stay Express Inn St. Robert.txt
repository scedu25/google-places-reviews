Text: So for fifty ? it's ok the room is clean bed was comfortable and the ? was hot only complant is noise owner needs to spend a little sound proofing the place. I've never stayed anywhere that people's conversations through the walls  made it a little hard to get to sleep

Text: Rooms were extremely dirty. There were dead bugs all over our bathroom floor, vomit stains on the floors and bed sheets, the sink was clogged up, the cable worked 50% of the time and the wifi never worked. The amount of dust in the room basically kills me because of my allergies. The restaurant is permanently closed even though the website and sign say otherwise. It's like a jail in the rooms. The second you step inside, the signal disappears so to make calls or use data (because the wifi doesn't even work and the owners/staff refuse and fail to fix it), so you have to step outside. 12/10 would never recommend or stay here again. This felt more isolated than the military base. Just no.

Text: Recently stayed at this little Motel. Ben and Christina are new employees in training as the new management . Fantastic service. They have and are taking care of the customers as well as the property. Will return. They have went above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need.
