Text: Very good customer service, house keeping is on point. Sheets change often, rooms cleaned everyday. Management very polite, respectful and understanding . Kid friendly, romantic rooms and close to a whole bunch of stores and restaurants. Beautiful place to stay.

Text: We booked the hotel early in the afternoon, when we finally got there at 4am they didn't have our reservation in the system. The room was clean but had a strange smell to it. But the worst part is the price. The room is supposed to be $60 But instead we were charged $100.  The rooms there are maybe only worth $50. Don't stay here unless you like wasting money.

Text: They didn't have my reservation when I arrived and I really wish they hadn't had a room available. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows smelled like mildew. The blankets were paper thin and it happened to get very cold on the second night. To add to it, the heater didn't seem to work, because the room stayed cold after turning it on full blast.
