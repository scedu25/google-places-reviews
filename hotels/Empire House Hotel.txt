Text: The Empire house is the type of place with old school charm, and a wholesome coziness that makes you feel welcome and comfortable.  The owner pours her heart and soul into her business and goes above and beyond in both friendliness and service. I would recommend that everyone experience this throwback to a much happier bygone era. We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
