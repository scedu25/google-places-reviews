Paul's Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Of the 2 hotels in this town, this one is certainly the best. Rooms are clean, shower is hot, pool is accessible late, and the pizza restaurant across the street (family owns) is great. Coffee and breakfast snack cakes are available there in the morning. Rates are reasonable and we are charged as quoted. We stayed here once before, and we will continue.

Text: The room I stayed in had plywood walls. It was a no smoking room so of course I went outside to smoke, it was around 11pm and the owner came down and told me to get inside and go to bed or he was calling the cops and that his nephew was a cop. The room did seem clean enough, but with that level of rudeness I can't give the place more than one star, plus they charged my debit card double the advertised price.
