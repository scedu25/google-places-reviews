Text: While cute and adorable unit 1 was filled with the smell of mold.   All Windows painted shut ecxeot for the bathroom.  My sister and I became very ill with respiratory problems.  Not a place to stay n the future

Text: Absolutely unique in lots of ways, all good.  The owner’s main concern was our comfort and could not have been more accommodating and kind. The room is clean, well arranged and comes with pampering, Hamilton, MO style!
