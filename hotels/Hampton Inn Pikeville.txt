Hampton Inn Pikeville

Text: One of the most pleasant hotel stays I've ever had. The staff was great. The amenities were great. It was clean and sanitary (and I'm VERY picky). You can tell that this hotel is either new or recently remodeled. When I stay in Pikeville, this will always be the only place I'll stay from now on. The only improvement I would suggest is better signage in the parking garage. I've never seen a parking garage like it, and I live   in Lexington and use parking garages on a regular basis. The top floor if the parking garage was very poorly lit. My son and I were actually a little scared to be up there.
