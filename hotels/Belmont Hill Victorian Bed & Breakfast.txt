Belmont Hill Victorian Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: I have been here several times, will come back whenever I can.  Have sent several friends and groups, and we all give rave reviews.  Quaint, charming, clean, beautiful room and grounds.  When you come up the drive from a lovely neighborhood and turn the corner it is sort of like finding paradise.  The  owners are very warm and welcoming. Thank You Belmont Hill for a memorable visit.

Text: What a lovely place to stay.  My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  From driving around the corner into a garden paradise, to being greeted at our vehicle, to being told there was a Willie Nelson Concert in town (and advice in getting tickets), to the quaint guest house with a lovely room, to a scrumptious breakfast with fun conversation with other guests and the owners we loved this Bed and Breakfast.  Wandering the gardens, listening to the birds singing in the trees, smelling the blossoms of trees and flowers were the crowning touch!  We highly recommend this B&B.

Text: A great place to relax and enjoy. We would highly recommend. Make some memories vs a hotel chain.

Text: I've been here several times, and only book here whenever I come. I absolutely love it. It's heads and shoulders above any hotel in the area, and the couple who owns it labor endlessly to ensure a relaxing and hospitable stay. 

Also, the folks who gave four stars and say it's wonderful and that they wish they would have stayed another night....why only four stars?  Not cool.
