Text: Great campground. Spacious sites. Big enough for my family of 7. If you can get a site with direct lake access I highly recommend it. The views are amazing and the fishing doesn't disappoint. My son grabbed a pole for his first time and caught 2 respectable size fish. Great place to relax and enjoy yourself.

Text: I love camping here! Family Showers, clean facilities and the hosts travel through the park several times each day. The host has lots of information to help travelers find the many recreational spots nearby. We obtained a free beach pass with our campsite. We will definitely come again. The sunsets over the water can be amazing!

Text: We like to camp in this area of Rend lake. It’s close to the interstate yet right on the lake. Showers and bathrooms are fairly new and comfortable.

Text: Awesome place to camp, so not Illinois like.  It's on a huge lake improved by the army corps of engineers...
