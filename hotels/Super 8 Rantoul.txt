Super 8 Rantoul

Text: I will never stay here again. Some of the staff were really rude. The hair dryer didn't  work, the bathroom plug didn't  work, the microwave didn't  work very well. When asked to talk to the manager, because talking to staff got us nowhere, we waited 4 days and never heard from the manager. And are still waiting! Like I said never again. Rantoul has a brand new motel, DON'T  waste your time or money with this one!

Text: Rooms were very clean and looked like they were newly renovated. Beds were nice for the night. Overall a good hotel to stay for a night or two.

Text: Really nice truck parking. Not huge but level and can accommodate 6-7 trucks. Hotel is within walking distance of many fast food and sit down dining. Breakfast could have been a little better. Not a great selection and no hot items. Overall, a good stay.

Text: This hotel was great! All rooms are updated (several of the photos on Google are old and no longer correct). Everything was spotless, the place was quiet, and the price was completely reasonable. The bed was new and comfortable, which is important to me. There is also a lot for truck parking.
