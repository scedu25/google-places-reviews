Text: Didn't have a too good of experience here we had called and reserved a room with the three beds  and got here and got a totally different room with only two and there was three of us staying in the room the lady was rude when we had said well we reserved that room alls she could say well it's been TAKEN!!! And then Since there was three of us staying in the rooms and the beds are very small I had to sleep on there hard chair because they didn't offer us anything til the very next day when we had complained the breakfast was excellent until I went to go have this roll then good thing I looked before I took a bite there was mold on it. Other then that they are a good place to stay at
