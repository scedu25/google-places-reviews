Iowa House-Ames
Rating: 4
Text: Iowa House is an old brick fraternity house, beautifully remodeled, with all ensuite bathrooms. It is within easy walking distance  to campus. Very nice hot cooked breakfast with interesting people to talk to. There are no elevators but most rooms on second floor. We would recommend Iowa House especially if you are wanting to visit  campus.

Text: Was welcomed the minute I arrived, briefed like the president,  then allowing questions or concerns.   Got to room 201 and relaxed.  Beautiful decor antiques and fused with modern bliss.  CLEAN.  Refrigerator/ freezer perfectly chilled ready for my beverages and steaks to grill outback.  Aircleaner in room.  Went to Bob Dylan.  Came back to a jetted hot tub and music.  Bath salts and fine soaps and shamp/cond.  New soft towels.  Serta bed.  Breakfast with Wallstreet and local paper.  Top of the line personal chef.  Includes everything.   Walking outdoors meet Chuckles the frat squirrel ready to play and looking Cadallac.  Listen closely and you may hear SEIZE THE DAY.
