Text: This place is very small,  my daughter and her friend had rashes the size of a soft ball on their legs, they called it sand fleas bites. I'm not sure what causing factor/s were, however I do know both pretty teen kids had no rashes before the boring day, and after leaving they both did. 
Further more I witnessed,  along with the party I was with a man frantically yelled help, trying to get the attention of the lifeguards,  as he popped up out of the water dreaming I can't breathe. I admit everyone thought he was joking which became apparent that this was no joking matter as he existed the water furious Because? he felt he should have had help. When asked why was he so tired, a man of his body size should have been able to handle himself. His reply was he was swimming out to his daughter who got hurt jumping from the big rock and he lost his breath. 
Plus it really small, but on the up note there is no sharp rock that cut your feet like Lake Ladonna.
