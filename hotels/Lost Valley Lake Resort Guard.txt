Text: Unfortunately the list activity's are not as good as they were 4-5yrs ago when I thought it would of been better, ? also need to be more wheelchair friendly. Bring back the bingo and craft activities for children among many of the popular activity's  they use to have. Over all its a good place to just get away and relax and enjoy time with your family.

Text: Place has not improved in 10 years. In 10 years they havent finished the project they started from when the club house burnt down.  Indoor pool smelled like sewage sometimes.  This Place has SO much potential to be an amazing place.  The staff are nice the grounds are clean the campsites for campers are nice and spacious. But the roads and place need major repairs and all the increases in anual dues do not reflect
