Hilton Garden Inn Detroit/Novi
Rating: 5
Text: Great hotel. Rooms were quite comfortable and clean. Recently stayed during the Novi water outage. Unfortunately the hotel had almost no water supply. But the staff were very kind and readily helped any way they could. Even helping guests finding alternate accommodations if desired. I would happily go back on a future trip just because of how good the staff was.

Text: Had a very nice stay at the Hilton Garden Inn this past week. The rooms as well as the hotel overall is very clean and well-kept. The hotel sits in front of a secluded wooded area which is a nice reprieve from the busyness that surrounds the front of the hotel. Staff was very friendly and attentive to my needs. There's a very small bar in the lobby and they also offer a very decent breakfast for $12.95 in the morning. I would definitely stay again if I was in the Novi area.

Text: Stayed for the weekend and it was great. Was close to the Suburban Collection Showplace were I was doing a show. Staff is excellent, everyone said hi and they even gave free water and chocolate milk to my kids. Rooms were nice, pool clean. Across the street is a really nice area for a family, played glow in the dark putt putt golf and the kids loved the trampoline and game center. Also a nice bar across the street for the big kids. I will always stay here when I am back in the area.

Text: My husband and I stayed here for an extended weekend to go to a Tigers Game. The staff was very helpful, pleasant, and accommodating the rooms were very beautiful, modern and comfortable. Only down side? No Continental breakfast and no Jacuzzi tub in the pool area. But I will stay here again if I ever find myself in this neck of the woods.
