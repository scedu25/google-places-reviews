River View Retreat and RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: The area nearby is filled with aging mobile homes and older lake cabins.  When we reached the park I was astounded as to how close to the river we were.  The spots are very tight.  They are clustered in between a house (available for rent) and other out buildings.  Hookups were excellent (cable was not used).  Wifi was iffy.  The grounds were well kept and beautiful.  There are a series of benches along the river along with steps that go down to the river.  The bank is very steep so caution is required.

The reason to come here is the river.  It's just amazing to sit and watch and ponder the history and the beautiful views.

As of 5-29-17 the google maps marker is not correct, the park is north of it right alongside the river.

Text: The river view is great. You can see the mud from the road. There was no water, no fish, and no where to park my r.v. I will keep coming.
