Hampton Inn Greenfield
Rating: 5
Text: We are staying at the Hampton inn to attend a convention in downtown Indianapolis. It's a small distance but the price was better and the drive is a straight highway drive. The rooms are clean and comfy and the staff is very friendly. Breakfast is standard fair for this style of hotel but it is fresh and well stocked. I would certainly recommend this hotel.

Text: I realize they are undergoing renovations. But they have failed to do simple maintenance in the meantime. We had a wobbly toilet that wouldn't flush without holding the handle for several seconds, broken bed frame, in-room coffee maker that added what looked like an oil slick to your coffee, and let's not forget the open kitchen door to the breakfast room with an attendant who shouted obscenities when something blew up in the microwave. As silver Hilton Honors members, we expected so much more. We have stayed in Hilton/Hampton properties all over the country and have never had such a poor experience. We will not be staying at this one again.

Text: We a good stay with beautiful views. Staff was very friendly and we got a good night's sleep. Only complaint was the bathroom had hairs on floor and in the sink. But beds were clean and comfortable.
