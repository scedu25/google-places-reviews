Cobbler Room & Cottage B&B & Massage at the Patty Kerr LLC
Rating: 4
Text: Nancy is a great host and fantastic cook!  The cottage has a rustic feel to it, and is meticulously clean.  Breakfast is delivered directly to your room, in case you don't like B&Bs where you must all come to breakfast I'm the same spot as other guests.  My husband didn't love the firm bed - but I slept fine, it's probably a matter of preference.  It's probably better to book in the winter, as a very large and loud air conditioner is directly over the bed - it kicks on multiple times per night.  The location is great and within walking distance to most local restaurants and wine bars.  I would recommend this B&B to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay.

Text: We come to Hermann every year with some of our friends.......we decided this year to not go with the flow and we stayed at the Cobbler Room.  The room was quaint and very neat and clean. The kitchenette was fantastic...loved the iris stained glass windows in the cute little bathroom.  Nancy was kind, helpful and very hospitable....breakfast was brought to our room, which I absolutely loved.......and it was delicious.  We will be back!

Text: Nancy is a really good person. The cobbler room is where we stayed and it was cozy and very private. I didn't feel like I was invading their space because the room is more of an attachment to their house rather than a room inside their house. It has its own a/c, fireplace, kitchen, and bathroom.  She also has really good breakfast as well. Definitely would recommend staying here.

Text: Nancy is a hospitable and friendly host.  She recommended several good restaurants during our stay.  The room was impeccably clean, the bed was comfortable, and breakfast each morning was great.  The B&B is located right in the middle of Hermann and within walking distance of downtown.  The Oven French Toast was our favorite.  Try the Riverfront Walking Tour.
