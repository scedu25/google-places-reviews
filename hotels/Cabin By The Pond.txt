Cabin By The Pond
Rating: 5
Text: This place was magical and way more than we imagined. Tom is a really great host! We were able to use the beach and the pond as ammeneties during the total eclipse. There was only a handful of wonderful people in our crowd i imagine we are among few to have such a lucky spot. Supernaturally intimate, in a way. I have a 10 year old son, only child and he had a wonderful time with Tom's dog Cody and thoroughly enjoyed his time! He even got a ride around the tube in the pond provided by Tom personally in his boat. He gave us absolutely everything to make this the best trip ever, unforgettable experience we can't wait to come back again and stay at a different spot... Hoping to even bring more of our loved ones to share this little gem with. Thank you Tom and all of your family and friends for having such a great spot to visit! Also. If you visit, ask Tom to clean your headlights for you. ?

Text: The outside of this cabin is beautiful!! The water is a clear blue and the fishing was great. We caught a lot of big bluegill and bass...nothing over a 1.5 lb though. The whole cabin, inside and out, and very spacious and private. The owner, Tom, was a very nice guy and brought us plenty of firewood for the whole week. I rate this cabin as 3 stars because of the cleanliness and the decor. The master bedroom with carpet had a lot of stains. The decor is very outdated. 3 of the pinball machines didn't work which was a bummer because we were super excited to play them all. Make sure you bring quarters because they cost a quarter each! Overall our family had a great time. We just hoped the cabin would have been cleaner and the decor would have been more updated.

Text: My husband and I went here for a get away day and it really was just what we needed. The cabins are deep in a wooded area, but only about 10 minutes away from downtown. Tom the owner was awesome! He gave us some great history of the area and his cabins and told us where the best vegetarian restaurant in town was. By the way eat at the Longbranch! The cabins are really cute and we'll kept. All of the luxuries of home in the middle of the woods. Thanks, Tom! We will be going back asap.

Text: We stayed there twice last summer and had a great time! We didn't have to worry about bringing cookware, as the kitchen was stocked with what we needed! The cabin was clean and had a full size washer and dryer that we were able to use. It is very close to Castle Park and Giant City State Park. Tom was very helpful. He even let my son borrow one of his movies! We are looking forward to going again this year!

Text: This place was most definitely Not a dump. We stayed in the smallest of the cabins and were very pleased with it. The cabin was very clean and private. There were tons of eclectic décor which we loved and the cabin itself had a very sturdy rustic feel. There was a skylight in the bedroom that allowed us to watch a thunderstorm through. There was a fireplace, many board games and movies provided, though we spent most of our time out doors.  The owner was very accommodating and even allowed us to bring our small dog.
