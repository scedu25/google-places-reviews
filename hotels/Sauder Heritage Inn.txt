Text: We loved our stay. I have to say the way the building is set up is kind of unique. The pool area is my favorite. It is very inviting but the hot tubs is secluded. Perfect!!!! I will be returning.

Text: The building was beautiful and the pool room was the coolest I've ever seen. It had a nice stone design with a waterfall that really helped set the atmosphere. Infact the entire place just felt cozy and relaxing. Not to mention free cookies and the best complimentary breakfast I've ever had.

Text: The Sauder Village in Barn restaurant are nice. The air conditioning in the room didn't work so well. The pool was so crowded because the people from the campgrounds came to the pool as well as the in.
