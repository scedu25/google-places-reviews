Text: The Frontier Lodge offers a quaint country atmosphere with a friendly staff. Budget friendly, and free breakfast too. There's also free wi-fi and cable as well. Though the breakfast by no means is deluxe, it does do the trick; and the coffee is on point. Now I don't konw if it was just our room, but there was a musky smell about it, so perhaps bring some air freshener if you don't find the scent appealing. Also, don't know if there was a miscommunication, but our beds weren't made back up the next day, so be sure to insist on made beds before you embark on your day. But all in all, it was a good experience, considering the price you are paying.
