Text: The room was smelly, toliet wasn't flushed when we got in after check in, pool was nasty, No vending machines, and we requested a room for 2 adults and 1 child. We got a full size bed and a sleeper sofa. Not happy

Text: The first floor hallway looks fairly beat up, but the room I had itself was nice. I'm just not used to seeing Hilton properties with that much wear.

It's a good place to stay. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Text: Mary who works in the evenings is absolutely fantastic! After a long day it is a pleasure to see her friendly demeanor. Mary is the reason my team and I decide to stay at this hotel versus the many others in the surrounding area. Thank you, Mary for making this such a wonderful stay.

Text: Close to restaurants and shopping the other airport locations are quite isolated so that is a serious perk for this location. Aside from that It is a nice extended stay. Clean and well appointed Only negatives I noticed we're the property is starting to show it's age if you look closely. Staff were great and parking was plentiful

Text: This trip went from horrible to great because of the service I received here. Do to miscommunication I did not have a room when I arrived late at night. They worked with me to get me a room so I wouldn't have to travel another 30 miles to a different hotel.
