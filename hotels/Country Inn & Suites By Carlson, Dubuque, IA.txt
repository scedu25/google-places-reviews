Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Dubuque, IA

Text: There was alot of dust, not good for someone with asthma, blood on the sheet, found a wadded up napkin under the bed skirt, and an ink pen and more dust  behind the night stand. One window whistled all night because of the wind.  I got zero sleep here.  To top it all off the woman working the front desk at check-in needed to take a course in Hospitality!!!  It's your job to make me feel welcome, not like checking me in is some heinous chore!!!!  If people don't stay there due to your rudeness then you don't get paid!  I stay at alot of Country Inn & Suites.  Never have I been so disgusted... Also, I wasn't recognized as a Club Carlson member...

Text: Really over priced. If I'm paying $200 a night, I expect alot more. Rooms need updating, especially the bathrooms. Staff was very friendly and the breakfast was pretty good. This hotel should be in the $120-$150 per night range.

Text: Building needed many updates. The hot tub was colder than the pool, and the beds were very hard. The breakfast was good, but the rooms need updates.

Text: The hotel room itself was good but the free WiFi had non existing data rates .01Mbps upload, 0.0Mbps upload.  This is unacceptable.
