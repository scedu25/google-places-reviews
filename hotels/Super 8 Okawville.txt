Text: I am the housekeeper here and I work very hard everyday. I clean the rooms as if I would be the one renting that room I want people to be proud to come to our family hotel. I take pride in my job. So i can't see how people can say somethings wrong with the rooms until the next day at check out time if something was wrong with the room why stay the whole night myself I would have said something right away. "I LOVE THIS PLACE EVERYONE HERE IS AMAZING AND I LOVE EVERYBODY HERE"... THANK YOU

Text: Superb. We stopped because we were tired. As we were  driving  from Nashville Tennessee,  back home to kcmo. Arrived just before 11. We were starving, too. B.K. was still open. when we checked in, and got settled in.. Much to our disappointment, burger king was closed when i walked over
 Had to settle for gas station hotdogs. Looking forward to super 8's a.m. breakfast

Text: Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were suitable. Breakfast was okay not great. Room did not get cleaned one day which was annoying. Overall a slightly above average stay.

Text: This is a good place to stay reasonable and close to a lounge and burger king. So you can get drunk walk over to burger king and the bed. And best of all no DUI
