Hammack-Moore House B & B
Rating: 5
Text: This place is beautiful! Comfortable bed. Sitting area in the room. It feels like a "home" away from home. The owner is friendly. There is a train but I didn't notice it because I live by a train track. Yes, just like "home", only with the perk of being nicely renovated. If it weren't in Kentucky,  I'd be ready to move in!

Text: It was quaint and quiet. Has nice interior comfortable beds. I think there was an overseer but we never saw anyone. We had the whole house to ourselves. It was nice and they were gracious to give discounts for the event we attended. There is a train that passes through sveral times in the night but it was not so close that one could not go right on sleeping. Overall it fit our need for a place to lay our heads and take a hot bath.
