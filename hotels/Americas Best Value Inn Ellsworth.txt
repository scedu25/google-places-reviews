Text: No issues at all. The room was nice and clean. Check in and check out were very easy. It's the only hotel in town so it's nice to know that they keep it up well.

Text: Stayed one night and had two rooms reserved, one of which was the suite. The rooms were great. Everything was extremely clean and the carpet is brand new. The owner and family were amazing. The indoor pool was great, good way to keep the kids entertained. Would definitely recommend to anyone.

Text: Decent bed, nice room, good air conditioning. Considering the surrounding area it would be a 5 star except the place didn't enforce quite hours and there was a group hanging out in the court yard out side our door until 12am. I drowned then out with the air conditioner but so it wasn't too bad, but still a place like this should have quite hours.
