Greenmill Campground

Text: Really nice and off the beaten path! I loved it, except for the guy (Mike I think) yelling at me for speeding when I was letting my car accelerate on it's own power. Other than that fantastic! Has canoe rentals and the water isn't super rough. Be warned cell service is spotty since it's out there a bit. Out of all carriers AT&T had the best service being able to actually make calls and use data.

Text: The most private and wonderful place in Missouri for canoeing,  fishing, swimming. ..etc.. Less expensive camp fees, a more than generous host and all in a quiet, clean and beautiful setting. I wish we'd come sooner.
