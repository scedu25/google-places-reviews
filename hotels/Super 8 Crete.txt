Text: Don't waste your money...  it's probably fine for an overnight just to sleep,  but if you plan to stay a few days it sucks.  They cut every corner they can to make a nickel or two.  It is clean and ok but not worth price.

Text: When we arrived, i wanted to pay cash and were informed thst there was a 200.00 deposit and the room charge.  We were not informed when we booked the room.  I needed a ground floor room as i have trouble going up stairs.  Not only did we not have a ground floor room, we got a room on the 2nd floor, down in the middle of the hall.  I would probably not stsy here again.  The room was nice and hotel was quiet, so our stay other than the room assignment was okay.

Text: I stayed here Mon. 5/15/17 thru Sat am 5/20/17 on business and these people made me feel very welcome and safe, being away from home & husband.  They are constantly working to make this a good experience for their customers.  There are trains that go by the hotel, but they are all over the state.  As in everywhere.  I would definitely recommend this hotel as a place to stay if you need to be in the area.  Best hotel, very clean & awesome workers.

Text: If there was negative stars this would fit this "motel". Sam, the owner is inhumane. He was abusive, judgemental towards females, ransacked thru personal luggage and kept personal ID's as hostage! Payment was coming but late as a donation. Refused to return personal ID. He is getting paid for the room by donation. hot headed owner Sam gets violent towards customer. Dont stay at Crete Inn- same owner if u want to be violated! 

Owner also stated: "he videos customers in the room you pay for"- illegal! 

So donations did go thru to pay for two nites. Sooooooooo, He is double dipping for two nites stay. 

No trust.
