Text: The staff makes this Hampton Inn warm and friendly at every turn. The hotel is immaculate, the breakfast service good, and bedrooms comfortable. Housekeeping is terrific at this hotel - efficient, friendly, and masterful. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get into downtown Charleston by car and also the nearby state forest.
