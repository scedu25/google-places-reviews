Text: Great camping spot as long as you don't mind walking to get to the bathroom, store, etc.  No showers and only tent sites with a fire pit.  Bring your own grill.  They have canoe, kayak, and johnboat rentals; be sure to get on the list early if you want one.
I can't say this happens all the time, but we just happened to be there while some very noisy neighbors sat up all night and drank their way to really loud talking.  The more you drink, the louder you get, I guess...
Fishing was okay, but not a lot of shoreline spots due to overhanging trees and weeds/logs in the water, but that's where the fish are.
If you plan on camping here, just bring anything you may need if you were to camp in the woods.  The store is mainly a bait shop with a few food items, but the owners plan on upgrading everything soon, so that may not be the case in the near future.

Text: Friendly staff and the price for a kayak rental is beyond reasonable. I would highly recommend spending time here whether it be camping, kayaking, fishing, etc...
