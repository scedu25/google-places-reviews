Text: All I was looking for was a room to lay my head after going to a concert. This place was perfect. Even had breakfast ready in the morning. I do recommend going before 8am to breakfast, otherwise you'll be running into a crowd of late risers.

Room was clean, service was exceptional. I have no complaints. Thank you.

Text: Lobby was clean. Staff is nice. Breakfast is the usual hotel breakfast. Waffles and biscuits and gravy and then cold food. Pool was nice. Hot tub was good. However, they have a sign out front sign out front saying they're newly renovated rooms. Theh certainly haven't renovated the rooms in the middle of the first or second floor. Torn carpet, musty air from air conditioner, torn shower curtains. For $120+ per night and the renovation sign out front, I was expecting new carpet and new paint and new ac at a minimum.

Text: It was nice not to fancy but overall would stay again. Room had jetted tub and worked more like a Jacuzzi when you unscrewed the air valve. Bed was kinda shoved in an awkward cubby hole in the room so one night stand wouldn't open but nobody uses them anyway on a one night stay.

Text: Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Tv was left to the bed so was uncomfortable to watch. The heater was a bit loud and situated between the bed and tv. Smelt like there had been in the room.

Text: Its right off I-29 so is easily accessible from the highway and the rooms were basic but clean. There was a basic continental breakfast and the staff was friendly. Wal-Mart is a five minute walk from the motel.
