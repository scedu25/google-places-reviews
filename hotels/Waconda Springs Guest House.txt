Waconda Springs Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: My family and I had a wonderful stay! Pam was beyond accommodating by checking on us daily to ensure all out needs were being met! Our dog was welcome to stay as well! The house was stocked with everything and misc. items/snacks could be purchased by running across the street to Dollar General. The entire town was friendly and welcoming. Pam exceeded our expectations by mailing our forgotten items to us after our departure. Talk about going above and beyond. We will definitely be returning and I would highly recommend this guest house to anyone!
