Text: The place is a pretty cool, but the owners of the property are not very kind to newcomers unless you buy a lot. Fishing is not allowed unless you live/own a plot there, but if you call the bait shop. They will tell you that fishing is allowed but it is not. wouldn't recommend.

Text: Pretty ghetto place. Water is technically not potable. Washroom/shower is sketch as hell. Come for a genuine experience what it's to be a redneck. Tenting is cheap for a bicycle tourist though, so why not?
