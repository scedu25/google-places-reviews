Text: Positives- clean room, friendly and efficient front desk and house keeping, dog friendly. Negatives- old rooms need better beds and upgrades. Dog friendly (I didn't have a dog) also means dogs constantly barking day and night, rooms say non smoking, but it smells like smoke in the room and I saw people smoking. Rooms aren't really sound proof. Bottom line, pay for a better motel. Especially if you want a fresh room with a good bed and piece in quiet.

Text: This hotel was pretty nice. We had two rooms, one was smokey the other wasn't. Beds were comfortable and rooms were clean. The breakfast was good, lots of options. Only complaint would be that walls seem to be thin could hear the people next to us talking and laughing, people walking above us. All in all a pretty good stay.

Text: I was only there for a few hours, but it seemed nice inside. Staff was friendly and helpful to help my parents change their room after a night.
