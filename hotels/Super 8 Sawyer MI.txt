Super 8 Sawyer MI

Text: This is a 40-70 night hotel. Don't pay any more. We made the mistake of paying twice it's worth.  Our first room had no window screen and smelled like cigarette smoke. Second room: the air conditioner didn't work properly and left the room humid. Couldn't open the window because of loud noises of cars and trains. The rooms have a contemporary bed cover, that's it. Everything else is from the early 90's.

Text: I give this a 4 not because it's so great, but because it was better than I expected it to be. Which is great when going to a budget hotel. Room was clean with newer items. Had microwave, fridge and coffee maker as well. Pool was also clean and nice. Free breakfast had waffle maker, hard boiled eggs, cereal, toast, yogurt, bananas, coffee, juice, coco....all good. We would stay again for the price and location. Only complaints....hair dryer was broken and we wished pool stayed open longer.

Text: Very peaceful outside. By the interstate, but clean and peaceful. Located by a gas station and store which made it convenient if we needed to get anything as well as located by some really good local food. They have both refrigerator and microwave in the rooms which was a big plus. The next morning we went and got the complimentary breakfast, nothing big and fancy but some of the basics; toast, waffle, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juice, hard boiled eggs. During breakfast I believe the owner or the manager came to greet us and asked how our stay was and was very friendly. All the staff was very friendly. One of my favorite things was this Super 8 had Veteran Parking. That to me means so much, and they will def get my business again!
