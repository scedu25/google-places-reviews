Text: We love living here , we have been here for over 8 years . there is no steps that we can not longer do. The  staff is great if we have some thing go wrong Vicky has it fixed very quickly, thank you for that.  If Joe has to come in to fix some thing our dog Izzy loves all over him.
Thank you again for building Faith Community .
