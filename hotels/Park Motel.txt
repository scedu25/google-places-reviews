Text: Stayed for one night. Inspected immediately for bedbugs as I do this at all of my hotels upon entering room & they seem to be up to par with my standards as they have mattresses sealed in protective covering.  I did notice ALOT of hair in the bed, I’m not sure if they allow pets but , having worked in the housekeeping industry I would say the sheets were definitely not changed between guests.  The shower was disgusting, it literally looked like someone bathed an unruly German Shepard with the mud stains all the way up the shower wall to the ceiling. Found three huge spiders and several fly’s of all ages. Lots of dust & trash matter by base of beds and along walls of baseboards. I wouldn’t not recommend this place for 89.99 a night .

Text: You get what you pay for. The receptionist didn't know what he was doing, booked an already vacant room so had to switch that out. Finally got our room, opened the door to find antique city. About the only thing "modern" was the tv which appeared to be from last century as well. Bathrooms are very small so if you are plus sized you will have problems moving around. Don't plug the toilet as there was no plunger. Your better off spending more money on something different, not impressed at all. I won't be going back
