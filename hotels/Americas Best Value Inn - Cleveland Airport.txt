Text: This hotel doesn't deserve any stars whatsoever! I had to kill a cockroach in room 307. They moved me to room 317 and I found a huge bedbug just chilling on the wall. They are bug infested. They wouldn't give me my money back and their terrible staff was even worse. Tracy the manager did absoultuey nothing to help me and just gave me attitude and Liz who is the lady at the front desk was very rude also and just laughed. Their breakfast is disgusting and is surrounded by flies every morning. Bagels and watered down orange juice is NOT a continental breakfast. It smells so bad in the rooms and I've been in 2 of them. Don't waste your time nor money at America's Best Value Inn on Brookpark!

Text: Needs a good cleaning and updates badly. Just a place to sleep the night before take off. Can leave car which is nice and shuttle service was prompt picking up. All in all not bad.

Text: Hotels very old it needs a little bit of renovating and also airspray in the elevator who smells like marijuana. There's definitely some serious maintenance issues as far as wallpaper tile bathroom facilities cleanliness overall as rough. The hallway on the inside of the building looks like something from The Shining. If you need an inexpensive place to stay 1 or 2 nights and you don't really care then this is the hotel for you if you're looking for something a little bit nicer spend the extra fifty bucks a night somewhere else.

Text: Run Away. You can do better even on a modest budget. If you have to stay here, CHECK THE ROOM THOROUGHLY FOR BED BUGS. There's nothing American and nothing to be considered a best value. This whole chain of resurected dumps should be bulldozed and the earth under them salted so nothing ever grows there again.
