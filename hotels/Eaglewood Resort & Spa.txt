Text: Overall definitely liked it. The food at the restaurant was outstanding! The service was friendly and very helpful. The atmosphere was also very very good. They said the hotel was modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright designs and it shows period in the rooms however the beds were very hard and my room and another family that we were with had ant problems. The convention center there is also really a great place to go. Wish I would have had an opportunity to golf!

Text: Had the pleasure of staying here for a wedding. Beautiful scenery, big and modern rooms, and great food. We also took advantage of the spa (couples massage), pool, and hot tub. Finally, the staff in charge of the wedding was extremely courteous and professional. There were 5 other weddings going on the same night as the wedding we went to, but everything seemed to run smoothly from what we could tell.

Text: My wife and I just held our wedding reception there and everything was beautiful! The food was amazing, the hall was big enough to hold all of our guests and since the hotel was connected, everyone was able to stay with us and celebrate our marriage. The staff was wonderful, understanding and easy to work with. Thank you for making our day so memorable.

Text: Nice hotel. Main restaurant could of been a little more upscale. Sports bar was good and large. Big outdoor fire pit and bands all summer. Pool area average and had mini bowling area and free billiards in another bar area.
