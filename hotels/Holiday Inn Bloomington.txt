Text: Before my negative comments I'll give you my positive ones. Front desk and housekeeping were great. The hotel overall is clean and neat. 
Went to on site restaurant and requested the salmon grilled with nothing added. Was simply told no. Then she added that "the fish would stick to the grill". May be right however I have made this request at many places with no issue. Also, she didn't even take the time to ask! Then she told me I could not have my glass of wine in the restaurant because they sell alcohol. I carried it down and was standing to order "to go". I returned to my room with nothing. Later I called down to ask if I could buy a few boxes of dry cereal (Cheerios) because I was still hungry and I'm on a very specific diet. I again was told "no, that's breakfast. All I can charge you for is dinner" (of which they can't accommodate my diet). I really think they just didn't want to put forth any effort.
