Text: Peace and quiet place for relaxation. Nice and accommodating staff. It's our second day and hope to have good memories in this place so we can come back again next year.

Text: I don't camp here. Although it would definitely be an awesome place to do so. Mostly we just visit the old Bridge and view the scenery/have a picnic. I would give the area 5 stars if there was more to do. I don't understand why Nicholasville or Garrard county hasn't done more to promote this area. It has tremendous potential.

Text: Positive: Beautiful location! Staff kept office open for late check in. Negative: Too pricey for tent camping. Tried to make reservation via Facebook for tent site was given a RV site. I think that's why the price was $40/night.
