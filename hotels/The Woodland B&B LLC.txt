Text: Tom & Janey have created the perfect solitude of rest & relaxation ! incredible food, extrordinary service, exceptional people. One stay here and you will be hooked to come back again and again like us. Why stay somewhere else, when you can be with friends and treated like family.  When it comes to  B&B 's the Woodland is truly in a class all by itself !
