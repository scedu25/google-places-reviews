Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Paducah
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed at Fairfield Inn, Paducah after evacuating Hurricane Irma in Florida. After a (very, very) long drive, I had the perfect and most relaxing stay, which was much needed. Catherine checked me in and was incredibly helpful and friendly. The room was immaculate and accommodating, and it was such a quiet hotel so it was easy to relax! I would absolutely stay there again. I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a hotel. 5+++++ stars.

Text: Good location. Room as expected. Front desk staff was friendly. Did mobile check in and key was ready when I arrived, since that was at 2:00 a.m. it was nice to just get the key and get to my room. Breakfasts was decent. Would stay there again if in the area.

Text: The location was very convenient for me due to the close proximity of my office and it is also great for close by restaurants and shopping. The room was great with plenty of pillows for the bed and some seating, plus fridge, etc.
