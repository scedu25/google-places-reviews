Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Stockton, IL
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed last night at the Country Inn & Suites in Stockton, IL. and all I can say is "Wow!" Another great word to describe this place is "Charming." Located in a very peaceful area. There are not a lot of eating options, but there is a Subway across the parking lot. There is also a reasonably priced grocery store if you want to purchase grocers and take them back to the hotel. The rooms do provided a refrigerator and microwave.

Before you even enter the hotel, the first thing you notice is the very folksy front porch complete with a table and several chairs. Once we entered, we were immediately welcomed and helped by the very friendly woman behind the counter. The interior of the lobby is as folksy as the front porch. On the first floor, you also have an indoor pool, workout room and the dining area where they offer their complimentary breakfast.

The rooms are not fancy, but very welcoming. The place is clean and the beds are very comfortable. The room offers plenty of drawer and closet space. And, because of the very quiet area, I can almost guarantee a very peaceful sleep. One of the best perks of the room is the really spacious bathroom and shower. The Country Inn & Suites in Stockton, IL. is a great place to stay.

Text: Flying in from Los Angeles, I wasn't sure what to expect from Country Inn. In a word, amazing. The front desk staff went above and beyond. They were able to accommodate an additional night for me and made it so easy. They Inn itself is immaculately clean and backs up to a corn field which being a city slicker, I found amusing/enjoyable. Open windows, crickets chirping, best sleep ever. 5 stars and I'd stay again!

Text: The room was great. We had a suite (can't remember if it was because that is what I booked or if we indeed were upgraded) and it was clean and comfortable, with what looked to be mostly new furniture. The only thing was the shower setup, where it was impossible not to flood the floor with water due to the curtain's sole purpose of maintaining modesty, foregoing it's responsibility for holding in the water. Still, everything was nice; we had a quiet stay and slept wonderfully. Would recommend.
