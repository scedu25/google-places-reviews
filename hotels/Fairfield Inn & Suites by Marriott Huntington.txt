Text: Was there for a professional training. The room was very nice and neat, and staff was very professional. Breakfast was also good. Bathroom needed clean the first day of the training, but was very nice second day. Overall good experience.

Text: Loved this hotel. Sits on top of a mountain and overlooks the valleys down to the City and river. Rooms, lobby, beautiful patio with fire pit, fitness center, and pool all have this view. Delightful staff, lovely breakfast, beer and wine  for sale. All exceptionally clean. Planning to go back. Highly recommend to travelers and locals.

Text: Friendly and helpful staff. The interior is nice and clean. We stayed 2 nights. First night we had to ask for a different room because we would hear snoring in the room next to us. Yes, paper thin! But the staff was kind enough to get us a new room and make sure we were comfortable. Second night in the new room, this time someone has their TV on so loud, it was louder than our TV. You can probably hear someone sneeze a few doors down. 

Their breakfast is ok. I'd rather make a McDonald's run, but if you're strapped for cash, it's edible. I'd stick to the cold stuff, yogurt, cereal, etc. Their hot breakfast leaves much to be desired. 

The rooms are kinda small. You don't get a full closet and they have showers instead of tubs. The bathroom could use more thorough cleaning. You can see the pink bacteria in various places and hair..bleh. The bed isn't the most comfortable, but I prefer firm anyway. My biggest issue is the thin walls and hearing everything. Other than that, this place seems to be in better condition and have better customer service than the surrounding hotels. I'd stay here again if I'm back in the area.

Text: What she amazing experience. Over the to breakfast, Kelly takes good care of you! Fresh food with a wide selection.   I did not care for the genre of music playing (too loud). I did all the to turn it down and they did. Very clean!

Text: This was a hotel I wouldn't mind staying at again. On our cross country drive we stayed here over night. They have a great indoor pool (towels to use so you don't have to bring your own or use the ones from your room) small but great gym (weights, treadmills, elliptical machine, etc) nice complimentary breakfast, and helpful staff! If you need larger parking spaces with easy access for trailers and semitrucks, then this is a great place. It's one of the reasons we choose this location over the other hotels in the area. Everything was really clean and our room had a beautiful view of the mountainous area your surrounded by! They also have a military rate to help benefit our soldiers and their families. It only draw back was it was a bit more expensive then we expected but well worth the money.
