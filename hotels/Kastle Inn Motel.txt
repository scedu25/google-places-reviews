Kastle Inn Motel
Rating: 1
Text: I stayed here for months the rooms are ok but the owner and manager you can't even deal with they rob you every chance they get and it's a very high Crime rate there and please if you do end up going don't take yours kids it's the worst environment they could possibly be in you can read the good reviews but I stayed here months straight I Know how it really is there and you must pay in cash so the man at the front desk can take your money and if you are trying to get a room during the night you are better off to go to the next exit and get a room at the days inn

Text: Even though they are undergoing a major renovation and remodel and the outside of the motel wasn't the most inviting I was desperate I did have to stop to sleep and to my surprise the inside of the room was great it was clean the internet was fast people were friendly and it was quiet

Text: Just a cozy clean place. But you can tell there are lots of drug problems and transactions in and out of here from people staying not the owner's

Text: It's an older place priced great and clean. I liked the vintage aspect of it. It's quiet and has the simplicity of travel. It was cleaner than some 5 star hotels I've stayed in.
