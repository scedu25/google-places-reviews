Text: The Heidelberg is the perfect place to spend the night or the week or in some cases even the month, friendly staff,close to all necessitys, and safe for tourist who wander, keep the noise down and do as you wish, Frequented by Blue in the little black truck to assist travelers in trouble or in need of a favor, beware cops are prompt and always helpful, Justice will be served, so cautious......

Text: I was raised here. My parents were the managers. But now it's not a motel anymore. It's just a bunch of one room apartments. Lots of drug busts. The Trailways bus stops there.
