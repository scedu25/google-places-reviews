Text: The motel itself is extremely dated. Kind of dirty and kind of dingy inside and out. Pretty cheap stay though. I will say the only reason it got a 3-star rating instead of a one or two star, is the excellent Cafe right next door with delicious home cooking and over the top friendly service. Place should be a gold mine due to their employees and quality of food. I sure hope they make it because places like that are fast disappearing.

Text: Great price, staff was friendly, rooms were clean! For a quick overnight stay I couldn't ask for more. Perfect for our needs.

Text: The staff is nice and the rooms are clean. The pool....well, it definitely shows it's age and the water was cloudy with a strange smell.  For the price, it is okay. Not quite up to the standards of past reviews.

Text: It's a good place to pull off the road and rest your head when you are a weary driver. The rooms are small But the rooms are clean. It's just across the street from a gas station and a McDonald's.
