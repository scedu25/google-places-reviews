Text: The Best Western Plus is in need of a make over. My suite was dark and very, very  dusty. I always wipe down everything as well as bright green my own sheets and blankets. Never again!

Text: As always very nice for the price. Breakfast was the same both days so limited on hot foods. Pancake machine not working. They were painting out side so a bit of a mess. One side exit door glass broken so could only exit our end of building but could not enter. Room was large and clean. Over all will return again.
