Shady Grove RV Park

Text: We have had a trailer there since 2006.  Dave and Judy are the best.  The campground is always well kept.  Everyone is so friendly.  If something needs to be fixed  it will get down.  The rent is reasonable and the sites are great.

Text: A quiet woodsy get-away. Sites are spacious and neatly mowed during the summer months. The owners are especially nice and accommodating. Could not ask for a better "home away from home"!

Text: We have had our camper in this park for 8 years. We love it!  The owners Dave and Judy are the nicest people you will ever meet and the spaces are not on top of each other you actually have some privacy. The public restrooms are the cleanest you will ever find. They smell nice and even have fresh flowers in them. If you are looking for a spot daily, weekly, monthly or yearly this is the place. Close to the water for fishing and swimming maybe 5 minutes down the street. Give it a try, I know you'll love it.
