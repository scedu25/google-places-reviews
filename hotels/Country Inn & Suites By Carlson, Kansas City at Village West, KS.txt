Text: We got a suite with a whirlpool tub and a king size bed. The room was clean, comfortable, large, and welcoming. We loved it. The only complaint I'd have is that the jets in the tub didn't really line up with where your back should be.. but of course that's a minor complaint. We will definitely stay here the next time we are in town! It's conveniently located near a lot of restaurants and shopping and close enough to the downtown area of the city to enjoy it but far enough away to be out of the hustle.

Text: "Complimentary hot breakfast"  means a toaster and a bag of English muffins at a lot of hotels.  Not this one.  The ladies who run the breakfast buffet put on a fine spread.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Hotel room was clean and the staff were genuinely friendly.  When seeking accommodations in this area again, I'd choose this hotel over other options.

Text: Could not have asked for a better hotel, staff and location! Came here for the race and the hotel was very accommodating to the race fans staying there. Hotel is located near a great shopping and dining area. If I come back to the race I will definitely stay there.

Text: Hotel was clean, bed was very firm, breakfast was good with good variety but was not completely ready by 7am on weekend, and we were in a tight schedule. This is not the first time this has happened to us at this hotel either. Overall hotel is great but breakfast seems to disappoint.
