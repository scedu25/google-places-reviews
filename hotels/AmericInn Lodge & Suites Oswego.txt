Text: Very good stay so far! Rooms are clean and comfortable, and have a mini fridge and microwave. The lobby is adorable and unique. Looks like a logged cabin with wooden furniture and stuffed bears. Hotel has an indoor pool and hot tub. Breakfast is delicious with hot food like sausage and eggs, but also oatmeal, toast, waffles, etc. Haven't had any issues with wifi or television reception. Only downside is the price is a little high, but it seems like a well-run place, so it's worth it.

Text: I was visiting guest in the sitting area of the hotel foyer. It was a great experience except the game area is literally right on top of you in the sitting area. The teens were so obnoxiously loud that you could not talk to the guest in sitting area. The games are less than three feet from the couch in the sitting area. I wish it was in the other side if the room. We ended up leaving the hotel to continue our conversation with the guest at the hotel. Other than that it was a nice visit. It was very clean and welcoming inside.
