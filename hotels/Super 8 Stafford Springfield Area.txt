Text: Great service by all the staff. Small, friendly motel. Mostly clean room, rather small bathroom for King size bed but no complaints. Room did have mini fridge but was lacking microwave. Thank you Abash!

Text: Staff was very friendly, helpful and polite! Room was clean. I loved the Route 66 decor. Hallway smelled a little like cigarette smoke. But the smell did not enter the room. Would stay here again.
