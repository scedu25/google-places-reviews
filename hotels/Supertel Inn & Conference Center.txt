Text: I never got a chance to stay here because they never answer their phone. I called them multiple times all day and evening and never once did anyone answer their telephone. Having problems finding a room and everyone kept recommending this place. However, I have no idea why and won't try to stay here.

Text: Considering that I had a dead cockroach on my bed & the new room tag they gave me hadn't been vacuumed....I don't have much to say except that I would stay somewhere else.  This place definitely is not worth the price!
