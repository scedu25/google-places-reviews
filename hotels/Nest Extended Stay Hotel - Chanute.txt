Text: Nice old hotel with plenty of charm. Great location on Main Street. Only things that would make it better would be a new comforter and a fresh hot breakfast.

Text: I have a friend that lives there and we were hanging out. His room was pretty nice, a one bedroom. Kitchen was tiny only a couple cabinets, a stove, and the fridge. Living room was massive and the bedroom was good sized.
