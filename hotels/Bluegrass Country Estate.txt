Text: We love the Bluegrass Country Estate B and B! Cheryl is a wonderful hostess/owner. Her breakfasts are delicious.  She allows us to "make ourselves at home".  There's a pool, hot tub, exercise room, theater room and more. And horses, of course, it's Kentucky!We're having a lovely time. Thank you, Cheryl! We will recommend you to everyone we know!

Text: Exceeded all expectations.  From the warmth and feel of home to the fresh autumn ambient scents that enveloped the estate and countryside, and from the sincere hospitality of the innkeeper to waking-up each morning to the aroma of hot country-style breakfasts awaiting us at table where the individual settings made us feel very special.   We are seasoned travelers.  It was a perfect stay for a return trip home to visit family and friends.  And we are thankful all the best hotels in Louisville were sold out due to conventions, prompting us to stay here.  For us, the personal touches were reminiscent of an era largely gone-by.

Text: We loved Bluegrass Country Estates! We went there for a staff retreat, 5 of us, and had the whole place to ourselves. It's beautiful, comfortable, and elegant! Cheryl was a fantastic hostess. Breakfast was out of this world delicious, and the table was set beautifully. Cheryl made cookies in the afternoon. Just what we needed in the middle of our meeting! One night was not enough! I wanted to stay for the whole week! I can't recommend it enough! I would go back in a minute!  The best B&B I've experienced!
