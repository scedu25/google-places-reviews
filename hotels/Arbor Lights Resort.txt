Text: We had an amazing weekend! Kids loved it! We were right next to Indiana Beach and we brought our boat and docked at the resort. The pool was great too! We really enjoyed ourselves! The owners very helpful! John (the owner) gave us helpful advise when launching the boat! Super friendly people! We want to go back! Yes there are lots of cats! Bring pillows the ones in the rooms werent too great! Our studio room with a pull out couch was the perfect size for us 4!

Text: i am so sorry i did not read the previous review.  ABSOLUTELY on the mark.  there are cats and dishes of food all over.  the 3 bedroom cottage is a dump, converted garage for $180.00 per night.  the toilet was ready to overflow- we were told by the owner Mary that the septic tank had not been cleaned and to be careful with the toilet paper.  she also yelled at us to keep the door closed and windows if we had the air in.  very noisy and intrusive owners always in your business.  always watching you coming and going. did not leave anything valuable in the so called cottage, worried it would get ripped off.  states that she is the last resort before you get into the amusement park..you just walk in fails to tell you there is a chain link fence to prevent this. PICTURES ARE DATED !!!
