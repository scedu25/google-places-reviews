Text: Excellent service at the counter, even my cranky husband thought so. They were very gracious about an early check-in so we could get ready for a wedding. The room was clean and everything was as it should be. We thought it was odd that the air conditioner was running (at the end of October) but that was a quick fix and the heater worked well. The only thing that stopped me from leaving 5 stars is the fact that not only was there no coffee pot in the room but there was also no continental breakfast. Minimum of at least one of these and I'd probably leave 5 stars.

Text: Very nicely remodeled! Not good lamp lighting so very dim unless the window shades are open. Still working on getting their food license so breakfast was not available.
