Hampton Inn I-75 Lexington/Hamburg Area
Rating: 4
Text: Not all Hampton inns are crested equal. This was one of the better ones. It was clean and the staff was friendly. The only down side was the air conditioner vibrated which didn't allow me to sleep as well as i could gave otherwise.

Text: Fine hotel with friendly staff. A few odd characters hanging around outside the building and rooms haven't been updated in some time. Location is convenient to most of the city and wifi is fast.

Text: This place is deplorable. Badly soiled carpets and chairs in the rooms, mold and mildew on the shower heads and tubs. The pool area is unspeakable with the threadbare furniture in the pool area is a lawsuit waiting to happen...the ceiling and wall in the pool area is bubbled up and peeling off. Animals can stay here and I guess they don't bother to clean after them evidently, pet hair everywhere. We checked out as quick as we checked in! Horrible place, can't believe Hilton allows such.  The ONLY good thing about this place is that the desk guy worked with us leaving...for that I am grateful.One star only because of the desk clerk.

Text: 8-18-17 UPDATE!!!   I have to take edit my statement about Mike F. at the front desk. He was an absolute gentleman this stay and provided EXCELLENT customer service. I have upgraded my rating on this hotel now due to this positive experience.

Would have been a PERFECT stay if it were for Mr. smartass Mike F at the front desk. Everyone else was AMAZING.

Text: It is clearly an older Hampton but was clean with great friendly service. Breakfast was okay but nothing out of the ordinary. The bed was great and had been updated. The rest of the hotel could use an update too.
