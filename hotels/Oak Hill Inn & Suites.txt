Oak Hill Inn & Suites

Text: We arrived late at night (with a reservation) and the hotel was very accommodating of our schedule even offering a free late checkout to get some extra rest before driving home after moving our daughter into her dorm. The room was spacious and very well laid out.  Bathrooms were clean and smelled great !

Text: My husband and son stayed here while visiting Culver Stockton college. My husband has stayed in many hotels all over the country, and he said this is one of the nicest, cleanest hotels he has been in. Staff was very friendly. If our son decides to attend Culver Stockton, we will be returning customers.

Text: The rooms appear to have been recently painted and updated. The renovations give it a new modern look and feel. The hotel has a swimming pool and hot tub and is conveniently placed across from a gas station and a Steak and Shake.

Text: Spa tub in the room was nice. Room itself was pretty good. We stayed here for a wedding in town. Breakfast was the same as it is everywhere nothing to be overly excited about. Overall great experience for a hotel. Staff was friendly.
