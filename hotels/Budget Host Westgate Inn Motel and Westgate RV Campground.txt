Text: We were at their campground. Their campground is easy to get in and out. Close to a lot of good eating places.

We stay at this campground, usually twice a year. We love it.  Close to everything.

Text: No idea why there were so many positive reviews on this place, honestly.  We picked it, despite having no experience with the brand, based on the number of positive reviews, despite there being a number of other local options in the same price range.  The room we stayed in was extremely dated (I felt like I had been transported back in time to my grandma's house).  All systems at the front desk were extremely dated (they still use keys, for instance, not keycards).  Breakfast was a box of pre-packaged pastries.  We had to lug our luggage up the narrow internal stairs to reach our second floor room. 

Room felt clean, but extremely dated.  Shower head was located quite low in the wall -- had to bend over to wash your hair.  (I"m only 5'10", so it's not unreasonable to expect to be able to stand under the shower head).  

Staff was friendly, as advertised.

Text: Nice rooms with good shower pressure.  Clean, quiet, easy access to your car.  Small breakfast bars and coffee in morning.  Alarm clock has us for phone charging.  Cable TV.  Mini fridge.

Text: The hotel is run by a family and is very neat and clean. It's nothing fancy but the price is reflective of that. I would definitely stay here again if I was looking for a cheap place to sleep along 75.
