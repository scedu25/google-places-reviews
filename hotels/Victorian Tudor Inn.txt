Victorian Tudor Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed for a few nights in the Nautical Suite. Very spacious and comfortable. Location was convenient. Breakfast is different each day, and you can request items. We didnt spend much time in the common areas, but they also look comfortable and quiet. Host is friendly and knowledgeable about the area and it's history. Will stay again.

Text: The host, Richard, was so accommodating for us in our short last minute getaway! The tudor is beautifully decorated with antiques. Our room (Royal Oak) was very clean and comfortable and right next to the private hot tub room. Breakfast was fantastic. We really appreciated the superb hospitality!! Highly recommend!

Text: Kind, helpful, accommodating and beautiful inn full of fascinating antiques.  On a hot summer night air conditioning also made it quite "sleepable."  Perfect!!
