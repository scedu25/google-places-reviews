Text: The hotel is clean mostly modern. The employees are very helpful and courteous. But the first morning the room phone rang at 6:30am for no reason, the next morning I was woken up at 6am to the garbage service emptying the dumpsters and the internet quality is very poor. I have stayed there before and didn't have the disturbances, but the internet was also poor. For the cost I have to say that there are better hotels in the area.

Text: Pros: Staff was really nice. The pool and hot tub were great. Nice family atmosphere. Con: The first room we got, the windows were leaking when it rained. And we had issues with our key cards not working repeatedly. Overall: Really great time.

Text: We were evacuated from our room around 3am. The alarms in the hotel were going off. They stuffed everyone in a room,didn't offer any water food or anything while we waited for the fireman to secure the building. The next day did not hear a "sorry" or anything. It was sad to see the hotel be so unaopreciative of there guests
