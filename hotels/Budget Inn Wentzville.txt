Budget Inn Wentzville

Text: Thought it was safe for a last minute crash based off the reviews. Turns out our room had roaches which we caught one to take to the front desk and she refused to give us more than $35/65 it cost to stay. Keep in mind we were there maybe 1 hour. Not surprised, just disappointed. Don’t stay here- splurge the extra 30 bucks.

Text: It's not as sketchy as it looks.. The building is definitely designed weird and the entrance for the rooms doesn't lock but the room doors do, so that's a plus. Breakfast is only served for an hour so prepare for that.

Text: the staff was super cool, would have been badass if the pool would have been in working order. had a sweet change machine token game in the vending machine room.. kinda dim and maybe could be cleaner but hey, at $65 per night i didn't expect a whole lot more... would stay again
