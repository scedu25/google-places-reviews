Text: This is a beautiful retreat in Ohio! Nice clean campsites some with electric available and amazing friendly staff! Host to many festivals they know how to have a good time. I considered this beautiful nature wonderland a home away from home.

Text: Rented a cabin with our dogs. It was adequate. The cabins are very rustic and smell of cigarettes. You need to bring your own towels etc. The water is from a cistern so I would bring bottled to drink. There is no cell coverage or internet. You need to go to the football field to pick up some cell coverage. The place can use a bit of TLC. It's ok for short stays and our dogs loved it. I just wish it didn't smell of cigarettes.

Text: The Hannon's are insanely good people.  They take great care of the land and always go above and beyond when Kinetic comes out to play for a weekend.  It's a blast getting to know them more each year, and I'm grateful for the hospitality they provide to all of us.  You all rock!
