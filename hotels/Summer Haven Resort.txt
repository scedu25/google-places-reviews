Text: The new owners are rude and not very helpful. The air conditioning in our room did not work it was a very old air conditioning unit and they refuse to do anything about it so we had to stay in a hot room. The room was filthy there were cobwebs everywhere spiders and bugs in our room. There was dead bugs all along the window seal. The fire detector was busted up and didn't even look like it could work. This place is very outdated. The refrigerator in our room had a bunch of nasty stuff at the bottom of it. The people that were in the room below us said that their room had mold. The room smell of mildew. Unfortunately we will not be going back here we love staying at Indiana beach but will not stay at this Resort again.

Text: this place was nasty. I had black mold in the room. My carpet was wet and when I went and said something about it they brought me a  humidifier and sprayed something on all the black mold. Told me that the humidifier would take care of it. Needless to say by the end of the weekend I was sick and ended up missing two days of work.( Monday and Tuesday) DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!  The help is drunk and high and I had my children three and six with me. Absolutely the worst time we have ever had

Text: This is the worst establishment I have ever been to. A group of my friends and I went to stay here for a weekend about a week ago. When we got there the room smelled like mold and there were several holes in the wall as well as missing ceiling tiles. The furniture said that they had was plastic lawn chairs which okay all those things aside we weren't too angry. That was until we found out they had BED BUGS. Which okay places get that so I went to file a report with the manager and the associate refuse to let me talk to him and stated he would take my report so I begin tell him what happened. He precedes to yell at me telling me I am lying that they do not have them and I'm making it up. Which is ridiculous why would someone make up a case of bed bugs, that is a parasite that feeds off of people and gets a bigger problem the more it feeds. I now have it and so do my friends all because of this hotel.
