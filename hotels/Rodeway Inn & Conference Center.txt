Text: If I could give this hotel a zero,  I would.  After having to switch rooms several times,  due to safety issues,  filth, and no air conditioning,  we finally had to stay in a room with a clogged bathtub because they wouldn't give us a refund. The only thing halfway decent was the breakfast and the night clerks who tried their best to assist us.

Text: Kind of run down, but it's affordable. Hopefully they will improve soon.

Text: This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Items throughout the hotel were broken an dirty. There was graffiti in the stairwell and a strong smell of urine.  The phone in the room was broken and the carpet felt wet. Never again will I stay here.

Text: It was a decent place, but when I took my two kids swimming the other people there were being so disrespectful. They were jumping in the pool, splashing, yelling, and swearing. Not to mention these kids were only 12 years old. We went to tell the front desk and the worker came immediately and talked to the young kids, but as soon as she left they continued what they were doing before.
