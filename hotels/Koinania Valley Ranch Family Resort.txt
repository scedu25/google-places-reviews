Koinania Valley Ranch Family Resort

Text: If you are looking for a peaceful place out in the country to unwind and get away from it all, this is the place!!  The hosts are wonderful, the facilities are top notch, and the setting is gorgeous.  We have gone to Elephant Rocks and Johnson Shut-Ins, and both sites were huge hits with the family.  On the resort grounds, there is ample space for hiking and exploring in the creeks and woods, not to mention fishing or paddle-boating.  There are also ample movies and books if you prefer to curl up and relax.  I highly recommend Koinania Valley Ranch Family Resort, and look forward to when I can return!

Text: We stayed at the ranch house for two nights. It was a great experience. Mary was very accommodating to our requests. The rooms were clean. Mattresses were very comfortable. It is especially great for large families or groups of people.

Text: Mary is my Grandma and she makes sure my family and I ALWAYS have a great time!! I is the perfect place to have a family get together. It is far enough away from town that it is quiet and peaceful, but yet it is close enough to town to not be in the middle of nowhere.

Text: What an amazing experience! We've been coming here for years for scrapbook weekend getaways and it's always superb--this weekend was no exception. Thank you Mary and Duane for the fantastic experience as usual.

Text: This resort is so surreal and refreshing. It is a way to get away from the busyness of the world. Duane & Mary Wiltberger are the most incredible hosts. Our family has been coming to this resort for over 16 years.
