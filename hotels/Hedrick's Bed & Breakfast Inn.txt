Text: Animal lovers, this is your place!!!  My family and I stayed one night. This includes an evening tour, breakfast, a morning tour and camel rides (or pony rides for kids under 60 lbs). It was very hot when we arrived, and the animals were feeling the heat as much as we were. When a cold front came in that evening, all the animals perked up and became much more active, so try to visit in spring or fall when it's not so hot.  The tours included feeding treats to/petting giraffes and kangaroos!  In the morning, we bottle feed baby camels. As guests, we we're allowed to visit and pet the animals as much as we wanted, without entering the pens. Many of the animals are quite tame and friendly, and love attention, they come right up to the fence to be petted. My daughter and I spent hours petting Ben the super friendly giraffe, zebras, donkeys, camels, horses, goats, sheep, and other exotic animals. Ostriches and emus are fun to watch, but they bite. Bison and elk were also fun to watch but had no interest in being petted. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, especially our morning tour guide, Cole.  Breakfast was delicious!  It included fresh made french toast that was amazing!  The farm also does tours by appointment, which would be fun, but I highly recommend staying at the B&B for anyone who really loves to interact with animals.

Text: Great rustic place (it's a real working farm).  Great interaction with animals including exotics like giraffes, camels, kangaroos, among others. Breakfast was good and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Third time we have stayed here during the fair and plan on doing it again next year.
