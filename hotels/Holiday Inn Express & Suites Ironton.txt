Holiday Inn Express & Suites Ironton
Rating: 5
Text: I stay in hotels at least 150 nights every year for my job and this is hands down the best Holiday Inn I've stayed at. I was at this location 4 nights a week from December 2016 - April 2017. The entire place is brand new and spotless, the staff is very welcoming and diligent to serve. I can't say enough good things about this location. It's so good I'm taking the time to write up this review. The pool and hotub are clean, the exercise room is adequate for working out away from home, and there are plenty of stores and restaurants in the immediate area.

Text: Very clean rooms, friendly staff, reasonably priced, and breakfast included!.  What more can you ask for.  24 hr pool with jacuzzi.  Keurig, fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and iron board in our room.  I would assume they all have that.  Again very nice!
