Text: During four day stay we had exceptional customer service. The housekeeping and front desk staff all were friendly and courteous going the extra lengths to see that our stay was relaxing. The property and room were pristine and well maintained.

Text: Can't say enough good things about this place. Absolutely superb from top to bottom. Our room was squared away and clean. The laundry room, weight room, entrance, lobby and grounds are well maintained. Two thumbs up!

Text: The rooms are great, everything is clean. There is free laundry, a place to buy snacks, local products, and hygiene products, and a gym. You also have access to the pool at the Holiday Inn across the street. The only downside is no breakfast, but there is always fruit in the lobby.

Text: Love staying at Candlewood Suites. Having a big desk in the room to work from and a kitchen with an ice maker makes long stays easier. Two queen beds and a recliner means there's room for the entire family. Like being able to go borrow movies from the front desk at no cost. I miss out on breakfast but all the other amenities make up for it. Candlewood Suites is my choice for long stays.
