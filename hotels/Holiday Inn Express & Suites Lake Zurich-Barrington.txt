Text: The staff was extremely professional and very attentive. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking to stay in the Northwest suburbs due to its vicinity to the expressway allowing foe easy access to Chicago, and major public transportation.

Text: Great Location -
This property sits so far off the road that there is not a single sound but birds and breeze outside!

Staff was outstanding, and property is well kept.

Normally I would stay closer to my destinations, but I wanted something else.

Plenty of eatery around the area for sure!

I'll recommend it, and I'll be back

Text: I have never stayed here. But my sister and brother in law did had no complaints. I think its location is good on US 12. Which is on the way to Wisconsin. Large outdoor parking lot. Pool for customers only. It sits back from the road and I do remember my sister could not find it maybe because of the buildings along Rt.12 kind of block the view. And the signage is not real prominate
