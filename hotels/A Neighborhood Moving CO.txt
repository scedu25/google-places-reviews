A Neighborhood Moving CO
Rating: 5
Text: I called a neighborhood moving company on fairly short notice, and I appreciated there willingness to help me with my move. The staff was friendly, on time and professional. They were very resourceful, even removing my front door so I could fit my couch in through the doorway. I would strongly recommend this company.
