Text: The ladies running the front desk were very polite, and almost always greeted me. Although I would have to leave the hotel very early every morning, the staff still had the ready made items our for breakfast, which I found to be super convenient. The beds were a little uncomfortable, but I still liked my room. The tv was a nice model, and the room appeared to have modern decor. The elevator was a little small, but I never ran into any issues with overcrowding. I would stay here again.

Text: Rooms were nice size. I believe the two queen beds were actually two full size beds. the pool and hot tub were small but comfortable. bring flip flops to the pool, we saw two different people slip and fall while we were there. Breakfast was a bit crowded but very good. we would go back to this hotel if we are in the area again.

Text: The staff was very kind and accommodating! We would highly recommend this hotel. We got in after 1am after our car breaking down on the way home from a family vacation. Everyone was very welcoming. The room was very clean and the breakfast was perfect.

Text: Hotel has a great modern look from the lobby. People are nice, for the price the breakfast could be better. It could be that I just got THE room that hasn't been remodeled. But I'm pretty sure they gave me the Peter North suite!

Text: The building is relatively new. The staff are well mannered and attentive. Breakfast is free so one can't complain. The rooms are comfortable, put a towel on the office chair before siting for long periods. The "leather" is not kind to you.
No restaurant at night so you have to go out, but there are plenty of places very close by.
