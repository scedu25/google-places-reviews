The Oread Hotel

Text: The interior was inviting, and beautiful. Everything seemed to be accessible right in the lobby. The elevators were so smooth that I didn't even realize we were moving. We went to the roof, and it was so pretty! The view was great, and the "atmosphere" was wonderful!

Text: Beautiful hotel and great room. Only downside is limited parking and there are not complementary toiletries ie tooth brush, floss, razor. You have to use theither store to purchase these items you may have forgotten at an insane price that hotels usually provide for free
