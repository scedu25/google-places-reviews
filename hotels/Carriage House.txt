Text: Inexpensive. Clean. Roomy and quiet. Nice, helpful hosts. Right on the main road through town. We'd definitely stay there again.

Text: So far so good, but I'm an all nighter sometimes, guess I'll re-evaluate if they end up not liking my odd hours, and give me any grief about it. 
 No grief gave, but NO late check-out.

Text: Very nice owners!! Extremely affordable compared to all other motels in the town.  Antiquated, but remodeling underway.  Comfortable and "Old School" Cozy with easy drive up parking just feet from your room>
