Text: This place was great! Such nice people that own it and the place was super clean. I wish the website would have stated it has basically a full kitchen. We brought our camping stove expecting to rough it. But we were pleasantly surprised it had a fridge, microwave, hot plate, and everything else you'd need to make a meal except a stove. We will definitely be back to do some more dirt bike riding and will hopefully stay here!

Text: 10/10 would stay again. It's got a nice cozy feel. Loved the comfortable beds. They did not have any shortage of extra stuff like blankets and pillows. There was a great deal of restaurants in the area that delivered.

Text: Would be a solid 5 star if they provided wifi so that in the evenings people were able to call home and what not. Other than that love staying here! Great host!
