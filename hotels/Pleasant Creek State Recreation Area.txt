Text: Harassed instantly by DNR because we are from CO. DNR asked us to move from empty plot we set up at, said it was "reserved" even though there was no reserve sign. We ended up moving to plot behind it, no one even showed up to "reserved" plot. Went to go check out one of the lakes to see if we wanted to fish, husband parked, cracked open a beer and stepped out of our vehicle to find DNR pulling up behind us to give him a citation for open container. He was literally 3 steps away from it being ok to have beer. This one night stay costed us $350. So, if you like spending lots of money to be harassed, not fish, not relax and have a great time, this is the campsite for you!

Text: Looked like a nice place but good luck getting a "walk up."  Pack everything and drive all the way there just to be turned away.  They have an online reservation system that it would be nice if they would mark it as full instead of making it look like walk up sites were available.  Not going to plan on going here again.
