Super 8 Nebraska City
Rating: 4
Text: Quiet and comfortable, clean and nice staff.   Breakfast was mediocre at best... mainly due to no fresh fruit or protein options.  However, it was great that they allowed pets as we were traveling with our 8# puppy and the first few hotels we considered did not accept pets!

Text: Excellent customer service.  Hotel in good repair.  Most comfortable mattress,  so much that I want one.  Parking lot needs repairs though.

Text: Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable.  Short staffed.  Check in ok sent to an occupied room but got corrected.  Breakfast, had to ask for coffee and milk gravy mix out at 7:00 and never refilled.  We cleaned and wiped off counters and tables.  Not typical of Super 8.  Wouldn't  recommend to friends.

Text: Ended up here late since the Motel 6 nearby was full. They only had a suite left, not a problem. Metal tray over the tissue box kept falling out into the tile floor. Sink seemed like it hadn't been used in awhile, spit LOTS of rust and air. Shower was fine. Two out of three Wes Cravens.

Text: The hotel itself was great for the cost. Clean and comfy enough. The lobby smelled like marijuana because the clerk was smoking. He stunk like dope. In a truck stop so no nice scenery.
