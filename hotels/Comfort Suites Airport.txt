Comfort Suites Airport

Text: Very accommodating, friendly service, close to the airport. Good breakfast. Rooms are awesome for the price. Fridge, microwave, couch, footstools or coffee table not sure which one, and a small changing bench. Clean. No complaints.

Text: Nice hotel. The room was very spacious and modern. The room was very clean as was the entire hotel. Close to the airport but I never heard any air traffic when in the hotel. The only negatives were the pool and the breakfast. The pool was pretty small and quite crowded. There was also no hot tub. The breakfast quality was not the best I have had. But it was included in the price of the room so I suppose I can't be too picky. Over all a good experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.

Text: Comfort Suites, Louisville KY started our time with them by picking me and my coworker up at the airport. A friendly face gave us a room card and told us about their complimentary breakfast. The room was clean, large, and comfortable. I had a king size bed which was very comfortable. The breakfast had alot to choose from and their was complimentary iced tea in the lobby. I enjoyed my stay and definitely would stay again

Text: Was falsely accused of smoking in the room. Hotel never contacted me or tried to figure out the situation. They charged my card $150. $150 That I didn't have to just give away. They basically stole my money. When I called to talk to the hotel... the lady didn't even let me get a word out. She was very rude and highly unprofessional. The hotel is  in a shady part of town, pool was nasty, the "hot" breakfast was anything but that, and the staff was NOT friendly. It's definitely not worth the money they are charging. I got a discount through a family member, but I know what they charge. All in all I would recommend you do your research.
