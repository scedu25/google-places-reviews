WoodSpring Suites Louisville Southeast
Rating: 4
Text: The room was clean, and the property was nicely kept. The location is great, tucked away but close to everything. It's kinda noisey if your room is facing the interstate though. The staff were not very friendly at first but seemed to lighten up after a little while. The weekly rate was very affordable!  I would definitely recommend this place to someone.

Text: The front desk guy was nice and helpful but the room was smoked in. I always book non smoking! They only offered to refund $25 on a $160,  2 night stay. All my clothes smelled and the air sprays/candles I purchased didn't make a difference. Make sure you call and reserve a room# and have them triple check the room if you plan on staying here.

Text: Great staff. Comfy rooms with all you would need for an extended stay. All rooms include microwave and small stove along with a full size refrigerator. Stays pretty quiet and safe place to stay with small children. They are also a pet friendly motel.
