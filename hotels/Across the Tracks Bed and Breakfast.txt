Across the Tracks Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We wanted to get out of the city and visit and few days to rest and recharge and this was the perfect spot for that! From the first conversation with one of the owners over the phone to set up the dates- we were treated with kind and friendly conversation which was very welcoming. Upon arrival, owners were very nice and laid back and we were incredibly impressed with the property- the location was a bit secluded, set up in a historic home that had been lovingly restored, with a warm and cozy vibe that we really loved. Such great attention to detail in every single room- each were obviously designed with enthusiasm, great taste, and care. The breakfast smelled and looked magnificent but we unfortunately slept through breakfast times on both days. The accommodations were outstanding- each room beautiful and eclectic. Our stay in the Red Room was perfect-  very spacious, had two big windows, and the bed was so comfortable we hated leaving it each day! Next on our list is to stay in the Paris Room! ?? We look forward to returning to this absolutely charming establishment soon!! ??

Text: We got caught up in solar eclipse traffic for over 8 hrs when we had to make a pit stop...we then decided to find a hotel at 10pm.....we  called several in the area... many didn't answer.....we assume bc they were overloaded with stranded travelers. After several failed called by 11pm,  we believe the Lord led us to this BNB! What a gem and great find. We will be back. Nina and Brian were very accommodating, and at 1130pm too! They took in abt 12 people at the last minute who were stranded on August 21st 2017. The place is cute, quaint, clean and very welcoming. Breakfast food was great, esp the sausages made from grass beef, AND the coffee was outstanding too!
