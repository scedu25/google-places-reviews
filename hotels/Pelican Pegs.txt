Text: Hubby and I love coming here. Peg is so nice and a good cook. Always a wonderful breakfast and so much better than anywhere else we've been.
She is so helpful at suggesting activities but the best part of or stays is sitting on the deck next to the river.
It just doesn't get any better than this and rates we can afford.
