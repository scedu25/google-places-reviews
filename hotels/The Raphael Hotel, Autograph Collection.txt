Text: Amazing experience, super personalized and the hotel staff went above and beyond. My husband and I plan to go here every year together. Food was great, room was beautiful and clean, valet was a great perk and walking distance for us to go out without worrying about driving. Can't wait to go back!

Text: Good: historic feeling, pleasant atmosphere with a great view and location in the plaza. I feel as though the staff genuinely wanted our experience to be good. Thank you to William who tried his best to fix the issues we faced, which are noted below... 

Bad: our room had some else's dirty clothes in the drawer. On top of that, mini bar was not (even a little bit) cold. We alerted the front desk and the moved us rooms. 
The next rooms mini bar was perhaps 44° (still not cold) and had a big wad of long hair on the mattress. At this point I wasn't interested in alerting the staff. 

This would be a fantastic hotel if it weren't for the lack of attention to detail, and my bad luck of getting what I suspect are the 2 bad rooms in the hotel. Sad, because I would have come back had the details been attended too.

Text: The rooms were nice and properly cleaned every day. The room service was average. There are much better restaurants to walk to.

Text: Visited someone who was staying here. The rooms were VERY nice, deep tubs, pretty decorations. It's designed to feel like a European hotel. Ate at the restaurant. It was nice but very expensive.
