Text: Rented 2 sites for 3 days on labor day weekend 2017, we have been here many times and never had any issues until today. We were told by the park attendant we were not allowed to fish. That's not acceptable. We will not be returning.

Text: I almost hate to review just how excellent this stop was as it felt like a well kept secret. We traveled through end of July and the grounds were almost empty. Absolutely beautiful camping, fine facilities, and a beautiful landscape. A hidden treasure!

Text: The park is clean and well maintained. Restrooms and shows are also very clean and we'll maintained. Camp sites offer shade,  electric hookups and water hookups. All in all it's a great place to go.
