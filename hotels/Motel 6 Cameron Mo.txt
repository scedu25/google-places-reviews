Motel 6 Cameron Mo
Rating: 3
Text: Clean room.  Good price.  Easy to get there.  No breakfast.  Refrigerator seal didn't work and it leaked on the floor. Air conditioning  worked great.  It did keep things cold.   We just slept there and then when went on our merry way.

Text: The man running the motel was very nice.  The room was quite modern looking with the wood simulated floors.  I did however have to fix the sink drain which was stuck on closed.  The toilet was loose and rocked around when you sat on it.  I couldn't find the "sleep" option on the TV remote control, which I find quite necessary these days.
Otherwise it was a nice place to sleep.

Text: A no frills place to sleep.  No toiletries so bring your own shampoo.  Towels were clean but hard and thin.  Bed was ok. Easy access off the road.  All in all, not a bad place for the price.   I'd stay there again for an overnight, but if you're planning a long stay, I'd suggest someplace else.

Text: Clean & Comfy.  Aside from the chipped paint in the bathtub,  there was nothing to complain about. The desk clerk was very nice and polite.  We'll be back!

Text: Great service, clean rooms!
My truck was in the shop and I needed a room asap, motel 6 was there and at the right price. The gentlemen at the desk was friendly and even gave me a phone charger for the night when I did not bring one and needed my phone to be charged. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and at a low cost. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing a place to stay.
