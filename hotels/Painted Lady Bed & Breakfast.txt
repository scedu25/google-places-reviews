Text: We stayed here for an anniversary getaway, and had a wonderful time.  We stayed in the private cottage, which included our own (giant!) jacuzzi, private patio, king-size bed, and kitchenette.  Everything was pristinely clean and well-maintained.  Best of all, the owners were the most lovely people imaginable.  We thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them the evening we arrived, and breakfast was made to order.  We even received breakfast in a little basket (complete with hot breakfast sandwiches) on our cottage porch upon request.  

We love Wanda and Sandy and do not hesitate to recommend the Painted Lady.  We will certainly be back!
