Ivy Court Inn & Suites
Rating: 3
Text: Rooms are small but clean and functional.  Toilet and shower are awkwardly set up requiring some nimble movement to close the door. The a/c units are loud as is the bathroom vent fan. Not particularly pleased with the first level room with view of street particularly next to side door.  No soundproofing so inconsiderate loud people walking in at 2 am tests your own manners.  Breakfast was good. Though they had a very nauseating infomercial playing all morning.  Might have liked it more with a view of campus.  For the price on a non football weekend not bad.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  It's not the Inn at St. Mary's but it's close to campus and worth visiting.

Text: Nice hotel but very thin walls. Can hear every noise in adjoining rooms and the hallways.

Text: Room was clean, bed was comfortable, and parking was easy. Surprising were some standout aspects in an otherwise mediocre breakfast buffet: freshly fried eggs over medium and homemade salsa verde that was actually spicy.

Text: Highly recommend this inn. Feels more "homey" than many hotels, and close to campus.
