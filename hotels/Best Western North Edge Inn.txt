Best Western North Edge Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed for two nights while on a driving vacation. Room was large and had a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator. Property was in excellent shape. Being that the hotel was on the North bypass around Dodge City, it was much quieter than all the other hotels on the main highway through the city due to the train tracks, and the trains that come through the downtown area all night. The free breakfast each morning included everything that you could want. Front desk, and breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The staff was outstanding and very lively! The owner was the most respectful and accommodating business owner I've probably ever dealt with. Our room was very clean and had all the comforts we could ask for in a hotel. Can't remember the last time I had a kitchen in a hotel with a full fridge and stove top!

Room was all clean, and maintained. Had a couple of mixed drinks at the bar area. Will definitely be staying here again. Great experience.
