Text: It is not a good place to stay, hospitality isn't what it should have been and the employees are nosey the air didn't work the fridge quit and wouldn't fix it or give another room. So I suggest not staying their if you can keep from it. I will rate it at 0 or maybe 1. I'll never stay their again I'll sleep in my car first.

Text: Remember the show "My Name is Earl"? This hotel is nastier then the one they lived in on the show. It is a pay by the day apartment complex for druggies. Avoid this place and the Red Rock Inn across the street by all means!

Text: Most disgusting foul place to stay even for one night on a have to situation! Room was very dirty walls was very dirty, unknown white stains in the carpet, looked like the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in months. Very strong odor that cause me to have a nose bleed. This place needs a inspection! The room was cheap but still not worth the $180 I paid for a week. I only lasted 3 days. Don't even consider if you have any other option.
