Cedar Hall (Union Street Center)

Text: I got food poisoning from an expired product that I consumed the same day at the Union Street Market.

Text: The convenience store is on the south side of the ground floor. Lots of vegetarian/vegan, organic, and fair-trade staples. 
The hot bar and sandwich line are pretty good but very expensive if you're not using a meal plan.

Text: Even for students that don't live in this area (myself included) this building has a lot of good purposes. Convenience store has decent breakfast items and coffee at the same semi-unreasonable prices as any other campus dining establishment but the food is marketably more edible, actually quite good sometimes. 

Multimedia center has movies and such for rental (last time I checked you must be an on-campus resident to rent but this may have changed) free of charge.

Ground and 1st floors each have a large multimedia classroom that can be used for study when not reserved for classes. The 1st floor also has multiple glass enclosed Skype-enabled conference rooms available for group study and club meeting rental (when not reserved for classes). 

An EXTREMELY limited number of City of Bloomington Free 2 Hour Parking spaces are located adjacent to Cedar Hall along Union Street but again are EXTREMELY limited in number and HEAVILY monitored by parking enforcement. Don't expect to arrive 5 minutes before class starts and expect a parking spot to be open.
