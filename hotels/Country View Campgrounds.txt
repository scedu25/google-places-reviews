Text: Great campground! The night clerk was really helpful and kind, even escorted us to our site. Super clean bathrooms and showers (so important!) Would highly recommend to anyone! Thank you so much!!

Text: No picnic table and no fire pits. They had us against the back fence..right behind the Fed-Ex center. Trucks started up at 6:00 AM so no need for an alarm clock. Train whistles begin at 3:00AM and continue until 5:00 AM.  Some sites were given away ( according to our neighbors)  so they were forced into a spot that their camper barely fit.  Electrical connection was a disaster. Would not recommend this place.

Text: Very nice park!  Spots are big and level.  The showers were awesome.  Clean, modern and lots of hot water.  Good Wi-Fi and cable.  Will stay again.

Text: Good place to stay. The wifi, from my experience, is terrible unless one sits on the office steps. Other than that the place was satisfactory. It had a pool, playground, and nicely spaced lots. Satisfactory.
