Holiday Inn Windsor Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is pretty much in the perfect spot if you're visiting from the states. It's just around the corner from getting out of the tunnel. It's also just a block from the main downtown strip. It's also really not that expensive. 

One thing I noticed that was pretty neat is that they have special parking spots for IHG members, so if you're not already part of that free program, you should be. 

The room in general and the bed are pretty stand fare for a Holiday Inn. Check-in is a little interesting in that you need to park in the "five minute" spot, go inside to check in, then go the rest of the way to the parking spaces.

Text: The pool was great! You have to pay for parking (which I don't remember being advertised). It isn't guaranteed that you get a spot in the lot so check in as early as possible. Really close to a lot of amenities. Comfortable beds and really good pressure in the shower!

Text: This is a great hotel. The room was so nice, comfortable, modern. I am 100% satisfied. It had everything that a visitor requires. A large desk, mini fridge. The bed was very comfortable.

Text: Not a bad place. Beds were comfortable and service was friendly. Excellent location but the bathroom was tiny tiny. Could barely sit on the toilet it was so close to the vanity.

Text: The location is with plenty of other hotels, rooms are clean and accessible, and the service of employees was impeccable.
