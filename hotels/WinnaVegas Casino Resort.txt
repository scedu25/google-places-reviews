We ate at the buffet, excellent food as always! But when we were going to leave we had a flat tire, the maintenance men, not only aired our tire up they fixed it also! I believe that their names were edman and Bert.  They went above and beyond what some would do. So THANK you very much!

Text: Hotel. Staff. Confusing over worked.  No refrigerators in room.  Hand to call down for towels.  Buffet over priced for amount of food.  Out dated machines. In casino.   The only positive is that the veterans get 15% discount and their own players card.

Text: Excellent Service, from the moment we got a ride from security to the hotel the service was outstanding.  All the staff greeted you and offered to make our stay better.  I was very impressed.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable!  The food was great!

Text: It was a first time attending a King Of The Cage fight, overall we had a great time. Box Office lady I spoke to over the phone was very polite i believe her name was Jeanie, we had to go to Will Call to get ticket's, not knowing where the event was. Maybe better detail (sign's) to where the area for events are hosted for first timers. Staff was polite and we will definitely be attending another event! Maybe try the buffet!

Text: I only visited for a short time, and just in the casino. Really like the variety of games. Like being at the casino but not a lot of money, play on the penny slots. Nickel, quarter, doller slots as well. Plenty of blackjack tables.
