Marble Creek Recreation Area Campground

Text: Beautiful place with tons of swimming holes, definitely recommend river shoes because the rocks in the water can be slick. Definitely will be back!

Text: This was a quiet, beautiful sojourn from the bustle of city life. It has a day use area with picnic tables and grills in addition to having a small but clean campground.

Only disappointing thing about this place was the amount of litter left in the creek, around the swimming area, along the trail and strewn amongst the picnic area :(
