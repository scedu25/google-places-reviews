Baymont Inn & Suites Washington

Text: Place had bed bugs. I stayed in 121 on the first floor, woke up this morning with bites all over my body and found one crawling on me. I don't blame the hotel for this, it's kind of the luck of the draw with hotels, but I don't think I'll be back.

Besides the bed bugs, it was an average hotel. Decent rates, standards amenities.

Text: Decent place to stay. Not very many choices in Washington, IN. I highly recommend not getting a room on the back side above the indoor pool. The smell of chlorine is overwhelming. The beds are not very comfortable and the breakfast bar is limited. Other than that, it's quiet and cozy and part of the Wyndham Rewards family.

Text: The cleanest hotel I have ever been in. The staff are friendly, respectful, and accommodating. It was easy to find with plenty of the places to eat nearby so I didnt have travel to far. The rooms were comfortable, clean and quite. Housekeeping did an amazing job at keeping it well maintained during my stay.

Text: I payed for a room with two king beds and a sleeper sofa, and when I arrived there they said they only had rooms with one king bed. They wouldn't do anything about it and the manager wouldn't even talk to me. They have the worst customer service imaginable and act like dumb f's. I would never ever stay here not just because of their inability to do their jobs, but that they don't even maintain the hotel well.

Text: The rooms are clean. Nothing to complain about. The breakfast area is nice and large and the employees kept it well stocked. The front desk was welcoming and personable.
