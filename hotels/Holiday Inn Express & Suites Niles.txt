Holiday Inn Express & Suites Niles
Rating: 4
Text: I spent 2 nights here, traveled out of state for a few nights and returned here for 3 more nights. Both rooms were clean and spacious. The restroom was large enough, definitely not too small. The breakfast served near the lobby had an impressive selection including multiple hot selections, fresh fruits, juices, coffee, milk, cold cereals, breads and pastries. My only complaint is no bottled water in the room. I had a Keurig in both rooms but only 1 room had a small refrigerator.

NOTE: The hotel entrance is shared with Honor Credit Union. Pull into the entrance and turn right toward the ATM but stay on the left side of the ATM. That takes you directly into the hotel parking lot.

Text: The staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful.  The family suite is perfect for our needs!  There's even separate climate control for the extra bedroom. 
Unfortunately, I didn't get pics before my daughter and 4 of her friends got comfy (I'll pick up before we leave to make things easier on housekeeping). 
If you need a hotel in Niles for any reason, this is a clean, welcoming and comfortable place, especially for the price.

Text: Pretty happy with this location. It was a little hard to find, being nestled back off the main road quite a ways. Driveway is pretty easy to miss because it's almost like you're pulling into the bank in front of it. The staff that I interacted with were generally pleasant though I had to wait 10 minutes to check in on the first night because the desk agent was off "helping a guest" somewhere else in the hotel. Our room was average. The room (119) had a high ceiling which made it echo when we made any noise. There were some blatantly obvious stains on the floor and just some general disrepair. But all in all it was a pleasant stay.
