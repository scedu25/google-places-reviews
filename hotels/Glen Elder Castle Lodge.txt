Text: I stopped by on a cross country road trip. We came in very late, but they were very willing to accommodate us and waited for us to come. The room was cozy and very comfortable with all the amenities. The room has a lot of interesting memorabilia and a log book with all the people who have stayed there for various events and journeys. I would love to come back here on another cross country journey.
