Glidden Canoe Rental
Rating: 3
Text: I most definitely have mixed feelings about this place.  The first day we canoed the Dismal River.  Mitch drove us to the put in, we unloaded a few things and Mitch said the trail was steep at the river.  We carried a few items down the trail.  He said the trail was steep, not a 20+ high cliff!  I returned to gather the rest of my gear, only to see Mitch driving away!  With some of my gear!  You would think that he would have cared how we treated his canoes and that we were set before tearing off. This place is just a canoe rental, not an outfitter, so if you need things like a rope, spare paddle, bailer, well, bring your own.  We did make it to the take out out and had a grand day on the river.

The second day we rented stock tanks, and things went just fine.

Text: Really nice, easy to work with people and the Middle Loup is a great river to float.  We floated in a tub with three little kids.  They provide benches for the tub and paddles.  The river was great.  Lots of places to stop and explore.  We had a wonderful day and will be back.
