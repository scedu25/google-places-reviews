Text: My wife towing a trailer had to stop and rest on her way back from Texas and she was treated like royalty by the desk clerk he really went above and beyond to put her at ease I cannot thank y’all enough 

She said that the rooms were big and clean I seriously recommend this little motel to anyone they have some excellent staff here !!!

Text: We're in from Oklahoma the staff here is very accomadating switched us to an pet friendly room last minute so we could bring our furbaby with us. And kudos to Cody the front desk clerk this man needs an raise! He was very attentative to our needs even though the place is completely booked and he was the only one on his shift. Yes I'd definitely recommend this place and the cafe located inside is amazing great dinner and awesome breakfast two thumbs way up?? Also the indoor pool is heated and very well maintained, there are foosball tables, pool table, bball game, and hunting arcade game and vending machines and tables something for everyone to lounge & relax clean rooms, mini fridge ,heater/a.c. both worked like an charm.

Text: This motel was better than expected for the rate. Room was clean and comfortable, pool area was well kept. We would stay here again if we were in the area. Great value.

Text: Stayed for a school event. Room was beautiful, everything works, they were doing massive construction. The only complaint is the pool was very cloudy.
