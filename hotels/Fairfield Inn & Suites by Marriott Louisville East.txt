Text: Well overall I have to say the stay wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Despite a beautiful lobby and nice property the cleanliness level wasn't up to par. My suite didn't seem to be very well cleaned as I found a used plastic cup under a chair and a semi clean bathroom. The room also had some wood paneling loose around the tv area and the small refrigerator seemed to be sitting on just plywood. I can't say all the rooms are like this but mine certainly was. In not one to complain so I just let it go but the next morning when checking out I had to tell the girl at the front desk that her luggage cart was literally falling apart due to almost every screw and bolt being loose. They also made me put down a 250$ cash deposit even though I know I had money available in my account linked to the debit card I was trying to use for incidentals and the guy working at the time was not eager to help find a solution to the problem except to run my card and then tell me that it had nothing on it. He I was kind of rude but the rest of the staff was polite and can't fault any of the other employees. All around not the best experience....

Text: Awesome and inexpensive hotel. Very large rooms for the price. The remodel job shines. We had a small issue and it was resolved very quickly. I will be stating here again.

Text: Room a little small but ok for a king Memory foam mattresses TV is a smart TV all you need is your passwords for Netflix or Hulu. 
That's a nice touch to the room.

Text: Hotel is clean. Front desk guys were not helpful or happy to be at work. Breakfast bar was understaffed.
