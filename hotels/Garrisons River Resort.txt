Garrisons River Resort

Text: Efficient staff and good sized rafts. They gave us a raft big for eights people when there was only for Jason we had enough spaces for our coolers and stuff. They also have a pizza delivery service for their cabins which is very cool. The roads to the cabins are very rough and patchy so using a car with with good tires would be a good idea.

Text: Very dated. Stayed in a bungalow. Hated it, bed was an old hard mattress on top of a plywood stand. Covers were dirty. The ladies in the office were not hospitable at all...like give me your money and get out.  Loud music until 1am...lots of marijuana smoking going on. Loud people drunk and carrying on yelling and cursing. Not a very classy place. The only reason for 1 star is because the guys at the pickup were very hospitable and caring. We left a day early because of the reasons stated.

Text: Awesome for arranging amazing float trips on the beautiful, Current River. They also have a huge campground that's equipped for everything from tents to Motor Homes, a great pool if you don't want to swim in the river at the campground and they even have Cabins and a small store for some necessities.

Text: The Worst place in the world!!!! Please do not go here... very rude... horrible experience on a wonderful family vacation... this is the only bad review I have EVER written... I'm am normally a very optimistic/benifit of the doubt person... I will not go into detail on what happen... just know, you have been warned... spend your money at a place that actually cares...

Text: I've been to garrisons 3 different times. Every time has been a great time. Staff is helpful and nice. Check in is fast and simple. Lots to do on the grounds. They offer great prices and the new rafts are great. See you in July!
