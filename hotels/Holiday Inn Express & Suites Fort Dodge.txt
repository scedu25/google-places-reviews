Text: Working overnight. We always stay here it's the nicest hotel in town. They are always extremely accommodating going The extra mile to make sure we're comfortable. I didn't get the gals name at the front desk but she is very nice and actually spent about 15 minutes explaining the best places to eat.

Text: Super nice hotel! Everything is new and fresh.. The room was huge, and it had a full kitchen (everything but an oven!). I have paid 3 times as much for less in other hotels.
