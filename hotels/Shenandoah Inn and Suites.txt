Text: Cozy little spot that was close to where I was working. Took a business card because I'll be out this way again. Rooms are nice and the lady at the desk was so sweet.

Text: Gal at the desk was very nice. I have trouble sleeping without a fan and haven't found very many hotels that offer one but they were very quick to get me one. Super clean and right in the heart of downtown couple bars within walking distance.

Text: I woke up with a line of bites on my right arm, turned it in to the front desk. Nobody contacted me about it or moved to another room.  Hoping it's not bedbugs
