Text: This was my first time as a guest at this hotel. The staff was great, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, and I couldn't expect much more. I had some noisy neighbors upstairs but that wasn't really the hotel's fault. I will definitely stay here again.

Text: They let people drink in the breakfast area all hours of the night. Which I didnt like to walk up to check in and my son to see. Other than that it was a good place.

Text: This is another good place. Great swimming indoor pool for kids under 10& under. We were here over the weekend and it was packed Friday and Saturday nights. Our room was next to the elevator, so we got the main crowd in the hallway.
