Edelweiss Guest House

Text: We stayed here for my boyfriends birthday and everything was great!  They made him feel special, helped us get around town and then let us know if we needed anything they would be close but they wouldn't bother us.. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable..  I would recommend this place to anyone!!

Text: Definitely a unique experience. You're staying in one of three guest rooms in the house of a lovely couple. They maintain a professional vibe while giving you a local experience that a conventional hotel can't offer.

Text: The folks running the place are awesome.  The bedroom was nice.  The bathroom needed some work.  The workmanship was shoddy in our bathroom.  The biggest problem is that the bathroom doesn't have a shower and the bathtub  jets are a little discolored so they appear dirty.  Also, the hot water is luke warm so taking a bath was not a pleasant experience.

Text: Great little bed and breakfast. We had the place to ourselves. Their breakfast is a  fantastic three plate beginning to your day.

Text: Fantastic experience! Lovely people! We were greeted at check in with a glass of wine and suggestions on things to visit in town during our stay. Then after a little relaxing we were shown our rooms. This is great for a romantic weekend for a couple or a couple's weekend with friends! 

I was blown away by the individuality of each room but the Miss Noelle room was just breathtaking to me! 

Will totally be back for another trip and can't wait!
