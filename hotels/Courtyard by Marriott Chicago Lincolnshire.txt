Text: We stayed in a double queen suite. Room was clean, hotel was quiet and clean, an for an extra $10 included breakfast from the Bisto. Staff was friendly. Beds were comfortable. The pool area, decor, and all else was nice and made me feel like I was in a more expensive place. Great value!

Text: Solid hotel choice. Nothing to complain about, except maybe that the bed was a bit too soft. Really convenient location for the nearby corporate office parks and good food options nearby. Friendly and helpful staff
