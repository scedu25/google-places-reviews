Sonesta ES Suites Cincinnati - Sharonville East
Rating: 5
Text: This was a great and accommodating place! Beautiful, clean rooms, the breakfast was simple but delicious, hot, and prepared with love. I brought my whole youth group here and the staff served them with excellence.
ONLY complaint (not really a huge problem) is the fitness center. It pretty much consisted of two treadmills and a some sort of stepping machine. No weights, but nonetheless, it was a fantastic stay.

Text: This was an affordable place to stay with a kitchenette. We only stayed one night but the service was great, rooms were clean and quiet.

Text: We stayed @ Sonesta for our family vacation in Cincinnati.  The free breakfasts and dinners were great, however one of our daughters is highly gluten sensitive and could not eat most of the food offered.  When Theresa - the hotel manager - heard about this, she DROVE to a restaurant and purchased my daughter a gluten free dinner to eat. We thought this warranted a 5-star review, but then for the remainder of our week's stay, Theresa purchased breakfasts and dinners from multiple different restaurants and delivered them to our 7-year-old daughter @ meal times.  WOW!  This level of customer service and care completely floored us and we would HIGHLY recommend Sonesta as the place to stay.

Text: This place was an absolute joy to stay at. The front desk staff were very friendly and informative so that checking in was a breeze. The suite was very big for the price we paid and it was amazing. Fully stocked kitchenette, new furniture and a beautiful aesthetic made our stay here one of the best I've had in any hotel ever. My wife and I will definitely be coming back to Sonesta again.
