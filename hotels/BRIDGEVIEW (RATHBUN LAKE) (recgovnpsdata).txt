BRIDGEVIEW (RATHBUN LAKE) (recgovnpsdata)

Text: Had a great time camping. Campground is nice and well taken care of. Close to the lake and there's even a sandbar that you can walk to (if you don't mind walking through some tall grass.) My one complaint is that the bathrooms have no ventilation, which means they are very hot and humid.

Text: It was cold and raining and couldn't get refunded from paying with cash couldn't get for over 90 days but if it was a debit or credit would have been back on within hrs. That's not right
