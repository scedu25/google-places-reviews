Text: First time staying at this brand hotel. The staff was friendly and quick to get me checked in. The room was very clean and the beds were neat. I like the room's wall mounted nightstand and TV and the occupancy switches throughout. They made the room look more tidy and advanced. The bathroom was clean also but the water tasted a little odd. I was missing a shampoo so I washed my hair with the bar soap. Breakfast was to be expected as it was similar to other chains.

Text: If you're ok not having a pool, this hotel is the best value & service you will find. Super nice folks working there, the rooms are spotless, and their breakfast is outstanding , both in selection and quality.  Loved this place!??

Text: I have no complaints. It was clean and quiet,  and those are high on my priority list!
We checked in late and turned in shortly after so we weren't there long. 
Bed was comfy enough. We had one small issue with our bed linen, but it was resolved quickly. 
Breakfast wasn't anything special, but it was  nice to have the option.  I'd stay overnight again.
