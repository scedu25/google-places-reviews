Text: Great experience. We booked a couple rooms here very late at night, and the staff was excellent and very accommodating. The rooms were very nice, and well maintained. They also had a great continental breakfast, with many food options to choose from. I would definitely stay here again, fantastic!

Text: Great value. Clean and well-maintained facility. Hot breakfast and dinner included in room price. We have been staying there over a four year period during the Indiana State Fair. We will certainly return.
