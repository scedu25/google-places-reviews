Text: Nice small rv park out in the country.  The family that owns the property are super nice and accommodating.  They are new owners so they are learning as they go.  They have a few farm animals and my children really enjoyed feeding them.  They also have plenty of picnic tables and offer use of their childrens swingset to those with youngsters.  Milford lake is only about a 5min drive, boat ramps a little further.  Not too far off the highway, but enough to give you that country feel for sure.
