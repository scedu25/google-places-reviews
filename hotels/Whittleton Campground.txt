Whittleton Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Second time camping at this campground and both experiences have been good. Our site was right on the creek and it's awesome to fall asleep to the sound of a babbling brook. Sites are close together and open so not real private. Depending on your neighbors, you could have noise issues, but that's true of any campground. Had no issues with the shower house. Hot water and cleaned daily and a washer and dryer to boot. The gate attendant left at 5 each day so we had to drive to get get ice and wood, but it's not far. We will be back!

Text: A nice campground. Nice site on the creek with plenty of shade. All sites pretty open so no privacy here. Nice picnic table and fire pit. Long walk to the bathroom and shower. Bathrooms were clean and showers were hot. If you stay a site 35 make sure to bring an extension cord for your RV. Power source is about 50' away from the concrete pad. Water hookup at every site. Had very good pressure. Lot of foot traffic due to hiking trail that begins at the end of the road to the sites. Rangers pass by a couple times but other than that didn't see any other park staff on duty other than the person at the front check in. Had an issue with a few campsites the first night getting all their alcohol stolen from their coolers that were sitting outside the campers. Other than that no other issues.

Text: Beautiful camping grounds (RV & Tent) at inexpensive prices and very close to the main resort. Also had several trails starting from the campground and near by. Full bathrooms with hot showers and a coin operated washer/dryer.
