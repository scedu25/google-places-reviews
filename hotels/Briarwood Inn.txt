Text: Worst customer service that I have ever heard of in my life!  Made a reservation in April for a 2 night stay in November.  Called 2 days before with a message that reservation never went through and no rooms would be available.  When I called the manager (and I admit I was irate) he hung up on me!  When I called back he yelled at me and told me that I did indeed have a room, that there had been an error.  Why didn't he call back earlier to tell me to disregard the earlier message, right?  Next day, called and asked for owner and told "he isn't working here" and hung up.  I have never experienced such unprofessional customer service in my life!

Text: Reserved a room in April through Expedia for August 21.  Notified July 20 it was cancelled.  No reason given.  Eclipse event so by then all sold out.  Sure this Hotel charged a lot more than what they were willing to rent to room to me for back in April.  Beware of Expedia.  They should not tolerate this!  This should be a Minus 5 stars.
