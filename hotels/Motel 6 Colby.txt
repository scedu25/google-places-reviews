Motel 6 Colby
Rating: 4
Text: Motel is very convenient to restaurants and the interstate. Pet friendly. I have been staying at this motel for the past two years and they now have wood floors in the rooms, a very nice bed and flat screen TV. Rooms are very well lit. Perfect room for my needs without spending a ton of money. The shower seems to be a little slow for some reason but does the job with abundant hot water. The only thing that I would like to see at this motel is that the back door into the parking lot were more secure, the door is unlocked all night and not monitored. The back parking lot could also be better lit. The motel backs up to an open area which is perfect for airing the dogs.

Text: We stayed here one night while traveling through to Colorado. Rooms were quite clean.  Linen and towels were fresh. Room was cool when we got there but warmed right up. This was a pretty good place for being no frills. I would stay again.

Text: Nice and clean updated rooms. Beds were a little noisy but comfy. Staff was friendly, location was great ( right off the interstate), restaurants and entertainment was within walking distance. Don't let the outside appearance fool you, the inside is clean and updated.
