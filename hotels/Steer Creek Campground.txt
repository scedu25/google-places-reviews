Steer Creek Campground

Text: I love this place! If the winds and temperature are favorable, when you enter the campground you can smell the pine trees. Forget about your cell phone no signal to be found, yes its pretty remote. We have encountered a few people in the past, but for the most part you are alone with you thoughts and companions. This is by far my favorite campground in Nebraska.
