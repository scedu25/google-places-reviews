Americas Best Value Inn Beardstown

Text: This is a under-cared for establishment. The staff seems to have a very lackadaisical approach to interacting with patrons, cleaning, and managing the facilities. This could be a decent place to stay but it's not cleaned effectively. During my stay, the fire alarms went off at 11pm, then 1am, then 2am, then 3:30am...absolutely unacceptable. The night prior I had to listen to unruly guests having some sort of party at 3am. The staff seem to lack control within their own establishment. I would recommend staying elsewhere, but if you need to stay in Beardstown your options are limited.

Text: I have stayed at several Abv hotels and had great stays and luck with them. But the beards town location needs some work,it was 200 degrees when you walked in the door to check in and the room was that way for the first hour. They had just turned the rooms air on,semi clean. Pool was closed.  I think next time I will look in to the budget inn.

Text: The place neat, nice and clean. Big issue I found was breakfast only has cereal.
