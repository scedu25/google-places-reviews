LaSada Sporting Clays and Hunting Service
Rating: 5
Text: Outstanding!! Really cannot say enough about Scott and the experience he provided. My dad, brother and I had never pheasant hunted before but he was patient, informative, and just an all around good guy. We had 3 limits of birds in just over 3 hours and we missed the first 5 he flushed!! After the hunt the lunch that was served was also phenomenal. All around the single greatest guide experience we've ever had and cannot wait to come back.
