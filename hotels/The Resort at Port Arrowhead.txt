The Resort at Port Arrowhead
Rating: 1
Text: We stayed at cheaper hotels for the week while vacationing at Osage Beach. For the last night we decided to stay at a resort thinking it would be a lot nicer than where we had been. What a mistake! 

We woke up to them banging on the pipes at 9am. The only pool that was open was the kiddie pool so 3ft or 3.5ft. No hot tub or adult pool. There was no water pressure in the shower and then it was turned completely off. I called the front desk and she said they had an emergency and had to turn off all the water,  it would be turned back on within the next 30min.  

When I voiced my concerns while turning in the room keys, the only thing that the manager said was "thanks for the feedback".  

What a disappointment! Save the extra bucks and stay at quality inn!

Text: Recently renovated. Room was clean. Bathroom small and didn't have great water pressure. Indoor pool, but open patio so you can still get sun. Fitness room still under construction. Friendly staff and decent Continental breakfast.  Not far from outlet mall in Osage Beach.  No lounge or bar at this resort.
