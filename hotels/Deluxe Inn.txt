Rating: 5
Text: Deluxe inn is the most Cleanest Motel i have ever stayed at. As far as the Price, I've been there for over a year & a half. Nobody has ever bothered me, they do daily cleaning witch is great. Cable TV, free Internet. I haven't had any Problems living there, i would recommend the motel to anyone.
