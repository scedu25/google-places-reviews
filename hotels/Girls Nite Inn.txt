Text: We usually stay at GNI over Memorial Day weekend for at least 5 years now. Love the owners ~ so accommodating! We love the closeness to the Katy Trail and downtown Rocheport. The house is super clean and very well stocked of goodies! Highly recommend this lil' gem.

Text: We were having a rough time on a katy trail excursion. For reasons unforeseeable all the food and lodging along our pay that day had been closed. We made it into Rocheport around 5pm and I tried to book a night's stay online. It took about 45 minutes for them to get back with me and my group had decided to continue up the trail already. I didn't get to stay here, but I can sat that their customer service is wonderful. These ladies are friendly and responsive!  They refunded the $100 room deposit without any hassle because it was such short notice.
