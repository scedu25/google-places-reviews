America's Best Inn & Suites - Emporia
Rating: 1
Text: I would encourage you to keep driving by this hotel!  Dirty rooms, unkept, linens hadn’t been changed on our bed, rude staff!!  Would not refund our money after we saw our room, complained and wanted to leave!!   Left and checked in at another hotel and just took the loss!  Worst hotel I have ever been to!!  If I could give them a negative rating, I would!!

They lost my reservation. Called 2 months in advance. Then they had the gaul to blame it on me. The rate was quoted at one price for the lost reservation, then they said they had a room available but the price was 75% higher than the quoted amount.   We called around an got a better room for less money at the Rodeway Inn which shares the same parking lot. If the lobbies are an example of room quality, I made a great decision.

Text: No door on the bathroom. Water never gets cold. A/C blocked by the curtain. Cost for the room is way too much!!! This is a $20.00 room. Had someone watch me take my luggage in my room that worked here.

Text: Price for room wasn't comparable to other rooms reviewd online. Rating was overstated online. I would pass and go.somewhere else.Old, pricey based on other local hotels.

Text: The bathroom had ants, the tub would fill up with water while showering, on the plus side the AC worked. 
I was one of the first to get breakfast, only to find 3 bagels, 4 pieces of bread and 1/4 pitcher of OJ, im not sure if they were just being conservative or just short on everything.
If your looking to sleep and go it's okay, but dont expect much more...save your breakfast dreams for McDonalds.
