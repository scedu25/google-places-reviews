Text: My only complaint would be only 1 washcloth in a double bed room, so I had to use a hand towel. But on the bright side, my back is really clean! Everything else about this room is super clean.

Text: I always stay here when I visit my family in Pittsburg. The rooms are nice and clean with a pretty color scheme and big,  quality furniture. There is a great little liquor store less than a quarter mile away and lots of restaurants just a bit further down. The WiFi signal is strong enough to support PS4 gaming and the flat screen TV is HUGE!! The folks up front are friendly and helpful. All around great place to stay. They even have room for a full sized tractor trailer around back, which is great for us, since my husband and I are professional drivers. I highly recommend the Regency Inn. Great job, guys!
