Text: We really enjoyed our stay in Oak Room #5 at the Patchwork Inn in the month of October. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were super soft. The shower pressure was really good.  I really appreciated the lighting in the bathroom. It was great for  doing my makeup. I don't think the listing for this room mentions access to the front balcony which we really took advantage of. It was my favorite part of our stay. We felt like we had the place to ourselves. The only time we saw other guests was at breakfast. We did hear the other guests sometimes; as Steph the innkeeper said, the floors talk. We use a sound machine so it wasn't a problem and we only occasionally heard people walking around. The inn was built in the 1800s years so it was easy to hear movement. We really enjoyed the adorable back patio with picnic benches and a little garden area. They have a really cool metal sculpture of a bull that is also a grill. Seems like a fun feature for the summer. The innkeepers have beer and wine available at a very reasonable price and a surprisingly large selection -  a lot of craft beers, some Belgians and Bud Light. $2 for a beer and about $12 for a bottle of Chardonnay. The breakfast is rather large. We enjoyed it our first morning but the second morning had to split a plate. It was our first time at a bed & breakfast so we were unsure of what to expect on the breakfast aspect.

Text: This place is great. It's operated by some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. Breakfast was delicious. The rooms are cozy, and as a previous reviewer wrote, the sheets are incredibly soft. The little details like remembering my name or the fresh baked cookies left in the room are the reason I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. The cost is comparable to that of a Holiday Inn but the stay is much more pleasant.
