Text: Worst experience ever!! My Jacuzzi king suite reservation was denied 4 weekends in a row. Manager finally paid for me to stay at a motel in the next town. Never again will I book at a Days Inn!! Rated at a negative 9!

Text: We love it when we come here. Its quiet and relaxing with a friendly staff. Kim, Amber, and Jeffrey are the friendliest staff that we've ever come across at any Days Inn

Text: We arrived at 8:20pm on a Tuesday night. It took two times of me calling "hellooooo" for the surly front desk person to come from the back office.  She checked us in and got our room keys.  She then said, "I'll go with you to make sure the room really isn't occupied."  (That should have been the point I turned around and left.)  We went to the room; the door was ajar and a light was on.  She walked in, glanced around, returned to the hallway and looked one way, then the other.  She said, "it's empty".  We moved past the boxes piled near the door and went in, and quickly bolted the door.  The decorating was interesting; lime green wall, yellow flower bedspreads. The TV was askew, at an odd angle.  One lightbulb above the vanity was blown out.  There was this stain/hole above the shower. Had we not needed to sleep and leave early in the a.m., we would have gone elsewhere.  Although the people shooting off Roman candles outside the window was quite noisy, we slept and left.  Two positives: the morning front desk clerk was nice, listened to my complaints.  And the toilet paper was two-ply.  I'll never return.

Text: Uniquely flawed but cozy and welcoming. Wednesday night dinners and every morning  breakfast were wonderful.
