Text: Love love love this place! Have previously stayed in the Turkey Ridge Cottage with the kids, and just returned from 4 fall nights at the Line Camp Cabin. The peace and solitude was just what we were looking for, with  time to reconnect and recharge away from all of life's distractions. Kathy & Tom are great hosts and operate a top notch, pet friendly establishment. Hated to leave and are already checking out dates to return!
