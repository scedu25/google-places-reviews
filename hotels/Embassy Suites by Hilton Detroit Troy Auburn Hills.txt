Embassy Suites by Hilton Detroit Troy Auburn Hills
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel staff is really friendly. The breakfast is really good and fresh. The on-site gym is clean and there different machines and weights to use. The only issue I have with the hotel is the decor is old. If the hotel had a makeover and was more modern that would for sure make it a 5 star. Overall it’s a good hotel.

Text: I had a great stay. The front desk clerks were extremely helpful and friendly. The place was always clean. I appreciated that the fitness room had weightlifting equipment in addition to the treadmills. I also liked that they had a full hot breakfast bar and free drinks and snacks in the evening. Definitely coming back.

Text: Love embassy suites and this one has the best service of any we have ever stayed at! We have a large family with 6 kids so the 2 room suite is always fantastic. Everyone that works at this location seems to really care that you are happy. The pool area could use a face lift but it was clean and the kids loved it. Highly recommend.

Text: Great service, complimentary drinks (*3 per drinking age guest). Loved the pool, which was open to midnight. Amazing free breakfast. Dining on-site. The hotel experience was so great, we are hunting for things in the area to visit again.

Text: Truly loved it.  The staff was awesome. There was an issue with the reservation and the manager assisted by going beyond my expectations. One of the best Embassy Suites I have visited in a while.  The atmosphere was top notch.
