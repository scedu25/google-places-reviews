Admiral Bicknell Inn
Rating: 5
Text: The location of the inn in New Albany, IN is close enough to Louisville for convenience, but far enough away for a relaxed, small-town feel. New Albany was very charming with many good restaurants and historical features. The Inn was comfortable, low-key, and beautifully decorated, creating a wonderful atmosphere for our anniversary getaway. Melissa, the owner, was always available and responsive to questions. The room was well appointed with a private bathroom. Snacks and coffee/tea were always available and the pool was refreshing on a hot Summer day. I highly recommend the Admiral Bicknell Inn.

Text: They had great Service from the time I walked in, to the time I left. They had great tasting food and the rooms were nice and clean. The bathroom was clean and had the usual stuff for guests like the shampoo and towels. The front desk attendant was nice and she was fast, she knew what she was doing, she got me to my room in no time. Over all, the stay was great I would personally prefer it to other people who want a great night at a nice INN compared to others.

Text: The Inn seemed very well taken care of, clean, and organized. The staff was polite and orderly. I attended a professional event there and, after never having personally been there before, would recommend to anyone looking to book or stay the night.

Text: It was a neat little history thing to visit, I was only there for a few minutes for Pokemon Go, but I stayed a minute and enjoyed my surroundings.

Text: The new owners of the Admiral Bicknell are lovely,  though today it is more residence than event space.
