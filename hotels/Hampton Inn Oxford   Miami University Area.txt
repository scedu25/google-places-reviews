Hampton Inn Oxford / Miami University Area
Rating: 5
Text: Nicest, most comfortable Hampton I've ever stayed in.  The rooms are exquisite--super clean with comfortable beds and silky sheets. It helps that it was built recently (2012 or so).  Hard to believe it's located in a college town in rural Ohio!

Text: Stayed for homecoming weekend at Miami. Nice rooms, good location near a bar, cvs, and restaurant. Walking distance to uptown. Breakfast was great with a lot of choices.

Text: The room was clean and the beds were soft. The staff were helpful and also recommended nearby restaurants. Only downside was smallish rooms with little more than just two beds (No fridge, balcony, etc.)

Text: I am an employee at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Richmond Indiana so I am very much  familiar with hotels. When I checked into the Hampton here in Oxford I was surprise to find that the bed had been remade with dirty sheets and there appeared to be poop on the shower head. Yes poop... I went to the front desk to get clean sheets where I found the front desk employees on their phones relaxing in the lobby. No one offered to clean the shower and only gave us clean sheets to make the bed ourselves. Now I know that at our Hampton in Richmond this would have NEVER been okay! I was told that the manager would be back on Monday before I checked out. Today is Monday and they informed me that she isn't here and will not be back until Tuesday. Keep in mind I have allowed housekeeping in twice and the poop is still on the shower head. I am VERY upset and will not return or refer anyone to this Hampton. Which is sad because it is a nice building in a nice area.
