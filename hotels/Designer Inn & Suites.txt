Text: The staff is very friendly and courteous. 
I got to take a quick peek at a fantasy suite, amazing!
I stayed in a standard room.  It was nice  and very clean, they offer some extra with there rooms a lot of others don't. I stay in several hotels through the week. I walked into this room pleased. I took a shower first thing I see large full size plush towels. Thank you! That's not a hotel norm.

Text: It's not a 5 star in that it's not a resort type place but it's very clean, I think they use softened water, it's quiet and comfortable. I recommend this place if you are in the area. Pool is currently closed so check that out if you want a pool.

Text: Artistically crafted fantasy rooms well as standard motel rooms available. Friendly & helpful staff gave me a tour of the rooms which were very clean & well maintained! Romantic getaway with swimming pool, exercise room & super continental breakfast AND close to the casino... ? value!

Text: I stayed in room 221 Friday night and came home covered in bed bug bites! DO NOT stay here unless you enjoy miserably itching and want to chance bringing the bugs home! I called the hotel. The woman who answered was very nice and said a manager would be in touch. I'm requesting a full refund.. if these bugs came home with me, it will NOT be the last they hear from me!

Text: Location was great. Like leads than five minutes from the casino. And way cheaper.
