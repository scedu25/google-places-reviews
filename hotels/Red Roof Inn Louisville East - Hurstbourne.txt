Red Roof Inn Louisville East - Hurstbourne
Rating: 5
Text: Had an excellent stay at the Red Roof Inn. The renovations and updates were modern and use of the space was really well done. Big fan of the vinyl wood floors as opposed to the carpet. Gave it an extra feel of cleanliness.

Text: Nice room for the price. Dog friendly and clean. Both are important to us. Nice staff. Night check in window not visible to parking lot, not the safest but we would definitely stay there again!

Text: How embarrassing, my card was declined because the front desk wasnt putting the right security code in the credit card machine. I had to call my bank to see why it was declined. Soon as I get off the phone magically my card works. I get to my room and find stains in one of the beds and had to get another room.. $88 for this? Never again. I wish I could post the pictures of the nasty bed sheets.
