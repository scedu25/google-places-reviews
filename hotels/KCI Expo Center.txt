Text: I have recently visited the KCI Expo center for a gun show. The event space was very spacious with plenty of restrooms and adequate parking. They also have a small cafe which is better than a vending machine.

Text: Attended a gun show here, nice large open space, ample parking. It's a convention center, not exciting but it's well maintained and lit, what else do you need?

Text: Located at the very North edge of Kansas City makes this expo center easy to get to from the airport, or one of the few interstates that are nearby. Ample parking, and places to eat close by make this an easy spot to spend the day during expo's or other events.
