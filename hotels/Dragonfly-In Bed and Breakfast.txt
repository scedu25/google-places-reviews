Dragonfly-In Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had an incredible time at the beautiful Dragonfly Inn! We ended up here by chance on a family vacation after our original plans at a VRBO cabin fell through last minute  (septic system issues on arrival!). Linda saved our vacation by working with us to get us lodged that same night! The property is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in the Vincent Lodge cabin and enjoyed hikes, fishing, swimming, canoeing, kayaking and paddleboating, ping pong, bon fires and late nights on the screened in porch playing cards, all without leaving the property! What a peaceful retreat! Nestled on a mountainside we felt secluded and miles away from our hectic lives, yet good food, groceries, and even more recreational activities are just a short drive away (Johnson's Shut-Ins and Elephant Rock State Park are very close and a must-visit for any outdoor enthusiast!).  We have been married 27 years with 4 kids, a daughter and son-in-law and a grandbaby and this is the first family vacation where we simply were not ready to come home. The private lodge was beautiful, modern, clean and super spacious, the lake right out our front door was beautiful and Linda and her staff are so kind and helpful. Book with confidence,  if you want a fun, relaxing, secluded but conveniently located cabin retreat, THIS IS IT!

Text: I had my wedding here last year and it was wonderful!!! Not only is this one of the most beautiful properties I've ever visited but the prices and accommodations were pretty fantastic too. The service was nothing but friendly and constantly worked with me to help make the wedding planning even easier. My husband and I are already planning our next stay at the Dragonfly and will surely have other future visits too as this venue also doubles as a great vacationing spot as well.
