Text: This is absolutely a great place to live. Peaceful and Mostly Quiet. On occasion there will be a disrespectful group of people who like to party and make noise, but this is NOT a frequent event. Mostly, I enjoy the staff. They are very friendly and helpful. Unlike the last place I lived. Errrrrr...

Text: Park manager is extremely rude when I asked for corporates number the first time she said it's their policy that they can't hand it out. I even recorded a video the second time. An hour an 10 minutes before they close I went in asking for corporates number and a copy of their rules and regulations she began to.say she was leaving in 10 minutes but I see no reason why she can't give me the rules and regulations in that amount of time. If anyone has corporates number id greatly appreciate it. I highly recommend this park finds a new manager before people start moving since we as adults can't have a guest at our house for more then an hour without being harassed!!!

Text: Manager is rude and will not help out residents' problems. Potholes and messed up sidewalks need fixed but no one will do anything. Crime is coming over from Connie Jean Crossing and manager will not extend fence in between properties to prevent it. Manager favors some tenants while treating the others unfairly. Not a good place to live. Please don't waste your time there.
