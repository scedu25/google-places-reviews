Text: If you are searching for a spotlessly clean Kansas B&B located in a quaint small town (Buhler), with a host and hostess that will instantly treat you like family, provide a comfortable bed (3 uniquely decorated rooms), and a scrumptious breakfast following your great rest, search no more!  Innkeepers, Becky and Tracy Spencer, provide a warm (Christian) atmosphere to every guest now that their own 8 children have "left the nest".  It has been my pleasure to enjoy four special nights at the Grand Staff B&B, with a fifth visit scheduled this November (2015).  Two of my four visits has been with a group of several women, as is the fifth scheduled occasion.  So, whether you are an individual, a couple, group of friends, or small family looking for a place to have a reunion,, it is my honor to recommend the Grand Staff to you.  ENJOY!
