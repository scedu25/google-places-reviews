Econo Lodge Lansing - Leavenworth

Text: Clean room, and friendly staff. Worst complaints include a tub drain that didn't stop, and some minor chips in the tub. With that said, it appears major maintenance is either pending or in progress. Bed was comfortable, water pressure was excellent and was hot enough. I would definitely consider staying here again if in the area. Hotel is fully non-smoking, and lacks an elevator.

Text: For the price we had an excellent stay here. Will definitely stay here again the next time! This is not a luxury hotel. If you are on a budget this is the place to stay.  Clean rooms, quiet, continental breakfast, Iron and ironing board, LCD TV and fast internet (no slow down at night) I made reservations with Linda who comes on at 5: pm, she is so friendly and down to earth! I will wait till 5 to make my reservations from now on. She knows the area and gives good directions. I met the owner when checking out who was very appreciative of my business and thanked me as well.

Text: Stayed here after a wedding we attended in Lansing, KS. Very friendly staff, but our room's bathroom floor was not very clean and items remained in the mini-fridge from previous guest. I suppose for the value recieved, I can't complain too much. They do give you a 20% off coupon for IHOP (located next door) which was a nice gesture.

Text: This is what they don't show you in a picture a big ass hole in one room  the hallway smell like some weird moldy water infested hallway to cover it up with some type of spray that smells like hairspray the windows don't have screens on them so you can't open them up without having bugs flying into the room  smells like curry in the lobby obviously they live here also The only good thing about this hotel is that there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance then I had to come back to the hotel just stay another week and they harassed me about the review I gave good maybe they should tell people about the hotel hole when they check it instead of letting them assume they need to be mature and adult about this stop making there are guest feel uncomfortable

Text: This is an excellent hotel to stay at. The staff and cleanliness are above par. They are pet friendly. This is the only hotel I like to stay at in Leavenworth/Lansing.  I have stayed here on numerous occasions over the past 9 years and will continue to stay at this hotel if the need arises.
