Text: We just spent  4 nights at State Street Inn B&B and we were very pleased with everything.  The owners, Sandra and Al, are very welcoming and accommodated to all our needs.  The rooms were all uniquely decorated with a nice touch of the past with modern day amenities.  Whether a single person, couple looking for weekend getaway, or a big family suite, they have rooms for all sizes. Our suite had a private bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub.  The building has so much history that I found myself imagining all the people who have passed through in the past.  The breakfast was very tasty.  Everything was organic and if you had a special request, all we had to do was ask.   The great thing was that there was no time frame for breakfast as we heard is standard at some B & B.  Al and Sandra were very respectful of our time.  This was our first stay at a B & B and weren't sure what to expect.  They made us feel comfortable. We felt as though we had known them for years.    The State St Inn has plenty of movies that can be watched in the lounge, as well as a fireplace to add to the atmosphere.  Netflix was in the rooms as well if you wanted some private time.  Our visit was in August and it was hot and humid outside. The room temperature, as well as, building was cool and relaxing.  Free Hi-speed internet was also a great convenience too.   If you are ever in the area and need a place to stay, don't drive to a chain hotel 30 minutes away, stay at a place where you are treated like a friend.  And the price is very reasonable.  I will be a return customer and hope you will have as great a stay we did .
