Gibson City Inn
Rating: 4
Text: I stayed one night last week at the Gibson City Inn for the very low rate of $51.  It had just changed owners 10 days before and already the new owners had made a good start in their plans to completely repair and refurbish this small motel.  While there was nothing fancy about it, it was clean and all the advertised and necessary items were there and working well.  The bed was comfortable and offered a good night's sleep.

This is obviously a family business and one with plans to make it a much better facility in the future.  The office was staffed with extremely friendly and welcoming people, giving personal service with a big smile.
If you're looking for an inexpensive alternative to the usual interstate chain motel, in a small-town atmosphere . . . you should try the Gibson City Inn.

Text: I would give this a 1 star but apparently the owner was nice. But the room had mold, the electric outlets were so out of date they didn't have grounds and my phone charger fell out of the socket. The bathroom had terrible paint. I at first thought it didn't have any at all on one wall. The entry door barely closed. No dead bolt just the lock on the door knob which didn't work very well. I probably could've pushed the door open when it was "locked".
