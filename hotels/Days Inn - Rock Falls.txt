Text: 2 families stayed here and we all had same kind of rooms however charged $40 difference in rooms. Our room had spider webs you could tell had been there awhile. Killed 3 spiders and had 2 more in room in morning. Then when we brushed teeth noticed ants or small bugs crawling around bathroom mirrors. Curtains stained  horrible on window with dead bugs in window sill.  Reported all of this to front with ok we will look into it. Should have went to Holiday Inn express for this price. The price in line was not the price given either.

Text: Came to visit my girlfriend and daughter and was given an extremely small room after requesting a larger room to accomidate the three of us. Continuous banging of doors all hours of the day, room keys continuously failing, outside door never locked to prevent NON RESIDENTS FROM ENTERING, air conditioner hardly kept the room cool.
