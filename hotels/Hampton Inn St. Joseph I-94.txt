Hampton Inn St. Joseph I-94
Rating: 5
Text: Visiting st. Joe is something we do fairly often as a family in the summer and into early fall, seeing as I grew up there so I like to go back home and bring my kids. However, the town has grown significantly and is very touristy in the summer months. Finding a place to stay without spending tons of money is hard to do. The Hampton Inn has helped us be able to come there and afford to actually do other things. It's affordable, their breakfast is amazing, which would three kids saves us a lot of money in itself, the staff is always very helpful, and can usually squeeze Us in last minute. Also the Hilton Rewards help because you get a free night stay after a certain amount of stays. Which if it wasn't for them I would have never known about it. Everything is clean and I feel comfortable staying there with my daughter who has a lot of medical issues and I'm usually weary of staying in hotels with her. They are always accommodating. I highly recommend them as somewhere to stay that's not overly expensive! We will be back!

Text: Hampton Inn was fantastic. Only draw back was that the keys are still cards versus the locks controlled from the app. Stay was perfect!!

Text: Good location that was close to our event at St. Joseph High School. The room was quite nice, with comfortable beds and a fair amount of room. Very nice looking bathroom that was well functioning. Service was good. Breakfast was decent at best, with rubbery eggs and lukewarm sausage.
