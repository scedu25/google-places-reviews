Super 8 Lexington Winchester Rd

Text: Great stay for the price. Clean, vet comfortable rooms, super friendly and helpful staff. Not a beautiful hotel, but we just were there to sleep. The mattresses and pillows were some of the most comfortable I've had even at much fancier hotels. It deserves a 5 star for a Super 8. I'm not comparing it to a Hilton.

Text: I paid over $100 a night for a room with broken flooring that would pinch your feet, the bathroom was not clean at all there was hair in the tub the cap to a razor and dried urine all over the commode, there was bugs in the room, the refrigerator was garbage and the walls had holes and smeared dirt on them. This room was not even worth $30 a night. You get a better deal at the Lexington Motor Inn for $50 a night. We will never stay here again!

Text: The room wasn't bad, but it's the old woman working behind the desk that is the problem. She is as mean as a snake. She didn't smile, didn't ask how our night was going and made just trying to get a room after a day of traveling very unpleasant. Beware if going in here and having to deal with her, she will make you feel extremely unwelcome.

Text: Dingy smelling room, one of our beds was not made with no sheets.  Guy at front desk said he had no clean sheets and face me a comforter.  Lucky for me I was camping the next day and had a sleeping bag.  Finally get settled in and went to the bathroom to discover our bathroom light didn't work.  It was cheap but it's also a dump.

Text: We stayed here on Oct 10 2017 the room was not very clean. the tub was dirty, had no plug to hold water and the drain was full of hair -- had a bad odor and water ran out slowly - stay at the Microtel just down the street. we stayed at the Microtel on Oct 16 2017 on our trip back through - nice and clean and about the same price
