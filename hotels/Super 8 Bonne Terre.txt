Text: My husband and I have done business with this hotel several times. Today I received a charge on my bank card from April 2017. Excuse was that it didn't go through. This is November 2017. So basically I am being charged for THEIR mistake 7 months later without any warning or phone call.. We will NEVER do business there again... BEWARE!!! Better watch your cards !!

Text: Clean rooms, super cheap rates, pool looked good although I didn't get in. Wifi worked well. The continental breakfast wasn't that great, but again, for the price I will return if I need to stay another night in Bonne Terre.

Text: Got here last night at 9:30. Travelocity had our reservation all wrong. After spending 45 minutes on the phone I finally had to get a refund from Travelocity. The wonderful assistance manger Cassie gave us the room for the same rate. She could not have been any more compassionate and kind. Made the whole ordeal so pleasant. Great job Cassie!!! Beautiful room! We will be back.
