Hilton Columbus at Easton
Rating: 4
Text: Remodel is lovely but there is no sports bar anymore. We used to love going in there, socialize, shoot pool. The bar is in the middle of the hotel lobby, all white marble, bright lights.  Feels more like a fancy hospital waiting room. Menu changed, also. No sliders, no fries?!?  Very sad.

Text: It's a gorgeous hotel, but some things just don't work as well as you'd hope for something so grandiose. A/C absolutely couldn't get the room below 68, which is really, really annoying. The phone didn't work, had to call the front desk from my cell phone. Staff were fine, but not nearly as friendly as you'd hope. Oh well...

Text: Fairly standard Hilton. The bed was comfortable, the pillows bad, the water pressure was good. I will say that I liked the size of the bathroom, not that I spent that much time in there. The food was decent, the staff friendly and the location was good for me as I wanted to be close to the airport.

Text: It's definitely a nicer hotel. Room and staff seem great. In a good area around lots of shopping and restaurants.

Text: The Hilton at Easton is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The staff is amazing and polite. The pool was very nice and warm and the hot tub felt wonderful. I would absolutely stay at the Hilton at Easton anytime and I would recommend it to everyone.
