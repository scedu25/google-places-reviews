Text: Nice rooms. The entire hotel smelled wonderful of coconuts. The pool was cold and the hot tub jets did not work. So it's just a hot tub, not a jetted hot tub. Overall nice place with not so great night service but very accommodating morning service. Breakfast was good.

Text: We got what we paid for.  Front desk staff was very friendly.  Housekeeping skills need to be improved upon. Asked to have an old spider web removed the day after we arrived, it was still there when we left.   Housekeeping was just sloppy, didn't make the beds the first day, the second day no vacuum was run, and beds not totally made.  Great location for traveling to various attractions.

Text: Location off I 64 convenient.  Lobby personnel very courteous.  Breakfast was adequate.  The room was filthy.  Night tables need a proper polishing.  Carpet very stained even for a pet friendly motel.  Area around the bed, under the desk and along the walls was thick with dust, crumbs and plastic utensils.  We're changing to another motel on our return visit.

Text: 2 stars because it's not the worst room I've had to stay in. Room was not very clean, there was some kind of liquid splashed or spilled down several areas of the walls that never got wiped up, the carpets were in dire need of a good vacuum, build up of dirt on the door, also the door to our room is so thin and crappy, we could hear every single thing in the hallway and from the hallway, you could easily hear everything in our room. Front desk staff was very nice and accomodating. House keepers do the bare minimum.

Text: Staff are friendly. Rooms are clean but are little run down. Bathroom door didn't open all the way as it was dragging across the tile. Location of the hotel is good. You can clearly see it from the highway.
