Text: The land is pretty and big but there isn't a whole lot to do. The rooms are comfy other than a couple bugs here and there. The service is great and I have had no problems.

Text: Beautifully set just outside of Salina. Worked a wedding reception here and was amazed the the transformations they made. I hope I get a chance to go back and get the full experience!
