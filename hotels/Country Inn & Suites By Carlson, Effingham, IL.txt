Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Effingham, IL
Rating: 4
Text: We are fans of Country Inn & Suites. This was our first stay at this location off of I-57. The lobby was cozy. The room was similar to their other locations. Nice TV, comfortable bed. Hot tub remained open late which was nice after a long drive. We left very early, before breakfast buffet. They don't offer a "to go" breakfast. We will return to this location.

Text: Proof that happy employees make for good business. Clean room's, breakfast, pool, and many other pluses made our stay a good way to breakup a long road trip. We thank the staff and management for their hard work. I will be recommending C.I.&S. To any and everyone. It was that good of an experience.

Start off your morning off right with their free hot breakfast. The comfy beds paired with the indoor pool made it easy to relax while traveling. The staff was polite and professional.

Text: I was impressed by the friendly staff, and the snacks, coffee and tea in the lobby. The fitness center had 9 machines, while most places usually have about 3. The only thing i was disapointed by was that there was no water cooler in the fitness room.

Text: This is where I stay and where we send our out of town guests when they come to visit. The employees are professional and very friendly. The rooms are clean, the breakfast is good. The pool is very nice. I highly recommend.
