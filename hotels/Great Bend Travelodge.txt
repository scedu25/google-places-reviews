Text: After the 1st motel I booked at didn't answer the door I came here. Mostly a decent room. Karen was great. I think the pricing was a bit high for 1 adult and 1 kid. The sheets were dirty. There was a plate of half eaten waffles in the microwave and the a.c. knob is broken. I would stay here again though.

Text: I reserved a room on line,  asked specifically for a downstairs room due to the fact I was traveling with a disabled senior. I called to confirm the room as we were close to arriving. 

I was informed by guest services that the only room they had available downstairs was (her exact words) dog fur covered, musty smelling, with  a dirty fridge. If I didn't want that room I could cancel my reservation.. 

Needless to say, I canceled and will never attempt to book a room there again.

Text: The price was fair I thought until... I asked for a nonsmoking room. Clearly smoking in this room, cigarette burns in the comforter, curtains and sheets.  I was grossed out by the stains on the sheets (sheets that didn’t fit the bed) and the Coors beer cans under the bed, and we didn’t drink it.  Something tells me these rooms aren’t thoroughly cleaned!  Breakfast was a bust as well!   Disappointed
