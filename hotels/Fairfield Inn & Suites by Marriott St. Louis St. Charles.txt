Text: Overall a great stay! Only one real complaint for me was the room smelled bad like a damp or humid kinda smell. Others had similar experiences with their room. The parking was great; has a pool and gym. Bed was firm and comfortable for me. Shower was also very hot, however poorly ventilated for how hot the water can get. I didn't use the appliances or TV so can't comment on those. Breakfast was free and variety to choose from. Good experience overall!

Text: Great staff and customer service. Disappointing decor for Marriott chain. Basic small gym, clean pool. Comfy bed, good shower and, unusual but the reason for my choice, the windows open for fresh air.

Text: The kids had a great time feeding all of the animals. Just the right variety at a great price. Safe and well laid out. Perfect afternoon with the family.
