Hampton Inn & Suites East Lansing/Okemos
Rating: 3
Text: The hotel is bright and cheerful. It was very clean and the service was good. The breakfast was adequate, probably average for a non fancy hotel. The bed was not particularly comfortable. It wasn't bad either. I would stay again, it was fine.

Text: Awesome rooms! Awesome staff! Great breakfast! Nice pool! Renovations are underway in part of the hotel but they have made sure it doesn't interfere with your stay and its business as usual.

Text: My stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites was very good. The young woman who checked us in at the lobby desk was very pleasant and gave us a choice of floors. The room was clean and neat with what seemed like an absurd amount of both electrical outlets and USB-A ports for charging older cell phones. The bathroom fixtures, especially the showerhead, were excellent and the water got plenty hot enough. The only points where they could improve are the alarm clock (which was very bright) and the continental breakfast which was the same 'decent' mediocrity that all hotels seem to offer.
