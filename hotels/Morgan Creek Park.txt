Text: Great place to camp. Will be our go-to spot when we go north to visit kids and grandkids. Clean camping spots, and extremely easy on the budget! Public restroom and showers are clean and well-kept. Walking trail there, too, but I didn't get to that. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Text: Great area to walk my dog. He loves to see the deer and  visit the trees. We have arrived several times between 7:00-7:15 and the gates were closed and locked. If 7:00 a.m. is not the correct hour to open please post the correct time. Milo the Magnificent whines terribly when we have to turn around and go to another trail.

Text: Nice park. Make sure you check out the arboretum! Small driveway just up from the park and campground entrances. Every tree, flower, and plant you can imagine and tons of cool trails!!!
