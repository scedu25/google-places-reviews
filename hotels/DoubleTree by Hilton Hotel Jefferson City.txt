DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Jefferson City
Rating: 5
Text: I had a great experience at the DoubleTree by Hilton in Jefferson City. The staff were welcoming and friendly. They got me a room promptly, despite arriving well before the normal check-in time. The immediately recognized my HHonors Rewards status, provided me with the signature DoubleTree cookie and got me in exceptionally fast. Be sure to visit their penthouse restaurant/bar, Sapphire's. It has great views of the Capitol. The location of the hotel is great. Close to everything. It was a good experience and I would stay there again!

Text: We had 3 rooms all were nice. A little surprised by them only using 1 of the 3 elevators . 1 was down for maintenance understandable. The cleaning staff was using the front elevator NOT THE EMPLOYEE ONLY ONE. Check out time is 11. House keeping knocked on the doors of 2 of our rooms at 930 am wanting to clean. And JUST WALKED IN OUR 3rd room also at 930 am,  without even knocking. The SERVICE in the restaurant was good. Jeff the on duty was nice.

Text: Super staff. This hotel hosted our annual conference this year.  We had always been at the capitol hotel.  The staff here went out of their way at every moment to male us feel welcome.  I never saw a member of staff who wasn't smiling.   Rooms were very nice and breakfast was great.  The bar closed earlier than I would expect and the bartender seemed a little put off when people came in around 11pm. Overall this location was great
