Rim Of The World Cabin
Rating: 5
Text: We spent 3 nights at this cabin and it was great. Plenty of beds, plenty of space. The cabin was cozy and far off the beaten path. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook and eat in. The hot tub was great and provided the relaxation we needed. Be warned: if you have Verizon for phone service, you won't have a signal! We finally found a signal in the back corner of one of the bedrooms, and had to stay there if we wanted to use the phone. Also, no wifi is provided at this cabin, so you really are disconnected and off the grid! We went to The Wilds (about an hour away), Big Muskie Bucket (on the way back from The Wilds), Glouster, Burr Oak State Park, and saw some historical sights in McConnelsville. You do have to drive a bit to get to anything, and there are no Walmarts or big chain stores in the region. Kroger, Family Dollar and Dollar General are your main stores. But the drive is beautiful....just make sure you go slow if you aren't from the area!
