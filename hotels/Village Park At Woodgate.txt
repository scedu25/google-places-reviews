Text: The staff is GREAT!  From the office to the maintenance crew, they are very good kind hearted people who are always welcoming and smiling, and the whole winning free rent Is TRUE!  I have won TWICE!!!
My area of the building is GreAt,  just hard working families who are trying to do good,
The building has its flaws like any other older building,  leaks on sinks,  but they fix it when you tell them, I love waking up and opening my balcony door to see the sun rise and let fresh air in. 
I want to give them 5 stars but I would be lying,  so 4 is GOOD,  again staff is GREAT all around. Tenants in my building and area as well no issues,  thus far , ???? home is were the HEART IS 
My heart is with Christ our Lord,  so I feel at home always.

Text: We have lived here nearly 6 years.  The past year has greatly improved.  Security has improved and the staff have been very helpful.  We have not experienced a great deal of issues with our apartment either.  For an older complex, the units are fairly priced.  The staff really do try to resolve problems in a timely fashion.  It is close to shopping and highways. All and all not a bad place to live.

Text: No hard feelings!!! I have been in this apartment for 4 months. I don't have any serious issues here. When I need to call maintenance, they would come within few hours. The only problem is that there had been a gun shot since I moved in. The management, the area and the facilities are all satisfying though. I would recommend people to live here!!
