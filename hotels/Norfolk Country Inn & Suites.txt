Text: Without a doubt the biggest dump I've ever stayed in. Mini blinds were damaged and broken, carpet torn, and we booked a "handicap" room. Laughable. There were no racks to set your luggage on, and the bathroom--- they put a couple bars on the tub and that was all. A handicap room has a walk in shower, not a tub. A person in a wheel chair would be unable to use it. We had booked room for 5 days. Stayed one night and changed hotels. Would not recommend this dump to anyone. Will be contacting management with a formal complaint.

Text: Definitely not the nicest place to stay. Very dated, like this place is right out of the 70's. Maybe even the 60's. But I guess for the most part it's clean though.

Text: Great little place to stay, the room I stayed in was great, very updated and nice, and it looked to me like they were updating the rest of the rooms,  . True the breakfast selection could have been better, but being a person that doesn't eat much breakfast it was fine. Pool what closed while I was there ( it was January), but it looked really nice with a cabana area near by, would love to see that in the summer. I was sad to see that the restaurant was closed, I hope it is open again soon. The staff was friendly and inviting. All in all I had a great stay, would for sure stay again.
