Text: We were greeted by the friendliest lady ever. She gave us a wonderful tour around the grounds. We got a couples massage in our room, it was fantastic!!! The best massage ever. The bed was phenomenal felt as if we we're sleeping on a cloud. This was our first stay at a bed & breakfast we will definitely be back!!

Text: This was our first stay at a B&B and if this is what they are like, we'll never stay anywhere but a B&B! We were given a tour of the dwelling and was very impressed with the up keep of the property and the hospitality was unbelievable! The only thing I would change is I would have stayed longer. One of the guests, that we sat with at breakfast, told us that we chose a great B&B to learn about them, but most were not near the caliber as Maple Hill. I would recommend Maple Hill to anyone!!!

Text: Amazing!  Spent the weekend here. It was beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous, view, lake, pool and breakfast were great. Amazing wildlife. Within 1 block we saw deer, fawns, turtles, countless birds and even a red fox as we were leaving. I would recommend to anyone staying in the area. Very clean too.

Text: Staying at Maple Hill was the best decision of our trip through Tennessee!!! 

From the moment you get there there's a view of the lake from both the front and the back. Huge decks to relax on in rockers under a fan! 

The owner is the most gracious, helpful person you'll ever meet! She immediately told us about the home and helped us plan our trip to Nashville. Every room in the home was luxurious and comfortable. We stayed in the Mary Todd (I think that's what it was called) and the bed was so comfortable it was a great night. 

Breakfast the next day was absolutely amazing! She doesn't miss a single detail and will spoil you! 

From start to finish this was a lovely experience!
