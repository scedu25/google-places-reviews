Text: Awesome. Friendly staff. Surprisingly clean. Sure the Town is a bit out of the way if you're a Interstate traveler, but well worth the few miles to stay here. Wonderful food choices very near. Superb breakfast in house.  I'd return anytime we get nearby.

Text: This a great hotel. Very clean & looks wonderful. Breakfast is decent: waffles, gravy & biscuits, frosted flakes & raisin bran, and yogurt. Worth the money I paid.

Text: Sandy is a very nice lady and she did an amazing job giving us a clean room to stay in. This is a very nice hotel and we stay here every time we come to Wisner for the pull.
