Hampton Inn Bowling Green
Rating: 4
Text: Decent Hampton Inn but in need of a bit of an update. I appreciate the space to park as we have a trailer that makes it so we take up 2 car spaces. There was enough spaces on one side so we didn't have to disconnect but if they were busy it might have been necessary. Bathrooms could use a bit of an update. Didn't stay for free breakfast cause it was too crowded the Sunday morning we were there. Went to a seafood place across the street that was unexpectedly good and shockingly empty

Text: The Bowling Green Hampton seemed to be updated and nicely appointed. Breakfast was your standard continental choices with heavily processed pastries, make your own waffles, and cereal choices. Air conditioning unit was rather loud, but worked well.

Text: The location is close enough to the campus and downtown that if you're on a college visit to BGSU it is a great spot to hunker down in the night because it's so close to a ton of restaurants and not that many people are staying in the hotel at one time so you have plenty of privacy, the room was nice but lacks a mini fridge and the beds were comfortable but I'd advise you to bring your own pillow, they were small and not firm enough in my opinion. The breakfast is limited but it is substantial and you feel like the staff is there to make sure you are satisfied and happy. I'd rate this higher if the rooms were a touch more fleshed out and besides that for an over night stay its perfect.

Text: Very nice looking hotel. Located very close to BGSU's campus. Lots of local delivery options.
