Innsbrook Resort
Rating: 4
Text: POSITIVE: great privacy from neighbors, set in a nice natural landscape, nice homes and properties, great security with gates and guard house staffed 24/7, lakes, golf course,  and club house, everything well mantained.. Oh and the Governor lives here.
NEGATIVE: about an hour from the city, no street lights, very small street signs, at night if you dont know your way around, it can be almost impossible to find your way with many lakes and dips in the roads and twists and turns.. At night driving can be very dangerous. 
TIP: Also a heads up google maps may not take you directly to the correct address because many of the homes are on acres of property, so if its your first time here I would have your people on the phone to guide you.

Text: This place is nice to go with your friends and family members. Pool is updated and there are more and more events to attend on special weekends. Nice golf course, and is in good shape. The beach could use a little work and there are goose droppings all over the place. Owners are hit and miss with who's friendly and who is a yuppy...

Text: Innsbrook Resort is a very large and unique gated community. There are a wide range of houses among various price points yet the community has an upscale, yet rustic feel. Sales associates and residents are very friendly and helpful.
