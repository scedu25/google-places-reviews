Text: They won't let me give no stars so by default I had to give 1 star. I can't even bring myself to give them 1 star because of my experience. Very poor customer service. Jamie at the front seat isn't even qualified enough to check people into a McDonald's let alone a hotel/motel. This hotel does not work well with orbits/expedia, they checked another guest in on my reservation then decided to tell me that the booking sight I used was in the he wrong. If your using a third party booking site I strongly advise you double and triple check your reservation before you leave your house or book at a hotel that hires a front desk attendant with at least a middle school education. Even the "manager" who I talked to passed the blame and was very unhelpful. Room cost me $200 and I wouldn't think a place this poor should be allowed to charge that much. Be advised don't stay here there are 2 better named hotels right beside this 1 that hopefully hire smarter people and can work better with a booking site.

Text: I had to give a star to be able to give a review but this hotel deserves zero stars and to be shutdown. BEDBUGS BEDBUGS BEDBUGS...Dirty room, grimey tub and dusty everything..Moldy toilet and tub backed up. Old hard crusty linen and outdated furniture with food stains from who knows when. I asked for a non pet room but of course the room reeked of musty dog and soiled carpet. I continuously had to look for bedbugs all night so I got absolutely no rest. Im bitten up on my face, arms, neck, shoulders as well as my daughter. I killed one and took pics. The front desk clerk (who seemed high as the sky) stared at me bewildered as I explained my horrible experience. He had no compassion or suggestions just spacey looks. I asked for the manager and he advised he would be available after 8a. I took his card and will be following up after I attempt to have a productive work day.

Text: Hotel is poorly maintained and used bait and switch tactics. The Windows are easily Accessible from exterior . The lobby was filthy. The front desk clerk was rude  went to the red roof inn down the street and found the hotel in better repair and a very friendly and helpful staff.

Text: Pretty dirty bathroom. Obvious hair clogged sink, something all over the tissue holder and nastiness on the door even I could get with a little effort and a Clorox wipe. Bed and pillows were comfy though, that's a plus.
