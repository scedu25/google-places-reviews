Text: Great property if you're working at Riley. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Ample power outlets. The bar has a number of local beers, plus a local and bud light on tap. The bartenders are mostly good, but Amber is the best! The staff is very friendly, but the breakfast staff isn't the best when compared to some other locations. Over all, 8/10 (and I travel A LOT) Will book again.

Text: Great room, great downtown location. An easy walk to everything. Breakfast was part for what you'd expect. Exercise room and pool were both very nice. The front desk clerk was very kind and gracious while helping with a number of requests.

Text: Great location. I was there for a conference which included seminars as well as catered meals. The meeting facilities for the seminars were less than ideal. Often the speaker could not be heard, the tables did not have power outlets close and they were an odd height. The wait staff was often inattentive, which was disappointing. The hotel itself though, was beautiful.

Text: Stayed here a couple of nights, I will say the breakfast omelettes were delicious.. Otherwise, I was really disappointed with the size of the room and the bed felt rock hard, although the pillows were cozy. I wouldn't suggest room service either, huge disappointment. Just didn't feel like their room rates quite matched the rooms-more like a $70/ night room- versus their advertised pricing of $100+. I will not be returning.

Text: A very nice facility for professional events. I enjoyed participating in a conference even not staying at the hotel. Great and welcoming facility.
