Hampton Inn & Suites Lansing West
Rating: 4
Text: I'm not overly familiar with the Lansing so I can't say a whole lot about how well-located the hotel was. The lobby and rooms were pretty sleek and you can see you're getting what you paid for. The breakfast selection wasn't super big, but what was available (eggs, wafflemaker, sausage, fruit, some other small sides) tasted good. If I had the money available for a decent hotel stay, I'd likely pick this hotel 9 times out of 10.

Text: Short drive from downtown. Lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby. Rooms, and amenities were all very clean and well kept. The staff was all courteous and accommodating. I will gladly stay here again. The warm cookies at the front desk are a nice touch as well :)

Text: I always sleep so well when I am in a king-size bed at a Hampton Inn & Suites (and I normally have a lot of difficulty sleeping on new places).
