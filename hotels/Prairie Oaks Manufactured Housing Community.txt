Prairie Oaks Manufactured Housing Community
Rating: 4
Text: I lived there for a short time. I would probably still be there, but due to health reasons I had to move. While I lived there the owners were always very helpful and polite. Things were taken care of promptly if there was an issue, and they kept it very well maintained along with the people that lived there. If you hear a bad remark from someone about this place while they lived there, they probably didn't fallow the rules and asked for the issues they complain about. I was very happy with the way things went while I was there.
