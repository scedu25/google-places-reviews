Text: One of the nastiest places I have ever had to stay. If I am ever in the area again overnight, I will sleep in the car.

Text: You definitely get what you pay for at this place.   They're transitioning from Days Inn to Grayson Inn so it was a bit confusing checking in,  not knowing what hotel I was in.   

This place has smoking rooms on one side of the hall,  and non smoking on the other.   I didn't really smell smoke in my room but could definitely tell in the hallway. 

The floor level room I was in,  did not have locks on the window.   To test, I was easily able to slide it open from the outside.   

Tub was disguising!   We definitely showered in sandles.  The shower curtain rod was barely hanging on.   The thing was just poorly fastened to the walls. 

A few good items were the sheets were clean and bright white.  And the front desk clerk was very polite.

Text: If we weren't so tired from driving we would have left. The whole place wreaked of smoke. The non-smoking room did not have that smell but the bathroom had dirty towels left in the tub. Also it looked like mold was growing in the shower handle. 

The A/C unit cover was all broken even though the unit worked. 

Desk clerk was nice and did her job. But the motel could  use some remodeling work and a deep thorough cleaning.

Text: Beds were fine, free coffee and maker provided in the room. If all you want is a spot to sleep during a trip, you won't be disappointed
