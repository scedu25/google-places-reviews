Text: One note, however, if you are planning on a late arrival let the front desk know in advance because this hotel does not staff the check-in desk past 10 PM. They place your room keys in a safe and provide you with an access code. Otherwise a lovely, comfortable, and well-managed facility in the 2-star price range.

Text: There are not very many hotel options in Hoisington, and this one is reasonable. There was a dead beetle in the hall. There was a Continental breakfast which was good.  The selection was sufficient but limited.

Text: Just hope you don't have an emergency in Hoisington. I would guess this place is nice, the lobby area looked clean and modern. Last October, my then-husband and I had the unfortunate mishap of finding Bambi right outside of Hoisington. This is the only motel/hotel in town, and someone had booked the entire thing for a wedding, If it had not been for a very generous local couple who offered to help us, we would have spent the night sleeping in our truck. I gave it four stars based on the lobby area that I was able to see.

Text: Decent hotel room with everything ?you would expect. The only notably negative was the lack of sound insulation. I could here the person in the next room snoring, and the hallways got quite loud in the morning.
