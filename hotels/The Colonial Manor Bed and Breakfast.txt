Text: The new owners will be continuing the B & B business.  They are wonderful people and we have been neighbors for 20 years. We are going to miss them dearly.

Text: I have stayed at the Murray House twice in the past year and can't wait to return! Conveniently located just outside of Springfield, it's very easy to find and extremely welcoming. 
Last May it was the venue for my bridal shower and the downstairs seating area was a perfect fit for the 25 guests. It is really the perfect venue for many of life's celebrations, as my brother and sister-in-law also patronized it for pre-wedding preparations and pictures.
The innkeepers are wonderful folks who know how to make you feel at home and can whip up amazing breakfasts - I have yet to visit anywhere else with a breakfast so fabulous, that I find myself daydreaming about the stuffed french toast and quiche!  Highly recommend this venue to anyone traveling through the area looking for an off the beaten path accommodation.
