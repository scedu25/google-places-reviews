Text: Facilities overall unkept. Tennis courts without nets. The Marine facility was nice, great restaurant. The accommodations are clean and standard. We stayed in a modular three bedroom unit. Only one tiny TV on the wall. For the money, a fair value.

Text: Very nice. The people are great, resort is clean' doxla are nice and they had a great firework show. They could use some work in the bathrooms though. The stall doors don't close well and they need to spray for spiders.
