La Quinta Inn Richmond

Text: I have stayed here 3 times. The first time there was holes in the sheets, the last time I stayed across from a maintenance area that reeked of cigarettes. Both of these were in the secondary building across the parking lot. The second time I stayed in the main bldg and that was so much nicer. Updated and more well kept. The people there have always been super friendly.

Text: Love this hotel.  Clean rooms.  Pet friendly.  Nice place to walk your pet behind the building.  Breakfast and WiFi included.  Free parking.  Easy check in-out.  Downside not near restaurants and no place to just take a walk.   It is close to activities in Richmond and not far from Lexington

Text: Overall it was a good stay. There are things not perfect here, but it's a lower price hotel, so I'm not surprised. The important stuff like cleanliness, good staff, cost, space were all good. Air conditioner worked great. The outdoor pool area was really beautiful. Breakfast was okay, typical, except no fresh fruit. The reason I dropped it to 4 stars is the room really smelled of smoke. It was weird because the room was clean and I believe recently painted etc, but smelled like smoke. In all fairness, we didn't ask for another room because we were tired so maybe the other rooms are okay. Overall, for the price, I would recommend and I would stay again.

Text: Seems to be recently up dated. Room clean and very nice and spacious. The evening has been very quiet. Location to some restaurants is very close. Just a short drive.
