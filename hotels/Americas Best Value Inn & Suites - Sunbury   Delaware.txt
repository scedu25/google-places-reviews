Text: Saw the recent reviews and thought it would be okay. I've been in worse, but not by much. Hallways and room smelled funny. Bathroom was gross. Bed was hard as a rock. There's even a garden in the front flower beds. Weird. Wouldn't recommend, especially for $80 on a Tuesday night.

Text: Older property showing a bit of its age. Kept in good shape, very clean, good TV and lighting. Staff quite accomodating. A good value for a considerate price. If you want to pay more for the Hilton class hotels they are just down the interstate.

Text: No elevator and there are 3 floors. Bathtub stopped up. Really needs updated. Air conditioner blew out black particles over onto the bed. Covers and blankets were so old and worn out with holes in them. Charged for a safe in the room and never asked to use It? Everything was just old and bathroom floors On the baseboards had black stuff on them.and the room stunk. I feel bad complaining but they charge just a few dollars cheaper than places like holiday inn and best western.

Text: Terrible. As other reviewers have said, beds hard as a rock, rooms old and felt unclean, smelled of smoke, and breakfast sucked (hello carb and gluten fest. All they had was gross waffle mix, cold cereal, and oatmeal. I asked for some cold water (they only had hot water out), and they told me I could go to the ice machine, vending machine, or the gas station next door. Umm...forget it. Terrible customer service.  We didn't even check in until 2 am, left at 10 am, and our stay was waaay too long. If you don't care about eating or cleanliness, this is the place for you. Otherwise...keep driving.
