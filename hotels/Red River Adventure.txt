Red River Adventure
Rating: 5
Text: Some fast moving parts of the river, water level was down when we went, I would reccomend some prior experience if water levels are up. Lots of rocks to dodge, would recommend dry bags if you have them.

Some excellent views of some surrounding rock formations and cool sights to see alon the way (suspension bridge and jumping rock). Very much j enjoyed the paddle.

Staff did an excellent job on prepping regarding the river/ safety.

Text: We had a fantastic time. This place is run by a bunch of laid back veterans, which really helps make it a great experience. We were the last to get to their base, but were ten minutes after 3:00. We called them when we were in traffic and they told us to come on in! The last party out had three people too many, so one of the guys loaded us into his personal truck to make sure we made it to the water with our boats. The paddle itself was beautiful, but was rushed at the end due to sudden bad weather (no ones fault). Overall, couldn't have had a better time. Can't wait to go again.

Text: Had a lot of fun canoeing for a bachelor party! Our reservation got messed up, but the staff worked with us to make it work. If you are going in the summer make sure to make a reservation.
