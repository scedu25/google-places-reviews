Text: Room amenities were great. Set up like studio apartment. Laundry area and public areas clean. Room was pretty clean. Bathroom floor needed mopping in the corners. Coffee, snack bars, package oatmeal and muffins for breakfast. Great price and location. Staff friendly and helpful. Would stay again.

Text: Got reservations over the phone. Get to the hotel and they have no idea what I'm talking about and book me a new room. Room has another guest in it. Come back and wait 45 min for the lady to return. She gives me another room. Wake up the next morning to 6 missed calls and someone beating down my door. My card was declined. Fixed card issue. Next day at 5am sharp, fire alarms go off. Entire building evacuated. I'm just glad the alarms work. Nice rooms though. Love the kitchen area.

Text: Nice hotel with clean rooms. Friendly staff was so helpful after our nightmare at Valley West Inn! Got us checked in right away. Missed out on breakfast but I bet it was nice. Fast to bring us towels when we needed extras! Highly recommend!

Text: West Des Moines Hotel is run down and not clean. Hallways and elevators are dirty, rooms outdated. One of the past maids offered herself to my husband for money, Maria Kirchmann. The place needs renovation and new management to get things under control.
