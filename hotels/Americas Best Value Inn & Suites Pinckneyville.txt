Text: If I could give it 0 ? I would. Foreigners working are completely rude and could not be understood. A $20 fee for my ? that will need a bug bath after we leave due to evident bed bug issues. Pool was disgusting and water was so low the filters couldn't reach it to clean the water. Never again for me.

Text: The only guy that works here shouldn't be working here. First, the room had bed bugs and he didn't want to switch our rooms. Finally he did when we said we were going somewhere else. Then the next room had black mold all over the bathroom and next to the window by the bed! He then accused my friend of bringing her dogs in to the hotel to stay. He followed her to her car 2 days in a row threatening her. He is crazy and rude!! Would never stay here again

Text: Included decent breakfast. Enough selection to make most people happy. House keeping came rather early in the morning while still getting ready for the day. Since we were still getting ready we said we didn't need anything at the moment. When we returned later in the day, room service had not returned to refresh the room.
