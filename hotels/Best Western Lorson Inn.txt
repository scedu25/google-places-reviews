Best Western Lorson Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Fast Check In, very nice and clean room. Great price. Was staying here for work and it's next to a bunch of food. Fridge and microwave in the room. Can't get to right off road, have to take neighborhood road to get in. But a great place to stay.

Text: As usual, our stay at a Best Western was great.  We appreciated the Best Western Lorson Inn having a freezer in the lobby, which provided additional snacks in addition to those in the vending machines.  Great motel.  Great service.  Great staff.
