Text: Eh, It is a hotel. I stayed about 6mo ago, and it was ok. Pool was nice. Staff was caring and friendly. If you don't like sketchy places, this is not for you. When I was there I could hear gunshots. Mansfield PD sucks, so don't think they will help it. Other than that, I like the room. The rooms were clean. The bathroom was very nice, had bath and body works toiletries. Beds were comfy, and there was a couch bed. Was pretty good for the price.

Text: My best friend lives in Columbus and I'm in Cleveland we wanted to meet in the middle so our girls could spend time together and celebrate their birthdays. Ten and 11 year old girls love the pool and this one was awesome, according to the pictures online. Not at all the case. There was Black mold, no chlorine, and the neighborhood kids were using it. It was disgusting. They finally closed it down after we learned the hard way. We took our babies to the local Y and they had an awesome time. We'll never stay here again but big shout out to the Mansfield Y for being everything this place was not!

Text: Not bad, could use an update and the pool was out of service while I was there. But the staff is all very friendly and the breakfast is pretty good. Don't venture around behind the hotel. It is a pretty bad neighborhood back there. And this coming from a guy familiar with Kensington Philly.

Text: I come to town once every year or two and almost always stay here.
The staff is nice and friendly, clean rooms.
This year the pool was closed and they offered a free breakfast instead.

Text: VERY friendly and accommodating staff. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool was out of service and a few things are looking date and worn but all in all a nice stay and would stay here again.
