Text: Room service didn't make bed or even drop of towels during our 3 day stay and we had to argue w the front desk just to get towels for our room.  Its never good when the front desk says "well i guess you dont need to shower then".

Text: Front desk woman the worst ever.  Stayed for a couple days during a convention. NO ROOM SERVICE FOR EVERY DAY HERE. When i went to the front desk she says go find your house keeper we have no clean towels and absolutely refused in the ugliest way to refuse me towels for a shower. Then tells me im disrespecting her for being upset that we have to work a 12hour day and she got to shower but we do not get to! This woman, not a lady ever, would be fired on the spot if i owned the place. I own 5 retail stores and have NEVER NEVER HAVE HAD WORST SERVICE! I would never recommend this to my worst enemy! And better your motel and get rid of that weekend receptionist that worked sunday morning march 19th! 
And respect is NEVER just given, you KEISHA have to earn it.

Text: "Renovated" but still much work to do...also the entire 3rd floor smelled like week for 2 days straight. Not very pleasant
