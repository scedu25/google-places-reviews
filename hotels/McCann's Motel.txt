McCann's Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Nice older motel with great rates for those in a budget. Nothing fancy, an older place that could use some updates. The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean and bug free. Close to a nice little park on the river and within a short walk to the local convenience store. Free WiFi and basic directv in all the rooms.
