Text: Both beds were dirty with makeup stains and one of the beds had 2 small bloody spots. Ewww! And to top it off there was leftovers still in the fridge from the previous people that were in the room. So we called the front desk and asked for a different room. One of the manager s on staff came and scanned the room, she didn't even apologize. She said "so do you want another room or a refund" and since she was rude we just asked for a refund. The man at the front desk that checked us in was very nice to us by the way. At least someone working here was able to keep a smile on. Oh did I mention there is a strip club literally next door. ???? Yikes!
