Fairfield Inn by Marriott Dubuque
Rating: 5
Text: Friendly and helpful staff, clean well equipped  rooms and a standard breakfast. This motel is nothing special, but it is special because of the stay we had. Sometimes it is the little things like great staff and a very clean room that make a motel stand out. I hope the rest of the motels on our trip are exactly the same.

Text: I've stayed in better Fairfields. This property needs a little updating. It's not the quietest place either. Noise from traffic on Dodge street can be heard.

Text: Staff was very pleasant. Only issue was with our room location on the bottom floor we could hear foot steps throughout the night. Room was clean so no issues there. The television was noticeably smaller than usual. Breakfast options were good.

Text: I delivered a pizza there. This review is for Google reviews. But the lobby did look nice so...

Text: This hotel is always the best every time I come to Dubuque. The staff goes out of their way to be super nice and friendly. Also the renovation that was done recently looks great!
