Hampton Inn Indianapolis-Ne/Castleton

Text: Good service. Rooms and TVs are very outdated. Also not a convenient way to enter the hotel parking lot. Requires you to either U-turn or work your way back through back alley type roads.

Text: I will not stay here again.  Although staff is friendly and did their best, the management has not paid attention to the needs of their customers.  Air conditioning units are outdated and did not work.  Hair dryer did not work.  coffee was not replaced.  But the thing that irritated me the most.  The "business center"  is a kiosk where you have to pull the computer monitor out sideways to put a flash drive in just to be able to print.  You can only stand, so doing any kind of work is impossible.  For a "business hotel" whose customers are BUSINESS PEOPLE, this is just ridiculous!  I was told it was this way because people were sitting too long at the computers.  Hmmmn.  I travel every week.  I will choose Marriott, I do not have this problem there.

Text: After a bad experience with Motel 6 East Indy this hotel sure did exceed my expectations. Kyle was extremely helpful and set me up with a nice room. The room was clean, staff was friendly, bed was comfortable and they had the nicest toiletries. I would definitely recommend!

Text: The rooms were comfortable. The staff was the best part though - hands down. The lady who checked me in was great. 
If I'm ever back in Indy, I will be back here.
