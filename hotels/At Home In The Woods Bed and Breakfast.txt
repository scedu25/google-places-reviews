Text: We have been staying with Scott and Victoria for years and At Home in the Woods is out home away from home! Clean rooms, great prices, and the food is truly remarkable. The rooms are inspired by the keepers travels around the country and offer for that reflects an individual national park. AHITW offers a welcoming sitting area that offers a place to relax and unwind or a chance to converse with the other guests. I cannot say enough about this place!

Text: We are forever grateful to have found Victoria & Scott's place.Thogether they made our wedding day unbelievably carefree. The rooms, the food & all that they did for us (from making the cake, the food & the 'late-night' pizzas to hiring the minister & making (or ordering) the flower arrangements simply can't be beat.
As a bride who is down-to-earth & loves nature, I couldn't have asked for more.
Our wedding was scheduled around my stepkids spring break, or we'd have had a fall wedding.
Both my husband & I still want to get back to "At Home in the Woods" in either late spring, fall, or in the middle of winter to enjoy the views @ a different time of year. 
We haven't made it back there yet...But we will soon... Hopefully VERY soon!
