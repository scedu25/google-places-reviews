Text: Childhood memories flow from this little place. I remember that it's needed some work but still fantastic! Only problems really are that the shop and dining room by the lake floods when the water gets 5 feet higher than normal. Great arcade room and great boats to take out. I'm definitely going back and may live there for a while in my future. Great people and great atmosphere around the place.

Text: Water is a little bit dirty but has great service and friendly people. You can go fishing, swimming, paddle boat, or just hang out on the beach. The food is great and they slides to play. I would definitely go again.

Text: The seasonal campers are great people & all staff BUT one (Joyce) are great! Joyce will yell at campers & their guest. I spoke with 6 different seasonal campers & shared my experience with her & their stories were worse than mine. Unfortunately that old, ratchet, b*tch is part owner so she can do whatever she wants. For ALL people running Tough Mudders in the future, DO NOT stay here!
