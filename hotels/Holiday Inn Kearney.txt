Text: My daughter and I recently stayed here for the weekend.  The staff was great, especially Will!  He went above and beyond, even going next door to the gas station to get what I needed.
The restaurant is always delicious and good prices.  
The meeting rooms were spacious and we'll equipped.
I can't recommend highly enough.

Text: It was jus a hotel but we went and spend the money so we could use the amazing pool. But sadly it was not very clean. Foam was in the pool and not just a little but a ton. It quiet frankly was gross. CLEAN IT

Text: I was a little leery about this hotel from some of the reviews and things I heard, however I was pleasantly surprised. Very clean and well maintained. The room was a good size and clean. Nice big pillows. It's an older hotel so some of the ceilings are pretty low and the room furniture could use updating but overall a good place to stay for a few nights. The staff was great and there are several restaurants within walking distance.

Text: Clean room. TV, microwave, mini fridge, Blu Ray player.  Friendly service.  We come for the indoor kids pool with slides for all ages.  Nice hot tub too.  Good location right off the interstate.  Restaurant nearby.  A nice place to stay in central NE.

Text: Nice hotel, up to date, comfortable beds, amazing pool. Breakfast in the restaurant was disappointing for the price and yogurts expired. But otherwise a great stay.
