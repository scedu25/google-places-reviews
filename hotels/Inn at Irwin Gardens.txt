Text: Very beautiful, relaxing, and peaceful! Delicious breakfast as well. The grounds we're very well kept, and had many great spots for pictures. Very beautiful all around.

Nestled in the heart of Columbus, Indiana is a fabulous Inn. Not only a trip into a more elegant past, but a balm for the soul. The Gardens are a delight; feels like your own private retreat. And there's a spa on the property. Great for an event but you might want to keep it a secret for yourself.
