Text: Great location just off the highway traveling from California back to Wisconsin moving our Marine home. A military discount was offered which was appreciated. Room was comfortable and clean. Staff was helpful and courteous. Would stay here again.

Text: They are under construction, so you can't enter through the main door. The beds were nice and soft, with lots of pillows. They did accommodate for one of us being on crutches, move us from 3rd floor to ground floor close to the exit.

Text: Friendly staff.  Clean rooms. Just wish there was a blow dryer in the room.  Everything else was great!

Text: Close to I-80, it was only a couple minutes off yet far enough to not hear the noise. The rooms are a little small compared to some other buildings, but not enough to be an issue. Good for just staying a night and going of on your way. Reception was kind and they had free cookies and popcorn, along with breakfast. Overall like a 4.5 but more towards the 5 in terms of "passing through one night stay."
