Text: So much attention to the details that make your stay as easy as possible. Free full breakfast served each morning; small store for snacks and sundries, anything you might have forgotten, even laundry products. We had a free upgrade from standard king to king executive suite. Very comfortable couch in the suite. Charging stations for multiple devices conveniently located on desk and nightstand. Very impressed with staff, from front desk to housekeeping. We were towing a 25 foot trailer so Brady from the front desk actually waited for us outside the entrance and walked us to the parking for trailers. We very strongly recommend the hotel to others.

Text: My friend and I had a wonderful stay at comfort suites. Our room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. We mostly enjoyed the pillows and we were delighted to know we were able to purchase the same type of pillows to enjoy back home. I travel frequently and normally with a pet. I love that comfort suites has a pet friendly policy. Although my pet did not come on this trip, comfort suites is the preferred hotel of choice for when I travel.

Text: This hotel was very nice, clean, family oriented and affordable. They provide dinner 3 nights a week & staff knows the area. They have family games for you to play. I like that it's off the highway and a couple of exits from the restaurants and mall.

You can tell some people just love what they do. Thank you all for the kindness. P.s complimentary hot breakfast and dinner with your stay!
