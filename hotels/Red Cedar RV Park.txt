Red Cedar RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: We stopped here for one night. It was a fair price, about average, but they parked us in a gravel parking lot, basically. To be fair, we could have gotten a back in site with grass, but if you pull in here for one night, odds are you might get parked in a gravel lot with only about 2 feet between campers. Not really an RV park at that point, just a parking lot! But they were friendly and helped me with a problem on my RV for free, so that's why they're getting 4 stars instead of 3.

Text: Easy in easy out, very large sites,mostly level sites, all hook ups, polite and very friendly staff, clean. Good prices and within a mile or so of food and shopping in a great little town. If you are tired of driving for the day I would spend the night here any time. What an RV park should be. Thank you Red Cedar for making us feel safe and secure. Scra Stone your review is way off base and most likely nothing but lies. I bet you are one of the  drug addicts that currently plague our good old USA. I have checked you out on the web and it's a shame you are so hateful.
