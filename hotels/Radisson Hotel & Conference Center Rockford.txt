Text: The staff here was extremely friendly and helpful. They were more than willing to help me with a special request, because my car battery was dieing frequently.  They located an extension cord and directed me to park in a convenient spot so I was able to plug in my battery tender.  Now that I fixed the problem, I won't need this extra help, but I will never forget the wonderful experience they worked so hard to provide!  The hotel room was very well appointed, and definitely way better than average.  If you're looking for friendly staff and above average accommodations, this place should be your first choice!

Text: Extremely friendly and helpful staff! The room was incredibly clean and quiet! The spa and pool were also extremely clean. The bar staff was attentive, the breakfast room service was on time and the food was prepared exactly how we asked. Location is within walking distance of many different food locations. It is just a slight drive off the highway. All and all our stay was amazing and we will definitely use this hotel again!

Text: I hosted a Bridal Show at the Radisson and it could not have gone more smoothly thanks to the staff. They are attentive to every need. The food is wonderful and the banquet hall is beautiful and versatile. I would highly recommend this space for any kind of event!

Text: Plenty of parking and very well (centrally) located. Easy access to highways and close to the most popular restaurants. Staff very friendly and helpful. Maintenance resolves issues in a timely manner. House keeping does a great job cleaning the rooms.

Text: Our company stays here and the staff is excellent.  They take great care of everyone.  It is also within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and more.  On the other hand, it isn't he greatest area and locals tell me this is where Chicago drops its thugs.  Back to the Radisson itself, the rooms are good quality but not what you would want if you are used to high end stays.
