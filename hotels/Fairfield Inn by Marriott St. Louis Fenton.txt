Fairfield Inn by Marriott St. Louis Fenton

Text: Place was small and cozy. Picked this due to the price and it was good for the price point. The main issue I had was that the shower leaked. That was really irritating to get out of the shower and find the whole floor wet. Other than that, the stay there was fine.

Text: Rooms are nice. Located in an industrial park setting. Not much within walking distance. Need a vehicle to grab anything to eat other than the complimentary breakfast.
