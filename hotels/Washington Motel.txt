Text: Nothing fancy, but a good room for a good price. Owner was helpful and accommodating. Stayed here opening weekend of quail season. Clean beds, hot shower, heater and AC work fine. Would recommend to traveling hunters.

Text: Do NOT Stay Here.  First thing I noticed when walking in the room was a rather large dead spider in the bathroom.  The tub was filthy and had hair in it.  Both beds had hair on the pillows and in the sheets.  I'm not a super posh kind of guy, but I was almost tempted to just sleep in the car.

Text: Dirty, dirty, dirty.  Had to go to the Dollar General and buy a can of Hot Shot Fly Spray to get rid of the 10 million flies in our room.  But, hey, didn't see any bed bugs!  We found out from one of the locals that we should have chosen the motel a few blocks to the east.
