Holiday Inn Portsmouth Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: Always love staying at Holiday Inn in Portsmouth, Ohio! Portsmouth may be my home but, when I stay at Holiday Inn it feels like my home away from home!!! Beautiful rooms, comfortable, very clean, very private if you want it to be that way & I also really love the late check out time which is at 11am! 5 starts for sure! This is always my “go to” spot when I need a Hotel. ???

Text: DO NOT STAY!! My daughter is a college student that lives 2 hours away from home. She hit a deer and wrecked her car last night. She forgot to get her apartment key off of her key ring when she left it at the body shop. She got all the way to her apartment and could not get in. We called the Holliday Inn to try to rent out daughter a room and just because she is not 21 they would not rent her a room. We called and explained the situation, advised that we would pay for the room and they would not help us. Its 1:00 in the morning, she is 19 almost 20 and 2 hours away from home. We called the Comfort Inn and they will more than willing to help us. Go to the Comfort Inn. Holiday Inn SUCKS!!!! My daughter was crying in a panic and they would not help us.

Text: Excellent wait staff at bar, good food and good beer. The pool had way too much chlorine but was clean. Overall good hotel within easy walking distance of the University and several restaurants.

Text: Best Hotel in Portsmouth. Comfy bed, and the bar drinks were priced nicely. Not your standard hotel pricing.
