Candlewood Suites Cleveland-N. Olmsted
Rating: 5
Text: If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...

The North Olmsted is convenient to major transportation hubs, including several interstates and the Cleveland airport. Though we only stayed for one night, the accommodations are very well equipped for people who need longer stays. The service was prompt and friendly, and the bed very comfortable. The rooms were well appointed and very quiet.

Text: Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. This is an older hotel. The elevator had a strange smell but the room itself was fine. The bed was more comfortable than expected and the AC worked well. This is an extended stay hotel so there is a kitchen as well as equipment you can borrow from the hotel.

Text: The staff is fun, but the kitchen isn't stocked very well for long-term stays. I also wish there was an oven. Otherwise, it's a pretty clean & comfortable room.
