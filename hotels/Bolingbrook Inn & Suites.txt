Text: While I do understand that they are renovating, even though it was not mentioned during the booking process on Expedia, renting a room that seems to be under construction is why they got this rating.

The one ice machine was not working.

Also, no bacon during breakfast. Waffles we're good, just missing bacon.

Text: Horrible. One of the 2 worst hotels I've stayed at, the other one was in a 3rd world country. The air conditioner was right above my window buzzed all day & night. The male staff at the front desk, HATED getting up off his lazy ass. Hallways smelled like smoke & I asked for non-smoking. I was scared someone was going to kick the door down & scared if my car was going to be broken into. The stair well carpets had huge water stains on them, I might as well slept in a 99 cent store, I probably would have felt safer. I could have also gotten a better breakfast at the same 99 cent store. And yes, that was my view. Seriously, look for another hotel.

Text: Terrible.  Under renovation but that shouldn't mean nothing works.  Rooms were either ash try smelling it over powered with perfume.  Only ice machine didn't work and told we are under renovation so some things may not work.  Really?  Renovations means no ice machine!  Front desk seemed more interested in not doing anything opposed to assisting guests.

Text: We checked in 11/6/17 the front desk could not find our resveration even after showing him the confirmation email! He finally got us a room upon first entering the room everything was fine. Our 2nd day the staff did not change the sheets, they just made the bed, and took out the trash! The 3 nights we were there the sheets were not changed, then cleaned the bathrrom and we found a used pad behind the toilet! Also this hotel has roaches! We found roaches in our room. Will never stay again! Worst hotel ever!1

Text: This place is the one off the worst hotels we have stayed in and I thought motel 6 was bad. The staff don't know anything when we ask for something they don't have it. Our room was supposed to have a microwave and two beds, no they didn't give us the microwave and they changed our room to a king size bed with no extra bed and we were 2 adults and 2 kids one off us had to sleep on the floor. Also the pool isn't deep enough only 3 feet deep and the jacuzzi was broken. Seriously this was one of our worst stays.
