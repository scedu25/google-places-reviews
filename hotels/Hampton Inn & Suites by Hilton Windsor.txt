Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Windsor

Text: Excellent hotel. I stayed here October 13/14 2017. Clean rooms Friendly staff and the complimentary breakfast was very good.  My SUV wouldn't start and a staff member used his own car to try and boost mine (unfortunately that wasn't my problem). He spent about 1/2 an hour trying to help me. Every staff member I encountered was pleasant and friendly. For being in such a busy spot in Windsor the Hampton feels so small town friendly.  I also have to leave my car in their lot for a day or two until we can get it home on a flat bed because it's all wheel drive. The hotel just said leave your plate number with the front desk and don't worry about. Fantastic staff nice spot would definitely stay again.

Text: Location is good and hotel is clean. Do not stay on a room facing the Main Street as it is very noisy. Lots of trucks passing through all night. Walls of room are paper thin and I could hear my neighbour going to the toilet. 

Breakfast was very nice with some good selections.

Text: Stayed in a one bed (king size) room, very spacious and clean. Staff was very friendly with no hassle while checking in or out. Free buffet breakfast every morning was great and they also provided free coffee all day.

Text: Very central location, great service: quick and super polite. The rooms are very clean, comfy beds with a variety of pillows to choose from! Quiet, except for the relatively noisy street below. Breakfast was not amazing. It looked like there is no chef making the food, but it's prepared from ready foods. Good orange juice! ?
