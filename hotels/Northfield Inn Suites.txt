Text: All the people were exceedingly friendly. But the second shift guy Nicholas was about as friendly human being as I've ever met. Would go back solely because of him. But the place was nice and clean and they did a great job

Text: We stopped overnight here on our way to Saint Louis. Great location sorta looks like its part of this Mexican restaurant, but better rooms and service. Waking up in the morning to breakfast was amazing. I slept so great in the bed and the showers were nice too. Overall I give it 5 stars.

Text: We had a lot of help in planning the event. The price was perfect for such a gorgeous space. The room was clean, and everything ran smoothly for once. The event coordinator even helped set up and tear down. We weren't even disturbed during the event. Amazing experience! I wish I had had my wedding here.

Text: Perfect little hotel smack in the middle of so many restaurants, lots of shopping, and even a flea market just around the corner on Saturdays and Sundays!! So many stores and good eats within walking distance too. The rooms here are very clean, and the staff is amazing. Everyone is very friendly. No complaints at all!
