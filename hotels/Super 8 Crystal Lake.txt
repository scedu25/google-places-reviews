Text: My father of 82 years who has a hard time getting around, had been displaced by the flood in the Fox River area. My home was to far and has too many stairs. I was afraid if I brought him home he would've fallen and would have then really be in bad shape. Aseri was very accommodating. My dad also has a dog. The room was kept up at 12:00 each day for a week. Aseri and they're staff were very professional. Thank you Super 8 for being there for him .

Text: I dropped in to visit someone staying there. Not in the best shape and could use an overhaul... this was one of the original type Super 8's, not yet one of the nicer ones you sometimes see. It would not be my choice for a stay unless I really needed the rate. My friend was they because they allowed pets.
