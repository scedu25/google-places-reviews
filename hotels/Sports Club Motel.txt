Text: Nice clean rooms, friendly staff that was extremely accommodating.  Went there when the motel was packed with Rugby players. They went to great lengths to make everyone feel like they had their best interest st heart. The managers actually understand customer service!  They took group pictures with every team and made us feel like we were with friends!  Highly recommend this motel!!!!

Text: We took the last available room, which was a smoker but the owner let us check it out beforehand and you honestly couldn't tell. Very nice and helpful folks. We'll see about the coffee in the AM :-)

Text: The motel was very welcoming and made you feel at home, rooms were clean and comfortable.  My father and I spent the weekend for my son's Rugby tournament. Troy and Tony were very helpful, bending over backwards in trying to help several Rugby players find accommodations after a serious miscommunication between sponsors and schools in reserving rooms, this was not even their problem but they called around and found rooms to accommodate those that didn't have reservations.  They even suggested several places to eat and we were not disappointed with their suggestions.  We would definitely stay again if we are in the area.
