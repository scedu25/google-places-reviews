Mill Springs RV Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Mill Springs RV Resort is amazing! We’ve had our spot since January 2016 and we absolutely love it!  The owners are so nice, very friendly, some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet.  They take impeccable care of the campground; it’s always clean, decorated nicely and well maintained. We have made so many wonderful, life long friends at this campground, it truly is our “Home” away from home!!!

Text: Started off great but the owner likes to stalk and bully women. Waits until your gone and flys in on his golf cart to stick his chest out. Nice place but good luck if you don’t like surveillance

Text: A seasonal lease is required to camp at Mill Springs. Guests are welcome, but additional fees are included and they must stay in your camper; as no additional camps are allowed. During the week it is very quiet. On weekends bring your golf cart and socialize. Don't expect a lot of privacy if outside your camper. Grounds are well maintained. Pool, showerhouse, and laundry room available. Ice and firewood are for sale also. Pet friendly. Owners live on sight and willing to help.
