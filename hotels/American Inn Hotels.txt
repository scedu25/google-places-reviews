Text: When we first got in, they put us into a smoking room despite booking for a non-smoking. It was also pretty messy and gross. But when we mentioned it to the front desk, they got us moved quickly and into a much cleaner and nicer room. They were super nice and apologized for it. The room was nice and the bed was pretty comfy, though I wish there had been more/bigger pillows. The breakfast was pretty great! It was biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs from their restaurant, which we were pleased with. There was another guest however who was not happy with that lack of choice and threw a humongous fit over it. No knocks against the hotel, but thought I'd shame that jerk.

Text: I came in later than expected. They gave me a key and guided me to my room. Staff was wonderful and funny. Bed was huge and shower was great. It was actually a nice quiet room.

Text: This place discriminates against the handicap. The management is very disrepectful. He does not let you explain yourself but instead hangs up on you. They do NOT allow service dogs even with the proper documentation. They through the handicap out in the street with no where to go. The only reason I gave one star is because I had to. I would not even recommend this place to my enemy's. You get what you pay for here. If you're looking for cheap...keep driving and save yourself the headache.

Text: This is definitely a bottom-feeder hotel. I seen just as many hookers as I did police officers there. If I had kids I would not bring them here. It's not in a bad neighborhood it's in a good neighborhood just once you get inside the hotel things are different. I didn't see any bucks there but there probably are

Text: I was visiting a friend and the room they had was huge compared to a lot of hotels I have stayed at with my husband and was also neater than half of them.
