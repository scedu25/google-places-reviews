Text: I arrived on Monday forenoon around 10:00, they did let me in my room and had called before I got there to schedule a room and told them I will have to stay till Tuesday night @9:00, and made it clear again when I arrived that I will be staying till Tuesday night, at 11:00 a.m.on Tuesday they made me and my 3 yr. daughter leave our room, as they said they have someone else that needs that room tonight, I would advise you all as owners make sure you are sure what your customers are telling you!!!
