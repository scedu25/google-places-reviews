Text: This is an older hotel that is/has been recently refurbished. While the rooms are a bit tight, they are very nice. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful as well.

Text: We went for a quick one night stay with the primary reason of using the hotel pool for our kids. The pictures made it look like a decent sized pool especially for a hotel and it was. The only downside is the majority of the pool was 5-6 ft deep and it was a quick slope down. It worked pretty well for our 9 year old who has just learned how to swim, but our little two year old twins didn't have as much space in the 3 foot section. It wasn't too bad, but with just a few other hotel guests it could get crowded. And even though it was heated it was awfully cold. We also ate at the restaurant in the hotel. The kids meals were bigger than expected - came with fries and fruit! Kids loved it and the adults even thought it all looked/smelled good. Adults all got bacon cheeseburgers. They were delicious. Overall the hotel was clean and staff was great.

Text: Would highly recommend staying here.  We had car troubles and the staff were so accommodating, friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and the 6th floor lounge was what we needed to make our stay even better!

Text: Love the concierge lounge for platinum and gold members! Staff is very personable and friendly. Reovated rooms are nice! Restaurant is closed for renovation but you can eat in the bar area. Once renovation is complete it will be perfect!

Text: The pool is nicely heated but the hot tub was scorching. The single king rooms are very nice but the bathrooms are a little small.
