Text: A lot of large and nice homes. Shingle and vinyl, one of the only parks in town that includes water with your lot rent. One of the best parks in Springfield at this point. Many of the bad reviews are older from previous park owner. There is a new owner who is kicking out bad people and trying to make the place nice again. You don't get lot numbers, you get an actual street address.

Text: I lived here back in 09 and it was a damn mess! No one carried, the roads were horrible and management didn't care!! Since the new owners took over they redid the roads, kicked out everyone that was causing problems, being loud, not paying rent, or caring for their house/yard. The owners are very visible & you can tell the difference now. Carol the owner plays no games & will tell you flat out she doesn't! She demands the lots be kept up & if you cause problems you get a warning then the next time your out! It's definitely a place to stay when your grown, working, have a family, and live a normal life. If your one that parties, loud, fights with your spouse all the time, have bad kids, or lives nasty I wouldn't waste your time or money because she will kick you out. I've been her a few years and I love it.
