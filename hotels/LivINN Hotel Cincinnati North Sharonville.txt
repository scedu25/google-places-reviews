LivINN Hotel Cincinnati North/Sharonville
Rating: 5
Text: We reserved two rooms for our family which included six children ages 16 down to 2 years old. We mainly slept and ate breakfast at the hotel as we had planned visits to the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum during the day. Our rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic with choices everyone could enjoy. We appreciated an affordable option that did not sacrifice quality. The entire family gave this LivINN hotel two thumbs up!

Text: My boyfriend and I (we're from New Jersey) was in Ohio the last weekend in September, and we literally had no idea where we were going to stay. While driving through Cleveland heading to Cincinnati we found a room at this hotel! The rate was low, and we were able to get a king size bed. Not knowing anything about this hotel besides the reviews, we were amazed. The staff was super nice, the room was very clean, and spacious, and not the mention the wide variety of breakfast options. We loved it here. If we're ever visiting in Cincinnati again we will be staying here!!

Text: Wonderful hotel at a budget price! The complimentary free breakfast consists of a wide variety of foods. Make-your-own pancakes, yogurt, cereal, a variety of pastries, sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, as well as biscuits and gravy allow most people to choose something to his/her tastes and preferences. The rooms are thoroughly clean and offer plenty of space. A mini refrigerator capable of storing three two-liter soda bottles and a carousel microwave are more than adequate for heating leftovers or preparing simple meals and snacks. Desk area with accompanying chair, drawers, two side-by-side mini closets, and a rather spacious counter allow for plentiful and organized storage opportunities. The beds consist of comfortable pillow-top mattresses, decent pillows, and satisfactory sheets and bedding in order to provide for a restful sleeping experience. Would definitely stay again if I found myself in the area!

Text: Nice hotel with good location. Rooms were clean and nicely maintained. Could not utilize swimming or any other amenities due to time constraints but seems nice. Breakfast was good.
