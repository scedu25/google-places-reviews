Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel Windsor
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel was quiet and clean...its is under renovations.. I see this a a good thing. The room are quite small and the bathroom is not made for two to get ready at once. I like a more stiff bed with lots of support and that was exactly the bed I got... this hotel is completely non smoking. Parking is very limited and you will be towed if in an opposing businesses parking so be careful... I wish hotels had better cable TV option.

Text: I stayed for a night. Room was dirty. Carpet was stickey. Hotel didn't clean the floor. Very small bathroom. Wall paint colour made me sick. Rent was expensive as compared to room quality. Breakfast was free and good but no egg.

Text: Highly rated because of excellent value for the money.  Clean comfotable rooms.  Reno / refresh makes it a very nice interior.  Continental breakfast buffet has all the basics

Text: We were just looking for a cheap place to sleep for the night, and this fit the bill. The room smelled a little musty and the whole place felt a bit run down. However, the hotel was under renovation, so they may be addressing those issues. Tldr; if you need a cheap clean bed to sleep in, it will work fine. But I can't recommend it for longer stays.

Text: Very worn, stained and dirty. My wife was bitten in the back after being in bed for 15 minutes. We found black bugs in both beds. We checked in very late at night and had no energy to call the front desk and change rooms. We let the front desk know about the bugs in our bed but we're told we had to contact the owner to complain. After two attempts to ask for a response from the owner, we were told that an exterminator check the room and didn't find anything. I strongly suggest you don't stay at this dump.
