Text: Nice and quiet place. Very family friendly. They have a boat launch, swings and a merry go round. There's an old school ice cream truck that stops by periodically.

Text: Not off the beaten  path so some road noise at times.It has great lake access which you can't find at that many campgrounds all for reasonable prices & owners keep the place nice. They are easy to work with I've stayed here monthly 2 summers now . Showers & bathrooms kept in good working order .
