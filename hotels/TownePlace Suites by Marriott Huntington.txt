Text: This hotel is well maintained and clean. The suite (we stayed in a two bedroom) was small but adequate. Beds were a bit too soft for my taste. Definitely a good choice for those staying longer, as the mini kitchenette is well stocked. We would stay again if in the Huntington area.

Text: Love this place! Very spacious rooms and friendly staff. The breakfast offered included waffles, boiled eggs, yogurts, cereal, juices and coffee. WiFi is easy to use and there is even laundry on site for those who need some clean clothes. If you have to stay longer than one night there is a kitchenette and a lovely desk, as well as ample closet space. Everything is very clean and in place each time I have visited. It's very refreshing to stay and recharge in a place I can settle into during a long trip. I love this place!
