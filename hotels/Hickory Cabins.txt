Hickory Cabins

Text: Unique and well-appreciated stay!  The only place to stay near MCNP in my opinion; we stayed in Nutmeg cabin for two nights while visiting the park.  It was fun to take the ferry across the river to get here.  The cabin is down a private lane and shares the plot with one other cabin - it is very quiet at night.  The craftsmanship of the cabin was fantastic, though the bathroom was cramped and the bed was pretty creaky.  Wifi was spotty too but we didn't go there to surf the web. We really took advantage of the kitchen, charcoal grill, and hot tub.  It was great to eat dinner on the private deck.  Would definitely recommend to any couple or a couple with one child (sleep in loft) looking for a quiet and secluded place to stay.  Also of note - there are a couple small convenience stores that sell a bit of everything except beer - this is a dry county!
