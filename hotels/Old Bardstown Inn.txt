Old Bardstown Inn
Rating: 3
Text: Mediocre small hotel with pricing to match quality. Clean rooms with firm, adequately comfortable beds. Bedding seemed to be the cheapest possible, as did the towels. The breakfast served was almost laughable, but with only four cars in the parking lot overnight, I can't say I was surprised.

Text: Room was relatively clean, but still too expensive for what you're getting. Towels were stained but seemed clean enough to use. They don't allow smoking, but people smoke on the benches outside the rooms and it gets sucked into your air conditioner. One thing that irritated me a little was the advertised breakfast. It consisted of 6 pieces of toast (which were not replaced the second day), three sesame-seed bagels, and two small fruit danishes (the one I had was stale). There was also two kinds of cereal, some milk, and some orange juice. I wasn't expecting bacon and eggs... but they could have made a better showing; maybe some fruit or something.

Text: It was clean, give the lady who cleans 5 stars, as for the free breakfast, there was no free breakfast. We had to get our own breakfast. Shower was good, AC was good. No one told me breakfast was from 7-9am, we got in late and didn't get up til shortly before 9. Most hotels have breakfast until 10-10:30

Text: Pleasant service, okay room. Really musty smell in the room, but I assume they're not used to be being so full, and couldn't turn on the a/c for all their rooms.  Didn't do breakfast, but again, clean room, friendly service.

Text: Stayed at the Inn after tent flooded while camping. Staff was polite even with 3am check in, but the bed wasnt the cleanest and the room smelt muggy. Door dead bolt didn't work and chain lock had been torn from wall previously, made it feel somewhat unsafe. Works in a pinch but wouldn't stay here if I didn't have to.
