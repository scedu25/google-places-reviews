Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Bloomington
Rating: 5
Text: I didn't personally stay here, but when my family comes in from out of state they always stay at this hotel. Hotel is clean, smells fresh, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. They have also stayed at a couple other hotels in the area, but told me they will always choose Hawthorne Suites from now on and would recommend it to others.

Text: We were surprised to see how spacious and well furnished our room was -- and how affordable! We've paid more for hotel rooms, but never had one so big. It had a full fridge and stove, too, so we could have stayed comfortably for quite a few nights. The kids loved the pool, too. We booked it based on a Google search while we were already en route, but next time, we'd seek it out.

Text: Hotel had a great location that was easy to find off the interstate. The room had a nice layout and was quiet and comfortable. Unfortunately, the blackout curtains did not cover the whole windows, which meant it got really bright as soon as the sun came up. It made it very difficult to sleep when the sun was up. Hot breakfast had plenty of delicious options. They had eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, and sausage, along fruit, cereal, and assorted breads while we were there. The pool was probably great, although there was never a time that there weren't too many rowdy kids in the water (including, but not limited to, all the way up to closing time and first thing in the morning). Constantly getting splashed by someone else's kids (while their parents were nowhere to be found) was a major disappointment. 9/10 would stay here again.

Text: Decent hotel. Clean. Nice fitness room and pool. Litter bar and some slots. Next to nothing except the highway.

Text: The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. Nice pool and good breakfast.  The breakfast area is rather small with not much seating and they ran out of some foods while we were there. I'm giving 5 stars because I feel that they excelledwhere it mattered most.
