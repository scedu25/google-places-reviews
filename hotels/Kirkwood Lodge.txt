Kirkwood Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Attendance was for my husband's company picnic. It was thoroughly enjoyable. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and very well manicured. The staff was very friendly and professional. It was a beautiful breezy sunny day and I spent most of my time relaxing lakeside soaking up the gorgeous views of the Lake of the Ozarks and enjoying the company of friends. I was blown away by wide array of family friendly activities? available for our enjoyment. The exerience was like taking a trip back in time. An absolutely impressive venue and I am looking forward to a return visit.

Text: Built in 1939, the Kirkwood Lodge has a maze of stairs, a tram that rides 4-6 people down to lake, lots of potted flowers, and lion statues.  There are 65 rooms, about 80% have lake view!  Its a great place to relax and get a bit of exercise up and down the steps.  A must for Ozark Lake lovers.  Boat rentals and slips available

Text: Great experience for Senior trip kids! Had a blast on the lake, rented a boat, did some fishing. Salad bar was fresh and BEST homemade ranch dressing. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Great experience!

Text: Might possibly be the worst hotel in the state of Missouri.  I had to rent bed sheets for $25 (never saw that money again).  Was charged over 100 dollars for "cleaning charges" because there was a piece of gum on the nightstand.  It's also a really cool place if you like finding worms in your bed. The only cool part about this hotel is that it is on the lake so they earned a solid 1 star from me.

Text: We have come to Kirkwood Lodge once a year for the past 20 years for a week of great C3A challenge square dancing. This is a rustic facility but the staff are caring, food is good and the lake front is nice. We'll be back next year.
