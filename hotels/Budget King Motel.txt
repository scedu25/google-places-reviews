Budget King Motel
Rating: 4
Text:  This inexpensive motel has an Asian feel to the decor. The sheets were soft. The place was clean. I loved the ice too. Unfortunately, some dilapidated vehicles were stored near our door. One, however, had an engine that ran very loudly. The walls were so thin that we could hear the light switch in the next room.
