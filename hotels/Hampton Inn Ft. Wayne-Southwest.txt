Hampton Inn Ft. Wayne-Southwest
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is undergoing remodeling. The staff was very apologetic about it even though it did not interfere with my stay at all. Breakfast was outstanding!! I slept well too. Mattress is outstanding and the room dark and quiet. I'll be back since my daughters have two more years of college.

Text: This was a lovely room and included a large hot tub. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had just been in a Crown Plaza hotel at a considerably higher cost. The Hampton Inn was much nicer. Much!

Text: This is an older Hampton. It has been "freshened up" to feel newer but the property is showing its age.

What sets it apart is the people. Everyone I met was nice and inviting. No issues what-so-ever. I would stay again. 

I only "dinged" it one star due to the property feeling old. 

Side note, no HBO. Only Showtime. Also, they have a very nice outdoor patio.

Text: It's a decent hotel. I've been staying here for over a month for work with very few issues. The mini-fridge wasn't working, they brought up a replacement in 15 minutes. The shower was draining slowly, they sent someone to fix it even though I kept forgetting to ask. Decent amount of TV channels, and the free internet speed isn't bad. Good enough to stream video in HD. Currently doing some renovations to the hallways, lobby, and pool area. They don't work past 6, and they do a petty good job cleaning up, so it shouldn't be disruptive to your stay.
