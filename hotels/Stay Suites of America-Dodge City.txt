Stay Suites of America-Dodge City
Rating: 5
Text: Great stay!! Was able to get a room before regular check in time thanks to the gentleman working the front desk (Drew). Not only did he not charge me extra he gave me an upgraded room since it was ready to go when I arrived.  Nice T.V., microwave, mini fridge, cold A/C and comfy beds!

Text: I booked Stay America from just a online site and man we're we pleased and surprised. It was clean, very nice, and updated décor and the breakfast bar was very good. It looked a bit plain but we were so very happy with the nice room, comfortable beds, and the quiet pleasant stay we had...would definitely recommend travelers to stay here.

Text: Upon arrival, the room had a smell to it that was somewhere between alcohol and being closed up for awhile.
The room looked nice, we opened the windows to air out. The sheer was torn at the handle down.
We went to the pool area, the hot tub was barely going and not very hot. The pool was a green color of which we were told it was the chemicals they use.
The hot tub, also was a weird color and felt kinda slimy feel. We didn't attempt it again.
Staff were friendly

Text: Initial impression upon arrival was promising. The lobby looked inviting, our room was spacious and looked conducive to both relaxing and getting work done. Staff was friendly. Unfortunately, though, the hotel was smelly, in general, and our bathroom, although it looked pretty clean, smelled like a gym locker. We found mildew in the tub and also all around the inside of the window frame of our room window. Breakfast was also subpar. But, the big thing was the constant unpleasant smells.
