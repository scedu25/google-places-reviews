Text: Decent place, but we had to beg the owners to open the pool (on Memorial Day weekend when all the kids wanted to do was swim). 2 days in a row we were told the pool would be closed..only after asking repeatedly did they finally open it. They said the pump was broken, and spent a lot of time sitting around drinking beer and smoking cigarettes rather than 'fixing it'. Luckily the pool was magically fixed after a couple of hours. Also, if you're looking to take children, keep in mind that they had a band until after 11pm that could be heard through the entire campground, and cars/trucks/golf carts going up and down the roads at all hours of the day and night. We made the most of our trip and enjoyed it for the most part...but will not return to this campground.
