AmericInn Lodge & Suites Sioux City — Airport

Text: We loved everything about our stay! The front desk clerk was awesome. He was friendly and very helpful. 
This hotel is beautifully decorated. The pool and spa area is clean and large enough to serve many guests at once. The location is very convenient as well! It's right off the interstate and close to shopping and many nearby dining options.
The price was a surprise to us, but we feel in the end it was worth it. I'm told that the price is actually very competitive during the Sturgis Rally, so no harm, no foul.

Text: Easy access right off the highway and a light down. A few miles outside the city center, so if you want to go to the casino, you will need a taxi unless you don't drink. The room was absolutely huge, it was 2 rooms in 1 it seemed. The breakfast wasn't too bad either, standard fair of cereal, waffles and eggs.

Text: I thought it was very good service. Everyone was friendly and the beds were clean and comfortable. Bathroom was nice and clean as well. The only problem would be my bedside lamp didn't work. But it was great!

Text: Nice clean rooms and friendly staff. Good breakfast, they had strawberry waffle batter and strawberries & whipped cream to top it off! Felt like a home away from home.
