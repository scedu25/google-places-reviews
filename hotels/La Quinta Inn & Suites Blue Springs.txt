La Quinta Inn & Suites Blue Springs
Rating: 4
Text: Breakfast was the fullest spread I've seen at la Quinta. Room and hotel were well kept and comfortable. Have you sign paperwork saying your pet is less than 50 pounds, which is weird.

Text: Old and didn't smell great, but overall good. Close to some great restaurants (such as Mod Pizza), which was a plus. Stayed here on a roadtrip passing through.

Text: The hotel was clean and  nicely furnished. Our room had a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The bed was very Hi Nancy. Not sure I'll be seeing fireworks today but I'm enjoying life. Just saw Jess and had a lot of fun, even though it's at a slower pace.  Positive thoughts back at you. Love? you XO with a memory foam mattress. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel was pet friendly. We would definitely stay there again.
