McGrady Inn
Rating: 5
Text: The inn is a very well-done renovation of an old church.  If you like mission/Craftsman style architecture, you'll enjoy staying here.  The owner was friendly and helpful, greeting us at the door to show us to our room and explain the amenities.  We spent a wonderful night here, sleeping quite soundly.  Highly recommended.

Text: I booked the whole Inn by reserving 3 rooms for my wedding party & family. I received confirmation and everything. Two months later I received a phone call and they stated they accidentally booked someone else (and their entire wedding & reception) at the Inn! I was really upset. I booked the rooms 5 months in advance of my wedding and thought that was adequate. Because of their mistake, I'm now searching for other lodging in the area (which is limited)! I had no choice and the owner cancelled my reservation! I'm disappointed with their poor customer service and professionalism. I guess it's all about money, when it comes down to it, not your word.
