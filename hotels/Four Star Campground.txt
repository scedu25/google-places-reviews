Text: Id change the name to Two Star Campground. Staff was friendly, except the guy cleaning the bathrooms. Not much to do here. Could use a upgrade. Dirty pool.

Text: The campers were way too close together. We had no picnic table. No fire pit. Our spot was a literal mud hole, so bad we ended up folding a Jack in half. We stayed in our camper for the night and pulled out the next day. I didn't talk to the staff so I can't say much on that behalf but I wasn't impressed with this place. The only positive comment I can leave is the restrooms and showers were clean. Its "year round" camping because it is a trailer park. There were dogs running all over we were so close to our neighbor we couldn't of put our awning out if we wanted to. Needless to say we won't be back here again. Lesson learned

Text: Camped out here for 10 years. We loved it there. The people are great. The Owners and staff are wonderful and it's the perfect place to kick back and relax.No Snobs on Snob Hill. If you want to camp and relax and meet some great folks, then this is the place. Since we've left Illinois, I'm having a hard time finding a place like 4 Star...
