Peace of Earth Lodge

Text: The lodge and cabins are lovely and the owners are nice, but our experience was slightly strange. I had talked with my daughter on our private cabin enclosed porch about how good asparagus sounded. The next morning, the owner made me a fresh asparagus omelet... Almost as if he'd read my mind or had been listening. Aside from that, it's a wonderful getaway! However, perhaps I wouldn't go on my honeymoon in case the cabins aren't actually private if you know what I mean.

Text: Beautiful lodge in a woodsy area with trails and garden fresh foods for breakfast. I did their dish installation and they are extremely nice and caring people. Id recommended anyone to this place. If you just want a nice quiet place for just getting away or mini vacation, id recommended you try this place atleast once. And ask for a tour bc there are a few more things i know i have forgotten.
