Text: Sleezy, will not answer the phone. Unclean. Disrespectful, and a lot of immortal practices.

Text: Old hotel which definitely needs updating.No non-smoking rooms available so had to keep door open as much as possible to air the room out. Had two doors, one leading to the parking lot (which I like) and one to the inner hallway leading to front desk and dining area. Breakfast was okay with a fairly wide variety. They had eggs over easy, potatoes, sausage, hard-boiled eggs, two choices of cereal, yogurt, oatmeal with toppings, a pancake machine (which was out of order one day), biscuits & gravy, three types of bread for toast, some fresh whole fruit, and orange & apple juice. It was a little noisy as the rooms basically have a wall of glass rather than just a window. Strictly a working man's hotel or for the traveler who just needs a fairly inexpensive place to stay. The staff that I dealt with were friendly enough.  I was there three days and the WIFI NEVER WORKED. This was a major disadvantage because I was there to work and needed internet access. The desk kept saying they would reset the router but it never helped.

Text: We were there Friday night and had a great time. We had dinner inside the bar and grille. Everything came out in a timely manner and was cooked perfectly. The bartender Cheryl was great and super friendly. The entire staff there was nice and helpful. We will be going back and enjoying Legends again. I highly recommend trying it out.

Text: Really unpleasant. Old, tired two story motel.
The room was dingy, dirty and dim. Needs a complete makeover or, better yet, a bulldozer. There was a door which fortunately was locked that opened onto thin air. The staff was fine but the hotel needs to go.

Text: It looks rugged from the outside but everything on the inside is excellent. Hot breakfast, friendly staff. Would stay again.
