Text: If you pay $120 a night and you can't have  guess /family mwmbers to visit you for a couple hours . I would completely understand that they can't stay a night there or mess with stuff but they treat you like a child .  Tell you can't have anyone visiting you.  The person was staying there drove 9 hours to visit for 3 days and they weren't allowed to have a family member to see them and sit down and talk for awhile . I give this place a BIG F- .

Text: Really good food.  The potato soup is the best I have ever had.  Salads are fresh, desserts tasty.  Smallish eating area.  Convenient hours, and nice people work there.
