American Inn and suites
Rating: 5
Text: Very welcoming and helpful front desk. Lots of historical facts and memorabilia from surrounding areas. Easy access to stations, food, etc. Would highly recommend for this area.

Text: Good morning the room was nice the price was high the breakfast well it was a free breakfast. The pool was closed and not sure why if the pool would have been open it would have got a 5-star rating alright maybe a 4

Text: Dirty towels, pool closed, weak AC, terrible hygiene products. However despite all the cons the rooms are decent with comfortable beds. Good place for the price

Text: Impromptu road trip and was the only room left in a 25 mile radius.

Creepy.....a “suite” in the basement, drop ceiling tiles, jacuzzi with a chair next to it creepy. 

Drain in the shower was insanely slow to drain...ick.

And, ya’d think a hotel (I use the word hotel loosely) with Ameri in the name would have the American flag on the flagpole out front...

Next time we head to Dubuque area, will book weeks in advance....impromptu won’t work there.
