Text: primitive sites have a lot of great amenities:  Fire pits, lidded trash can, picnic table, lots of trees (hammocking) and a free how shower to boot.  i saw another review who had expressed concerns over wild dogs.  i did not have that same experience.  i heard two dogs that sounded like they were barking from private residences and they quieted down after 10 pm.  i've camped many sites along the katy trail/morit and am currently rating roundhouse the best spot for camping.
