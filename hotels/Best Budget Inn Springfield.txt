Text: Housekeeping is very polite and tries to keep everything neat and clean. Has a good attitude towards people. I stayed again for a couple days and it was very nice place.

Text: They are not cheap and not the best for price. Weekly rates almost $300 and $80 per night. Good things are 2 beds have 2 separate rooms so it a ideal for multi party stays or families with kids. Close to highway, several food stops and shopping.

Text: Stayed for a total of 2 hours. Tv didn't work, no wifi, busted ac, the headboard fell off of the wall onto my husband and I. It was also disgusting. I can deal with all of that. But after getting my kids laid down and asleep. We are about to get into bed ourselves and lifted the blanket and a syringe falls out. That drew the line for me so we left and told the office worker. He didn't look surprised and wouldn't even give our money back! Never again!
