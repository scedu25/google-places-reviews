Text: If I could, I'd go here every weekend! Beautiful rooms and the best breakfast I've ever had. Quiet and comfortable but fancy and very tastefully decorated. The owners became friends very quickly.

Text: We loved our stay at the Wampler House! Donna and Zachary were the greatest hosts! The house was immaculately clean, cozy, and welcoming. We were treated to homemade cookies as we toured and the breakfast the next morning was equally delicious. We can't wait to go back!

Text: Amazing bed and breakfast and so much more! We had such a wonderful visit and the owners Donna and Zack went above and beyond to exceed our expectations.  The rooms are luxurious and the extra large jetted Jacuzzis are the perfect way to unwind and end the day.  Having the fireplace in the room was also a luxury as the temperature dropped at night while we were visiting.  Nothing is left out here at the wampler house. We will back for sure!

Text: We had a great stay at the Wampler House this past weekend while in Bloomington! The house is absolutely gorgeous, warm and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. We felt very welcome by Zack, Donna and of course the sweet Poppy! They are great people. The room was very clean and comfortable. We highly recommend the Wampler House and look forward to coming back soon.
