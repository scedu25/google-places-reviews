Text: This is a beautiful B&B in a quiet setting. The rooms were very nice and the breakfasts really couldn't have been better. We'll be back.

Text: The barn is beautiful as well as the Inn! Beyond the venue the owners were absolutely awesome to work with! They had tables and chairs set up perfectly for our wedding. Kristen was very responsive to questions and had tips on what usually works best! I would definitely recommend to anyone!

Text: Our stay was outstanding.  Even thought they had a wedding planned that evening  and Kristen told us the music would be going till 11 that night there were no issues whatsoever.  Room was clean, bed was comfortable, wifi worked great and DVD library was very good.  Breakfast the next morning was excellent.  If your in the Middlebury area and looking for a B&B this is the place to go. We will be back.

Text: Our wedding day was perfect!  Kristen is awesome and if you do not have a wedding planner (I didn't) she made sure to ask all the right questions and always answered any questions I had.  We had about 170 people and did not feel crowded at all.  The band sounded great in the barn!  We rented all the rooms that night and woke up to an amazing breakfast the next morning!  We couldn't have asked for a better venue or nicer people :) Thank you!

Text: Our experience was with the barn was for a wedding reception. It was rustic, clean and roomy. There was no a/c but it was well ventilated and far from being uncomfortable. The Polish Dinner was excellent.
