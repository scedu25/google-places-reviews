Bass' River Resort
Rating: 4
Text: As with most private camp destinations in the area, I expect to pay a little more than at State run parks. And I know that I am going to be sharing the property with many more people. 

I have been to Bass a few times over the years and have always enjoyed my visit. Place seems to be continually making improvements. I've stayed in a different parts of the park each visit and all have had nice features (proximity to water, open grass play areas, volley ball courts or pavilions). 

The bathroom(s) & showers were well maintained over the holiday weekend during my most recent visit, which is a BIG reason why I keep coming back.

Text: Wow, what an amazing place to just go and unwind. My son and I just came back from two amazing day's there. This is not your typical "camp ground" . The owners and more importantly staff take a lot of pride in keeping the properly top notch. The moment for me was when I observed EVERY morning employee cleaning the shower and toilet stalls. All but one were under 18 years of age. In a day of entitled youth, this was great to see. The staff was engaging  and eager to help. With this kind of customer service Bass River Resort will be around for another 50 years!

Text: My entire family stays in one of their beautiful 16 man cabins every year. This last weekend was our third year, we check in early with no problems, the floats are beautiful in which the accommodate accordingly. We go, drink, float, stay, then leave. Never a problem, clean, quiet times, security checks on everyone I would recommend this resort to anyone.

Text: My family stayed in the 200's family camp area. Get a shady spot and you can jump in the river almost from any of those spots. Been there twice this year and going again in September for my birthday! Cleanest bathrooms and showers at any campground I've been to in my 34 years.
