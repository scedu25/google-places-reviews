Millstream Resort Motel
Rating: 5
Text: We chose to park our 33-foot RV in one of the two spaces they have available.  We could not be happier.  They have all utilities and plenty of shade on all sides.  Just two blocks north of downtown Cottonwood Falls,  nestled right up against the river right off the main Street.

Text: Owners are great people. Rooms are fun and retro. Try to stay in the standalone cabin! River views and sounds are so calming. Easy walk to the restaurant.

Text: My husband and I just stayed in this wonderful motel June 22, 2016, for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I can't say enough about how incredible the motel, the hosts and the town's people are. I loved everything about it. The motel very well maintained and the hosts felt like family before we left.  We stayed in the cabin which was absolutely gorgeous. Some might say that it is a tad small but we loved it. The host gave us a tour of the other rooms and they are all equally as gorgeous. To top it all off, just a few steps to the waters edge and there is a waterfall, right there on the property.I cannot wait to go back and stay again.

Text: Sharon and Richard are the greatest hostess and host you'll ever meet. The rooms are tidy, comfy,  and Sharon has furnished each room with a real sense of funky style. This is a little piece of paradise!

Text: We were given a tour as we were walking by and it is a very nice rustic place to stay. We are looking forward to staying there over night sometime.
