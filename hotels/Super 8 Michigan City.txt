Super 8 Michigan City
Rating: 3
Text: My stay at this hotel was what I expect for any Super 8. The room had been newly remodeled. It was small, but clean and serves it's purpose. I had little interaction with the hotel staff. But, they seemed friendly enough.

Text: It's been awhile since I've been here. Good deal for the price. Nothing fancy, but presentable. Hopefully it will be the same when I return.

Text: Very nice motel for a good price. Nice, clean, updated room, friendly stuff. Comfortable  beds, cable tv, fridge and microwave in the room. There is no reason to look for something else if you spend most of time at the beach. Highly recommend.
