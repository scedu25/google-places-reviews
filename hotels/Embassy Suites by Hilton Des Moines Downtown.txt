Embassy Suites by Hilton Des Moines Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: Front desk staff member Cameron was best hotel concierge worker I have ever met. Valet worker explained other parking options in the area and offered to give directions. Breakfast was busy but plates were cleared quickly and tables turned over well. Only issue was bacon and sausage was kept behind the omelet line counter not on the main buffet line so you had to wait in mind with the omelet folks and the chef did not seem thrilled to be working alone.

Text: We were out walking our dog and we need to use the facilities. It is a beautiful spot to stay in. The waterfall is amazing and everything was very ornate! It is right next to the amphitheatre and the Des Moines River. It is right by downtown and the Court Ave district for some good eats! It has valet. It can be pretty pricey depending on when you go, but for where you are staying it is fair.

Text: Our gospel/jazz group just played here at NAACP banquet. Friendly and very accommodating staff. Banquet food was ok, but I'm a Chef and probably a little picky. Good place to stay or even visit with the growing East Village right there.

Text: Easily accessible, with valet parking as well. The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable. Room service is prompt and good quality. I would highly recommend this hotel to those staying in the Des Moines area. The banquet room was spacious as well, accommodated our large party, tables, and dance floor for the usmc birthday ball.

Text: I cannot say enough about the managers and staff at this hotel. I had a very big snag in my travel plans while staying here and everyone from the front desk staff to the valet made sure that I had what I needed to solve the problem. They were exceptionally accommodating and helped me through every detail even though they were busy and I was working with a rigid schedule. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers.
