Text: The restrooms were clean and the campground was quiet. Lots of trees to hang a hammock and to cover the tent. Also plenty of space between campsites. The hosts and staff were very friendly. Our new favorite place to spend the weekend. What a gem!

Text: We really liked this place. Campsites are large and placed amongst a mature forest. Everyone was friendly and helpful, and we had a great time camping over the Labor Day weekend.

Text: Very nice camp ground but I don't understand why the tent camping is on rocks. We spent the first 2 hours trying to get out tent staked in the ground

Text: Used to camp at paynetown with the kids, but haven't been back since we visited this campground. Excellent beach, not as crowded. Camping spots are much more rustic and in the woods. Kids love it, so do we.
