Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Bloomingdale
Rating: 3
Text: It was neat and clean, but service was lacking.  Here for a memorial service.  Boomed two rooms together and asked for rooms near one another on the same floor.  Confirmed this upon check in, but when Uncle checked in, they had given away his confirmed room.  No do not disturb sign in the room.  Second time things like this have happened in this hotel and while we love Marriott, will not be back to this particular Courtyard.

Text: I’ve stayed here a handful of times and have never had bad service. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well stocked, the hotel is lovely, and the staff is fantastic. Good breakfast in the AM. My daughter and her friends stayed before and after Prom, and the staff was very accommodating. Very well worth the money, especially for a ‘budget’ hotel.

Text: Nice lobby and bar. Staff screwed up my registration and didn't know what room I was in, tried to get in in the middle of the night. Not great.

Text: The room and hotel were very clean and fresh.  I fell asleep faster than planned.  Head hit the pillow and bam - I was out.  My room had a balcony overlooking trees and a lake.  Watched geese fly over the lake at sunset.  It was peaceful and relaxing.  Also, breakfast was just right.  Coffee in room and the in-room toiletries were quality.  The Jacuzzi was clean and hot.   I cannot complain.
