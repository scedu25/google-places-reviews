New Victorian Suites

Text: This was an amazing place to stay number 1 and the value was excellent number 2! The location is very convenient. Not a really crowded area so you get an excellent nights sleep, but close to anything you could wish for, eateries, groceries, coffee shops etc. It is a family owned small chain I have found out and you can tell. The attention to detail and the friendliness of the staff, were awesome! They helped me a great deal as I was not familiar with Lincoln. Rooms were clean and well kept as was the pool. The kids had a great time and so did we! I now make it a point to stay at New Victorian's whenever I am in one of the towns they have hotels in. I have not stayed in all of them yet, but I will sooner or later. This is what a hotel should be like! Thanks

Text: Location is nice, Hy-Vee and other stores right across the street. I stayed in their single room. Very spacious bed. The shower was nice and the room itself was large enough where you didn't feel crowded. I thought it was pretty expensive but could have been raised because Luke Bryan was in town.
