Text: We came in late to stay overnight so I can't speak to all of the amenities but the hotel was in the perfect location for an overnight guest who wanted to spend the day in Louisville and then head north the next day. The hotel was full, so finding a seat at breakfast was a little hard but they had a pretty good selection. The room was very clean and spacious. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Close to I-65,  many restaurants, a mall and other stores. Very consistent chain. This location was safe and clean. Staff knows they are in the hospitality business. Breakfast was not great so went to IHOP.
