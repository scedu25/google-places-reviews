Text: Thay said thay have a pool on their website but they don't very false advertising and the rooms are not nice. The pictures aren't even of the hotel. They stole pictures and used them. And the whole place just looked dirty and unsafe.

Text: This is no fancy Hotel, but it is a very decent Motel. I don't know why this place is getting the low reviews, it's a nice place to spend the night.

Text: The rooms are ok, beds are SMALL. Hard to fit one adult and one child onto one dbl bed. Walls are thick you can't hear what's going on outside or next door that is nice. Their complementary breakfast has a veey nice variety and kept stocked very well. Unfortunately, when we stayed the pool was broken? I guess! But we were not to far from Cedar Point like a half mile to a mile. One major problem was we stayed with our son's travel baseball league and we booked through them. Well, when we got here we were charged 40 more than expected. It took a lot of grief to get the original quoted price.
