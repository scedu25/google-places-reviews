Text: It's a nice place. Good views if camping or just driving around. Decent sized lake is gorgeous. Lots of people boating and fishing. Camping area with archery area. Restrooms are all around. Marina near the lake. There's kyak rentals. In the hunting season this is a popular place because it is state grounds where hunting is permitted.
