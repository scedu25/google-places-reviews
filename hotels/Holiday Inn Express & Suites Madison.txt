Holiday Inn Express & Suites Madison

Text: I have never before seen so many stains in a hotel. The floor has weird stains. The bedding was cleaned I guess, but was old enough that previous stains faintly showed through. There was a dead bug smashed on the mirror. The rest of room was run down too. The tile by the back door is all busted up and from what I've heard it's been that way for a while now. Some one was using a broken off piece to prop open the door. If you have to stop and you like the car you drove there with, I'd just suggest sleeping there for the night and continuing on your way in the morning.

Text: Room wasn't very clean. Used bandage on the air vent. Hair in the bathroom floor, on the toilet, and in the tub. Tub would not drain water. Phone was broke so I couldn't even call the front desk. The only nice thing was the staff. If it weren't for ever other hotel being booked I would have left.

Text: Friendly staff, clean rooms, nice location! Keegan at front desk was especially helpful in giving us suggestions for local restaurants. Very friendly and courteous! Only cons of stay were dripping sounds from above room's AC unit and shortage of outlets in room. But otherwise excellent stay!

Text: Super friendly and clean... they were genuinely concerned about our happiness. Literally minutes walk from everything even Walmart ( which is also awesome especially the new co manager kendra who knew EVERYTHING about the store)

Text: We were here to visit family. The room was really nice. The breakfast was typical free hotel breakfast. Pretty good value for the pice we got.
