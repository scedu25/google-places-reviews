Sunny Brook Cabin Rentals

Text: The worst experience we have ever had!!! We called in July to reserve the cabin for a week in November because we have a small child and wanted somewhere he could get out and play.  They took our payment information and confirmed we were able to stay.  Fast forward to October, my husband calls to reconfirm and provide them with updated information as our card was fraudulently used and we find out they will no longer rent on a weekly basis just either 6 months or a year lease.... Needless to say we are happy to not be staying here now as they were not capable of calling us and telling us we couldn't stay there no longer we had to find out by an answering machine. It's sad they chose to treat people that way and couldn't make a quick phone call when they decided to change their mind so we could make alternate plans. Thanks for ruining our family trip and forcing us to find an entirely different place to even visit.
