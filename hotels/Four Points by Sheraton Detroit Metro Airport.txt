Four Points by Sheraton Detroit Metro Airport
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel seemed nice, but I didn't go into any of the rooms. I had dinner at the restaurant there. I had the mahi tacos and they were delicious. It didn't come with any sides, but we're filling enough in their own. They have a large selection of draft beer. I think they had around 20 taps. I'd eat here again if I'm back in the area.

Text: Excellent bar and restaurant.  Mac and cheese with Brisket is incredible.  Refrigerator & microwave in room.

Text: Room is clean and service is fine, however, the TVs don't have HDMI inputs! It's the year 2017 and some people travel with their own media to hookup. Now I'm stuck here all weekend with an Xbox that I can't use. Great! Time to upgrade the TVs!

Text: I'll start by saying that four points and this four points in particular has had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in a hotel. I've stayed at many many different brands within Marriott and Starwood and this blows any of them out of the water. The hotel is clean, staff is excellent. I want to point out Veronica in particular. She has served me breakfast every day so far (I've stayed 2 weeks) and she has been nothing but a delite every morning. She has represented this hotel and this company in the best way possible. Definitely would recommend this hotel.

Text: You would think that Sheraton is a 4Star  hotel, but this is just a basic one. Much like America's Best Inn or Motel 6. Front desk staff is great though.
