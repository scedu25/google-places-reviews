Wolcott Rest Area Southbound

Text: Firstly, the ramp and road surface was in horrible shape. Potholes and bumpy. For a state that prides itself on its auto racing it was miserable (as was most of I-65 and I-70!!). Bathroom was old and dank. Compared to neighboring states like IL and OH, they should be embarrassed. My only compliment was that their rest areas are well spaced on the highway to prevent fatigue.
