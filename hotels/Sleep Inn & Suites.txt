Sleep Inn & Suites

Text: Really excellent customer service at this hotel! I reserved a room block for our wedding in Iowa City, and the manager, Jason, was far and away my favorite vendor to work with. He gave us very reasonable rates, even on a Hawkeye home game weekend. He was super helpful throughout the whole experience responding to questions (via email or phone) almost immediately. Thanks so much for making this a stress free experience!

Text: The Sleep Inn & Suites of Mount Vernon Iowa was a perfect place to stay. We had a family wedding and it was situated close to everything. The rooms were spacious, beds extremely comfortable and accommodations very clean. I am extremely picky and this Sleep Inn exceeded my expectations. Definitely the place to stay!

Text: Love this hotel~ especially perfect for anyone visiting Cornell College. The staff is very friendly & helpful,  (especially JJ!), and the breakfast is better than the other Sleep Inn properties I have visited. They have a pool,  hot tub,  laundry room, ice machine, and plenty of parking on both sides of the building. There's a Hardee's, Subway,  Dairy Queen, a Mexican Restaurant, and an ATM machine at thw bank all within 2 blocks. There's also a grocery store another block or so away, plus a gas station/convenience store that has hot fresh pizza whole or by the slice plus freshly made deli sandwiches. 
I've stayed here off and on for 4 years,  and the hotel is always clean and has free newspapers in the morning & occasionally free cookies in the evening. (Hot coffee, hot water, and tea bags are always available. ) The beds were comfy, the sheets are nice, and each bed always has 4 pillows. The only thing you may want to verify is if your room has a tub or shower only. *They also have at least one 1 bedroom Suite that has a Jacuzzi in the living room!
The property has 3 floors and an elevator, plus is handicapped friendly.
