Hilton Garden Inn Columbus-University Area

Text: Perfect for a night away. Pool was nice and although the Jets were broken in the hot tub, we were still permitted to get in. The breakfast isn't that great for the price, but the room is why we stay! Awesome pillows, clean sheets, and super comfortable bed. EVERY employee was smiling and genuinely great at customer service. Even the maintenance guys! We highly recommend this place!

Text: Best customer service ever!! The whole staff is extremely friendly; they go above and beyond. Great customer service is so rare these days, it's nice to know some still exists! Mimi is exceptional!!
The hotel itself is lovely, comfortable, quiet, and very clean. Lovely patio area as well if you want a cocktail outside :)
(Stay away from Staybridge on Olentangy, huge billboard right outside.. blinding and not even close to the same customer service).
This is our second stay at Hilton and I can't imagine staying anywhere else. (Will be visiting our new OSU freshman a lot)
Thank you Hilton Garden Inn and staff!!

Text: Nice place. No bedbugs. Lots of Canadian geese that are very protective of their adolescent offspring that are eating everything in the the two foot swath they waddle all over the lawn and parking lot.  So watch out for the goose poop on the sidewalk and near everything else. Oh, and the lobby coffee was excellent.
