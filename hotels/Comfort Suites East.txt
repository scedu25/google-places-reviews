Comfort Suites East
Rating: 4
Text: We had a great experience at Comfort Suites. The most important thing to me at every hotel is bed comfort, and this place lives up to its name. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet. The staff was very nice and helpful, and the breakfast was delicious and simple (they do have waffles, though!). We did not try the pool or any facilities, but everything was clean and very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Totally worth the five stars if not more!! I could rave and gush about this Comfort Suites but there probably isn't enough space.  Great staff!! Excellent breakfast!! Pristine rooms!! All of it - MAGNIFICO!! Lincoln has a lot of hotels to offer - but you're missing out if you don't stay here!!

Text: I attended a baby shower, so my experience was limited to the Lincoln Room. The room itself seemed clean enough. It was close to the main entrance, but the desk attendant was on the hotel phone when we arrived, and after a few seconds of waiting another baby shower attendant arrived and told us where to go. The men's restroom did not have a changing table, which is the main reason that I gave a low rating.

Text: The hotel was clean with spacious rooms and very friendly staff. The marketplace had a nice selection of items to save having to go to a convenience store. The only downside was the mediocre breakfast. While it was complimentary and had a few hot options (scrambled eggs, sausage, and make-your-own waffles) it all looked quite prepackaged and unappetizing. We decided it wasn't worth eating.

Text: Nice, big rooms. Clean and comfy. They even had a manager's reception. The staff was also very helpful. Shopping and restaurants nearby too.
