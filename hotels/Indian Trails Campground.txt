Text: I loved this place it has good and bad. Everyone is different but there are things about this place that make you uneasy but now hopefully those things are gone i hope this place propers because it diserves it. The land is beautiful.  There is beauty and happiness here so dont think thier isnt its all in way you think. So come and see and you will know if you like the woods this is place to see. It can be a beautiful fortress.  But they have to make it that way. They need to build it up. Make it strong and make it safe.  This place needs protection. This place needs love that we couldnt give it. So please make it right and make it a safe haven.
