Text: It's a hostile place to live and grow up. If you're out and active you see people drunk at the park 3 hours past dark. Cats run wild and everything is always getting in your trash. The trash compactor they do have is disgusting and filthy. The landlords treat everyone horrible and threaten people with eviction if you do the slightest bit of anything to them.. Then they obsess and kick dead horses until you want to just abandon home.

Text: Park place area needs fixed up. Slow management on fixing things with trailers. Good price for trailers.
