Text: Great access to Highway 60. Too good in fact as the highway noise is very loud. If possible, you'll want to request a site in the back row and away from the highway. The staff is very friendly and the campground is very well maintained. This was our second but probably last visit as the highway noise in the front row of sites was bad, even inside the RV with the AC on.

Text: We  stayed there for 5 days, and the grounds were well kept. John was 
very nice, and Harold the grounds keeper was very polite and informative
and ready to meet your needs, if any. Friday evening was very fun at the Pickin Parlor, had a GREAT TIME, great food and entertainment ! I would 
stay there again in a minute. Highly recommend this campground !
