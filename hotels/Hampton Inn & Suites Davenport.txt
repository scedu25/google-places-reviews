Hampton Inn & Suites Davenport
Rating: 4
Text: Great sized room with sitting area, large desk and kitchenette. Very clean. Great breakfast with a ton of options ranging from fruit and yogurt to cereal and waffles. Great little sitting area to eat in. My only complaint was that the bathroom itself was a bit small.

Text: Great place! We were in a bind and the Hampton Inn was there and very helpful in getting our needs taken care of. The staff was kind, courteous and very helpful. The suite was large and clean. We were there visiting family and had them over to the hotel for a little bit before going out to eat and a staff member noticing all the kids (6) brought a plate of cookies over for them to enjoy. This is the place we will come back to for all of our Davenport trips.

Text: Booked our room about a month in advance. Got there and they had given our room out. After a good 2 hour wait we finally got a room. Recently remodeled and a lot of previous gripes I had were fixed. The room layout was very weird though.
