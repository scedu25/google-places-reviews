Text: BED BUGS I stayed here in room 125 when I started to notice bites I immediately moved my wife and infant out and wasn't refunded any money and the staff where extremely rude (I woke them up at 6am) they do indeed have a few nice rooms but ours wasn't one never stay here sleep in your car I had to. They literally asked me to rate them five stars which explains all these stats they don't deserve

Text: Bed Bugs.... Bad infestation. I picked up my pillow and there it was right in between them. We had no choice but to stay because our car broke down. Dad woke up with one on him and I barely slept on a stripped bed with the lights on. The pillows they gave us had greasy marks on them and the sheets had ....how do I put this nicely.... love spots. Gross Gross Gross!!!!
