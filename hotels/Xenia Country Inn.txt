Text: Reasonable price. Not a fancy place but it was clean and quiet. Enjoyed the bed and pillow. Slept well during a three-day stay.

Text: My wife and i have been here a few months now.  This place is not that bad from all the other reviews i have read.  I nor my wife has noticed any bed bugs.the staff are very nice and helpful and very helpful. The workers here came twice to fix 2 different issues and were fixed promptly. They also were respectable and polite. .we have not had any other issues here except for the free wifi,but we do not mind,because we have our own unlimited hotspot we use. They also give you a complimentary breakfast  on weekends and unlimited coffee 7 days a week. Its a pretty nice place to stay.... .  .

Text: Xenia Country Inn is a nice motel on the cheaper end. The motel shows its age. The room we were in had the scent of old smoke. The mirrors and such were not entirely clean but the upkeep was decent. It's decent for a realtively cheap place to stay.
