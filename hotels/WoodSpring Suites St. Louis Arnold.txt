WoodSpring Suites St. Louis Arnold

Text: This is a simple hotel well suited for someone on a budget who needs long term rental. The room was clean. There is a simple kitchenette. You need to supply your own pots, pans and dishes. The staff and long term residents went out of their way to make us feel like we belonged even though we only stayed two days.

Text: I lived here for a couple of months.  Eventually the staff felt like family.  They almost never cleaned my room, the whole time I was there.  No pool but there is a laundry room.  The weekly prices went up almost every week.  It's much cheaper to pay by the month.  Cops were there frequently but if you mind your business and don't smoke in your room, they won't bother you.

Text: High weekly rates . located in a shopping plaza, so forget a nice view. You have to take your own trash to the dumpster. And no maid service! Building looks very nice, lol.

Text: Stayed for about a month. Extended Stay does not mean there is no amenities, Stay America provides a continental breakfast, daily room service, etc. Here the room service employees are allowed to barge into the rooms if you do not answer. You take out your own trash. Room service is every other week. No breakfast. No shampoo. Check your bed sheets before sleeping on them. The manager, Ashley, is VERY unprofessional and impolite. Beware - she WILL talk down to you. Some workers are nosey and ask too personal of questions. The employees WILL gossip about you. The price is mediocre and the service is bad. This is a good place to stay if you want to pay $1200 /month for an efficiency apartment that is furnished with basic needs. There is a laundry room. $2.25 to wash & $2.25 to dry.

Text: Pretty much like a dorm room, great if you want to get groceries and make food in the room, but not many emenities in the room. TV quality is also not great. Staff are incredibly friendlt tho, and everything was very clean.
