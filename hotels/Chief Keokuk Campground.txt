Chief Keokuk Campground
Rating: 4
Text: This was a nice campground and worth future stops.  One section is in the middle of a pine forest, while the other two loops are amongst a variety of oak, hickory, walnut and others, including some osage orange trees.  The wind through the pines was almost mesmerizing through one windy night, even though we weren't on that loop!  Walking through was like walking in a pine needle storm!  The sites are somewhat close together with minimal greenery between in spite of all the trees.  They are gravel and moderately level with some requiring extra effort to level an RV.  The restaurant at the lake was great with some pretty good biscuits and gravy for being so far north!  ;)  Good burgers and cod too!  The trails were nice and seemed to be well maintained and the round barn was a pretty neat stop for bit of local history!  We'll keep this one on our list of good weekend stops for future reference.
