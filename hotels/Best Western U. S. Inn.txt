Best Western U. S. Inn

Text: Desk staff was excellent and the rooms were nice. The halls smelled a little sulfurous and the continental breakfast was underwhelming. Great for a quick stay. The hotel itself was a two story with about 40 rooms and plenty of parking. The entrance was a bit weird, as you have to go through the driveway for the restaurant to the left. It's location is fantastic for anyone traveling I-64.

Text: This was a great place. Clean quiet and a friendly staff. We arrived with a group of 9 and asked when the pool closed. They said it was due to close soon but they immediately told us they would keep it open an extra hour for us. That's great customer service.

Text: Room and Continental breakfast we're great. I'd definitely stay there again. Only complaint is they only give you soap bars and a "conditioning shampoo". I much prefer to have a regular conditioner and shampoo separate.

Text: BED BUGS!!!!  On the walls and headboards!!! Do not stay here! The beds were unchanged and covered in HAIR!!!! It looked like a pet shed all over the room and no one bothered to vacuum, the curtains were even covered!!! It was obvious the bathroom was uncleaned because there was a puddle of dry urine on the floor and hair throughout the shower!!! Worst experience ever!! I will definitely drive the extra few miles to stay ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!

Text: Great hotel, very friendly staff, breakfast was hot and filling, great biscuits and gravy. The pool was nice and clean. Also enjoyed the cafe next door Little Nashville. Had excellent apple pie ala mode and the peanut butter chocolate pie was the best I ever had.
