Text: I'm a Spire member and I cannot give 5 stars due to one major issue (at least for me). This is my second time at this hotel and the service is great and staff is wonderful. I come here for work so I don't have much choice. My complaint is the water pressure. Took me a full 5 minutes to rinse my hair (I'm a guy) and an entire 30 minutes to shower. I couldn't even enjoy a hot shower due to the water being all the way hot, minimal pressure and water not warm. It's a cold morning and all I wanted was a hot shower.

Text: This hotel is renovated, clean, and very roomy inside. Very comfortable bedding. Pet friendly, which was a perk for us traveling with a dog! It is a $40 charge, which I felt was a bit much.
But I give it five stars for the service. I believe the staff member at the front desk was named Colleen. She was funny and very welcoming. The breakfast was yummy and the check-in/check-out process was simple. Nice stay!

Text: Hotel smells like cigarettes. Rooms smell fine to me. If you have a sensitive nose, stay away.
