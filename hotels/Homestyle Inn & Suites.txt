Homestyle Inn & Suites

Text: Very basic ans extremely outdated. Outdoor pool, weather too chilly to use. Breakfast rules... food only allowed in dining, not allowed in rooms. Nice to provide smokers their own section of rooms away from nonsmokers

Text: Disgusted!!!  Upon check in I was bumped from a non smoking queen room to a smoking room with a tiny bed! Very irritating. Then when we got to our room and walked in it was like a blast back to 19 diggity 2 with the very out dated carpet and bed spread and lamps.  Very disgusting as well. Since we drove 5 hours and were here just for the 2 nights to spend the weekend with my son we went a little less expensive to save money for more fun activities.  Bad move!  Walked in the room and it was a furnace and this is the end of August. The over head light had a heat bulb in it, so we  turned on the air it kind of worked. Then tried the tv.... nothing. The power cord was missing, called the front desk the guy said he would come look at it.  I had to physically show him that the cord was gone. He rudely told us to grab our stuff he was moving us rooms.  We did so, walked into the next room and it was even worse than the first. But the tv worked.   But the air conditioner was loud I mean a loud screeching fan noise.  Very disgusted and disappointed with no refund avalible... But I guess you get what you pay for...   would not recommend this no tell motel.

Text: Upon checking in I was charged a full night's rate just for a few hours when I was previously told that would not be the case. I was put on a smoking section of the hotel mind you I do not smoke not given the choice of smoking or non smoking rooms. Even when I told her I didn't smoke and the odor of cannabis was very overwhelming and guest were walking around with blunts hanging out of their mouths. I was very offended and had I been Caucasian my choice would have been better but I strongly feel the color of my skin which is just a few shades darker than theirs decided my fate here at this hotel. I will never frequent this establishment again.
