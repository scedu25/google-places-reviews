Countryside Inn & Suites

Text: This hotel is a very good value for the quality of the hotel. It is located in an area with easy access to highways to Omaha. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They allow small pets and even offer the dogs treats. The room had two queen beds, was very clean and super quiet. The room itself is pretty spacious. My daughters and I have stayed in the hotel twice and will again if we have the chance.

Text: Had a great stay here, was definitely worth the price. Staff was pleasant, decorations and atmosphere were lovely. Decent pickings nearby for food, my only complaint is my room had a strong cleaning fluid scent more than I'd like.
