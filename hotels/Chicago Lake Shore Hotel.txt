Chicago Lake Shore Hotel

Text: Desk staff was helpful ... they didn't  go the "extra mile" but they did the first mile just fine.  Room was clean and acceptable... plain no frills room.   The restaurant was good.  We were in town for a conference at McCormick place... we had our own car, the drive was easy enough... took about 10 minutes

Text: We were here for a professional development. Overall the hot breakfast was a nice touch. Everyone received the same meal which was average. The room itself was somewhat dark unless you were sitting by the window. 
Free and easily accessible parking was great! The environment was quiet and the servers cleaned up quickly. I would return... For work purposes only.

Text: We were just there for 10 days. Staff is always friendly since this is our second stay here. I have a lot of doctor appointments and even had surgery at The University of Chicago. The beds are a lot more comfortable than Laquinta next door. Last time we were there had to change to Lake Shore. Next time we may have to be there up to two weeks. Hopefully will get good enough pricing to stay here again. 
Restaurant is a little expensive but they went above and beyond to accommodate me for that I am grateful. And since we stayed so long we got coupons for breakfast.

Great little please to stay will stay again.

Text: So I can only speak from my experience so I'll do just that regardless of all the negative reviews here. The staff was polite and friendly. They answered all of my questions. The rooms were quite clean. It looked somewhat updated. No complaints on anything other than two things. First off pull off the photo and description of the pool, because one that had been sitting empty for years does not really exist. I think people won't necessarily think to ask if the pull has water or not. Second thing, the one brown fuzzy blanket made me itch, so I didn't use it. And the snack machine needs more options. Other than that no complaints. Also the ice machine in the lobby was convenient.
