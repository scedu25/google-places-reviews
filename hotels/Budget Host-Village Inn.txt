Budget Host-Village Inn
Rating: 4
Text: It is what it is. No frills, an old building, not modern. But it's cheap and the staff are very friendly. Check your rooms upon check in. The previous guests had left bed bugs behind but the manager bombed the room and completely cleaned the room from top to bottom for us. Not bad for cheap accommodations
