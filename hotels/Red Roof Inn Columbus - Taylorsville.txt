Red Roof Inn Columbus - Taylorsville
Rating: 4
Text: I'm not the biggest fan of Red Roof but it was the cheapest option for my quick passing in Indiana. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was clean and so comfortable! I was highly surprised at how great my experience was.

Text: Lady at the front desk was nice and helpful.  Room was okay till I used the nasty microwave. Or until i found black spots on a towel.  Or lipstick on another towel. Hot water went cold in shower. Found hair in my bed.  & found long Hairs on the shower walls. Hurl. This place was gross and even had flys in the room. For 84$... never again.  For 30$? Yes I would. Otherwise. Absolutely never again.

Text: Nice and clean with friendly staff.. breakfast mostly pastries, but was okay. high point for us, cleaning staff displayed our 8 month olds cuddly toy on the pillow, and it was a caring gesture. Thank you for putting care into what you do.. ?

Text: Friendly staff and a clean room with mini-fridge and microwave. The room doors face outside, motel style, but it looked like the floor and a few other things in my room had been recently renovated. Parking lot has ample space for trucks and trailers. My room wasn't very large, but it was also a one-bed room. They are pet friendly, which is hard to find in this area. The continental breakfast is mostly packaged pastries.
