Town & Country Motel
Rating: 2
Text: The entire region is served by not enough hotel properties, and thus the guest experience is rather disappointing. The ones that are available are mostly owned and operated by one guy. He is running his own near monopoly, takes significantly greater rates for units than is warranted,  has more rooms set for smokers than non-smokers. Room I took was enough to choke me and was a smoking room  but no non-smoking ones were available for my stay. Yet to be determined whether beds are free of pests. Water for shower was warm at best with no cold mixed in.
Bottom line,  hey, if you are rather desperate,  it's a ROOM, but it's not one you will want to keep for more than a couple days...tops. 
      At least the carpet wasn't damp with Odo-ban. Yeah,  I have seen that too, @ that place w the red roof on it.
