Text: Corporate Slum lords they will try to steal your trailer. They try to evict people illegally and the mangment is rude, unpleasant,  angry and impatient. They refuse to keep there lots up but then try to fine u for everything and anything. I think anyone thinking of moving hear should really look for somewhere else. I watched them take trailor after trailor from people after increasing lot rent continuously.

Text: There are only certain sections of the mobile home park that look clean and they are not great about fixing problems, instead they give out a lot of fines for really unneeded things
