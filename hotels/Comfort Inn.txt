Comfort Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Very clean and quiet. Loved the convenience of the coffee maker, mini fridge and microwave in the room. The room itself was pretty good sized with great furniture. Free hot breakfast was delicious with a good selection. Staff was very friendly and were able to get my family in on short notice.

Text: We stayed at the Comfort Inn, in Sullivan MO, the employees were all very nice, the pool was great, I did find that the bathroom floor was a little bit dirty, but not terrible. Great shower head. Comfy needs and great pillows. AC worked great and was quiet. Yes I will stay here again in the future.

Text: The staff were very nice and very accomodating of early check-in and reserving a room on the first floor for my handicapped mother and her service animal for no extra charge. The room was very clean and everything seemed fairly new.  The bed was very comfortable, I was right next to the elevator and still got probably my best nights sleep in a hotel ever.  The gym was well furnished and cleaned, as well as the pool, both had fresh towels available. The continental breakfast was a nice spread with the waffle maker bar and many other hot and cold options, also very clean and well tended by the staff. Located right next to a gas station and Walmart as well as a few other strip-mall type shopping options. Very good experience.

Text: The beds were a little hard, and the pillows were average "soft in the front, firm in the back". The breakfast had a fair selection. Cereals, some bakery items, eggs and sausage, and waffles (mmm, waffles) Staff was very friendly. Smoke free, which is nice for many people. Rooms did have a mini fridge and a keurig, but no microwave.
