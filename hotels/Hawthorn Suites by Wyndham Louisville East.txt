Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Louisville East
Rating: 5
Text: I only stayed here for a night but my experience will probably make me seek out more Hawthorn Suites in the future. The staff is friendly and the overall environment is very elegant and welcoming. I didn't bring my dog, but I love that these hotels are pet friendly. You also can't beat a hot, complimentary breakfast. The rooms itself are set up like a suite with a lot of extra room and a small kitchen area with a microwave and mini fridge. I could see myself liking to stay here for the purpose of a longer stay. Great value and amenities!

Text: We were only here for a night and the breakfast in the morning, but it was great. I don't know if I was starving or the food was legitimately good, but either way, I was thankful for it. There were a lot of people eating breakfast with us, but it never felt crowded. Oh and many of those people were in sports uniforms, so this is a good place to stay for sports. They even have a big fitness center right next to Hawthorn Suites that's free to use.

Text: We had a very delightful stay the indoor pool was wonderful, the rooms were even more than we needed. There was a living room with a pull out couch and a second TV in it, a kitchenette and a nice bedroom with 2 queen-size beds. Very clean and our room's air conditioner worked just great. ( I wonder why someone wouldn't tell the management if the air conditioner didn't work ).

Text: Check-in was fast after Louder Than Life music festival. Complimentary breakfast was ok, granted we got to it 30 minutes before they close it. Overall couldn't complain.
