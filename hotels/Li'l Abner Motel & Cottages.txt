Li'l Abner Motel & Cottages

Text: My family and I have stayed here for years. We love the staff, so friendly and really make you feel welcome. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the cottages are great little homes away from home. Pet friendly too ?? This yr we stayed in a handicap suite. The rooms were spacious and the power chair had no problem maneuvering around. Only disappointment was there was a standard height commode, not a taller handicapped commode. We made adjustments for the stay though and will definitely be staying with them again.

Text: Not far from Slade, this quiet, little motel served our purpose of staying the night comfortably. All staff was kind and considerate, rooms were sizable, beds comfortable, and the area was quiet. I can't think of a bad thing to say about this place

Text: Spent a night here just passing through....Cute little place! It is kept up very well and the lady at the desk was super nice. We were afraid other guests would be a nuisance but once it got dark it all got quiet and everything was peaceful. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to the area

Text: I have stayed there twice.  People are nice.  Rooms are really clean even though the facility is older but they keep it up.  For example, the refrigerator was real nice and even had a freezer in it.  I left my camera charger and extra battery in my room.  They sent it back with no issues.
