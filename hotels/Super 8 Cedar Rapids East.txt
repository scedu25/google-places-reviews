Super 8 Cedar Rapids East

Text: Where to begin? First off the screen on the window in the bedroom is totally shredded. In the pleasant cool weather, this prohibits opening the window. The ceiling is falling down in the shower. The vertical blinds in the breakfast area are broken and do not close. Additionally, there are missing slats or blinds. Since this room is Eastward faceing, the sun pours right in on you. The lady manager wanted to tell me that they are ordering special Parts when these could be purchased at any local Decor store.  Her excuse for our room disarray was that we were in a construction room. I will say that the bed is comfortable and the pillows are nice. There was ample hot water too.  Charging almost $100 per night seems criminal for the value received.

Text: They are very rude told me i had 15 mins to get out the room. I had over slept. Went to take a bath no shampoo or conditioner. When I got to my room tv was on and was really loud and bed looked like someone plus front desk called someone before I could go to my room so jus funny how things play out.  Will never go back. Worst night

Text: Stayed at super 8 for a concert at Jones county fair.  Drove here from Michigan.Had a room booked across the street and said no way,went to see if any rooms were available and they got us right into a room. The manager and staff was very friendly, rooms were clean and nice with fridge and microwave.
