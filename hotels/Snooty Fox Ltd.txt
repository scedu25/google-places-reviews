Text: I booked the Snooty Fox for a family retreat weekend in July of 2013. The family had more than a great time . We will be returning next year for another fun filled weekend. The cabins are clean and  the property is well kept. Try to book the entire resort when making your reservation  you will have the privacy and the whole place to yourself. After searching for about a month this place was the best value and the most accommodating. What a great place !
