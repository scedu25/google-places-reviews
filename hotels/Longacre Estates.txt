Text: Doesn't deserve a star. Me and my husband lived here and my mom and step dad was our neighbor. Both of our places were falling apart, people tried to break in , our yard was flooded for 2 weeks and to my knowledge still is because the last manger didn't do need thing but charge for stupid stuff. Ex if you had anything but white curtains you get charged because new manager new rules. During a year and half that park has been through 3 managers because all of them were crooked. Floors are falling through, nothing really worked in our place heat didn't work, had no insulation, ac didn't work. This place is a no go. If I knew what I know now I would have never moved here.  I will NOT refer anybody here. Place is a dump.
