Courtyard by Marriott Indianapolis Carmel
Rating: 5
Text: Getting to the hotel was interesting. You have to go through 3 roundabouts. Luckily traffic wasn't bad and the signs are clear and pretty easy to follow. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly! One lady brought in 2 stamps so that I could send postcards to family. Knowing that our weekend was crazy with soccer games and getting to a post office would be very difficult. No dirty carpet, stains or bed bugs. We had a king with a twin sleeper sofa and it was a bit small, but it was clean and comfortable!

Text: Pros:  Nice facilities, room was quiet, and staff  was nice.  No outside pool, but nice areas to  sit outside and get some sun in an enclosed courtyard. Was able to efficiently control room temp. Cons:  Hard to get to, lots of traffic circles and side roads since roads changed after hotel was built.  Room air conditioner was on the loud side, housekeeping knocked on door at 9am on Sunday morning, which seemed a bit early, especially since we we're traveling from a different time zone.

Text: This is a quiet and comfortable Courtyard off the beaten track though there are a myriad of large office buildings around it. The staff was welcoming and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. We didn't hear any hallway or other noise. The bistro had a decent soup for a late night pick me up. I would stay here again.
