Text: The location was great because it was fairly quiet for the location. The room was adequate for my needs. The service was outstanding compared to other places I've stayed.

Text: Sheets were dirty (with what looked like a blood stain) and there was mold in the shower. In one of our rooms the AC unit was broken. Staff was nice though, and the breakfast was hot.

Text: At first glance this looked like a beautiful hotel. The room smelled like dirty gym socks. No bathtub, only a shower. The Bathroom door wouldn't lock. We went with another family and there bathroom door wouldn't lock either. The only diamond in the ruff was the staff. They are extremely friendly  and helpful! The breakfast was also good, only wish they had cereal for kids available. I will never forget that horrible smell!
