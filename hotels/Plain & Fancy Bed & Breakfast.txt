Plain & Fancy Bed & Breakfast

Text: We stayed in the butterfly room which was lovely. It was a little loud at times because the room is right off the front hall and next to the front door. The bath tub was just lovely and so was the spa shower. Breakfast was delicious! I would highly recommend this hide away if planning a trip to the area.

Text: Nice and quiet retreat for our anniversary get-away. Our room was beautiful and came with tv, Jacuzzi, microwave, fridge, and a shower with 5 heads. Comfortable bed and delicious breakfast served at 9. The staff was very friendly and informative and accommodating. There is enough of a quiet country setting we enjoyed the star lit sky over looking the water by a fire in their fire pit.

Text: This was a great place to stay with clean, affordable rooms. The staff were friendly and the shower was awesome. Only complaints are that the TV was tiny but seeing as how we didn't come to watch TV this was not a deal breaker.

Text: Antiquated atmosphere with modern facilities, personable service, excellent company, and great food. Could not have asked for a better first-time B&B experience. Very close to several state parks. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a B&B in Arcadia Valley, MO.

Text: Absolutely a wonderful way to spend the start of or honeymoon! Ruth is kind and her dog chowder is so cute! The breakfast was out of the world. We stayed in Scarlets Hideaway which was perfect because it has a nice walkway down to the gazebo and hot tub. We had wine in the hot tub and gazed at the beautiful stars. We originally had scheduled a horse back trial ride, but I got a cold and had to cancel. She was wonderful to work with and does what she can to accommodate what you need/want. A++++ we will be back!
