Text: Not very well kept up. Rooms are not as well as they should be. The nightly and weekly rates are reasonable. But given the state of the rooms could be better. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and stores nearby. Plus fairly close to the Firekeepers casino.

Text: Reserved room with 2 QUEEN BEDS and both were full size, NOT QUEEN. Bed flipped off frame into floor when sat on, a/c was old, broken and barley worked at all. Pillows have a gross muggy, musty, odor. Bed spread have burn holes in them. Mattress is 'springy' and uncomfortable. Toilet has soap scum & dirt ring inside bowl & around lid. Shower tub has black soap scum built up around all walls in shower. Loud, obnoxious, people standing around outside. As well as the bottom of tub feels so soft you could fall through it any min. Over all... For the price, it could have been worse... BUT for Any OTHER REASON... WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN, ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE WITH US.
