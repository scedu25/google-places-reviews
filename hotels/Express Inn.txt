Express Inn
Rating: 2
Text: Express Inn is an older motel so don't think its something updated.... Go to Wal-Mart and prep yourself to do some real cleaning if you plan on staying the night... Like I did get your self bed bug spray to be on the safe side and Lysol... Rooms are not great but if you prep they will be somewhat manageable...  Rooms have a funny smell as well as the office.... Wanted non smoking but you could tell someone smoked in here.. Some of the light bulbs where blown and fridge stays unplugged as well as microwave.... It needs a really bad deep cleaning here to be up to some sort of standard... Only stayed here because its the closest hotel from my fuel stop for CNG fuel that opens at 7am...

Text: Very convenient and affordable place to stay. It is typically clean, but is dated. Some roo.s at more worn out than others.
