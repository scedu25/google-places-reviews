Little Thunder Bay Campground
Rating: 2
Text: The sites all have good back-in access.  Water pressure is fine.  Electrical service was as expected.  We had one minor outage during a five night stay.  The facilities were below their usual standards.  They were cleaned daily, but still fairly dirty.  The pit toilets near the beach were boarded up and they had port-a-potty's up.  My biggest complaint was that it seems like they're no longer watering the campground.  The sprinklers never came on once in five days.
