Rating: 5
Text: Greatest Breakfast bar I have ever seen.  Had waffles, oatmeal, eggs, bacon/sausage, biscuits and gravy. there were also danish, yogurt, fresh juice and fruit.  Beds slept great, very comfortable.  Room very clean.  Had ac issue in first room but within minutes, they switched us to a room that was across hall. I will stay here on my next visit to Kentucky.

Text: We always enjoy our stay here. The staff is always kind and accommodating and helpful; Miss Angela at the front desk is great, and so are Jackie and Brandy!  The beds are a little hard for my taste, but otherwise rooms are clean and comfortable; it's nice having a fridge and microwave in the room also, and they serve a good breakfast with eggs and bacon or sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal and waffles, plus some other extras. The warm cookies in the evening are a nice touch!  The pool and work out room are nice, and there are restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel. Best place to stay in Central City in my opinion!
