Laura Ingalls Wilder RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: This park is across the road from the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum.  Come on, if you're read the books and you're in the area, you know you've got to stay.  This was the best park of our trip.  It's simple and unpretentious, but the grounds are lovely.  There's a little pond with a bridge, mowed and manicured expanses of grass, flowers everywhere, a cave to explore, and our site was next to a tiny chicken coop with four chickens to watch!  At night, everything was dead quiet.  No car noises or anything else.  The loudest sounds were the faint murmur of the neighbor's quiet conversation.  I want to come back and stay longer.

Text: This camp is clean and extremely well taken care of.  The owners are a precious family who are available and obviously  take great pride in providing a visit to remember.  They are making improvements but the atmosphere is calm and relaxing.  Enjoy a stocked pond, cave adventuring, and play area that is visible from all sites.  Participant of Passport America and daily price is reasonable you will not be disappointed. :)

Text: great little park, we stopped on our way through MO, just happened to be the wed/Thu before their big Laura Ingles Wilder celebration and they were busy getting ready,  but we're not to busy to be friendly and chat.  great park, roomy, level sites, easy in/out, and best of all felt safe being out with our 2 yr old running around, chasing chickens, playing on play ground, etc...  lots to do and relaxing, will be back.

oddly we had zero expectation, so great surprise!

Text: Very nice basic campground. Worked great for primitive tenting. We camped here for two nights while we visited the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum and Rocky Ridge Farm across the road.

Text: We stayed here July 16, 2017 with an enjoyable experience. We were able to select a shady site from several available. We enjoyed exploring the cave at the back of the property and fishing was available at the pond. The bath house was clean. We used and enjoyed the campfire ring. Overall a good, quiet place to stay. Needs a little maintenance.
