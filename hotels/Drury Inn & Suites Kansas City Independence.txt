Text: We stayed here five nights. I can't say enough positive things about the facility and staff. Everything was great. Clean rooms, quiet stay, great meals offered twice a day. I would not hesitate to return.

Text: Probably the best hotel chain around. The Drury Inn & Suites in Independence MO is a newer version of thier hotels and is one of the best values for the dollar. The location is easy to access and there is plenty of parking. The rooms are clean and spacious as is the bathroom. Other items of note. The staff was very friendly and responsive. When we were staying, there was a Softball Tournament nearby. Even though the lobby and dining area were full, the staff kept everything moving without delay. As a chain, the hotel provides breakfast with eggs, sausage, cereal, fruit, yogurt, waffles and many other items. All we're fresh and replenished when we were staying. One request... serve bacon. In the evenings, you are provided with a drink card for three adult beverages and food is also served. The menu rotates but you can see such items as chicken tenders, hot dogs and baked potatoes. They also provide Pepsi products, but the selection is limited to six flavors, usually Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mist Twist, Root Beer, Tea and Mountain Dew. Second request... Add Diet Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper.
