Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: Great facility. Very beautiful and clean. The Coralville Marriott managed my wedding at Brown Deer Golf Club in 2015 and they did an amazing job. They included a complimentary suite in our package so we could stay overnight on our wedding night. They even surprised us with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries along with a handwritten congrats letter signed by all of the banquet staff at our wedding. We just visited the Marriott again a few days ago for a holiday craft show and it brought back great memories. Would recommend to all of our friends!

Text: The Marriott staff was very helpful. I ate buffet breakfast and lunch provided by the hotel, I enjoyed it. I liked that they brought coffee into the work session for us. The A/V staff was helpful with the projector for our slide presentation. The facility overall could use a few updates, wall paper near the floor was peeling and scratched, but the restrooms and food areas were very clean and tidy.

Text: The hotel has a check-in time of 4PM, however, we called in beforehand to arrange an earlier check-in. Parking is covered, but not free. The surrounding area is under rapid development, including a brewery and a number of restaurants. The room has clean and well furnished. The bed was comfortable. The views were good, as we overlooked a scenic area. Definitely the place to stay near Iowa City.

Text: It was nice enough. The food was pretty good, the people were pretty helpful. The space is laid out decently well. Parking was a bit of a nightmare, and leaving doubly so. Otherwise it was a decent enough space.
