Text: This was our second trip to the course as we live 2 hours away in Indiana. Unfortunately we got rained out on the back 9 so we decided to have dinner. Wow what a great meal and atmosphere. They couldn't be more nice in the club house and the course is absolutely beautiful and well manicured. Well worth the 2 hour drive. Keep up the good work guys!
