The Cornerstone Suites
Rating: 5
Text: I travel for a living and stay in many different hotels and the like; these are by far the cleanest rooms I've ever seen. It's incredible! I couldn't find dust anywhere. You can tell the proprietors have a lot of love for these Suites. I really enjoyed my stay!

Text: What a great place to stay!  My sister and I stayed there, it was very nice.  We enjoyed Lake City, a tiny piece of the USA.  We went to the library and the quilt store...we will stop and stay again.
