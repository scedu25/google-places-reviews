Text: I loved everything about this place. On the weekends they do fun themed nights with a band or DJ. Everyone dressed up this particular night in Woodstock themed outfits and it was awesome. The music was great and the DJ even threw in some new songs. The wait staff was quick and attentive even with a packed house. Food was delicious the breaded cheese curds and jalapeno poppers are a must. They also have corn hole and swings outside to play and keep the kids happy. I can't wait to go back.

Text: Very friendly and fun place.  So glad we discovered it thanks to google maps.
The hamburgers and crinkle fries were delicious and the rum runner for $11 was fun to share with friends.
