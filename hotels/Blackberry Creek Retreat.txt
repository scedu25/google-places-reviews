Blackberry Creek Retreat

Text: My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in September. Accommodations were wonderful. The room was beautiful the cozy. The common areas quant and welcoming. Not only was breakfast wonderful but there were snacks, drinks, and ice cream we could enjoy at our leasure. Breakfast was amazing and Mark great to visit with and very knowledgeable about the area. Hoping to go back for our anniversary. We drink from our Blackberry Creek coffee mugs almost every morning.

Text: The room was spacious and amenities first class. Nestled away into one of the most scenic areas of the Ozarks without being too far from civilization. So, when you step out onto the patio and hear absolutely nothing but the rustling of leaves and wind blow it's a easy to appreciate the peacefulness of the place. The hospitality of the Dawson family was something you might get a glimpse of at a five star resort. You can tell they are in the business for the love of it and it shows in every detail they've poured into the place. The breakfast was delicious on par with some of the best restaurants I've ever been to but without being pretentious. I'm not sure what you'd be looking for in a Bed and Breakfast that could possibly beat this place but I think they are very deserving of all the praise they've received over the years. Leaving was the only part of the place we didn't like.

Text: We went to Blackberry Creek for a wedding. It seemed very nice, had a lot of things provided to the bride and groom. The restrooms are a bit odd, could really use some doors on the stalls instead of curtains. But the location outside is gorgeous. Great for outdoor weddings or parties. Gravel was a bit tricky to navigate in heels or crutches, as was my case.

Text: My husband and I got married in early October of 2013 at Blackberry Creek and had the most magical time. Our close relatives stayed with us at the B&B and we had people come out on Friday for our rehearsal dinner, Saturday for the wedding and Sunday for an early brunch. Mark and Dixie were so helpful the entire time and weren't scared away but the amount our friends and family like to party! They were always around if we needed anything and were so accommodating when it came to the day of the wedding. Even during the rainy ceremony we had Mark and Dixie were all around helping usher guests in the right direction and getting towels out to wipe down the chairs. They are wonderful, kind people with lots of imagination and big hearts! They helped us make our wedding as perfect as we could imagine. And the B&B itself is a hidden treasure in the Ozarks. Everything one could want for a beautiful outdoor wedding in the fall!
