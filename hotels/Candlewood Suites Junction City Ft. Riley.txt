Text: Firstly, the staff is unbelievably helpful and friendly. Was willing to bend over backwards to make sure I was comfortable. The property itself is clean and modern. The room is pretty big with everything I would need for a month long stay.

Text: Decent, that's all.
 My biggest complaints are the Internet (sux), and the damned train horn at what seems random times of the day. If you're doing an extended stay, you'll need to buy cleaning supplies because they only come by once a week. Other than that, the place is clean, well kept, and the staff I'd friendly. 
Evidently, the hotel is need of cleaning staff. I say this because I got to my room at 4 p.m., and they still hadn't cleaned my room. Irritating to say the least. I want to come to my room and relax.
