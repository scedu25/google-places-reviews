Text: I have played almost every course within 40 miles of Angola. This one takes the cake. Played here last fall. Do yourself a favor and flush $25 instead.

Text: We found this course so fun and challenging, we played it twice during our short stay at Pokagon State Park in August 2009.  It had a few quirks and a very challenging 3rd hole.  It rewarded good golf shots and penalized bad ones.  The greens were in good shape and the fairways were fine.

My high grade is based upon a
C for playability and test of golf,
A for affordability, green fees ~$15,
A for easy access from Pokagon State Park
A for ability to walk on without reservations or a tee time and to play quickly.

If you want a fancy course with lots of amenities, go elsewhere.  If you want to just play golf.  This place works.
