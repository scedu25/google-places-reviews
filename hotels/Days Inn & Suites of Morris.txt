Days Inn & Suites of Morris

Text: The first room we were given wasn’t cleaned properly (maybe it wasn’t cleaned at all), they’re was some garbage on the bed and the shower had someone’s shampoo and soap sitting in it. 
We called the front desk and expressed our concern, then we went down to get new room keys. The man working the desk didn’t say a word to us, simply handed us new keys. The second room was more acceptable, but we found a few bugs and the beds were very uncomfortable. Thankful we only had to stay one night.

Text: Great place to swim and pretty comfortable place to hang out with friends. I would definitely come back again and recommend it to my friends.

Text: Smelled terrible, like cigarettes, even in non smoking rooms. Cart for luggage was broken. Very few breakfast options.
