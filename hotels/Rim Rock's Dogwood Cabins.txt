Rim Rock's Dogwood Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: We had a family vacation here. Our stay was great. The cabin itself had a really home like feeling. The air conditioning worked great? It was very pet friendly with alot land for my dog to run around. The staff was very tentative and helpful, they were always available when needed. We'll definitely come back!!??

Text: We stayed for a long weekend and i almost refused to leave! the cabins were perfect. Ideal for a close family or group of friends, we had a party of 5 in 2 cabins and could not be more comfortable.  The grounds are amazing, peaceful and inviting.  I know we will return soon!

Text: This is our second year coming here, first year was when Dixie and Bob were the owners and we stayed at Bears Den.   This year we met Steve and Tara and we decided to stay at Deer Run.  We had a wonderful stay, the new owners are super friendly, we arrived early and they had our cabin ready for us and we were able to check out the new cabin they build, which will be our next one to rent.  For some of you wondering about Deer Run it was nice roomy cabin, two full bathrooms a major plus.  The bed OMG I didn't want to get up so comfy.  The cabin comes with everything from towels to dishes. They have wifi and cable.  One raining night we found board games we played.  We were able to see some wildlife at night from our window, baby fawn and mom walked by.  Also right across the street is rimrock trails and also to the right of the cabin is another trail that goes around the property that is very well maintained.  I do recommend if you have pets make sure you applied your month tick meds, you are in the woods and due to easy winter they are out there.  We did use bug spray during the night for ourself.  They supply the wood for your campfire, apple pies on the campfire yum.  The grounds are clean well maintained, Tara and Steve have hiked about everywhere there so it's great if you have any questions regarding the trails.   If you needed anything and if they could provide it they did.  Our dogs loved meeting there  llamas Tina and dolly are so friendly and they love dogs.  We met another couple down from our cabin very friendly.  If your looking for a pet friendly or clean and well maintained place to stay, this is your place.  Also received a massage there was wonderful, outside with nature and being pampered at the same time.  If I could give ten stars I would. It only lets me give 5.  Am a clean freak I recommend this place to everyone.

Thanks you again Steve and Tara
