Text: The room was cheap for the location at 45 a night and if you need to complain about this place then pay for a higher priced place bc you get what you pay for. The furniture is outdated but we only stayed here to sleep and it worked out since we reserved last minute for 4th..

Text: One star is too generous. In my 62 years I've traveled all over the U.S., including Alaska & Hawaii. I've been to Mexico & Central America. My standards aren't that high; I've stayed in some crummy joints. Make no mistake, seriously, this is the most disgusting, filthy, dirty room I've ever stayed in. There were huge chunks of dust and spider webs everywhere. Food residue splattered on the wall. Black mold growing on the toilet seat. Black stains on the brown towels. Furniture is old, worn and filthy. Linens tattered & thread bare. Owners obviously don't care. Take my advice and sleep in or even under your car if necessary. Don't even think about staying here.

Text: This place is a dump. Save your money and go somewhere else. If you must stay here, make sure your tetanus shot is up to date.
