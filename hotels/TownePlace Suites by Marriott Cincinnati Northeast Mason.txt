TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cincinnati Northeast/Mason

Text: There were 2 Marriott's next door to each other, we picked the wrong one. The other one had a full breakfast bar in a huge seating area, ours had a room smaller than our hotel room (which was typically nice), and set up galley-style with only 3-4 tables. An island in the middle served as bar seating and food service opposite the wall, which was also food service. There were 30+ people trying to manuevare inside a room that would be crowded with half that. Our pool was outside, the other was indoor and had a really huge hot tub (hot, jets didn't work), though we did have access to it if we walked next door and asked for a pool key. Location was a little awkward to get to, thank goodness for GPS. Service was excellent, as always. I'd stay next door if I go back, but wouldn't be upset if I had to stay at this one again.

Text: Nice clean room.  The traffic in the area is horrible and this is off a road that's off a main road.  Only drawback

Text: Very friendly service! Great hotel that feels like home. Very clean, grill outside to cook your own food, great walking trails and shopping.

Text: Lovely place. The only suggestions are to better label the front office (the tiny "welcome" sign is hard to see at night) and supply some non-stick spray for the waffle maker. ?
