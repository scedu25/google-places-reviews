TownePlace Suites by Marriott Findlay
Rating: 3
Text: Pros:

Relatively clean. Nice closet space. Decent kitchen area. Comfortable bed.

Nice desk and work space. I mean, very nice. Perfect for business travelers.

Good lighting. Nice decor in room.

Cons:

By far, the dinning area which is no bigger than a bread box.

Smallest I've seen. Very uncomfortable.

Very limited breakfast options.

Same goes for coffee selections.

Limited towels supplied to room.

No guide function to TV channels, meaning you'll have to surf through every channel multiple times to find a college football game or any other program your looking for.

Text: Only stayed there for one night. But, the staff were very welcoming and the room was nice and quaint. In the group, one of us accidentally got a large paper cut and the staff helped us out, providing their first aid kit and even going out of their way, to check up on us after the incident.

Text: Nice hotel with very friendly staff. It is a little old but nothing seemed to be broken or worn out. The room had plenty of space and a comfortable bed. The fridge in the room is always great. Did not use the stovw or pots and pans. Would definitely stay there again if I was in Findlay.
