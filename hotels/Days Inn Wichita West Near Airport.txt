Text: The people were polite and helpful. The place was quiet and clean. The hotel is tucked back a bit off the road but easy enough to get to.

Text: This hotel deserves a 0 rating! This was the last available hotel. We should have just slept in our vehicle. I don't even want to go to sleep. The room smells like smoke and it's musty even though it's supposed to be a non smoking room. It's supposed to have two queen beds but they are only full beds. One sheet isn't even on the bed correctly. Remote barely works. I am afraid to walk on the carpet without shoes. There's something on the mat in the bathtub. There were only three towels to use. Light switches are disgusting! We paid $113 dollars for this room and it isn't worth a penny! This place should be shut down! I seriously don't think this place would refund my money, but they should! I am going to get a hold of the corporate office! This is horrible!

Text: I think the hotel has been recently updated.  Its not fancy but it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable.  The staff was friendly and the price was very cheap.

Text: Smoke burns on the sheets and blankets, door key pad would not work consistently and sometimes the door would not lock. Safety was a concern due to the doors and if you wanted to get ice in the dark room. Food is terrible, rock hard biscuits, warm milk and coffee that could strip paint off your car. The tv remote works if you hold it just right and press hard on the buttons. The bathroom is disgusting and my 100 year old great grandma could tile and grout better.

Text: The place is clean but has an odor that lingers. There is construction nearby so takes away from the overall presentation. Place needs to be renovated but will do for an overnight stay etc. It is convenient and next to the mall. The place has a mini fridge and microwave.
