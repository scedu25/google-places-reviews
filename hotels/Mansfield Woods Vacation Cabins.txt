Mansfield Woods Vacation Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed at Mansfield Woods cabins during the Laura Ingalls Wilder Days.  The cabins are located within walking distance of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home, which is why we chose to stay at  Mansfield Woods. Barb was very prompt and informative in our communications prior to our arrival.  She is the most gracious host, making sure everything is perfect for your stay.  The rustic cabin is tucked in the woods.  It was very cozy and suited our needs perfectly.  We really enjoyed sitting out on the deck in the mornings drinking our coffee and at night, unwinding from the day’s activities.  The kitchenette is perfect for preparing light meals, and the bedroom area was nice and quiet.   We will be coming back to Mansfield periodically, and Mansfield Woods is where we will continue to stay.

Text: Nice owners, beautiful property, great area for kids to run around, simple but enough for our weekend getaway to see the Laura Ingells Wilder house & museum, which is right across the street. Cabins were tight, but suffice. Fishing pond left a bit to be desired, but we weren't there to fish really. With a few neat attractions in the area, this made for a really fun trip.

Text: Proprietor called in advance to find out what our needs were. Comfortable cabins in a peaceful setting. Turned us on to a great used bookstore in town. I really liked the variety of teas they provided. That was an unexpected touch.
