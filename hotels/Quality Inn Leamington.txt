Quality Inn Leamington

Text: My job requires me to drive out of the city, and my boss chose Quality Inn because he said it was very nice. Turns out, it was very nice. The rooms were tidy with all the amenities that you'd require. Great customer service with a free breakfest; Plus, they have a bar!! Please note, my boss only let me have 2 drinks :(. Regardless, a great place to stay!

Text: Good place. Remember it as the Journey's End Motel when it first started years ago. Many renovations over the years gave improved the hotel.

Text: Nothing fancy, but nice clean rooms and friendly competent staff. "Room service" is delivery from Armando's Restaurant, and is excellent food. Wi-Fi works well. Convenient to shopping and dining. In-room microwave is small but mighty, with plenty of settings. Good-sized fridge with an icebox. In-room cup-at-a-time coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee was convenient and better than the coffee in the breakfast room. Gym is small but with one each stairclimber, cycle, and treadmill in addition to weights. Parking is free and plentiful. Bedside lamps include a reading spot on an adjustable neck. Plugs on both nightstands and the desk. Water heats up fast and stays hot. Bathroom sink has a working plug for running a basin of water. Oh, and check out the amazing wall panels in the ground floor restroom.

The cons: included breakfast is nothing special. Room was on the small side (one king bed with accessible shower). The snack shop offerings are really thin and just chips and candy. Coffee is a Nescafe dispenser and totally mediocre. There is no restaurant, pool, hot tub, or really anything but a lobby and a gym. Shower includes ZERO instruction on which way to turn it or anything.

Text: Located central Leamington, the Quality Inn had recently been renovated. The room was nice and the staff were friendly. For a hotel breakfast, the selection was pretty good. There was a small work out room as well and staff were friendly. Biggest issue was noise and not sure if it was just peculiarly noisy guests or the world's smallest walls but you could hear anything happening in neighbouring rooms and the hall. Good for an overnight stay though.
