Renaissance Cincinnati Downtown Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: They have eliminated concierge lounge for business travelers, not good if you watching expenses, just book at Marriott if that matters. Great restaurant on site. Staff is great as always and will go out of their way for you. Hotel is classy as you would expect. Great location for Central downtown. Plan on valet parking and valets are fast. Beggars are horrible. City needs to reign it it, it's getting rediculous so don't walk around downtown at night if that bothers you. You are going to get hassled but they seem harmless enough.

Text: Stayed in a suite which was very well appointed.  All of the staff was friendly, accommodating and willing to assist.  Although we did not eat in the restaurant, the bar was lively and comfortable.  The staff was great.  The valet service was prompt and courteous.  Our stay was most comfortable.

Text: Our stay was wonderful and our family enjoyed the suite. The pull-out couch in the executive suite was great for the kids and allowed my husband and I some separation from them at night. The decor was very high end but the price was not. Can't wait to stay again!

Text: Hotel is beautiful; rooms were clean and comfortable. The beds were amazing! So soft, slept very well! The parking situation was quite difficult, they do not have their own parking unless you valet for $35, so be prepared for that or to park in a garage in town and walk a block or two to get to the hotel.
