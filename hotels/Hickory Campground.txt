Text: It's a beautiful park some with electric and some without. Some have water and some do not.  I don't think many people fish from the campground - you have to walk out a couple hundred feet in swampy land to get to the lake . Also, I think the lake is much higher than it usually is there were a lot of green plants 10 feet out into the lake.

Also, right now the entire walnut and hickory camp areas are overrun with cicadas, the trees look like they are alive with the thousands of them buzzing around them.  The sound is overwhelming and not particularly pleasant.

don't be fooled by the large facilities every 5-10 campgrounds - there are only bathrooms, not showers.
