Super 8 Le Claire/Quad Cities
Rating: 4
Text: Nice, clean hotel near the river. The breakfast, while basic, was good. We were basically in and out, so we didn't have a chance to take advantage of any other amenities or attractions in the area, but it seemed conveniently located and was a convenient choice for travelers.

Text: It was one of the nicest super 8s we stayed in. Had to wait awhile for clerk to come from hotel next door to check in. Breakfast wasn't bad. The waffle batter ran out. Daughter specifically called to tell them, said be right there. The gal came and filled everything else first before the batter.
