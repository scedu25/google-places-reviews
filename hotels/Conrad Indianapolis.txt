Text: Great location for professional program. Great meeting rooms and service. Terrific food and beverage, everything delicious. Only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the quality of meat - pork was tough, but had great flavor. Awesome location in downtown Indianapolis, with tons of things nearby.

Text: This hotel has been awesome! Great service, great concierge, friendly staff. Rooms exceeded my expectation. I’m here for a work conference for a week. The beds are very comfortable along with the oversized feather bed pillows. If the standard pillows don’t meet your expectations, fear none, there is a Pillow bar available for your personal desire. A full on garden/soaking tub, nice shower......and a TV in the bathroom perfect while you are soaking. Lots of restaurants in walking distance and the Circle Center is connected to the Conrad which is a Skywalk to many locations including the mall. I’d definitely recommend this Hotel for your stay in Down Town Indianapolis.

Text: Wonderful evening downtown Indianapolis. We went to Tastings to take advantage of half price wine night. We had a cheese plate and a few of they're small plates.  Keagan made some very solid recommendations. It was a great evening!

Text: I love this property. The staff are very personable and friendly. The location is very convenient to everywhere downtown Indy. The room was so very nice and accommodating. Every thing was clean and it's a weird thing to say but the whole hotel smelled so incredibly nice and clean. We loved our stay here. We will definitely be going back to The Conrad.

Text: I went to the Spa and had the most luxurious experience. I will definitely be going back! My only issue was that I didn't know valet was included with my spa service so traveling to and from the parking garage was a bit sketchy. Overall I'll be back and highly recommend it to everyone!
