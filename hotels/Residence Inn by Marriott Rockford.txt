Residence Inn by Marriott Rockford

Text: It was a nice hotel. Good breakfast bar in the morning and I enjoyed all the little beer, wine and appetizer events in the evening. The only drawbacks I had were no herbal tea (cafeine free) options in the morning and none of the weights in the gym were less than 20lbs. I need lighter weights for my normal exercise routine. The rest of the gym equipment was good.

Text: Stopped by the inn to visit my parents who were staying there. The room seemed very nice. They said the breakfast was wonderful. I swam in the pool, which was nice and clean but a bit small. It wasas only about 4 ft deep.
