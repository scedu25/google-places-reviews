A Parkview RV
Rating: 5
Text: We discovered this campsite as we drove into Pratt, Kansas after a long day of driving. We were with our friends and heading to California.  This campground had trees and full hookups which was great for us. It was very windy and hot so the trees provided a buffer from the wind and it felt cooler. The owner was very accommodating and gave us a few great restaurants to choose from! We ate great food at Uptown Cafe D'est.  Thanks for a great stay!  The Villa's
