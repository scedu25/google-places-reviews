Holiday Inn Express & Suites Salem

Text: Conveniently located Holiday Inn with clean rooms and very friendly, attentive staff. Jessi was very pleasant and helpful. Several amneties make the stay more than worth it. Hot breakfast choices, inviting dining area, heated pool, and fitness center with treadmills, dumbbells, and medicine balls. Meeting room well-equipped. A 20% off coupon is available. Would highly recommend and hope I have the chance to stay again.

Text: Check-in was very prompt, friendly, and very professional. The overall experience was very welcoming. This time, I traveled with my pup. There is a $25 per night pet fee (this is per pet). I opted for a king suite. The room was spacious, bright, and very clean. There was plenty of seating. I love the details of the room. There were two firm and two soft pillows, each labeled as such.  There are very effective light-blocking blinds. Having an east facing window, this was very important. There was a complimentary breakfast, but I did not partake.  Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to others.

Text: We arrived after midnight. The night manager was accommodating and sweet. He personally brought up a crib for our infant. We asked him if we could have a late check-out. He said he didn't see a problem with it, but to check with the morning crew. My husband was up at 7am and headed downstairs for breakfast and to start working. We were disappointed that they did not have a private business room, but instead just had a computer in the main lobby. He asked if he could sit in the conference room and Megan at the front desk said he could until noon, when it would be used for another purpose. Amy came out from the back and told him no. He asked for somewhere else to work and Megan gave many different ideas, but Amy said no to all. It's clear she hates her job. The 3 kids and I came down around 8:30 for breakfast. It was wonderful and clean. I asked Megan for late check-out and she said sure. We could stay in the room until 2! Then out come later Amy again... Of course she was angry with Megan and said that we could not stay until 2. Megan went to bat for us and explained that the manager last night said he thought it was fine and that she didn't see any issue. At this point Amy is getting very angry and everyone can tell. She tells us that check out is 11. I asked again to please let us stay a little longer. Megan shows Amy that the cleaning ladies still have lots of rooms to clean and won't get to ours until after 1pm. Amy reluctantly agreed to let us stay until 1pm with an eye roll and swish of the hips. We got out of our room at 1 and went and sat in the lobby until 2 when my husband was done working. Megan apologized for everything. She gave us a wonderful recommendation for a restaurant. I called the hotel at about 3pm to ask if my daughter had left her stuffed animal. I laughed when I was told that the cleaning ladies hadn't been in there yet, but they would call when they went in. The hotel was clean and the majority of the staff was above average. Amy just ruined it with her attitude.

Text: So far an excellent experience.  Quality linens, clean and well maintained rooms.  TV is exceptional.  Kuerig coffee makers in room, and mini fridge.  Blackout window treatments are awesome.  We will stay here again.  I have been a Diamond with Hilton and Marriot so this is a humbling experience for me.  Will start thinking about HIE in the future.
