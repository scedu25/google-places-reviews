Hocking Hills Backwoods Retreat
Rating: 5
Text: My fiancé and I stayed at the Woltz cabin. It was very clean, well stocked, and made for a nice quiet weekend in Hocking Hills. I recommend backwoods retreat for anyone looking to enjoy what Hocking Hills has to offer.

Text: It was nice. Everything was clean and cozy. Had friends stop in to visit and not even fifteen minutes later a manager showed up at the cabin questioning us and who we had staying there. Seemed silly considering even if we had more adults the price would have been the same. But he was friendly enough to be polite and leave us all alone.
