Text: If I could give this filthy dump a zero, I would! It is the nastiest motel I have ever been in! The carpet is filthy. The carpet is seamed with DUCK TAPE! The beds are only slightly better than sleeping on a board. The sheets didn't fit the bed and the pillows were like rocks! There were 2 rags that were considered towls. The toilet tank cover was from a different toilet and didn't fit and the shower didn't have a shower head, was set up for a 4 foot tall person and only produced one solid stream of water.
The "cleaning" lady....the managers mother, came down pushing her cart, bare foot and not a sign of a single cleaning product on the cart. No vacuum in site. She was there to exchange the so called towels. She then basically accused us of trying to get a free "towel" (rag) by taking 2 from her cart and only bringing her 1 dirty one.
THIS PLACE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED!!

The owner knocked on the door and said "this isn't  a charity we owe him a late fee" I explained  it will a couple more minutes  before they so we can leave. I understand  but for the only one that provide  him a steady  customers  base you would think this won't be a problem. To act so rudely. My boy friend  has said this the last time he Brings a student here!

Text: Smelled terrible walking in. There was cigarette ash in the bathtub. Half a loaf of moldy bread in the microwave. Oh yeah, and we woke to find bedbugs first thing in the morning. I do NOT recommend this place.
