Hampton Inn Princeton

Text: It was my first time at the Hampton Inn in Princeton, IN. and I was very impressed. The vibe of the hotel is very warm. You walk in to a very welcoming lobby. I was greeted by the friendly woman at the front desk. She was incredibly helpful with describing everything the hotel offered. She even offered us a cookie and bottle of water. Very sweet.

The hotel offers a fitness room that actually has weights. Not a lot of hotel fitness rooms offer that. They have an indoor pool which a must in October. The complimentary breakfast gives you a fair amount of options for both a hot and cold breakfast,

The room itself was clean and spacious. Very comfortable. Plenty of drawer and closet space. The furniture and decor of the room made being comfortable really easy. The bathroom was very clean with plenty of space. Like I said, it was my first time at the Hampton Inn in Princeton, IN. and now I can't wait to get back.
