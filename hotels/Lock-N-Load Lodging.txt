Lock-N-Load Lodging
Rating: 5
Text: This place is awesome. It only has four rooms. two are doubles and two are singles. The internet is fast, flat screen TV, clean, newly remodeled - what more could you ask for? It is right next door to a sporting goods / convenience store that has a grill and makes pizzas and burgers and stuff. If I am ever in the area I will stay here again.

Text: Our overnight stay at Lock-N-Load was very positive. Clean, newly remodeled, the accommodations were comfortable. And, it is very easy to find, located immediately off US Hwy. 24.
