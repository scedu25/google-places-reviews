The Lofts Hotel
Rating: 3
Text: Hotel has all the "loft" charm it promised, with colorful decor and high, exposed beams. However, the noise of surrounding guests was all too audible in our room, and the room-darkening blinds didn't fill their purpose. We did not sleep well. The check-out process was not smooth - I had to go into the sister hotel to check out and then wait until the desk clerk could return to the Loft location to process my paperwork. The hotel is large enough to warrant a full time desk clerk!

Text: Really nice Hotel. Our heat didn't work on the first night but was still over exceeded expectation. It is in the arena district and really close to a bunch of bars and restaurants. You can get room service from the max and erma's.

Text: Now I know why they call the hotel "The Loft." The hallways have exposed brick walls, the room number looks like little door knockers, and the room itself looks like a mini loft. Exposed wooden ceiling beams painted grey, cream walls, a square wood beam as a coat rack, wall mounted tv. You just have to check it out yourself.

Text: My husband and I stayed here for a romantic getaway. The staff was awesome, very professional and catering to your needs. The location is perfect for walking around and enjoying what Columbus has to offer, especially the Arena District and Short North. We booked the Romance Package and enjoyed breakfast in bed, a daily turn down with a bottle of champagne, local gourmet chocolates, and rose petals around the room. We also had an in-room couples massage. It was the perfect way to spend the weekend without breaking the bank!
