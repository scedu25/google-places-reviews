Super 8 Madison/Hanover Area
Rating: 4
Text: Nice room, good size, semi clean. Breakfast was a 7/10 good amount of choices. Room is small and bathroom is small. Bed was hard as a rock with some kind of blanket in between the sheets and matress. Overall decent place to stay was not expecting much from a super 8

Text: This place is a joke. Owners are rude to employees and guests (I used to work there). Just quit Aug 8th 2017. Don't waste your money here.

Text: Toilet didnt work, vending machines and pop machines were both empty, sheets in a King Suite were for a queen bed, dirty wash rags hanging in shower were from previous guests. Hospitality was horrible. The reciept given to us was for somebody else. Im so disappointed in this place.
