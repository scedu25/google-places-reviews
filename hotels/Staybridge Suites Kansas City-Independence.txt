Text: I enjoyed the separate bedrooms for my family of 6. But the breakfast/Dining area is too small for all of us. Our party had to split up in order to eat. Pool and outdoor BBQ areas are nice.

Text: First time at a Staybridge. This is a great hotel! The food is decent (breakfast and dinner served through the week), and the rooms are nice with a kitchenette. I will definitely stay here again.
