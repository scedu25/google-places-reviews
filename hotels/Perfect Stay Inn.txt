Perfect Stay Inn

Text: I have stayed at many hotels and this place is the best by far. The price was good and the owner and management was super friendly and helpful. The place was clean and decorated beautifully. Very nice town and a very good place to stay!

Text: There was only a four hour window for me to check into the room, so if you're traveling, be weary. The room was extremely small with only a curtain separating the bedroom from the bathroom -- no door. The shower was barely big enough to fit an adult. The room I got was directly across the street from a high traffic train track. There is no dedicated parking lot, only on-street parking. If you have a lot of luggage, and the inn is busy, this becomes a hassle. Thankfully we were able to double park long enough to unload our bags. The building is old and the floors were very creaky and loud. I liked? the high ceilings though!
