Crooked Creek Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: This is a great B&B in a fine little town. The space is private and new and super clean.  Best place to spend the night and get a good breakfast if you’re traveling through Montezuma, KS! You will not be disappointed.

Text: My wife and I recently spent 3 nights in this quiet location; the best accommodations! Hosts are friendly, very comfortable King bed, love seat, spacious  bathroom,  roomy shower (turn on the water and adjust the temp before getting wet!) Would definitely recommend the bed and delicious breakfast and hope we have the privilege of staying here again soon.
