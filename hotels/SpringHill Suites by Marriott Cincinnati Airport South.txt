SpringHill Suites by Marriott Cincinnati Airport South

Text: The hotel was easy to find and the lobby was busy and loud upon our arrival. Check-in was very quick and hotel staff was courteous. The building was clean and for a hotel with a pool of of the lobby I was impressed that there was no overpowering chlorine smell. Our room was what I would expect for the price paid. The newer, contemporary style sets it apart from most of the other hotels we looked at in this price range in the area. The room was clean, smelled nicely and was well thought out. The only negatives were that my wife thought the mattress was too soft (I liked it quite a bit), and the thermostat didn't seem to work (although the room was mostly comfortable temperature wise). Additional pillows were requested and were delivered promptly and courteously. Overall, this was a wonderful hotel experience and I will gladly book again when I return to the area!

Text: Staying here for a week for work. This hotel is amazing. The staff is very polite and the rooms are beautiful. Location is near everything you need from restaurants to Target. There is a pool and workout space as well. Couldn't be more pleased with my stay.

Text: Great location. Every time you flush the toilet he keeps running. You have to jiggle the handle to get it to stop. Awkward light switches turn off on their own overtime. The light in the bathroom is really low and is connected to vent as well which is very loud. It's very difficult to see the television from the bed due to the partition. Contemporary layout and Design in bed and couches are very comfortable.
