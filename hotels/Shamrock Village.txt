Text: Shamrock Studios was a great place to live. Management was amazing - Quinn (if I remember correctly) was the nicest guy ever. Very helpful, very hospitable. Service is quick if you have any problems. Price is incredibly reasonable too - fully furnished and all utilities, internet, cable included. 
Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to live alone and not overpay!

The only problem I could ever have is that truckers use the lot for overnight parking - this can get noisy but it's never really bad.

Text: This place was AWESOME! I rented one of the studios for the year and it was very affordable and they made it so easy by covering all of the utilities AND having it be completely furnished! 

The manager is super nice and it's hidden off the road so it's surprisingly quiet. Great location, great staff, great price, I highly recommend it!
