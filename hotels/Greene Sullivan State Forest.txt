Text: lots of fun times fishing here, new cabins are very nice also.  NO mattresses on the beds.  Bring an air mattress.  Heat and AC work well in the window unit.  Cabins are close to the road but little traffic most of the time.

Text: If you are going to stay here do NOT stay in the cabins or the power sites. The layout of the spots is terrible. We stayed in a camper but had no privacy and right on top of a main road. The other campground at Wampler lake is much cheaper, better layed out and primitive but it's shaded and private with walking trails. It is first come first serve but many great spots to choose from. We were extremely  disappointed that we paid over double for a much worse location just to have power. Its a great spot to fish and hunt but nothing else recreational available to do so not ideal for kids.
