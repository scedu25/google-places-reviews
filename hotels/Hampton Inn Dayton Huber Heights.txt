Text: I just want to give thank you to the staff. My wife was staying at this location. We were apart on our anniversary. I randomly call the front desk to ask a huge favor. I wanted to know if they would leave a note from me in my wife's room and surprise her for our anniversary. The staff went above and beyond to make her feel like family and like I wasn't far away. A note, two swans to make a heart and a note for her from me. You guys are awesome and know how to keep her amazed. Thanks for being an awesome staff. If you read this just know you made her day and mine.

Text: The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I wanted a first-floor room comma after a little discussion they gave it to me. And basically the discussion was about making sure that it would be comfortable with the accommodations they had on the first floor. It always impresses me when they satisfy the customer. I'm a big Hampton Inn and Suites fan because that is how they are trained to treat you.

Over and above that, these hotels are very clean places. If you find something, like dust behind something.  They will do somersaults to make it right and make you happy.

Text: Had a good night's stay on 8-24.   9:15 a.m.8-25, typical Hampton breakfast.  Bar well attended by staff.  Floors in some common areas needed attention.  Some chairs in dining area had smudges and needed to be wiped.  Otherwise; a pleasant stay.

Text: It was clean is about all I can really say about this hotel.  Staff is nice enough and parking is convenient. Beds weren't great, air conditioning was worse, and housekeeping knocked on door even though do-not-disturb sign was on door. There was more but knit picking stuff. I normally love Hamton's but this one just doesn't cut it!?
