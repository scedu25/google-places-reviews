Text: Absolutely beautiful! Cozy, clean, & rustic cabins! Perfect to get away from it all! We stayed in a 2 bedroom cabin, hot tub and grill on the porch and a short walk to the river. Beautiful scenery, we saw deer on a walk! It is secluded and quiet. The people were very nice!! We will be back!! Would love to see the view with snow!! Who needs gaitlinburg when you have this treasure!
