Text: Deb and Keith have a fantastic B&B in the small town of Westside , Iowa. When we first drove up to the house, we could see that they had a lovely place and cared about the facilities.  The rooms are "over the top" for someone wuo likes antiques and just old,. well cared for "vintage" items.  The place is absolutely full of interesting things and immaculate. Deb must dust everything every day, as it is so clean. 
Breakfast was fantastic. We very seldom sit for more than 20-30 minutes when we eat in the morning and both mornings, we sat for over 2 hours talking and discussing everything. 
Would go back any time and recommend it to anyone who likes antiques and vintage decorating.,

Text: Impeccably clean and full of amazing antiques, I can't believe the work that the owners do decorating for Christmas.
