Text: This really might be one of then nicest places I've ever stayed. Three floors, three bathrooms, four bedrooms, six beds and a couch--you can fit the whole family! WiFi, hot tub, game tables and lots of games, great deck, fire pit, two dope TV's, plus laundry? DAMN this place is nice. Beautiful woodwork, great views, great vibe. Do yourself a favor and book it already!
