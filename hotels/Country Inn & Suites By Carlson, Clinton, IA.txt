Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Clinton, IA
Rating: 3
Text: I stayed there for 2 nights and it was good. Thought the covers on the bed could have been bigger (felt too small for the size of the bed) but overall was a decent stay.

Text: We were in town for a funeral, so we stayed at the hotel for a few days. We had a suite and really enjoyed it. The continental breakfast was great!

Text: We stayed in a King Suite was very roomy, however there was an odor in the room. There were a lot of channels on the TV, but there was no guide to know what channel was which station.

Text: Rooms are clean and spacious. Breakfast room had real tableware and silverware, which is great and an exception in the US. Except for the young woman with the coloured hair who was working the weekend in the breakfast room (she is a gem), all other staff we met was rather sulky and didn't make us feel welcome. Examples: The lady who checked us in only gave minimal information, we had to ask for every detail. Not even the breakfast hours or pool hours. Rather sullen too. The lady who cleaned up the breakfast room had this passive-aggressive tone to her when we used the tableware instead of the disposables: "Oh, dishes. I love dishes. Just kidding." And the room maids didn't even bother to greet us when we passed them in the corridor and said hi. 
Also: The bathroom in our room (273) definitely needs a complete overhaul. Some floor tiles are loose, and even the toilet bowl wobbles. 
The free WiFi was very bad at times: Once they had to reset the router because nothing was working at all for 1/2 our, at other times it was just slow or not responding for minutes. Rarely did we have really good, fast internet access. The room would also benefit from more power points close to the bed. Just one isn't enough in this day and age.
