Text: Fantastic Experience. A most beautiful, historic home with a lovely, gracious host.  We enjoyed our room which was the original master bedroom.  It was very roomy,  beautifully decorated and so quiet. You'll enjoy seeing the rest of the public rooms and hearing the history of it from Gloria. She is very knowledgeable and so happy to share her expertise. We felt so much at home.  The breakfast surpassed our expectations and we were lucky in our fellow guests, and had wonderful conversation over breakfast. We will be back when we're in the area.
