Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was amazing! I have a bad back and the bed was comfortable. the pool is heated and indoor which was great! the breakfast had wonderful options that varied and I absolutely loved the later check out time. we were able to enjoy the activities in the back on our last morning there and still have time to pack up the room.

Text: Stayed two nights and it was a very comfortable stay. The staff was helpful and attentive. The room was clean and comfortable. I was attending the Ohio Renaissance Festival and this hotel was located conveniently about 20 or so minutes away.

Text: The Hampton Inn in Wilmington was a near perfect place for an overnight stay during a road trip. The room was spotlessly clean and included amenities such as a refrigerator and microwave. The very reasonable rate included breakfast. Parking is ample and easy. The facility is pet friendly, providing waste bags, trash cans, and an expansive lawned area. Staff was pleasant and helpful. - highly recommended - would definitely stay again.

Text: Nice place to stay in Wilmington. I did notice it is starting to get a bit dated inside, but they have plans for a facelift soon (2018?).
