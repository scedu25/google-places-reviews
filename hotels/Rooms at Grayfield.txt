Rooms at Grayfield
Rating: 5
Text: If I could rate this charming and historic Jonesville Train Depot Inn 10 Stars I'd do it in a heartbeat!
My wife and I have been coming to the 'Rooms at Grayfield' for years, and it never disappoints! Sincerely! It is European 5 Star quality! 

The Inn Keepers, Dee and Grigor Hasted, make hospitality and clientele service a way of life here. Don't be surprised if the fire is roaring in the back suite, with an invitation for evening chats and a knuckle of libation. A daily highlight is the breakfast table where the Innkeeper, a graduate of The French Culinary Institute in Hyde Park, prepares her stunning fare!

For visitors to Hillsdale College or Jonesville, nothing comes close!
