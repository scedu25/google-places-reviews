Text: My room was clean and bed was comfy. Only complaint I have is the inside shower door was very hard to slide closed or to open after you're inside the shower. It wouldn't stay in the track.  I had to basically lift the door up to get it to slide open.  Breakfast was very good.  As I was there for a tax seminar,  I totally forgot to tell the front desk clerk about the door when I checked out during a break in the seminar. I've stayed there every fall for the past 3 or 4 years abd always gad great rooms and service.

Text: We got a room with a spa tub, the tub leaked, said we couldn't use our tub anymore. They offered a new room and completely refunded our money! They use direct tv, bed is very comfortable, rooms are very spacious, and their blankets are wonderful! Felt like a home away from home! Staff was super friendly!

Text: My sisters and I stayed here while our mom was in the hospital. They staff took very good care of us during our stay. The hotel was nice and bright and clean. We had a good breakfast every morning and parking was good too. We were very happy with our stay.

Text: Attended a teaching conference at the hotel for the ITQG STEM Literacy Project. The hotel was, as always; clean, professionally staffed, well furnished and relatively quiet. I always enjoy staying here.

Text: Not the largest accommodations but still quite nice. The food was fairly good, but staff allowed the buffet to run totally out of some items a couple times so their timing on the refills wasn't good. Alcohol and bar tenders were both excellent.
