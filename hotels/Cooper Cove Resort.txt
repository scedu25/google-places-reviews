Text: We've been staying at Cooper Cove twice a year for many years now.  Dave and Tina bought the place a few years ago and have really done a great job of sprucing the place up.

Text: We stayed at Cooper Cove this weekend and were extremely happy with the rooms, dock, and customer service. Cooper Cove is owned by Dave and Tina, they are the nicest people and they've worked hard to make this resort beautiful. We stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms with two queen beds. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was nice, and the kitchen area was pretty cute! The loading ramp is easy to unload and load, the dock is very spacious and you don't have to worry about your stuff. We don't have kids but the playground was always busy! They have a new swing set and a tire swing that kids were playing on all weekend. Great place to stay, loved every minute can't wait to go back! Thanks Dave and Tina for making Cooper Cove a great vacation spot!

Text: What a wonderful place!! Highly recommend! We stayed in one of the newly remodeled rooms, very clean and spacious. Two double beds, table chairs, full kitchen. The lake is so close the the new owners have cleaned up the beach area and we enjoyed floating for hours, they provide a dock for boats and the cove is quiet. Very family friendly, they were finishing up on the gazebo when we arrived and it is beautiful! If you search google, do not let the picture fool you. It does not represent the resort at all!!! I was nervous and when we got there I was totally impressed and glad we made the decision to reserve rooms. There was a group of eight and we all had a wonderful time and will be gong back soon. The rooms are very reasonable priced, there are charcoal grills available. You will not be sorry if you want a great place to just relax, fish and float!!
