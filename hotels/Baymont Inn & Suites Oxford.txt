Text: Front desk clerk was extremely helpful. I didn't catch her name though. Our room keys kept deactivating so i had to go to the front desk multiple times to get new ones. Seemed a bit pricey for an average hotel. Was being remodeled so it was a bit torn up.

Text: The plus side: comfortable beds, convenient location. The minuses: paper-thin walls, not exactly spotless. Also (and this became highly relevant the first night I was there) no tornado shelter. About a dozen of us spent an awkward half hour crowded into the bathroom by the breakfast area while sirens wailed.

Text: Rooms were nice, pool was great. The beds were very firm, but that's personal preference thing. Check in could have been better. We arrived early and couldn't check in until after 3pm. Then was told we couldn't pay cash for the room because they don't take cash.... what???

Text: I am not pleased to say the least with the Front Desk Manager or the General Manager. I called to let them know I was on my way there from Florida & it might be after midnight before I got there. Needless to say they were so ride to me, I just couldn't believe how extremally the rudest Managers I've ever had to deal with. They told me if I wasn't there by midnight that I would not have a room, Which was already paid for. Once I got there the person working the Front Desk was very helpful & explained things to me. I believe her name was Lisa. Once I got to my room it was clean, not to hot not to cold. I felt I could relax after the stress I went through trying to make sure I didn't lose my room. Like the 2 rudest Managers said I would. Other then Amanda & Desirae Morris I would have to say I had a pleasent stay & a nice warm breakfast. Just from Daytona Florida.

Text: I stayed here to visit my son at Miami. The whole place is very outdated, and the personnel is very unprofessional, especially the appearance of the front desk customer service representatives. 
After returning home I received a call from the head of housekeeping that I left my watch behind in the room. I appreciated her call and she told me the valuable watch would be locked up and to call when someone can make it over there to pick up. It took a month but I was sending someone over to pick it up. I thought it was safe, being told it was locked up with the manager. I called, the General Manager said there was no watch or any record of it being found. That the supervisor of HH has left. The general manager was snippy considering my watch was missing. I DO NOT recommend this place!
