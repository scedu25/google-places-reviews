Text: Bad comfortable, service no issues, didn't have breakfast (I slept in too long) ice cold ac (too cold for me even) but dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom. Crappy television speakers made me almost max out the volume, made me feel like I was blasting it to everyone at the hotel. Overall good experience

Text: Ran by Indians so don't expect much cleanliness of fresh breakfast. I asked for a quiet room and of course these idiots put me next to some beer drinking loud construction workers.  Pool was dirty . This place is a notch above motel 6
