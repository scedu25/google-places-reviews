Cambridge City RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: Nice little RV park for an overnight stay.  Electric only - 50 amp available.  Water & dump station available at entrance to RV park.  Bathrooms available in the Cambridge City Park.  Camping fee: donations accepted.  Pros - right off highway.  Cons - some road & train noise.  Would definitely stay here again & would recommend.  Nice hidden gem.
