Text: We recently stayed one night at this hotel while on the road home. It was a very nice place and we'd definitely stay there again. The hotel was clean and and staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was quiet and the breakfast was good. We especially liked walking to the local restaurant for a good dinner (Shiloh Steakhouse). Thanks to the hotel staff for a very nice stay!
