Text: I would not even give this place one star. Except that they make you pick something so your post will go thru. Typical dive.  We were verbally abused by other guests out there balcony as we drove in. Then two men walked around our car to check it out as we sat in the lot. They said there is security but doubtful we booked two nights there based on what I think are fake good reviews.  When I complained they just said you should have come in and cancelled.  No way we were scared to death to get out of our car   My opinion stay far far away from that hotel. Not Safe at all.

Text: Location wasn't bad. Walking distance to baseball stadium. Rooms where not well taken care of very old in need of maintenance. Carpet dirty, bathroom not cleaned. The front desk employees were very friendly and helpful.

Text: Short cheap uber ride to stadium, manager Sundeep was super awesome and nice.  Did a huge personal favor by bringing my cell phone to a different hotel after I left it in the uber. Who does that?  Will definitely stay here again just because of his hospitality
