Comfort Ridge Inn and Suites
Rating: 5
Text: I highly recommend this hotel.  The rooms were clean and the price was good.  The internet was good.  I see that someone rated this as poor internet, that must have been fixed because it was fast.  My favorite thing was that it was as big and busy as a regular hotel so it was actually really quiet.  This made a huge difference and I actually got some sleep during my cross country drive.

Text: If you are traveling on business or use the internet often .  This is not the place to be so  look at hotel in Norfolk 12 miles .  The internet services at the comfort  ridge in Madison is really bad. The signal goes out constantly..  There is no one to call . the clerk at the gas station could not provide an answer and she just said '  do not anything about '.   The hotel used to be top quality . The owners should  be looking more closely of the property. The room carpet is dirty.

Text: Nice and clean, like walking into a new home. My only complaint would be that you have to check in at the gas station so there's no one here after 10 on the weekdays and 11 on the weekends so if it's late don't plan on getting a room. I had reservations and arrived at 10:30, thanks to the nice officer that happened to be patrolling by was able to get a hold of someone to get me checked in. I love small towns and this is really a great one to stay in!
