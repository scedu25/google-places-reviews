Text: I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. I am a travelling railroad worker and have stayed just about everywhere. This place has a good location, easily accessible. Staff is quite nice and this facility has a decent work out room and pool/tub. All utilities seem up to date and most hardware/furniture seems clean and kept. Only downside is the smaller room size that I was booked with. Would fit a couple people, 3 max. Everything else was good including the free breakfast.

Text: Stayed overnight for my wedding. We were upgraded to a jacuzzi suite after a cancellation. The room was excellent. The front desk staff was friendly and accomodated my wedding party effortlessly.

Text: After being quoted 133 for the evening, I was handed a bill for nearly 40$ more than I was quoted. My military discount was waived without my knowing. The people were nice but the no notice discount waive was not a pleasant surprise
