SpringHill Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Downtown

Text: Always a clean and pleasant experience. The staff are very helpful and nice. They newly renovated their lobby and put in new carpeting everywhere along with a new gym and it's beautiful. Beds are comfortable, bathroom/shower split are clean and perfectly fine. The new pullout sofas aren't the best to sleep on. I highly recommend staying here.

Text: The location is very convenient by the beautiful canal, museums and businesses, the room was very clean and comfortable (the matress was awesome), in the bathroom the small lotion cream provided was already used. The science networking session was held in the building next to the hotel, which was internally connected. The bad thing about the service was that the reservation was made for a group of 40 people in double rooms very ahead of time, and when we arrive the keys to get in were not ready which took us a lot of time, plus they mistakenly didn't prepare reservation for 2 people, who almost lost their spot in the hotel.

Text: The hotel was very nice and convenient for our purposes. We waited a bit to check in, but not too long. The room was comfortable, modern, and incredibly clean. The only issue was that we couldn't find the information about breakfast hours or other info in the room, nor was there a direct line to the front desk that we could tell, so that was a minor inconvenience. There was also a family next to us with kids that we could hear through the walls, but there isn't much to be done about that. Breakfast was decent, and checkout was simple and pleasant. I would definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in downtown Indy for a great hotel that won't break the bank.

Text: So far the stay has been very comfortable and convenient. I haven't yet used any of the amenities, but the rooms are comfortable and I'd stay here again. Parking is absolutely horrible, however. Find a free place to park if at all possible

Text: Super clean and nice. Also right next to the river walk and canal walk. Not far at all from the downtown bars and restaurants. Grab one of the pacers bike share bikes and you get pretty much anywhere from here.
