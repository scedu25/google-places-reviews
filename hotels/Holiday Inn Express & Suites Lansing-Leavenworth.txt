Text: Cozy with very friendly staff. Rooms were clean and well organized. Free Wifi.  Free breakfast. The breakfast area was clean but super crowded when we were there and it took them a while to restock items. Spa was a little on the cool side for my taste and the pool was so cold the kids were shivering.
