Text: Nice apartments but dated. The cleaning staff were always friendly and helpfull when we needed things. Very Quiet area if you do not mind the bugle calls going off all day :-) I stayed there for 80 days and it seemed I had to rekey my card once per week. Not sure what the problem was there. My wife did not have problems with her card. Not the managements fault but I really hate it when people leave their clothing in the washer and dryer for hours thus not allowing the other residents the opportunity to use the appliances.

Text: Studio apartment/ hotel room, pretty big for one person. I hear alot of people complain but they are not bad apartments. Have room service and full kitchens. Air and heat work good. And the laundry equipment downstairs is relatively nice. Just leave it clean for the next person. Wi-Fi is pretty slow. Toilets flush slow and lighting is out dated.
