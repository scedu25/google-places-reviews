Inn At Harbour Ridge Bed and Breakfast

Text: Absolutely the most outstanding stay I've ever had and I travel A LOT! From the charming exterior, to the warm greeting from the owners...staying here is like coming home! The entire property is exceptionally clean. I always bring my own bedding when I travel and wear flip flops around the hotel room...both completely unnecessary here!!! There are so many small touches that the owners take time with and they truly add up to one massively magical experience! I can't wait to go back!!!

Text: Exceptional in every way: Rooms and common area are comfortable and inviting.  Respect for privacy is ideal with excellent touch of personal interest. There is incredible, attention to detail at every turn, every corner, every wall and more.  The breakfasts are gourmet with beautiful presentation. Excellent location with wide spectrum of excellent restaurants and the recommendations were perfect too.  Overall, the owner's earnest goal for perfect stay was accomplished in every way.

Text: Sue and Ron, made us feel welcome in there home, we were treated like old friends, we went there on a weekend getaway for our Anniversary, we even took our little fur baby Champ for the weekend with us. 
The breakfasts were totally amazing, and had all the little special touches, our room was outstanding even had a private hot tub, on our own deck. While we were out one evening, Sue put some chocolate strawberries and wine in our room, what a nice surprise that was, our Anniversary is really on Halloween, but we got away to celebrate a little early, Sue even set up a Ghost Tour for us, at a Haunted B&B, what a way to end a wonderful weekend. We will definitely be going back again. 
Thank you Ron & Sue , for such an amazing experience for our 1st time ever in a Bed and Breakfast, and our 1st time to the Lake of the Ozarks.

Text: We really enjoyed our stay.  We stayed in Uncle Bill's room and it was very quiet and comfortable.  Ron and Sue were very friendly and took care of everything we needed.  They also have a great knowledge of all the local attractions, and can recommend things to do/eat. Breakfast was delicious both mornings and ensured that we weren't even hungry for lunch.  We will definitely be back when we're ready for another lake weekend.
