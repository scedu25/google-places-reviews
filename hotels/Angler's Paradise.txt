Angler's Paradise

Text: I've been to Angler's Paradise twice now and will definitely be going there again soon -- and I'm from St. Louis so you know that must count for something that I'd spend 4+ hours driving to a private fishing lake on the Missouri / Kansas borderline. 

I've been fishing all my life and know a decent lake when I fish one. My personal best bass caught from this fishing lake is 5 pounds and I've caught numerous 2 and 3 pound bass. I have no doubt this lake holds 10+ pound fish. 

Once an old coal strip mine, this lake offers all of the right elements: 40+ foot deep water, lots of shoreline, tons of cover throughout, (rock, hardwood, brush, etc.) and an excellent population of forage fish to keep the bass fat and happy. Did I mention it's in a beautiful setting too? 

Don Kentner, owner and creator of Angler's Paradise, did an excellent job of packaging all the right elements for a good fishing trip. He has some very nice fishing cabins with ALL of the necessary elements, including sat TV, AC, kitchen, etc., to make a stay quite comfortable. Need a fishing guide to show you around the lake? Don does that too. 

I'm not a hunter, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention there are some excellent deer and turkey hunting opportunities; I see deer out there all the time!

And lastly, there are several "down home" and most excellent restaurants close by in Kansas, my favorite being Chicken Annie's. I could live on their fried chicken! 

My thanks to Don for providing us this jewel of a fishing lake resort here in Missouri.
