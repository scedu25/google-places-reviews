Text: Hotel was right off highway and clean. Newly remodeled. I had and issue with the shower head in my room and they were quick to fix it. Would stay again.

Text: Clean. Refrigerator and microwave. Matress is a little more firm than I'd like, but it does the job. Not much of a work space/desk in the room. Included breakfast is simple, but decently accomplishes it's purpose. Overall, it's great for a quick overnight/weekend stay in the area. It just wouldn't be my first choice for an extended business stay.

Text: This hotel has cockroaches & staff that do not know how to operate their own billing system. They did a pre authorization of over $1200 on our account. Asst. Mgr. Lopa Patel is very rude & the most unprofessional manager that I have encountered.
