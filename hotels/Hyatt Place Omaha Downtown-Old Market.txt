Hyatt Place Omaha/Downtown-Old Market
Rating: 5
Text: If you are visiting the Old Market, this hotel is the perfect place to stay. The property is very clean and well-kept, with up-to-date furnishings throughout.  The guest rooms are stylish and relaxing, and everything works perfectly.  The complimentary breakfast was tasty and well organized. The price was fair ($139 + $10 parking), considering the location and the quality of this property. My wife and I have stayed here twice, and will definitely return for another romantic getaway to the Old Market.

Text: Cons: The parking is not free. The hotel is under staffed and could be cleaner.  The bathroom in our room was freezing cold, as it had no heater vent.  

Pros: The location is great. Breakfast is included (and not bad).  Cookies.

Text: The walls are paper thin. I heard my neighbor brush their teeth and every time they coughed like they were in the room. The plumbing sounded like an airborne, which is totally great when people take showers at 3 am. On the flip side the location was wonderful and walking to restaurants was awesome. The Hyatt staff was very friendly and welcoming.

Text: Plenty of parking but had to pay. Everything in old market within walking distance. Wasn't overly priced. Air conditioning worked well. Could use new shower heads and vending machines. Fridge wasn't very cold. Rooms were clean. Great breakfast. Has a pool but never checked it out. Would stay again.
