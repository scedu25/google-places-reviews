Carlyle Lake Administration
Rating: 5
Text: This is one of the places to camp around lake Carlyle. You can also camp at the State Park down the street. This location "Carlyle Lake Administration" is on of the army cour of engineers camp grounds. These spots all have power and some of them face the lake. All spots here are shaded, clean, have fire pits and showers close by. The showers were clean but not air condition. This location is nice because the marina to put your boat in is only a mile away. The camp ground is quite and full of familys. ENJOY!
