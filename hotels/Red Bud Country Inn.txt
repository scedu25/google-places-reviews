Red Bud Country Inn

Text: Raj was so accomodating to us and our entire group.  We had a wedding at a nearby winery and were able to reserve almost every room at the inn.  He was flexable and allowed us to switch some rooms around so that those who wanted to stay up late were away from those who wanted to get some rest.  The rooms were very clean and the breakfast in the morning was great!  I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice room at an extremely reasonable rate.
