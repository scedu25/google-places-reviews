Text: The location was right off the main road and easy to enter. The parking lot had very little to no trash outside and the room was cleaned up well and everything was neat. Overall it seemed well taken care of.

Text: This place is the worst place I ever stayed at. The bathroom is filthy and they give you one dirty towel and washcloth for 3 people. Bad Bad Bad

Text: Room was large and fairly decent but the smell of cat urine seemed to permeate the whole place, especially just outside the room around the bushes. Granted we stayed there because they were pet friendly, but it could really benefit from a good power washing and carpet cleaning.

Text: We read all the previous reviews and were a bit nervous but there was nothing to be nervous about! This hotel is clean, the air conditioning worked and there were no bugs anywhere! The owners were friendly and accommodating in every way! We could not have been happier with our stay! This is an older hotel in a small town so please do not expect to walk into a modern 21st century hotel. We will be back!

Text: Jodi- She runs a great place for lodging. Very mindful of my personal comfort. Enjoy a quite place, walking distance to many food, fuel and Walmart. I strongly recommend this one. I have stayed multiple weeks at a time for business
