Text: Country Inn & Suites in Marion is an excellent place to stay. Our room was reasonably priced, very clean, decorated nicely and had all the amenities that we needed, and then some! My daughter has recently had training in hospitality, and she "inspected"the room based on her training and it pass with flying colors! We definitely will stay there again!
