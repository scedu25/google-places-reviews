Text: Our stay at Homewood was comfortable. The room or suite was very nice. We used the refrigerator to hold the contents of our cooler. There were two television sets, one in front room and other in bedroom. Thanks King bed was especially comfortable. I made coffee in the provided one cup pot in the morning. The only irritation was there inadequate wifi service.

Text: A decent place to stay a night or two. The breakfast options are good, the rooms themselves smell funny.

Text: The hotel was old and extremely dated. I could barely get through one night. A group of us were supposed to stay here for a few months. We stayed one night and changed location the following day. Can't believe it's a Hilton property, it was worse than a motel, by far. Just thinking of it grosses me out. Sorry for the bad review guys but it's really time to update and clean up!

Text: This hotel will become my new go to when I am in the Kansas City area. It was set up lie a 1 bedroom apartment. It had a small kitchenette, and more than anything it was clean....no mold or mildew in the bathroom ceiling or shower, the bed was comfortable,  and the continental breakfast was good...
