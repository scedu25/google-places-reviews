Days Inn Fremont

Text: We rented the meeting rooms for a wedding. Some staff was kind and accommodating but some were rude. The place was dirty though. The floors were filthy and the corners had huge cobwebs and spider eggs. The rooms we used to change and stay the night were good though. Everything seemed clean in them. The pool was nice. A shame we couldn't use the pool later at night since the reception went to midnight.

Text: I slept very well and that's all that matters to me so thank you!! I have been to many different hotels and so far this is the only one that I can think of that gives you actual control of the temperature of your room. I like my room very cold when I sleep and I got what wanted. The beds were even more comfortable than most of the other hotels I've stayed in. Anyway, thanks again for a great nights rest.

Text: Reading the reviews almost scared me out of staying here. They have improved. Clean room, good air conditioning. Nice king size bed. The person who checked us in was very helpful! I would rather pay $77 here vs $149 next door at the Marriott or Holiday inn. Heading to the free breakfast now...fingers crossed!

Text: Dog friendly, large lawn to walk the pup.  Clean enough, courteous staff, breakfast was as expected (waffles, cereal, bad coffee, yogurt, weird platter shaped pieces of egg).  Would recommend, especially if you have a dog.

Text: The hotel room smelled like smoke, not good for a non smoking room. Water smelled like sewer water. They advertise the indoor pool as heated, the room it's in is heated not the pool. The pool water was about 70° & the hot tubs jets did not work & the water was a light brown color. I'm marking this specific hotel off my list to revisit. I will visit a different hotel in Fremont, Ohio. Fremont is a nice, friendly quit city.
