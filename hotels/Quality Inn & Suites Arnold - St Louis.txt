Text: It's a nice location and a good price. The room is nice as well. I chose this hotel based on the amenities which were lacking. The workout room is in poor quality and I found multiple bugs floating in the pool. However, if your just looking for a cheap place to stay it's a good hotel!

Text: The room we rented had a king bed and a hot tub in it--way worth the extra money we spent on the room. However, It was still affordable and the bed was comfortable. The free breakfast was delicious as well.

Text: Rooms look very new and updated. The bed sheets have stains on them, and so do the curtains. I was expecting better
