Americas Best Value Inn - Lake Erie Sandusky
Rating: 1
Text: Disgusting place. It smells like it has never been deep cleaned and the walls had lots of stains on them, including a very noticeable stain on the television. The sheets were not changed from the last people who were in our room. We found crumbs and stains in both beds when We pulled back the sheets. We left before sleeping there since it was such a dump. They also said that all the rooms were booked when there were no cars in the parking lot. It was a really sketchy place. Not a family place for sure. Also there was a strong smell of marijuana in the lobby.

Text: The Inn is located in the heart of Sandusky, and only 7 miles away from Cedar Point! My daughter and I drove into Sandusky from Mid-Michigan for our stay and started our day at the amusement park. We went and checked in around 3, and the woman working the desk was very nice and welcoming. She checked us in no issue, and we found our room easily! They had signs up giving us good direction to find the rooms, and when we got there to my daughter's delight, we found the pool right outside our window! We went for a swim for about an hour before grabbing dinner 2 seconds down the road at taco bell, (in the parking lot of the Inn is a SONIC!) and then headed back to the amusement park. Then, we grabbed some ice cream from a DQ right down the road and came back. The bed was large and welcoming, and we crashed immediately. It was nice, the room was clean, and overall we will come back.

Text: Hotel looks cute from the outside and even the lobby.  Once we got into our room it was very small, had a stale odor about it, a dingy feel about it, and needed major upgrades.  Once I went into the bathroom I noticed the soap had been opened by a previous guest and set on a wash cloth with ghe packaging near by and both of the complimentary shampoos had been used.  The TV was an old tube TV, which was fine, but couldn't get the remote to work on it.  TV appear to only have one working channel and it was on Cartoon Network, which again would have been okay but it was on Adult Swim and I have an 8 year old son who does not need to be watching American Dad or Cleveland Show.  When I went to ask about the channels the desk clerk told me that it was very possible the TV only had one channel.  When we asked about the hours of the pool she told us 10am (possibly 11am, she wasn't sure) until midnight.  We asked directions to the pool since it was our first night.  She gave us directions but they were not correct ones.  We discovered there was a sign on the pool gate stating it was "under service of maintenance" and could not enter.  We went back to the clerk and she had no idea why it would say that but guessed maybe they just put in fresh chemicals.  I would have thought that it would be important for the desk clerk to know how many TV channels (okay, maybe not an exact number but to know there were more than one) and that the pool was not to be used and why.  About 10pm someone knocked on our door to ask about the remote.  By then we reset the TV and were able to manually change channels.  I thanked him for checking on us but decided his service because we were already in our pajamas.  In the morning we had housekeepers knock on the door on two separate occasions and since there was no do not disturb sign to put outside of the door I was appreciative they knocked prior to entering.  I told both of them that we did not require room service since we were only staying two nights.  When we returned later that day we found that someone had entered the room and half cleaned the room.  The already used soap and shampoo were still there, my sons bed was made but mine was not, and all trash was left behind (again, fine because I had requested to NOT have room service).  However if you are going to clean a room, clean it, don't only clean what you want.  When I discovered someone had been in the room after twice requesting that no one go in on top of the other issues my son and I decided to end our vacation a day early.  When we went to return our keys and let them know we were checking out early, we were never asked why we were leaving.  We will never return to the hotel and possibly never to another America's Best Inn.

Text: This place looks wonderful when you first walk in. The staff is friendly also. But as soon as you walk passed the glossy floor up to date floor everything turns outdated and disgusting. Our first room (room 131) was a smoking room. I did not expect very much from this hotel considering it’s price, but even with that, I was highly disappointed. We walk all the way to the other side of the hotel at the very end. The room smells horrible. The bathroom is the first thing I saw and it was disgusting, there was no hand soap for the sink, the walls were dirty and rusty, and the  toilet was dirty. Then in the main room the sheets and room looks like it hasn’t been touched since the hotel was made. The walls were disgusting and dirty. The Tv was older than me and the remote did not even work. I sat on the bed thinking that there are no more issues considering those above aren’t horrible. Until we went to lay down. I took my shoes off lifted up the sheet and they were disgusting. There were bugs all over,  and they were so dirty. While inspecting the sheet I felt something crawl on my foot, looking down to see ants all over the ground everywhere. So we switched rooms, the woman at the front desk was very helpful and  understanding, however she did say that the non smoking were cleaner than the smoking, hinting that the smoking rooms were not cleaned often. She then put us in room 255 a non smoking room. While walking up the stairs I notice spiders hanging from the ceiling and a bug that looked very similar to a giant roach. But for some reason, I decided to give this second room a chance. This room honestly looked way better than the first one but the sheets were still dirty and the window was broken, there was profanity written on the walls,  and bugs flying everywhere. After that, we left. Didn’t get money back or anything. Just checked out and left. Do not go here. You will regret it very much.

Text: I am going to be very honest here. I made a reservation back in January to stay in the first weekend of June for the full weekend. I called the week before to check on it and they said it was fine. I then called the day of to check if we could check in late that night in which they told us again that everything was good. Though when we arrived they claimed that they lost our reservation and booked under us. I understand computer problems... But if you know you are having them why would you keep booking people?? Aside from that they would not help us find another hotel. Basically sorry for you luck. Too bad, so sad. 
The location is very sketchy and the lobby was very outdated and old. Plus apparently they won't help fix their mistakes. I recommend anywhere else, like the Hampton Inn with has a lower room rate, higher rating, breakfast in the morning and the nicest most helpful staff I ever met and super clean comfy rooms.
