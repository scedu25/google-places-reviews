Rating: 5
Text: Came here for a staycation. So nice! Well, Residence Inn Hotels are great in general; this was just like the rest. Has good breakfast, washer/dryers, pool, and workout room. Also, love it here because It has a great location near Red Lobster, Mall, and other shopping Plazas.

Text: Most of the staff is pleasant,  and the rooms and common areas are clean. Appliances are older and not all were in working condition. Beds were a little worn, but good enough. Nice indoor pool and basketball court. Weekday breakfasts were very good.

Text: Enjoyed the suite, was clean and had an equipped kitchenette. Would be great for families. Breakfast could have been better. Stayed 3 nights and there wasn't much change in offerings. Third day they ran out of a lot of items,  or would be 4 stars.

Text: The beds are VERY comfortable. The room we have needs some renovation and the kitchen cleaned a bit better because it is sticky. Other than that it is good. Very quiet.
