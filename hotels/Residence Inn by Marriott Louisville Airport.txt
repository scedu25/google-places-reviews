Residence Inn by Marriott Louisville Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Decent hotel.  Stayed here for work.  The front desk staff was very pleasant.  Room was clean, although I think the hotel is due for a facelift.  The dishwasher leaked and I couldn't get the drain to stay open in the tub.  Nothing that would prevent me from staying here again.  Plus, it's very close to the airport.

Text: Chris at the front desk was extremely helpful. He was very polite and tried all he could to help us. Our room was very clean, well stocked and the beds were comfortable. The living room had a nice atmosphere with the fireplace. The breakfast was plentiful. Highly recommended.

Text: TheI staff was very helpful and quickly responsive to needs. The suite I was in was comfortable and felt like a secondary home vs just a regular room. I will definitely be returning to this place.

Text: Great stay! The night shift attendant was very helpful and accommodating to me and my family's needs. The one bedroom suite was enough for my wife and two small grandkids. The pull out bed (from the couch) was just right.

Text: The planes start Taking off at 2:50 AM and they don't stop.  Guests better have earplugs or forget sleeping after that time.  Other than that it is an ok place.
