Text: We come down to Morehead every year on memorial day weekend and working in a hotel I know how stressful holiday weekends can be sometimes and we were not disappointed with this stay. The staff was polite and respectful the rooms were clean and comfortable. The location was fantastic for everything we needed to do this weekend. I hadn't been to this Hampton Inn for many years and I was very happy to see everything looking fresh and up to date. Also the breakfast was very good, although the breakfast attendant had a bit of an issue keeping everything stocked. Overall great stay and we will definitely be coming back here in the future!

Text: This is your typical Hampton Inn. The place was clean and neat but did not stand out on any special way. The free breakfast was rather Spartan. The staff were very polite and the parking lot was well lite and appeared to be safe.

Text: This Hampton is located right in the center of the town of Morehead, placing it within a mile of many restaurants. The hotel itself is a little hard to find from the main road off the highway, but GPS will get you there. The rooms are on larger side for a Hampton. Very helpful and friendly concierge.

Text: We stayed overnight Saturday into Sunday for a family reunion and checked in roughly at 3:30. Upon arrival the front desk staff were courteous and got us into our room right away. The room was clean and well laid out and the atmosphere overall was nice. The breakfast selection was top notch and overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
