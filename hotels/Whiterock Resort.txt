Text: I visited this place a few times back when it was still Garst Farms. A great deal of land to do just about any outdoor activity in. Great trails, fishing, and canoe paths. The resort itself is a very nice place to stay. I have nothing but fond memories of this part of Iowa.

Text: Comfortable, affordable, old school "murder/slasher" movie vibe going on. Dig it

Text: The Whitrock Conservancy is just an amazing place!  There are five resort houses within the land, and miles of biking, hiking, and horseback riding.  The Conservancy is 5,400 acres of the most beautiful rolling hills and oak savanna.  I really enjoyed the sunrises and sunsets, everyday they amazed me!  The land has so many deer, bald eagles, hawks, rabbits, and pheasants.  I don't think there was a day that went by during my stay that I didn't see a multitude of wildlife.  At night the stars are awe inspiring, and there is even a star festival I might try to come back for.  The town of CoonRapids is five miles away and has cute shops and good food.
