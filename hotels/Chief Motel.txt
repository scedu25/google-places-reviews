Text: This is something America is missing anymore. The small little motels that made road tripping so much fun. Very clean. Everyone is friendly. Washer and dryer on site. Fridge in the rooms that was clean. Absolutely loved it. Brought back lots of good memories from my childhood. We traveled allot,and just being here made me want to take the kids on a road trip for the weekend just for fun. I highly recommended staying here if you get the chance. And something else awesome to check out while here is the 50 / 60s era dinner right across the road.

Text: Room was in good condition, with good upkeep. New tile in the bathroom on the floor and walls of the shower, carpet seemed to be in good condition, everything else was well kept. The room had a bit of a musty smell before we turned on the air. The bed was nothing out of the ordinary either for its comfort or discomfort. There was plenty of space for all our luggage and travel food to be kept out of the way. Continental breakfast was cereal and sweet baked items (muffins, donut holes, etc.) in the main office. In all, it was a good stay for the price. Would stay here again.
