French Quarter Inn

Text: On all counts the hotel is subpar, they have done some remodeling and finally updating from their old tube televisions. The tv channel quality us terrible. And I would say the majority of their whirlpool tubs are disgusting and should never be used. It's an older hotel and at one point in time was probably very nice and top-of-the-line but that time has passed if not for the fact the city doesn't have very many hotels I seriously doubt they'd still be in business

Text: The staff were so friendly! The rooms were clean and had very comfortable rooms. I couldn't believe the size of the Jacuzzi tubs in all the rooms! I will definitely be back to this hotel if I find my way back to this area.

Text: An older hotel so upgrade to one of the River side suites to better appreciate the historic little local.

Text: The French Quarter Inn is a pretty nice hotel, clean, with a friendly staff. The rooms are a bit dated as far as styling goes, but the Whirlpool tub makes up for it.

Text: A bit dated, but the amazing bathtub/Whirlpool is 2x the normal size. Great town to visit
