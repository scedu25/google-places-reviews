Text: The rooms were very clean, but the staff could have been friendlier. The prices are pretty competitive. Over all we had a decent experience

Text: Room smelled like smoke even though it was listed as a non smoking room.  Lady at the front desk did hook me up with some air freshner, so kudos to her.  The pillows are tiny and uncomfortable, and the walls are paper thin.  Heard the TV in the next room and guy hacking a lung up in the other.

Text: We loved our stay. Everyone was so nice. We had to visit the front desk a few times and they were quick and pleasant each time. We loved the pool hot tub area. It was clean and spacious with ample seating. The room was clean and well designed with seating and desk space. Hot water was hot and the shower had great water pressure. The beds were heavenly. So comfortable with clean white bedding. Highly recommend.

Text: It is a great place to stay if you dont work at 6 am. Of course i do, so no breakfast. So far it is a great place to stay and i like it. It is right across from the bass pro shop.
