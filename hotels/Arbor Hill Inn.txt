Arbor Hill Inn

Text: We stayed overnight while in the area for a wedding. The room was nice and the hosts where very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was great. The only negative was that our bed was positioned right below a window with no curtain so the sunlight was pretty intense in the morning. It wasn't a huge deal and may not even bother someone else. Overall it was a great experience and I would stay here again.

Text: My brother and his beautiful new wife had their wedding this weekend at Arbor Hill.  Everything was top notch 5 star service.  The owners Kris and Laura provide spectacular service, fabulous food, and an overall welcoming atmosphere.  Arbor Hill is spotless, the rooms are all superb!  This was a very memorable experience for our family.

Text: We bought the elopement package. What a wonderful way to fix our botched original courthouse wedding! 10 years later I finally got my small ceremony! I got to whear The dress. Arbor hill provided everything we needed and my husband was very impressed with the sweet!  They worked around my food allergies. And even provided a gluten free cake! Completely worth it!
