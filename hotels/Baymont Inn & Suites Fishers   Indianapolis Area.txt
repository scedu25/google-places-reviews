Baymont Inn & Suites Fishers / Indianapolis Area

Text: Nice hotel and we got a nice room for an affordable rate. The staff is nice and helpful and the free breakfast is always a nice perk. We had a whirlpool room which was nice and there was more than enough room in the very large room for my husband and I and all of our things. We did notice that they may currently have a problem with their fire sprinkler systems leaking. My husband was getting ice from the ice machine and noticed a small puddle in the hall. But our room was dry and comfy. We we're literally within walking distance of almost everything we we're wanting to check out. And we only had to drive a few minutes to get to the new IKEA in Fishers. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling into Indianapolis. Comfortable and affordable.

Text: Hotel was recently renovated. Very nice lobby area, staff very friendly. Room was standard, nothing too fancy. Bed was a bit firm, but in good shape. Bathroom and everything was standard, everything worked properly. Breakfast was good, wide variety of food and ample seating. Quality just what you'd expect. Very good value for the money.

Text: Wish I could leave zero stars! Worst hotel I've ever stayed at!! First room A/C didn't work. Moved to another room A/C didn't work! Drove 9 hours then told me they had nothing else. Finally had to call manager to find another room within the hotel. The worst front desk customer service I've ever came across!! Didn't do anything to adjust price!! If it wasn't so late I would have left!! Stay away from this place!!

Text: The room was nice, we wanted to stay another night. So my wife called the front desk to book another night and the woman at the desk gave her an awful attitude and threatened her with a $250 fee for having a dog in our room, We dont even own a dog! When i went to the desk to ask why my wife was being treated that way and what made her think we had a dog, she offered no apology and told me there was a dog barking in that area of the hotel, apparently that was reason enough to harass a hotel guest. We ended up staying the second night and our 8 month old was having an awful morning teething, I called the front desk and asked if we could check out at 12 instead of 11, the woman I spoke to said it was no problem. At 11:50 as we're gathering our things and getting ready to check out, the same woman who harassed my wife the day before calls the room, being rude again, and tells my wife we are WAY passed check out. I call back and ask why we are being bothered after we were given a late check out? Again, no reason, no apology. Just plain awful service from a rude woman. We will never give Baymont our business again, we can pay $40 anywhere else and receive 10 times better service.

Text: The lady that checked us in was super nice. The room was somewhat clean. There was green stuff all around the tub, you couldn't plug it to give my son a bath. The countertop was cracked. The air conditioner really didn't work, very stuffy. 
I could over look most things but there was no parking, literally every night. I ended up parking behind the building and there where signs saying we would be towed, but there was no other option. 
The lady that checked me out was rude.
