So Dear to My Heart Bed and Breakfast

Text: Brenda was a perfect hostess! She planned her afternoon around my arrival and upgraded me so I wouldn't be bothered by some fall bugs. The house was charming and immediately felt like a home away from home! I will definitely be planning a trip back to this lovely B&B nestled in the quiet Iowa countryside. Thank you for the wonderful stay!

Text: An excellant place to stay with beatiful rooms. Exuberant staff and a lovely breakfast home made right on the farm. The kids love the animals. A great place to escape the lousy noises of the city.

Text: Didn't stay due to having too many animals on the property because I am scared of all animals but Ms. Brenda was very nice, polite, and welcoming. The place was very nice.

Text: We just returned from a trip to southeastern Iowa with two night stay at this bed and breakfast... and it exceeded my expectations. Brenda's home is the perfect setting for a comfortable get away and she is an excellent host. We were treated like we were close family. We will be back!
