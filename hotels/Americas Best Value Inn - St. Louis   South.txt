Americas Best Value Inn - St. Louis / South
Rating: 3
Text: America's Best Value Inn was an average hotel stay. There were possible can security concerns with the entry door by my hotel room. It did not close completely or automatically. The room door also did not close automatically or with any force that allowed it to close and shut by itself. Staff however was very pleasant and kind in both check-in and check-out. The continental breakfast in the morning with a variety of items perhaps rotating was standard. Stay over all at America's Best Value Inn was okay.

Text: This hotel was ok but could have been better. Staff were mostly friendly and helpful and the beds and bathroom were clean. The hallway smelled very strongly of smoke but the room was ok. The floor was somewhat damp and not vacuumed very thoroughly. Also we asked for a crib for our youngest and were told that IF he could find one they were $10 extra even though the information in the room stated that they were available and complimentary. The free breakfast was decent for the price of the room. We probably wouldn't stay here again if we had other options but for this stay everything else around was booked due to the solar eclipse.
