Baymont Inn & Suites Conference Center South Haven

Text: They did some upgrading to the rooms and most the employees are nice. They need to stop the other guests/visitors from bugging guest's for money and rides. I know of the people so I know the money is not going to a good cause.

Text: Great hotel. Great price. The rooms were clean and updated. The breakfast was small, but adequate. The mattress could use a replacement, but 8/10 would stay again.

Text: Breakfast area is quite small and the biscuits were like sawdust. Beds are still box spring based and not very comfortable. On the positive side rooms are good size and have a microwave and a sizable refrigerator. Location is very convenient to freeway and not too far from South Haven.

Text: Lovely quaint little place. Close to everything in town. Squeaky floor, smaller hot tub, but no real issues.
