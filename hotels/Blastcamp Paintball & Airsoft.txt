Text: The owner is very knowledgeable of paintball , fair with prices. Has a excellent pro shop with all the lastest gear. Awesome staff, refs are top notch. The field is historic and so life like. Definitely worth your time. Field used to be a real military base.

Text: It's unfortunate I have to move out of state right as Blast Camp finally started integrating airsoft open play on the weekends. Even though I have gone to 90% of the monthly airsoft events at Blast Camp for the past 2 years and the player turnout is 100+ people it's not really my thing. I find that there really aren't enough refs for these large crowds and the opening of the entire field doesn't tactically work out that well. 

HOWEVER, the open play days are a Blast! Great amount of people, good ref to player ratio, different game types. I recommend trying to go to open play over the bigger events if you can help it.

Another plus is that the fill station and chrono area is right by the gate so you don't have to run back and forth too much. The store has extra bb's if I need it and the parking allows you to be within 100 feet of the fields. The referees are fair and the owner seems like a nice guy from the brief time I spent talking to him. Anytime you have a question about when the next airsoft game is check both their site and their FB page. Also, there are very responsive to messages on FB. 

I have enjoyed my time playing there!

Text: Large and fantastically filled field. Great refs and workers but sometimes I wish there were more refs. This is the only major airsoft arena I've been to in Indiana but I wouldn't doubt it's probably the best.
