Courtyard by Marriott Dayton North
Rating: 4
Text: Very clean and very accommodating Hotel. It was a bit humid during our stay but that may have been in anticipation of the storms that were coming that day. Definitely not a super dry environment that leaves you coughing and dehydrated. The hot tub and pool were nice and the staff was very friendly.

Text: Good hotel overall. My stay was interrupted by a black biker gathering. From 2pm - 11 pm the parking lot was blocked off by bikers with blaring music and loud bikes. Luckily this was only 2 nights out of the 8 I was here. Staff was friendly and rooms were clean. A lot of good restaurants around and close to the interstate for access. If I were in the area I would stay here again.

Text: Not up to typical Marriott standards.  Room was old. Noise from above room started early and was from maitainance staff/cleaning and pasted hours. Staff was nice.

Text: They have bed bugs!!! I pay more money to sleep comfortable and worry free from these type of things! The water pressure in the shower is horrible as well, my overall stay was a huge disappointment ?

Text: This hotel was nice and clean. The staff was also very friendly. I booked this hotel on priceline express deals and was immediately disappointed when I saw it booked a courtyard.  I was traveling with my wife and young son and I knew breakfast would not be included. My only other complaint is that the lobby doors are not automatic, so you had to wrestle the the two sets of double doors when you were bringing your luggage in and out.
