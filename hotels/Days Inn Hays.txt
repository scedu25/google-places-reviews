Text: First stop on the our trip for a night, for the price we were very pleased. My favorite part was the dog park area. It was clean and spacious. My yorkie Rowdy enjoyed his walks! Would stay here again!

Text: The rooms are clean and we were able to bring our fur babies in with us (for a fair fee), there's also an on leash dog park around back of the hotel which is nice.
