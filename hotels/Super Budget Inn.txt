Text: I stayed their a week. Most disgusting dirty hotel ever i would take a shower and feel even dirtier when i got out. Found roaches carpet had like a weird sticky film. Smelt funky very dirty. i stayed with my husband and 2 year old son not a safe hotel. Everyday i would get asked if i wanted to buy drugs or if someone could get a ride. The hotel manager is a angry little indian man. He will not work with you very hard to communicate. Do not stay anywhere within a 5 mile radius. Its worth it to go to a chain hotel and spend 10-15$ more

Text: No dead bolt lock or any other way to lock door. Heater in room didnt work. When told office said would fix it but never did. Room was very spacious and like the discretion the hotel provides but needs the property to be updated.

Text: Do not go to this hotel! It is awful! It's dirty and has roaches. It gave my wife anxiety and she was barely able to get to sleep. It's  very cheap but I guess you get what you pay for in this case. The carpet is peeling. You have to have $10 in cash for the deposit so you don't steal the remote. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!

Text: Literally the most filthy place ever!! I wasn't even in my room and hour, I saw multiple roaches on the walls, floor, and bed. I got video of the roaches crawling on my bed, showed it to the people at the front desk and their dumb asses said it was a fly...since when did flies just crawl on beds?! I tried to get my money back with in an hour of checking and they made up some bullsh*t rule saying I should have came back within 10 minutes if I was unsatisfied. I've never hated a business so much. I wish giving no stars was an option. I truly hope it burns down.

Text: Omg! Don't ever go here. This place shouldn't be open. I felt like i was in the twilight zone. They wanted to charge 300 for one week. We got a room and went to turn on the heater and it shocked my wife. There was a short in the wire and when i plugged it in she was holding the cord and it shocked her. I pulled back the blanket and looked like someone had stood and urinated on the bed. I went to the office and demanded my money back and they took 10 of it for a fee. I wouldnt let a homeless person stay here. They have a better chance of survival in the harshest of elements then to stay 30 mins in this hotel that time has forgotten... CLOSE THIS PLACE..
