Text: Amazing bass fishing. Nice beach for the kids. They need to sift the sand though it has rocks or is clumpy.

Text: My wife, myself and my 4 year old son had a great day this past Sunday fishing  at Iowa Lake.  We just went on my boat to help my son catch his first fish.  He caught two crappie.  One thing I would like to mention is my son wanted to go on the beach.  Once we got there I was disappointed to see owners of their dogs dismiss the "no pets beyond this point"  and had their dogs on the beach.   We actually saw dogs crapping on the beach and that's with kids playing on it and going into the water.  I hope the conservation people can watch that closer and fine people for not obeying the signs.

Text: The camping grounds and showers were well maintained. Lots of space available and low fees. We rented a boat for a day and had a blast on the lake.
