Holiday Inn Express & Suites Pittsburg

Text: We came to this area for Marian Days which is located in Carthage, MO.  Since all the in town or closer hotels were full we decided on this best one in Pittsburg, KS which is 39 miles out from our destination.  The service was great!  We arrived on Friday and they let us check-in and our room was available at around 10:30am which is sooner than the normal 3pm check-in.  Since I drove all night from the Twin Cities I was exhausted so the early check-in allowed me to rest in their new comfortable bed and pillows.  It was even better than sleeping at home.  I believe it was a commercial Sealy mattress but I don't know what type of pillows they have.  The hot breakfast was on.  The only complaint is when people are talking in the hall we can hear everything and since I'm a light sleeper it woke me up early.

I would recommend this hotel if you are in or near Pittsburg, KS.

Text: I met in the Buffalo room for a graduation party. The room was rented by my friends from West Africa, a totally different culture. The hotel staff treated my friends wonderfully. The room was fully prepped and ready for use.

Text: One of the better hotels in the area. Not much for a fitness center, pool is small and chemicals were strong.
