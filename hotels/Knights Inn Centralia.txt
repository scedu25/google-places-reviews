Text: It was a last resort situation. Was caught in a snow storm roughly an hour or two away from home. Only rooms available were smoking, I understand that they have a limited number of rooms. Shower was gross, needed cleaned badly. My pillow case had a burn mark from a cigarette. The other pillows had hair under them. My girlfriend found a bug in the blanket, not on the blanket but inside the blanket's fibers. Heater worked great and had a king sized bed also. Staff was polite. I feel like if they focus more on cleaning it would be a better hotel. We didn't even use a blanket we just turned the heater on and laid there till we fell asleep.
