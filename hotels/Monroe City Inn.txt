Text: I would only stay at this hotel again if I did not have any other options or for an emergency.  Hotel had a funny smell when we entered.  Our room also had this same funny smell. The room was very run down and looked like it could use a fresh coat of paint and a good cleaning.  The hallway/stairs were not vaccumed the entire 3 days we were at the hotel and our room was also not vaccumed when it was cleaned.
The pool was okay, though the hot tub was not working.
The breakfast was cold ceral and cookies.  Luckily there were were other options for a warm breakfast close by.
