Text: Our stay at The Round House has been AMAZING!!! We have enjoyed the coziness and comfort of this unique home. It has lots of space, the comforts of our own home. So thankful our daughter found this Round House!!!! The "peace and quite" makes for a restful, relaxing and enjoyable vacation. The went to The Ark Encounter one day and The Creation Museum the next day we were here. It was about 1 hour and 30 minutes away but an easy trip. Loved seeing so much of this beautiful are. I promise you if you come here you will Not Regret It!!!???
