Hampton Inn & Suites Columbus-Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: We arrived and our room was not ready. We asked if an upgrade was available and we received one. The best room they offer!! The shower was heaven! The staff was friendly and helpful. Clifford was an amazing addition to the experience. He was incredibly personable and always made sure to talk to us when we were in the lobby. This was a wonderful weekend getaway!!

Text: The hotel is definitely one of the nicer places that I have stayed. The room is very nice and the bed is comfortable. I'm here for a professional development course, and thus I am not paying for my room out of my own pocket. The lobby is clean and pleasant and the staff have been great.

Text: Nice room, staff, and facilities. Parking situation and noise from street traffic is unacceptable. Breakfast options were pretty weak given the room rate.

Text: Love, love, love! I stay in the studio king suite every time I come to Columbus. This is such a great hotel and does the Hilton brand justice. The location is fantastic- lots of restaurants and shopping within spitting distance! The people here are so wonderful and sweet. They go out of their way to help in any way they can.

The rooms are huge and comfortable for being in downtown! The shower is my favorite..it's massive!

Text: Very nice hotel.  The front desk was professional and attentive.  The time are updated and comfortable.  The only negative is that the pictures on their website indicate there is a hot tub next to the pool, but there isn't.  It has been taken out.  They need to update their pictures.  

The best thing about this hotel is the door man, Clifford.  We'd do back just to see him!
