Union Club Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: I attended a wedding at the Union/Hotel. it was a very nice venue. The food was amazing and the wait staff friendly and professional. I was in the hotel for a small period of time to change for the wedding and the room was large and spacious. No complaints. Only small complaint was the floor in the Ballroom. I took off my shoes to dance (heels were killing me) and the bottoms of my feet were black! It seemed a bit dirtier than I'd expect.

Text: Fine hotel, building was a little weirdly organized, but it was very convenient and easy if you're visiting Purdue. Rooms were a bit small but still nice. Unfortunately, the wifi wasn't working while we were there.

Text: I would say it's somewhat comparable to a motel 6, except that wouldn't be fair to the motel 6. Stayed here multiple times for one of Purdue's executive programs and I experienced the brown shower water on multiple occasions. Calls to the front desk were useless and the management is inept at handling any issue that will most certainly come up during your stay. Pro Tip: Brush your teeth with bottled water and follow any other guidance you would when traveling in a 3rd world country.

Text: The Union Club Hotel hosted our wedding block for my wedding at Purdue. They were very helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying here for any need including football weekends, visiting the school/a student, or any other need. Directly adjacent to the Purdue Memorial Union which houses many food choices, a bowling alley/pool hall, and two large ballrooms.
