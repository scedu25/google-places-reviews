Text: Great place to stay! Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable. Kitchen area with full size fridge. Breakfast has a lot of options and is always hot and flavorful. Large outdoor sitting area with fire pit and grill which we used to barbecue for large group this weekend. Jessica and the staff are awesome, always available for questions and suggestions for nearby restaurants/activities and really made our weekend stay wonderful. There is nothing bad to say about our stay, would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!!

Text: We just spent two days here on a shopping trip. We had dog along as well. They gave us a room on the bottom floor near an exit door. The 1 bedroom unit was spacious. Two TV's and many channels was useful. We didn't cook much but did use the kitchen somewhat. The staff at the front desk were super whenever queried. We would come back here in a heartbeat. Great stay.

Text: Location is close to everything but quiet. Room floorplan spacious. Bathroom sink separate from toilet. Outside grille and open fire. Full breakfast that attendants kept well stocked. Only negative was pets in room previously caused my child to have allergic reaction. If child has pet allergies I would call to ask if they have rooms that are pet free.
