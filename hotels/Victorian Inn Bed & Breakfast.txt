Victorian Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Five stars for the wonderfully hospitable people who run the business and their very nice daughter. This was our first experience at a bed and breakfast  but we took a shot, as we came to Rock Island to see our daughter who attends Augustana College... it was a great experience all around. Not something you'd get a local hotel. David and Barbara really took care of us and were such a pleasure to talk with. The other guests who we dined with at breakfast were also some really good people with some great conversations. I am sure we will be back!

Text: David and Barbara are the most charming hosts. Comfortable bed. Wonderful breakfast. Seems to have both parts of the B&B well covered. Conversation over breakfast was great and yes, there is a fireplace in virtually every room. Highly recommend and will be back.

Text: As soon as my wife and I met the owners and innkeepers, David and Barbara Parker, I knew we had made the right decision to celebrate Joy's birthday by staying a few days at their Victorian B&B in Rock Island, Illinois. The Inn offers 6 different rooms upstairs, each with it's own bathroom, and all accessible via the beautiful original carved hardwood grand staircase.  Our room was very warm and inviting, and it even had it's own working fireplace. (I later found out from David that the Inn has 7 fireplaces.)  
After waking the next morning we were both wondering how it was possible that the house and it's owners had made  us feel so immediately at home, and how relaxed we had become after just one night. When we went downstairs for breakfast, we were very impressed at how nicely the place settings were arranged with care on the huge table in the Dining room, with freshly cut fruit and flowers awaiting us. Barbara had asked us the night before about what we wanted for breakfast, and we both replied "French Toast!", not being sure if our request would be granted.  "No problem at all", she replied.  It should be noted here that we have stayed at many nice B&B's and hotels across the country, so it is no small thing for us to state that Barbara and David's breakfasts all 3 mornings were simply delicious.  Day 1 - French Toast, so amazingly light and airy. Day 2 - Eggs Benedict, we have never seen this favorite done better anywhere.  Day 3 - Fluffy Omelets with cheese and ham, and petite cinnamon rolls, again, just perfectly cooked and presented.   
Barbara and David were usually there to chat with us during our meals, and after doing so we must tell you that one would be hard pressed to find two more charming and knowledgeable people who make the right way to run a successful B&B look so effortless. David and Barbara have been operating their B&B for over 25 years, and every morning we were anxious to ask questions about the house, it's history, along with their family's history and relationship to the marvelous Inn. They were always more than willing to answer our questions about all of the photos and antiques, including Barbara's collection of doll houses scattered throughout the first floor.
The next time you make a journey to the Quad Cities, and need a place to stay during your visit, keep in mind the Victorian Inn B&B near downtown Rock Island just off the Centennial Bridge.  We almost forgot to mention that the house is located in a historic neighborhood and is on the National Register of Historic Places!  The food, the house, the hosts, and the neighborhood, all add up to a solid 5 star rating. Staying at a B&B does not get any better than this!

Text: We checked in pretty late without calling do to losing track of time. David (the host) was very accommodating, never said a word about it, and was delighted to still give us a tour of the beautiful home.  The rooms were extremely nice (I'm a sucker for fireplaces), and breakfast the next morning was divine. If I'm ever back in the area, there's no other place I would stay.
