Text: An absolutely wonderful experience.  My sister-in-law and I were just there for one night; however we were able to experience all the amenities.  Sat on the back deck, sipping wine and drinking-in the night sights (full moon), sounds (whippoorwill) and touch (gentle spring breeze).  If that wasn't relaxing enough, the queen bed was about as comfy as you can get.  The next morning we had breakfast with Carolyn and Wes in the dinning room.  Carolyn's artist talent is displayed everywhere and gives that easy conversation touch.  You feel right a home.  Breakfast was excellent.  Carolyn's signature Granola with yogurt and lemon curd was the perfect pallet pleaser.  Definitely a 5-Star B&B.  Thanks, Carolyn for a memorable experience in the rolling hills of Bracken County.

Text: If you want to get away to a wonderful, quaint and comfortable place, this is your place!.  Carolyn and Wes are incredible at making you feel right at home.  Great place to have a retreat, family vacation, girls get away, scrapbook crops or Mother's Day Brunch.  

Carolyn is such a gracious hostess and makes the best food ever.  She strives to buy local, using only the finest ingredients in her many recipes she will cook/bake.  This is my fourth time going there and just LOVE going here.  They offer so many wonderful opportunities to connect with family, friends or just nature.  I've met several new friends as she hosts pie bakes, scrapbook crops, soul print workshop or just a quiet relaxing time

Thanks Carolyn....Looking forward to many more visits!!

Text: This coming November will be my third time at The Country Lodge.  It is a wonderful place for a scrapbook weekend!!  The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful.  There is plenty of work space and entrance is on the ground level, so there are no steps for carrying in your supplies.  The food is absolutely delicious!  No cooking and no cleaning means there is plenty of time to get some scrapbooking done!  Invite a group of your friends and you will really enjoy yourself!!

Text: Just completed my third stay at The Country Lodge at Sabbath Song farm and could not have had a better weekend.  Spent the weekend scrapbooking with my girlfriends in the quaint, comfortable and homey atmosphere of the The Country Lodge.  Staying at the Country Lodge is like staying a weekend Grandma's farmhouse.....from the décor, comfy beds with handmade quilts, fresh home cooking, and the beauty of the Kentucky countryside.  I can't recommend a better place to relax, recharge, enjoy nature's beauty and have a wonderful time with family and friends.
Carolyn welcomes you "home" and treats you like both a guest and family!   You can't go wrong with a stay at The Country Lodge- to scrapbook, enjoy other creative pursuits, ride horses, read a book on the deck enjoying the views, taking one of Carolyn's cooking classes, or just relax!
