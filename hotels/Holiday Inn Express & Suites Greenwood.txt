Holiday Inn Express & Suites Greenwood
Rating: 2
Text: I've stayed at this location many times and have always been pleased, however they have replaced their beds with rock hard concrete mattresses.  They could have saved themselves some money by just taping off an area on the floor to sleep.  I'll be looking for a new place to stay.

Text: I have traveled  back and forth from  Chicago  to Indianapolis for the last year. Daughter going  to college in the area. I only stay at the  Holiday Inn within and around the city. This Greenwood location  is by far the best one I've stayedat yet. Clean, prompt service, updated, classy, elegant, nicely  decorated, easy to do busy, free breakfast and free 2 hour cocktail hour. Lovely helpful staff. Location is great with plenty restaurant options. I will be back and I hope they keep up the good work.
