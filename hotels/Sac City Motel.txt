Text: I've stayed at this Motel since the 1990's when it was refurbished. It's an original Motel from around the 1940's.  The single rooms are smaller with the original tiled floor and wall showers. Decorated nicely, clean, and comfortable. They have 3 newer rooms which have two beds and are more conventional. The TV stations are odd as some channels require hypens. I recently stayed here in January, 2017 for 3 nights and chose the 2 bed option for a change. I had broken my phone so desperately needed Wi-Fi for my laptop. It kept dropping the connection. So I had to check out. But I noticed they had the local city internet truck there for 3 days!!  It just recently has new owners who moved here from Utah to fulfill a dream of theirs. They are going to be doing some updates and would highly recommend.   Across the street is an awesome smaller cafe and a liquor store for ice. It's the best value around that area!
