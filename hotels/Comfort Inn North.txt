Comfort Inn North
Rating: 5
Text: We chose the Comfort Inn North because of its close proximity to I55 and its midway location between Grand Rapids, MI and St. Louis, MO. Our room was clean as was the pool area which was well kept and stocked with clean towels even on a busy Saturday night. We were welcomed back from dinner by Samantha with a kind upbeat greeting and genuine smile. When we called for a cot Samantha quickly delivered one and even included an additional blanket "just in case you guys need it". We decided to go down stairs to play a board game and Samantha stepped up again helping us find a great spot to set it up and play. Her upbeat personality and commitment to great customer service made our stay really great. Thanks Samantha!

Text: Great hotel. We felt safe and comfortable. The room was really large, seemed recently renovated and very clean. We stayed in the third floor. Very quiet and nice. WiFi was good. The breakfast was okay but not excellent. I would have like some more variety there.

Text: I almost would have had to give them a one-star but because they were able to accommodate my family staying there even after I already booked a room but then they were sold out, they managed to squeeze my family in. On top of that I ended up paying a little less. The room was clean, the connection to the wifi was great. We also enjoyed the hot tub and the pool. I was there with my husband my three-year-old and my one and a half month old. Water pressure in the shower was great. Hot breakfast was just enough for what we needed to get our day started. 

We live in the town right next door and just needed a little family night out. I wasn't sure I was staying in Joliet was going to be but the lady at the front desk was very polite and like I mentioned accommodating. I will be returning here for another family night out.

Text: Clean rooms and good breakfast. Not a IHOP breakfast but for free, it gets you out the door. Close to a lot of good restraints.
