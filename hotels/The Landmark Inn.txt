Text: Absolutely wonderful establishment! We had a great time during our stay. The room was fantastic and the rest of the building was fascinating to experience. We were made to feel very welcome and comfortable. The food was great as well! Looking forward to our next stay.

Text: This has got to be one of the most relaxing stays we've ever had.  Between the fascinating decor, great location, and delicious breakfast I can't think of a time when we felt more "disconnected" from the rat-race back home.  Gary is a fantastic host and proprietor.  You will not forget your stay any time soon!

Text: We have stayed at the Landmark Inn twice, first for our honeymoon and later on vacation. Both times it was excellent -- comfortable, clean, friendly, nicely decorated and preserved. The food was delicious: prime rib, salmon, double-nut coffee, and some of the best pan french toast I've ever had. We love the Landmark, and not just for overnight. It's also a joy for afternoon coffee or breakfast. Gary, my hat's off to you.
