Baymont Inn & Suites Mason

Text: Cheapest Whirlpool room you will find (at least off season).  Signs of wear, but very nice in room Whirlpool, plentitude of hot water, filled quickly.  Smallish breakfast, but includes make your own waffle.  I'm assuming responsive to reviews as there is now oatmeal packets and some fresh fruit available. Comfy bed with nice down comforter. Full cable channels including HBO and Showtime. Well worth the price(you have to expect a little wear at these rates), accommodated early check-in upon request.

Text: Not very clean. There's all kinds of stains on the walls. I'm not convinced that the mini fridge is cold enough to keep my leftover food safe enough to eat. The guy at the front desk couldn't be bothered to take his headphones out when we were checking in. Someone removed the light fixture in the ceiling and it's just a big hole now... Not really worth the 100$ we spent for the night I was expecting it to be cleaner than this. But the AC works, there's hot water and the bed seems clean enough so it will do for one night. I wouldn't stay any longer than that.

Text: During our overnight stay, the hotel had excellent service. The room's decor was a bit out dated but it was clean. Overall I would say I was pleased with our stay for the price.

Text: Old stains in sheets and towels.  Sink drained extremely slow.  Hotel smelled.  We put a do not disturb sign up because we didn't want anyone entering our room while we were gone.  Hotel staff STILL entered.  What's the purpose of the sign if they're going to ignore it? Will choose another hotel next time we go to Kings Island.
