Text: Stayed here for the third time on 9/28/2017. Very nice place. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast here was as good as it gets. Would happily stay here again. Oh, and I like that there are two good restaurants right across the parking lot.

Text: Everyone was very friendly and the room was clean. I stayed for 2 nights. I breakfast was very good. I am so used to just having one option for breakfast, but there were multiple. They also are dog friendly (with the pet fee).

Text: I have stayed here many times on trips on I70. It is comfortable, clean, moderately priced, well-furnished. Service is excellent, everyone is well trained and seems enthusiastic. There is a local work ethic that shows. A few problems now or then, but nothing major. A good value.

Text: Totally Awesome!!! Great room, pool and hot tub! Very friendly and accommodating staff! The breakfast was the best one we have ever had at any hotel, especially the coffee and orange juice!!! We would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a good night's sleep, enjoys swimming and relaxing in a hot tub, and enjoys an incredible breakfast and friendly staff! Definitely 5 stars!!! Close to all shopping and conveniences.

Text: When I checked into the hotel there was hair and foundation on the sheets/pillowcases of both the beds. There was a LOT of hair on the bathroom floor. The tub was very dirty. I immediately brought pictures down for the front desk staff to see the condition of my room. The woman gave no sympathy only said "laundry needs to comb the sheets". I had to get clean sheets to put on the beds myself. No compensation was offered. The new sheets I put on had NO hair from "laundry" as the front desk staff had suggested the problem was. Worst stay in a hotel EVER!!!!!
