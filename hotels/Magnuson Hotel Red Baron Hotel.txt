Text: room entry doors have light creeping in through the left side of them due to improper weather stripping being used. the first room we stayed in had no hot water and the bathroom door wasn't installed properly, so you had to lift it up to close it. when this was reported to the manager, he said that nothing was wrong with the room and he was refusing to compensate us for the night. one of the lamps had a flood light and a regular bulb installed in it. the  second room  the shade for the lamp was stripped and would not fasten correctly to the lamp. The lamp also had exposed wiring, not good when you have a toddler. in addition to the light creeping through the door, the weather stripping along the bottom of the door came off and had to be rethreaded through the track. finally the kids playground equipment has nails sticking up on the boards which are a huge safety and heath hazard to children playing on them. this will be my first and last time staying in this hotel. clearly the management doesnt understand customer service nor are the rooms in proper shape.

Text: Clean rooms, SUPER comfortable beds. Slept like a baby here. Toilets take forever to flush, but it's really no big deal.

Text: Horrible place. The online pictures did not match. The room had an awful odor. The toilet stunk like sewer. The water stunk as well. Bugs. I stayed for 6 nights and bought bedding the first day I was there. Would never ever stay here again! Staff was rude and the hotel surroundings we not any better. Go elsewhere you will thank me!

Text: For a stopover to rest and move on, this is acceptable.  Room was clean but very "tired" .  Plenty of very hot water!
