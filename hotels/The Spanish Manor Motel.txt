The Spanish Manor Motel
Rating: 1
Text: The room was very dirty. They gave us room 1, 
It's also the room next to the supply and wash machine to wash all their bedding and towels,etc. The door was open to our room. Very dirty. The worst was our bed. They never changed our bed from the last people. The sheets was crusty in some spots. Gross us out. We will never stay there again......

Text: We ended up here when our car broke down. It's odd to walk up to the manor to check in and the beds were comfortable like hard tack but it was clean and convenient. It was a good value. Well maintained and everything worked.
