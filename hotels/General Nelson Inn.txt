Text: My daughter had her wedding ceremony in the courtyard and her reception in the Carriage Room.  The staff is just wonderful and tried to take care of and help with our requests.  
The sound system was the only issue during the reception.  If you have access to your own, that would be a good idea.  Even with this, the staff was trying their best to help.  
The staff truly makes the difference.

Text: Rooms are nice for the price. Our bathroom was a little on the small side but not enough to complain about and the water pressure in the shower made up for the smallness. Staff are extremely nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants a nice hassle free accommodation. Even though we did not bring our dogs with us for this trip, this Inn allows pets in certain rooms.

Text: Room was clean, breakfast was OK and location was good - close to the centre of Bardstown. Pool was closed for Autumn/Winter, so be aware of that.
