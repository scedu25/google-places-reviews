Cambria hotel & suites Columbus - Polaris
Rating: 5
Text: Honestly, the best customer service i have received in Columbus and I have stayed at 6 competitors for work. Friendly staff, best chicken ciabatta sandwich (you definitely have to order it), clean rooms, and they pay attention to detail. Might not be right next to the main restaurants, but a 5 minute drive. Will use this location for business travel going forward. The only downside is the mirror in the bathroom is set up so when you shower you watch yourself shower. Otherwise this place is top notch.

Text: Fan in bathroom didn't work, and one of our phones was out. For the price I expected much better. The rooms were nice but that's my only compliment.
Breakfast (a very cheap meal) is not free in any capacity (no muffins or anything) and costs ten dollars. Ten dollars for a breakfast bar at a hotel is ridiculous.
Some staff are rude, some are okay. 
Go to another hotel.
