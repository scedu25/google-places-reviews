Holiday Inn Country Club Plaza

Text: I loved this hotel! It is not fancy, but it is very comfortable. What makes this hotel great are the people--every single person we interacted with was friendly, smiling, and obviously enjoyed what they were doing. The hotel staff was very accommodating to our group, helping us get our work done and stay comfortable. I would definitely stay here again if I get to return to KC!

Text: Nice comfortable hotel.  Very friendly staff. Choose it because we could walk to museums and hotel is pet friendly.  No issues.  Parking garage would be good in the winter.

Text: Flew in from Boston, Ma for a conference. While the rooms are quite outdated along with much of hotel, the ENTIRE staff more than made up for it. From the front desk who acknowledged me every time I walked by, to the cleaning staff who were friendly despite me walking on their freshly washed floors, to the restaurant staff.  Chloe, Vanessa, and my girl Jenna. These girls were amazing and became a bright part of my morning. They loved hearing about my husband walking to zoo, or to Independence lol. The food was great and honestly have never experienced such friendliness at a hotel which is ironic since its a hospitality business. Thank you to all Holiday Inn staff at the country club plaza

Text: Good place for the money when staying at the plaza. Room was pretty small, however I know there are several different layouts when it comes to the rooms. All-in-all it was a good stay.
