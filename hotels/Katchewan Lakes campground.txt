Text: I have been coming to this campground since I was a little kid. There are so many fond memories of this place. Im very happy to have someone purchase the land  that cares about family values. Looking forward to many years bringing my kids out here as my parents did for me.

Text: This campground is a very friendly place. Our kids love the beach and fishing caught some pretty big fish. Hot showers available day and night.

Text: The good the bad and the ugly.  Nice people who run the camp ground is probably the best thing that I can say. My lot was covered in garbage from previous campers. No fire pits, and I had to grab a delapidated picnic table from 4 sites over because my site didn't have one.  The bathroom was disgusting.  I mean Mexican prision style gross.   

There is a nice little pond but not stocked but moderately accesdible from the shore. There is a beach that was closed for the entire weekend. It was just as well because that didn't look clean either. 

There is a game room that they charge 10.00 per hour per person with a handful of 80s games in disrepair. 

There are junky campers surrounded by garbage.  It looks like people live there year round or at least for the season. 

Great location if you are going to canoe the Vermillion river. I wish that I could give a better report.

Text: Good campground for last minute planning.  Worth for the money. But the bathrooms were not very clean.
