Text: It was ok room could be a little bigger, I feel as though it was over priced. It was quiet not any racket or group of people just moving around. They offer breakfast that too could have been better for the price.

Text: A mediocre experience. The man and woman working the front desk were friendly and helpful. The condition of the room appeared to be clean, but it could use an update. The furniture was dated and so was the bed. The pillows were flat and only 3 on a king sized bed. The bathroom definitely needed an upgrade. Peeling linoleum around the edge of the tub, caulk peeling around the top of the shower, and I saw black ants in the bathroom. The shower head could use an update as well as it was exceptionally awkward. For the price, it was probably slightly overpriced. It fills a niche in a small community so they probably have the option to set the price they want.

Text: Clean room, no smoking but smoke coming into my room from other rooms. Waffle dispenser didn't work, weak coffee and to warm in motel. Even in lobby.  From 1 to 10. I'd give it a 5.

Text: People who own motel are rude, and obnoxious and greedy (older couple are nice, but other members of family are rude and hateful).  Rooms are not clean, maintenance is not done properly.  They overcharge, and if you don't have cash or credit card, they stub their noses at you.  Want to serve warm milk for breakfast, no microwave or frig in all of the rooms.  They want their money for nights on multiple stay reservation before checkout time and get very rude if they don't get it immediately.  I would not recommend this motel to anyone.  It is overpriced and if you need to check in ahead of normal check in they will charge you for it no matter what the reason is.  Don't like to give your private information back to you when you are ready to leave.
