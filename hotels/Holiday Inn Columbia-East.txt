Holiday Inn Columbia-East
Rating: 5
Text: Nice rooms and friendly staff. I would give five stars, but there is absolutely nothing around the hotel, other than a gas station and Jimmy John's. For the stay, no complaints. Single King/Queen room was spacious and beds were comfortable.
Rating: 3
Text: Clean rooms and decent services.  There is not a free breakfast here, but there is a restaurant on site.  
Service was good and employees were friendly. Although the hotel is only 5 years old, there was some peeling paint and wallpaper in the room, giving it a shabby appearance.
Overall, I would stay there again.

Text: Very nice Holiday Inn, fully updated interior and exterior. Breakfast was available in the hotel restaurant for around $6 each day and the typical room service as well. The big settling point for me was its proximity to Stephens Lake Park for the Roots and Blues and BBQ festival. About for miles, a quick affordable Uber away made commuting to and from the festival a breeze.

Text: Very typical newer Holiday Inn. Staff was friendly and helpful, offered to take us downtown in the hotel shuttle. There isn't much nearby except a sandwich shop, a liquor store, and a gas station. Comfortable rooms, I slept well.
