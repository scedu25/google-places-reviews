Text: A group of family members stayed here for a funeral, and while the staff was helpful providing a room for getting together, the rooms are not clean - stained carpet and bed spreads. Light bulbs burned out, bathroom sink drains that won't open or close, guests have to pry the drains open. Signs are posted in the rooms informing guests the cost of everything in case they want to steal anything!!!! As if anything in this place is worth taking!! At check-in we informed them of a pet and requested a king room for more floor space. They happily gave us one by the back door so the pet could go in and out easily. Ww were informed of a $250 fine if the animal was brought into the lobby!!! At checkout we were charged $20 PER DAY for said pet, and told we were never supposed to be in that room, but the manager had reluctantly allowed it - WRONG. Sure hope the Holiday Inn Express opens soon!

Text: The room was nice, and the location is easy to find. The only negatives I had were the basic breakfast options and the thin walls.
