Quality Suites Kansas City International Airport

Text: We are in the area for a few days each fall and have stayed here a few times. They must be under newer ownership that seems to be heading in a positive direction. They have new renovations (paint, carpet, etc). They have a pretty standard free breakfast and free wifi. On one visit the shuttle driver pulled a hit-and-run on my wife's car. Luckily I spotted the matching damage and called them on it and they covered the repairs. That is more of a ding on the employee's ethic though and kudos to management for doing the right thing. On this last visit our "non-smoking" room had clearly been smoked in, a lot. Upon request we were moved to a room that was much better and the manager on duty was very friendly about it. There are other hotels in the area that are a bit nicer, but for the cost this is a pretty decent bang for your buck option.

Text: Good hotel, served it's purpose. It s recently renovated and was clean. Looks like the were still doing renovations on the other side. I was impressed with this hotel for the price. Room was large, and the Whirlpool was nice. Breakfast had a small selection however was enough for what I needed. The staff was very friendly. The only cons I had was the toilet was so close to the wall that I couldn't hold the toilet seat up. There was also a bug in the bathroom. No big deal. I would stay here again. There also offer airport parking for a reasonable fee, It was $5 per day with cash min. $25 and $7 with credit card.

Text: I found the place to be superb. That front desk guy made me feel at home in ways one could only dream of.  Hats off to quality suites and their outstandingly outlandish hospitality that made me think I was no longer on earth. I felt as if I were close to heaven. I felt truly at home.

Text: The rooms have been renovated and are really spacious rooms. Located in an industrial area which is very quiet. The hotel staff are very warm and welcoming. And we have Grandma Judy cooking up the continental breakfast.
