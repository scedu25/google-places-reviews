Text: We've only just got here and i already feel the need to write a review. We've stopped here as we are travelling route 66 for our honeymoon and i must say this place is like  staying at your grandmas house. Beds comfy rooms very clean ans spacious. I would actually have no issues with living in the room i have. Its also pretty quite and the owner is super nice actually just like your grandma. Highly recommended. If you can here then do it

Text: My wife and I were 2/3 of the way across the country on our move from California to Ohio. The bearings on one of our trailer wheels failed and the wheel fell of on I44 2.8 miles from the Sleeper exit. We had just passed Lebanon. We were very fortunate to have broken down in this area. We crawled to the Sleeper United Methodist Church to park the broken trailer there. Pastor Martha was there, thank goodness, and gave us permission to leave it there as long as we need to get it fixed. She recommended the Munger Moss Motel. We are glad she did! This place is 70 years old and has lots of character. The owners are very nice people. I didn't have very much interaction with Bob, but I did with Ramona. Let me tell you she is a doll. It took longer to fix our trailer than expected. So we ended up staying with them for 7 nights. Ramona was gracious enough to give us a discount on 2 nights and said the last night was on her. This isn't something one of the big corporate places would do! This is all the more reason to stay here and not the other chains in town. It is super close to the interstate also. The rooms are dated (in a good way), but clean. A welcome change from the blandness found at other places. I felt like I was staying at my Grandmother's place.

Text: Having spent the night many times at this icon of Route 66 royalty I can attest that the Munger Moss Motel is a uniquely friendly and comfortable motel.

Text: This is a classic Route 66 motel. Just like motels were in the fifties. That is the advantage and disadvantage of staying here. The room is basic no coffee, microwave or fridge but they do have WiFi. The shower was surprisingly good. Bed was comfortable enough, pillows not so good. Everything seemed clean. No breakfast just coffee available in the reception. If you can enjoy it for what it is, give it a try and keep institutions like this going. Otherwise you will soon be visiting a place like this in a heritage park .

Text: I had a spectacular experience at one night at the Munger Moss on 5/19/17. I arrived close to 1 a.m., and the owner/manager Ramona was friendly and accommodating given my late arrival (not that I am suggesting you arrive as late as I did). I had a pleasant rest, and spent part of the morning photographing all around the property and having a nice conversation Ramona and Bob. I love the fact they've kept the furnishings authentic and the rooms immaculate. Thank you for making my Route 66 road trip memorable!
