Pumpernickel Inn

Text: This is was our third visit to the Inn. We always feel like we are right at home here. Close to the beach, far enough away from reality...I love visiting here. If you get away, even overnight, you feel like you have been away... it's a great break. Breakfast is amazing- coffee is delightful and while I didn't try the gelato, i can tell you my family thinks it's the best :) We'll be back next year, if not sooner!

Text: We were very pleased with accommodation and service. Didn't realize that our breakfast was included; anything on the menu! Lovely, leisurely service and excellent food. Friendly host.

Text: The place is ok. Thought it could be better for breakfast. The service was prompt. Food was very greasy,  especially the pancakes and potatoes, more than they should. Never had greasy pancakes like these.  Half the potatoes were burnt. However,  the bright side is that it is a cozy atmosphere.
