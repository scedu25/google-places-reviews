Text: I went on my xc trx250ex , it was fun but most of the trails are rutted and rocky from jeeps and erosion. , if the trails were better maintanied it would be a great place to ride , also drinking is allowed in the park and to me that is not acceptable at all drinking and riding is not a good mix in any way.
