Text: Amazingly attentive front desk staff, and clean, spacious room. No towel service my first day here, but possibly something you have to request. Not clearly spelled out. Otherwise, great time.

Text: I'm picky; If I can't find something to complain about no one can. I have no complaints about this hotel. Our stay was perfect. The room was spotless and the staff was exceptional. They were very accommodating of a last minute request and made us feel very welcome. The beds were cozy and the room had no odors. Our room was quiet as well. A+

Text: Would recommend. Very nice. My husband and I were in town for a wedding and couldn't get the same hotel as the other groomsmen so we had to get one at the candlewood. Very quite and relaxing. The rooms were small but it wasn't too small. Had a little kitchen area with a dishwasher, microwave, and a full size fridge. The bathroom was very nice and the bed was comfortable. I would recommend this anyone needing to stay in the area. The whole hotel smelled very nice and up to date on decor. The staff was also very courteous.

Text: There is only one word to describe this hotel, that is home. The staff is always friendly and welcoming to us. Mindy is extremely service orientated and always willing to go the extra mile for her customers. We enjoyed our visit so much we will definitely be coming back. Great job everyone.

Text: This stay was exactly what I expected. A comfortable room, little kitchenette, and a great bed. And so cheap! If you need a comfortable place to sleep and save a bit on eating out by some light cooking, this is the place.
