Rivers Inn

Text: To be honest, we just needed a place to sleep, because we had been camping and it was going to rain. We were looking for beds and a/c. That is what we got. The man at the desk was awesome though, he gave us a bit of a bigger room because we had kids. I didn't see any bugs... But the shower was not cleaned properly and the carpets/furniture could use a good cleaning. It suited our purpose, but it was not on my list of places that I can't wait to stay again...

Text: In the process of remodeling but for a cheap place to stay it's pretty nice. Only thing I would change is the fact it only has showers and no bathtubs. Very nice service and quick to solve any needs you may have while your staying at Rivers Inn

Text: Best local hotel I have stayed so far. When I stayed, room was really clean. They have microwave, refrigerator, and tv includes. Rooms smell like fragrance. Beds are really comfortable. I slept like a baby. If i come back, I would definitely stay here. I would tell all my friends and family to stay here. Have continental breakfast. It is a quieter and safe place to stay. I would recommend other to stay here. Price is reasonable.

Text: The hotel was adequate, and the staff was friendly. Most importantly, they allowed us to bring our dogs, and we're very reasonable about the fee. That said, the room wasn't very clean, the locks on the door were broken or missing, and the exterior and grounds looked run down and unmaintained. This motel COULD be a lot better with a little bit of work.

Text: Very nice check in, polite, eager to please. Not the ritz by any means but it's cold in the summer, warm in the winter, and the bed was comfortable.
