Text: This place is wonderful!  A great weekend getaway overlooking beautiful scenic central Nebraska. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Take the full 3,000 acre tour to see bison and horned sheep, definitely worth the time. Mitch, Roxanne and Emily are gracious hosts!

Text: The Lodge was spacious, comfortable and welcoming. The owners were very friendly and helpful, making the stay excellent. While I wasn't there for hunting, bison and elk hunting are available, and Comstock offers some excellent hunting opportunities. Very worth checking out. ?
