Text: Only giving 3 stars. Have alot of drink selections plus clean bathrooms, but after 3+ years of going to this gas station/convenient store is that when new owners took over, prices went up on pretty much everything they sell and alot of original employees left plus
 there seems to be a big turnover in employees, faces always changing. Only have 1 original face I recognize and she's always friendly and helpful.

Text: Food was just OK. Had a steak and ordered it medium rare. It came virtually raw. I asked for it to be cooked a little longer and it came back well done and tough. A breakfast buffet had almost nothing made fresh, like muffins or cinnamon rolls. It was all commercially prepared food and poor quality. Poor service, poor food.
