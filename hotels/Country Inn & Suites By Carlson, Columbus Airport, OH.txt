Text: I really liked this hotel a lot! It's very conveniently located by the airport and they have a shuttle. There's a lot of restaurant's within waking distance. Its very updated and kept up with. Clean and comfy and best of all pretty quiet! Their complementary breakfast is one of the best I've had (compared to other hotels) the staff is very friendly and hospitable. Will return here in the future!

Text: “Get the suite room for Fridge & Microwave - remodeled fitness center”

Hello Again. 12 Nights at this location. Started out in a normal room then 2 days later went to request a fridge and microwave. Staff moved me to a suite with no additional charge. Up front this is the first Country In suites I ever stayed in and it was a comfortable stay. The hotel highlights to me were the indoor pool, jacuzzi and the NEWLY remodeled fitness center which so far this year has been the best one. My only real complaint was the "fresh smell of bacon" that woke me up every morning (0600) once I moved to the suite (room 216). Whether or not it is just that room I don't know. I get up at that time anyway so it wasn't a huge inconvenience. But by the 13 morning... it was starting to make me sick.

Thanks for reading

Text: This is one of the worst Country Inn & Suites. Old, out dated and dirty. I would rather stay at the Best Western.

Text: Did not actually stay at this hotel but took the shuttle to here based on a misunderstanding ('country inn and suites airport' vs 'country inn and suites airport EAST'). They were however very friendly and the shuttle driver even gave us a ride to the other hotel! Almost wish we could have traded reservations...
