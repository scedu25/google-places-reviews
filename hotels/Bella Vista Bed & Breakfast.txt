Bella Vista Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had a wonderful time. This was our first experience with a b&b and we have decided it is the only way to go. Daisy, the owner, is a wonderful cook and hostess. She is also an amazing person and very interesting. If you are going to Iowa City this is definitely the place to stay. It is close to campus and to the interstate.

Text: My daughter and I stayed at Bella Vista while touring the University of Iowa. This is a beautiful old house with many room options available. Daissy is a warm and accommodating host. She made us feel right at home and cooked delicious vegetarian breakfast for us. If our daughter chooses UI we will definitely stay with Daissy whenever we visit!

Text: A Bella Vista housed us wonderfully for two nights. Daissy is both personable and warm, and it was a real joy to hear and see pictures of all her travels. The house itself is located a short drive from downtown Iowa City, but is far enough away to remain very peaceful and quiet. Our room was comfortable, roomy, and clean, and we look forward to staying with her once more, whenever we visit Iowa City.

Text: My 6-years old son and I have stayed at A Bella Vista Bead and Breakfast on several occasions. The location is wonderful, just a few blocks from downtown Iowa City, and a couple of blocks from the city park—in case you are up for a run or a walk. The rooms are comfortable, quiet, and sunny. Daissy is a great hostess. We enjoyed our conversations over breakfast. The food was delicious and well-presented. She is very accommodating, attentive, and as usual made us feel quite welcome. I truly recommend A Bella Vista Bead and Breakfast. Perfect location, great stay and great hostess. Thank you from William and Lucas from El Paso, TX.
