Rating: 4
Text: Our first time at Sugar Mill was this week. We were there for the fireworks. 
1) the campgrounds: I was amazed at how clean the grounds were. The area was filled with people and there was not a scrap of trash anywhere, unbelievable. 
2) the Fireworks: I have never seen such a display before. They seemed to go on forever. The displays were like the finales at most places and the finale at Sugar Mill was spectacular.

Text: I've been there for 17 years.   Best place to camp ever.  Extremely clean, prices for long term and over night camping very low compared to the amenities.  I have made a second family there and miss them in the winter months and come April 15 opening time it's like a big family reunion.  My father is blind in one eye and has had 9 strokes can't get around on his own golf cart anymore to visit so people now come to him.  The owners Jay and Ginger you could not ask for a nicer couple of people to operate the business.  It's mowed weekly and no weeds along the lake are to be found.  You want a camp grounds where your children can grow up play ride bikes and enjoy the summers swimming,  playing with the other children, and enjoying smores...here's your sign.
