Text: Loved my time here. Stayed ten nights. House keeping were wonderful. Rooms could do with a new colour on the walls but overall it was comfy and enjoyable.

Text: Welcoming staff. Rooms include a good sized fridge. Basic breakfast; waffles, toast, fruit, oatmeal, and cereal. Shower water wasn't super consistent but if that's why your staying in a hotel you might want to reconsider your properties. We stayed in a smoking room as the rest of the hotel was booked. The smell was slightly noticeable, but only to someone never around smokers. I hope the old guys playing cards in the lobby are always there.

Text: Most of the staff was great especially Lisa the evening shift desk. Leek on Saturday. The owner was super nice. It was a little pricey but we needed a place to stay. There was no elevator and I had to walk up stairs being disabled but I made it slow and steady

Text: My business there was work related. I am a courier and delivered two 4 to 5 long tall boxes for a guest. That guest had already checked out. My experience was solely involved with the front desk associate. She was genuine and thoughtful of the situation. Her service is what I expect from any and all hotel employee. Accommodating , hospitable , heplful , and strived to ensure each experience is satisfying.
