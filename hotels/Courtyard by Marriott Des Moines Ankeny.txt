Courtyard by Marriott Des Moines Ankeny
Rating: 5
Text: After a long flight yesterday, the staff was exceptionally warm and took off that chill from outside. The young lady at the front desk was great in every aspect, and the two young ladies in The Bistro were also great. This location is very clean, and very warming for children. There is so much more to say, I'm going to personally write a letter the the Marriott Company in reference to their warming staff.

Text: Over rated.  Very noisy bathroom fan, old TV, expensive breakfast.  Decided not to eat there.  First and last time to stay at a Courtyard.

Text: We was there for a wedding reception. There was plenty of room between tables and for the number of guests. The food was delicious although the wait staff never smiled, they were throughly focused on doing their job in a timely and orderly manner.
