Text: Stayed here recently... Kristie at the front desk was more than accomodating! Very friendly and helpful when I made my reservations and upon checking in. Left a pair of my favorite boots in the room when we left... she was the best in helping me get them back! The bed we had was super comfortable. Would stay here again!

Text: Had to stay in a smoking room the 1st night-and it was bad. The room had not been cleaned well (if at all). Moved to a non-smoking room the 2nd night. It was a totally different experience. Clean environment, well-kept. But the staff were courteous and helpful. I should have complained the 1st night. I think they would have made it right. But it was the night before the total eclipse and I think they were overwhelmed with a packed motel. They even had free viewing glasses for their customers. I would stay there again.

Text: It's not the worst place I have ever stayed.... That's why it's 2 stars. .... Pros;  it was $80, the hotel staff did NOT try to sell us a prostitute, meth or heroin.
Cons; the sheets had clearly not been changed in a long while, the shower was filthier than a crazy cat lady's floor, the gentleman working the front desk has very recently started to learn English (good for him, but he may want to invest in a new tutor), their are many other small things wrong, but I feel like these are the big ones.
....
When every other hotel is booked up at this exit, there is a reason this hotel is not, I suggest you do what we wish we had and go to the next exit.

Text: Nothing to say about my stay. Other than no frills, exactly what I needed for my long roadtrip!
