New Buffalo Inn & Spa
Rating: 5
Text: Great location, decent price compared to other lodging in the area.  The suite was clean and comfortable.  We stayed in the Whitaker Room with the captains nook.  It was very spacious.  Coffee work creamer was provided and very much appreciated.  We didn't get to experience the fire at night and hot tub but would definitely come back to try them out.  Beach was four blocks away about a 15 minute walk.

Text: Our experience at New Buffalo Inn & Spa was wonderful! We were in Michigan for an adoption and weren't sure where we'd end up or when we'd be able to leave so we arrived at the Inn without a reservation not knowing if any rooms would be available. We felt super blessed that the Captain Whittaker room was available and we were set up quickly and with great care. This space was perfect for our little family with a new infant and made our stay away from home quite comfortable. It was nice to have a kitchen to cook in and a place to do laundry right in our room. The owner was incredibly kind, accommodating and helpful, and she even brought a celebratory balloon to our room to congratulate us. If we are ever near New Buffalo again - we will certainly be staying at the New Buffalo Inn & Spa!

Text: Rest relax retreat. I did all three here and it was just so easy. The room was so beautiful and quaint. I love that I didn't have to bring any dishes to cook just bring food and ready to go. The atmosphere here is just so relaxed you can bet that we will be coming back in the future and recommending it to everyone who just needs to relax and have a good time.
