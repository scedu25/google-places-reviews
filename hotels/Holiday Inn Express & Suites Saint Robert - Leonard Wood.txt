Holiday Inn Express & Suites Saint Robert - Leonard Wood
Rating: 5
Text: So comfortable and made our 2 day trip to TX so much easier! 
They accommodated our large family by giving us two adjoining rooms. The pool was a great place for the kids to get out their energy before crashing for the night. We slept very well on their comfortable beds too.

Text: I had been driving all night and had not sleep in almost 24hrs. I called and spoke to Ash. She was delightful and helped find a room. I don't have much luck picking hotels. But when I got to my room it was clean, and the beds were so soft. Chena, was the name of the person who had cleaned my room. I'm very picky and very particular. I could not find anything wrong. It was wonderful. The other front desk personnel Sierra and Bernadette. They were so helpful with information that i needed. My daughter is on base at Fort Leonardwood. I plan on coming back and i recommend anyone to stay here. It was great. The breakfast was good. But the the front desk was excellent and made my stay the Best. Thank you ladies

Text: The checkin process was a snap. The front desk person knew exactly what he was doing and made me feel like a high roller. The lobby, facilities and room were very clean and visually pleasing. The breakfast bar was very good and had healthy (and not-so-healthy) options. The only thing slightly not great about the room was that it had a funny smell (which often happens at hotels). I diffused essential oils, which worked like a charm. I highly recommend this property.
