Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Cedar Rapids
Rating: 1
Text: The hotel manager was extremely rude.  I booked online requesting a double bed but ended up getting a single king bed in the room.  I called the manager asking for assistance and she said it wasn't her problem. She offered no help or even to look to see if other rooms were available. Based on her actions, I will not be staying at a Fairfield again.  Highly disappointed. I have always had good experiences at Marriott owned properties. It is too bad that one bad experience can taint a hotel chain.

Text: This hotel was a standard Fairfield. The room was clean and up to date. I loved that there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. The breakfast had good selection but was not very good quality. All in all a satisfactory stay.

Text: Very nice rooms and you can get the chance to see the how the other side lives in the traveling and the best of the best.  And not a problem with the two of us to be in the sleeping double in a single bed / room. Most important thing to me that I am so excited to get a new place to stay in while I'm away from home and for me to come back from a nice little break from the outside world.  Thank you for the hospitality and the best of all the best.

Text: The rooms and hotel are very nice, they even come with a free buffet breakfast. The pool, although slightly small, and the hot tub were fantastic. The only downside we had was there wasn't a vent in the bathroom to let the steam out, so it sat there. And that the ice Machine on our floor was broken.

Text: Great, very clean room. I was concerned that I was going to be kept up by the elevator because my room was right next to it but it was all soundproofed very well and not a problem at all. The front desk staff was very helpful in booking a room last minute after another local hotel did not allow me to check in. The shower was great, it was huge and very nice.  My one problem was that the pool and hot tub area was filled with young kids from some sports event and it was extremely loud and impossible to enjoy the hot tub. Regardless, I would definitely stay here the next time I need to travel to Cedar Rapids.
