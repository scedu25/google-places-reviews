Text: It's honestly a nicely maintained campground, but at twice the price of a Kansas state park.....I see little to get excited about.
The restroom/shower house here is not nearly as nice as most of the state parks either.
I asked questions of several employees, front office, pay booth, park Ranger, etc.
None gave even similar answers, none seemed to know more than assumptive info.
Not one could give a number on how much it cost, yet all agreed it was more than the posted sign stated ?!?
All agreed on one thing, set up your site, come back to the pay booth and we'll let you know then.
WTF.
Won't be back, wouldn't be prudent.
