Text: We enjoyed our stay at Summers, and are planning to return again this year.  It is a quiet, scenic country campground filled with many friendly campers.  The pull-through site had plenty of room for our motorhome and trailer.  It was a short Jeep drive to the Badlands.  There is a play area for the kids, and plenty of room for bicycle rides.  The biggest negative is the dusty county dirt-road that you have to drive on to get to the campground entrance.  Your RV will need a wash for sure.....but the setting is secluded and peaceful.

Text: Nice secluded feel just 5-10 minutes from town. There are "rustic" showers but the water is hot ! Kids love the play area and pool. 

Been here many times when we go the Badlands Offroad Park and will continue to stay here unless something drastically changes.
