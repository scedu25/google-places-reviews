Text: Room reaked of cigarettes, pillows thin as paper, carpet needs replaced, no radio alarm clock, cleaning was less than standards. Bathroom showed signs that whoever was the maintenance man, they needed to take his tools away. You don't use tapcons for the trans strip between the carpet and tiles, they are meant to be used in areas hidden from view. Entry door needed to be replaced not patched, couldn't lock the handle latch properly, it looked like someone blew it out. All and all the place looks like it needs a complete overhaul or demolished. But, I guess you get what you pay for. Never again for me!

Text: Decent price stayed for a week for work but very dirty blankets had cigarette holes and room had bugs. Stay down the road worth the extra money.

Text: The lock to our door didn't work. If we wanted to close the door to leave we had to ask the manager to open it when we got back. The entire place had a funky smell and overall it wasn't the most well kept place.
