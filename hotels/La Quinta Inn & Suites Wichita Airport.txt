La Quinta Inn & Suites Wichita Airport
Rating: 3
Text: The room has comfortable furniture, but the structure itself is very basic and dated. It appears to be renovated from an older motel. Aside from that, the stay was comfortable and the staff were welcoming. I would stay here again if needed, but there are others nearby that are a bit better.

Text: Kind of shady. Outside looks run down. Room never got cold even though I had it set on 62. Room was ok. If I had paid $20 less I’d give it a better rating.

Text: Room was decent and like that it is pet friendly.  However - very disappointed that they booked my room to me and someone else.  Scary experience when someone else has a key card and trying to get into room while you are asleep.  Glad there was an inside lock.  They could have accessed our room with our baggage there.  Very disapppinted because I was told verbally there was a 24 hour shuttle to airport and when I arrived that was not the case.

Text: The breakfast was out a little bit late and didn't have the greatest of tastes but the room its self was great, cheap, and had nice ease of access

Text: I enjoyed my short stay. The rooms were clean and big. The pool and hot tub were very nice. I would definitely stay here again.
