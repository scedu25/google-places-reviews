Best Western Plus Pratt
Rating: 5
Text: A comfortable and enjoyable place to stay while driving across the mid-west. It was right off the highway, easy to find, and parking was good. The room, closet, and bathroom were larger than many chain hotels. The bed was very comfortable. Staff was courteous and helpful. I will stay again at this hotel.

Text: Recently arranged rooms for family reunion at Best Western Plus in Pratt, KS.  Outstanding help from manager Shelly, asst. Tessa, front desk Garrett, Marilyn, and maintenance Darrell.  Everyone on Shelly's staff took initiative with suggestions and help to make our groups' stay wonderful.  Everyone in our group had excellent comments about this top-notch motel.  Huge thanks to all at this location.

Text: Super nice and I appreciate the kindness the lady whom I spoke with on the phone after we left. Our daughter left her blanket and she was very upset. When I called a few hours after we were gone I wasn't hopeful that they had kept it but they did and even said they would ship it back to us in California. They sent it the fastest way because it was home before we got home! We all appreciate that very much!

Text: Great hotel! Spacious, clean rooms and a decent price. We let the lady at the front desk know we were leaving early and she was nice enough to get many of the breakfast items out early so we could eat before we left. Much appreciated! If we're ever out this way again we'll definitely be back!
