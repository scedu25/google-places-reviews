Paddle Wheel Inn

Text: Absolutely Love The View Of The River From The Paddle Wheel Inn! Our Room Was Very Clean And Comfy! Included A Microwave, Small Refrigerator, and Recliner Along With The Desk, Entertainment Center, Small Table with 2 Chairs and The Bed! Only Downfall Would be The View Is On The Parking Lot Side and Shower Is Small But That Is Explained In the Pricing! Very Friendly and Knowledgable Staff!! Perfect Getaway!

Text: Nice hotel very clean. Shower was nice but the shower head looked like something from the 70s. Talked with them in the morning and they were more than happy to get that info. Very kind guy. Beds weren't the best in comfort and the one pillow I had was feeling way over used and clumpy. Beautiful view of the Rock. Lighting was a little under what I would have liked at night but I like my light. I would recommend.

Text: The paddle wheel inn is a cozy place to stay with an ample view of the Rock River. It's a great place to stay that's quite and away from the near by cities.
