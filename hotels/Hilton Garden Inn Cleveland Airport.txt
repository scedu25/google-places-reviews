Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Airport
Rating: 1
Text: Wasn't worth the price. The lady who took my reservation failed to tell me that I don't get free breakfast even tho I paid them $115 (with tax) for ONE NIGHT. AND she didn't tell me about the charge that they put on your card for damages just in case there are any damages rather than charge me for the damages after I have checked out. I've been to many hotels and I have NEVER heard of this before. Such bull. They only thing I enjoyed was talking to Marvin and Brandon when I checked in. They were awesome! Other than that, I wouldn't recommend Hilton Garden Inn to anyone I know.

Text: Quiet despite proximity to airport.  Not a lot of dining nearby but many places a few miles away.  Very convenient to downtown.  Nice folks.

Text: The hotel staff were very polite and professional. They were able to find me a room, despite arriving at the hotel without a reservation.

Text: Very nice hotel but why are you still charging for Internet? I was unable to sign into the free slow WiFi with the provided info. I would have rated it a 5 b/c the hotel and other amenities were really nice.

Text: Decent hotel. Was charged incorrectly for room service I didn't order, but was quickly removed. Not the easiest place to navigate to.
