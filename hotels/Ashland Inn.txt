Text: Avoid this hotel at all cost. We have an employee staying at this location. Never worked with a hotel quite like this one. Plus he tells us it is a total dump. I would give them less than a star if I could.

Text: There pictures don't look like the rooms. We booked a non smoking and it smelled like smoke. The carpet in our room was pieced together. There were holes in the wall that they tried to fix with plaster and then never painted over. The sheets had stains all over them.

Text: Loves to listen in on conversations.  Does it to where they won't let people that call in on a regular basis connect to the room they want to call.  When someone mentions money, they "need" money for said room when they listen in on conversations.  Especially when its a person they know is on a monthly income and the person that calls in makes even less than the person on a fixed income.  I will never stay at that hotel, would rather sleep on the street than stay there for they way treat people.

Text: The staff was courteous and kind, however there were some problems. The room wasn't very clean. Long-term guests were outside our xoor until 3 AM.
