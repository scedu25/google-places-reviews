Text: Very  happy  with  our stay. Reserved two rooms for 1 night . Both were clean and well taken care of, they were equipped  with a  small refrigerator  and  microwave.  Customer service was excellent.  Will stay there again when I  go out to visit family. Perfect and not expensive.

Text: This is a great place to stay. It is very clean and has pretty much what you need such as amenities, micro/fridge, Fox News, flat screen tv, nice shower and workspace. They could improve by adding an ice machine outside, you have to get ice from the lobby and they hand you a small bag of homemade  ice cubes. As far as I know it's the only motel  in town but it is a clean motel.
