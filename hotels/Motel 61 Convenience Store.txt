Text: We pulled into the Motel 61 RV in late afternoon on June 22, 2014.  Nice convenience store and very helpful friendly people.  The gentleman even offered to back our travel trailer into the camp site.  Not necessary as former truck drivers do know how to back a trailer.  The site was very nice,  grassy, flat and full hook ups.  We will stay there again when traveling KS.
