Text: Awesome hotel. Clean, comfortable and private. Beds are amazing!! Away in a quieter area but within walking distance to several great restaurants. Pool and hot tub amazing, great place to stay with kids. Overall an awesome hotel. We stay every year! Couple blips but nothing major, will return again next year.

Text: We had our wedding reception at the Wildwood Hotel in Oct 2017 and couldn't have dreamed of anything better! Shannon was seriously the best! She went way above and beyond to make sure we were happy! She also did anything in her power to make our dreams a reality! Chef Brian was also super awesome! He did a special menu for us (pizza and wings!) and our guests absolutely loved it! Also their staff was extremely nice! They all congratulated us throughout the night and didn't mind that our guests didn't leave right away when the reception ended :)  
Our guests also said they loved their rooms and the beds were super comfy! And we concur! We recommend this venue for your reception or for your guests to stay!!! Thank you again everyone at the Wildwood Hotel for the best night!!!

Text: Very nice, clean and comfortable boutique hotel. The continental breakfast is so much more than continental. They offer cooked to order eggs and omelets along with buffet-style scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, potatoes and bacon. Also offered are self-serve waffles, cereals, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea, and even almond milk. Great service, comfrtable and quiet. The rooms are nice and the top floor rooms have vaulted ceilings and a small balcony.

Text: Got married here the other day, and the staff was wonderful! They made the event amazing. The room was great to stay in afterwards, the room was clean and everything was extremely comfortable. Would get married here again, though I shouldn't need to :P

Text: Beautiful hotel. Clean, modern, elegant, quiet. Very comfortable room. A stones throw from grocery stores, many good restaurants, pharmacy, even a movie theater. Very professional and friendly staff. Fantastic breakfast. For the money (which was alarmingly cheap), you'd be hard pressed to find a better place to stay in the area. Not to mention it's across the street from a police station... I travel for business for a living and if I am back in St. Louis I know where I will be staying.
