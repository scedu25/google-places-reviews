Text: It's a great place to stay. Staff is awesome! The first night we stayed they had a dinner that was nice coming off the road. The pool and amenities was great. The pond in back made the stay more relaxing. Great job!

Text: Overall nice place.  Good breakfast.  Good room layout.  Plenty of space in the king suite to set up kids beds.  Minus 1 star because the garbage can under the sink was overflowing with the last person's trash and the fridge had their half used items on it too.  There were a couple other things like that too, nothing major, but need to do better.

Text: The first room I was given had unclean linens and not properly cleaned and prepared. I requested another and was given good service in a promptly manner. The next room was better. I was pleased with the price for what it was worth.

Text: From Monday to Wednesday they have a Social Hour with free wine and beer plus some food from 5:30 to 7:30 my room came with a fully stocked kitchen obviously not food. The bed was very nice and very comfortable. Had a couch and a TV and a DVD player. The bathroom was wonderful the shower was amazing the bathroom sink and vanity was nice as well. Very good experience would definitely stay here again. The free breakfast in the morning had a wide variety of choices and we're very delicious. The hot tub was also very relaxing. Did not use the fitness center but that is available along with of a swimming pool and laundry
