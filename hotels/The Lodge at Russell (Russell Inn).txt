Text: I'm a stickler about staying in a clean room in a safe hotel. I always check the room that we will be staying in before I pay. This was a wonderful place to stay. We travel this way several times a year and will definitely be staying here every time in the future. I didn't know there was such a thing as a triple room (3 full-size beds), which was wonderful. The front staff was friendly and efficient. They even let me put several of my ice packs in their kitchen freezer. They have a full breakfast, including waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereal, fruit, yogurt, muffins and juice. The double room was only $60 and the triple room was $80. GREAT  HOTEL AT A GREAT DEAL!!!

Text: I don't understand how any of the previous reviews can disregard the disturbing cries of the cows and the smell when you get out of your car. The place is "renovated", what they meant was some new furniture mix with the old. The old beds have bed bug droppings (make sure you do a lift test under the bed at every hotel). Bed have blood stains (likely from bed bugs). Towels are crusty (though with a cute note asking people to use it instead of tossing it). Curtains have dead bugs. The AC unit have dirt left over from the renovation. The ceiling have pieces falling , with dead insects. Bathroom was the only good thing about this place. Did not stay the night. Would not recommend.

Text: We stay at this Motel every time we are passing through. It is American run, very affordable, and the rooms are clean. They also serve a decent breakfast.
