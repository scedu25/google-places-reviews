Text: I wasn't really there, but my husband was.  I just want to thank Greg for go above and beyond for all the kind things and the friendship to my husband.  He had gone to see a sick friend and Greg was a real blessing to my husband, Harry Wilkinson.  God bless you Greg and Patty.  Looking toward to come for a visit.
