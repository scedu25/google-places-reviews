Utopia Park
Rating: 2
Text: The trailers are really old, some have mold issues. It's on campus so it's a nice option if you're working for the University, but not the best place to live.

Text: To be fair, I haven't lived here, I only drove through...very slowly, while I cried.  If you want to review this trailer park highly because the people who live here are great, I cant stop you.  However this is by the far the saddest and most depressing trailer park I have ever seen, and I have lived in some crappy ones.  These homes are in terrible states of disrepair and the fact that they charge $900 and up for them in the middle of small town Iowa is shameful.  I don't judge the people who choose to live here under these deplorable conditions, but the management of this university housing should be investigated for human rights violations.  If you love your children you will not let them live here.
