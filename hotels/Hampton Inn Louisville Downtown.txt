Hampton Inn Louisville Downtown
Rating: 3
Text: I have stayed at this Hampton several times and still think it is normally one of the better value for the price. Bit this cost was a mixed bag... Pros: Reception staff are consistently excellent and one of the best things about this hotel. This visit didn't disappoint. Breakfast is better than average for this price range. Cons: There were a prior guests curly hairs in the shower/tub. The vanity sink stopper was broken.

Text: The room was clean and well maintained however it smells like a high school football locker room. I actually had to go to the drug store twice because regular air freshener didn't cut it. Great proximity to the hospitals but ambulance sirens all night long didn't make sleep come easy. Good thing I packed my ear plugs. 

To be fair the facility is under renovations currently but I'm a frequent Hampton Inn visitor and this may be the worst. One plus is they have a bar in house but not many positives to report on this stay.

Text: We stayed on the 4th floor. The room was in working order and everything was clean. Parking in the lot satisfactory. Breakfast was very good and there were quite a few rooms to sit in and eat. It was a little bit busy as the hotel was full that day. All of the staff I dealt with were courteous and friendly.
