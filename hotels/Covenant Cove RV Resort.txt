Text: Great resort. Had a cute little playground for the kids and the owners even set-up a slip n slide for the kids. The kids loved it. Owners are very friendly and wonderful. I rented a camper and it was very spacious and clean. Definitely will return to this resort.

Text: Great little park.  New owners are putting a lot of work into improvements - laundry/shower house very clean and usable with a comfortable seating area for socializing.  Would be good for small group events.

Views are awesome.  Right next to the park is Bean Lake, with eagles, pelicans, snow geese (in winter), and many migratory birds (like the Yellow-Headed Blackbird).  Down the road you can see the slopes at Snow Creek ski area.  Riverwood winery's tasting room and store is almost within walking distance.

Military, pet, and kid friendly.  Big rigs can fit, we have a 40' diesel pusher and have room to spare.
