Text: Nice friendly place on an old cattle ranch. Five cabins with two beds, a small kitchen, bathroom, and shower. There is a great view of the Sandhills, the Valentine National Refuge is close, and it is very quiet and very dark at night. This is a great place to get away and is treasured by astronomers, hunters, fishermen, and families.

WiFi and Sat/TV are available, but the closest town is 40 minutes away.
