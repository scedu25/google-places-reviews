Moutardier Resort & Marina

Text: This is intended for the Marina ONLY. The campground is AWESOME and should have 5 stars!

 Debated on whether to write this or not, but I had to....... 

I rented a slip from this marina for 14 YEARS! Had the same covered slip for over 12 years. I knew all my neighbors. Loved my spot. Never had any problems...UNTIL...Spring 2016 we show up with our boat and there is another boat in our slip. Seems the "management" made a paperwork error and did not record my payment for my slip in Spring of 2016. Instead of contacting me or notifying me of a past due balance....they proceeded to sell my slip to someone else!!!! Never bothered to call me! Never bothered to ask why they didn't receive my payment (which I did pay). Never asked why I wasn't returning after MANY years in this marina. Never bothered to say anything. Just sold my slip. When we confronted them, and after having to show proof of cancelled checks and copy of signed contracts for the season, they finally said sorry and then gave us a better slip with a lift for no extra charge. They refused to ask the other boat owner to move slips (which would have been easier and no problem since the boat they owned was a VERY small pontoon and would fit in just about any spot in this marina) They said they would correct the problem at the end of the season and return our slip to us for 2017 season. Fine! I appreciated that at least. 
  Well guess what ?!!  2017 rolls around and they would NOT return my slip! They proceeded to tell me that the girl from last year was no longer there (wonder why) and that they would give me another slip farther down the dock. THAT WASN'T THE DEAL !!!! After a few heated arguments and the "new" girl refusing to return my old slip to me, I insisted on her having the owner (PHIL) call me to resolve this OR I wasn't returning to this marina! I was not going to be treated this way after 14 years of loyalty to this place. Of course I never heard from Phil. So, needless to say, WE WON'T BE BACK! Such a shame. We loved it  at Moutardier.  I guess when you have a waiting list for slips, you can suck at customer service!

Text: so I had cabin 4 for one night and it was one of the worst night of my life I brought my three children ages 9, 5, and 1 we did spend most of the day outside we tried to let the kids play in the water but their were fishing lures all over and it was to dangerous for them to even walk any where near the water as the sun went down and it was time to cook some dinner we went inside to find no remote for the TV witch ok that's something we can deal with what I couldn't deal with was the only real light that was the main light in the living/dinning room area would not work I tried everything there was no fixing it I would have called some one but no cell service I couldn't make any out going calls not even for an emergency and they did not provide a land line to any cabin so I had to cook dinner with a flash light in my mouth it's a good thing my brother in law who was staying in cabin 1 with my sister and her kids had one cause I didn't (by the way they also had their own issues with cabin 1) ok so now the night is finally coming to an end I sent up the play pen for my baby put him to sleep then I move on to the futon that my two older kids were going to sleep on well once I turned it into a bed if one child rolled over to either end of the futon. the opposite end would pop up flinging that child into the middle or on top of their sibling so needless to say they didn't sleep well at all and then when I told the lady when I checked out about all my complaints all she could do was tell me what they were going to do to fix the broken things witch didn't concern me any more do to the fact I was leaving I told her to validate the complains and have the owners contact me to tell me how they plan on correcting the ripe off and how they were going to make it up to me and I still have not heard from then this   was a joke of a cabin it's no where near comfortable and they don't care about correcting any wrongs that their costumers have never again and I will make sure every one I know that this place is a horrible business and the 30 mile away hotels would be so much better

Text: I love this place. I also love how the only one star review is from some idiot who didn't check the weather before renting a boat. Some people lol! But truly, I have had the most pleasant memories at Nolin Lake because of Moutardier. Thanks for everything
