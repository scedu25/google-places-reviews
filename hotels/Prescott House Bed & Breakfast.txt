Text: One of Kansas' BEST bed and breakfasts for the money!!!  You get a lovely two-story home for yourself (if no one else reserves when you are there) or you can rent the home for two or up to eight.

Food and snacks are provided but breakfast has to be made by you.  Some may not like that but I surely did not mind.

Lynn Berns is the hostess and she is very nice.  Her assistant, Caroline, is very nice, too.

The home is from 1923 but modernized and is quite lovely inside and outside.  I stayed in the cozy twin bedroom upstairs and was very comfortable.  There is even an enclosed garage to park up to two cars.

And the town of Peabody is a wonderful place to be to just get away from it all.

I have been to almost 30 Kansas b&bs and this is one of the BEST!!!  Check it out when you are in the area.
