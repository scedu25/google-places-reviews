Gordon Beach Inn

Text: The hospitality here definitely earns them a 5 star. Location is great and walking distance to the beach or to a few shops in town. We just came back and it was certainly to cold for what I had in mind, no laying out on the beach or swimming lol. But had we gone the beginning of summer it would have been different. The Inn itself is very charming. Remember this is not your modern chain, this place is beautiful for the peace and quiet and historic charm. A few friendly suggestions, they only have breakfast on the weekends, (donuts, bagels) Had their been a restaurant (which I understand sometimes there is one in this Inn) that would of been great so we didn't have to drive to the town and find a place to eat for every meal. The room does have a microwave and mini fridge. The air circulation in the room was muggy it was hard to get a comfortable setting. However the owners and staff at this place was AMAZING and if we visit again, we will certainly be staying!
Thank you!

Older visitors take care entering tub/shower as ours didn't have anything to grab on while transversing. Free wifi! The TV was a cute surprise.

Text: We've stayed at the inn and loved it. Timothys restaurant is the reason for our latest visit. The food and atmosphere is excellent. Hope the new location keeps the same ambiance.
