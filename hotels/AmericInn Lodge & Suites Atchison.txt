AmericInn Lodge & Suites Atchison

Text: The hotel in Atchison Kansas allows you to use their pool for $5 without having to rent a room. When asked if their sauna and hot tub were working, they said yes, which was not the case. I would not have spent money if i had been told the truth. The hot tub needed to be cleaned and the sauna, aside from not working at all, was not well maintained. The pool had a few spiders in it and ants were all over my belongings when it was time to go. Overall I'm not too disappointed... I at least got to swim.

Text: Nice and we'll kept.  Staff was friendly.  Only minor complaint was all of the pillows were too firm for me.  A very minor issue though. Breakfast was very good on the scale of hotel breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again.
