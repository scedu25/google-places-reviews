Baymont Inn & Suites Davenport

Text: Very nice Wyndham property. Dorothy at the front desk was absolutely great. Our room originally didn't have a microwave and fridge and they lined it out in less then 30 minutes. The bed is super comfortable. The whole hotel was clean. Didn't check out the pool or hot tub. Breakfast is basic continental. Easy access to the highway. The staff was very knowledgeable about local hot spots. Price on Priceline or Wyndham was very reasonable. Ask front desk for a weekly rate, if your staying awhile the price and service and comfort simply can't be beat! If I ever find myself in quad cities again this will be my go to hotel!

Text: The evening front desk clerk was friendly and efficient. The parking lot wasn't really big enough to meet demand. The elevator scared me into wanting to use the stairs. The room was nice sized with double beds. Very clean. I'd definitely stay here again.
