Days Inn West Liberty
Rating: 5
Text: My family is from West Liberty, KY and we travel every year to the Sorghum Festival to stay and visit.  This is a very small town, with small town charm.  This has been, by far, the best experience that we have had staying at the Days Inn - even with the air conditioner broke.  The room smelled of fresh paint on walking in, carpets were clean, bathroom floor was clean, sink was clean, stocked with plenty of towels, and they have ALWAYS accommodated our late check ins/outs.  The beds are VERY comfortable and the sheets are nice and crisp.  If you are expecting the Ritz, you will probably be let down, but the staff will bend over backwards to do what they can.  My 5 stars is based on the entire experience.  Over the years, our stays have been a little rough, but a fresh start is in the air.  I travel with my 5 & 3 year old, husband and grandmother.
