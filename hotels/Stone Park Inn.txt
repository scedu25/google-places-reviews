Text: Quaint, comfortable, vintage. It is a nice little place for a group to stay when in town.

Text: I have stayed here twice within 3 years. Only as a guest of two Wedding parties. I've never dealt with the coordination of obtaining the stay. But the family member who did, indicated they were great to work with both times.

This is a HUGE home, I lost count of beds and bed rooms. It has a suite, Private rooms, it has rooms with multiple beds. It has Jacuzzi/Hot tub rooms... If I had to guess, I'd say it would sleep 25 to 30 people, being families. Maybe more. There are rooms I was never even seen. It was originally set up as a Family Home with servants quarters upstairs in the back. 

There is a huge back deck, and office area in the entrance. a Fancy/Formal dining area for 6. Casual dining in the rear great room with TV, Cable, and Wifi, or in the Kitchen. (the Wifi is in the back room and doesn't reach to the front Bedrooms.)  

I may not ever have the opportunity to stay here again (since I live in Michigan), but if I do, I'm there!  It is more than adequate for a wide range of events.  The web page doesn't do a great job of providing the number of bedrooms, sleeping areas, how many hot tubs, etc. I'd recommend calling the number and talking to the property coordinator for a better explanation, for your needs.

DISCLAIMER: I do not know, and am not affiliated with this business in any way. I have never met nor talked to anyone in relation to this property. Nor have I, or will I, receive any endorsement, money or otherwise, for this review. Do your own homework. But I hope this review is helpful.
