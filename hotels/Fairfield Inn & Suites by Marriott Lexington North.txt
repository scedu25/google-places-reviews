Text: Wonderful hotel! The staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was clean, comfy beds, and just amazing all around. They have breakfast in the mornings, which was delicious. They also serve cookies in the middle of the day! I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The front desk was great, but the condition of the room was anything but. The shower had soap and shampoo in it, left by the prior guest we assume, along with hair in the drain. Elevators weren't clean either. All and all, the cleanliness standards at this property were not up to our standards. Definitely won't be stopping here again.

Text: Hotel was very short staffed. They did not have enough house keepers and did not have my room ready. The manager was extremely nice and upgraded my room. Unfortunately the room was dirty with soap from the previous guests still in the shower and hair on the bed. Nice hotel but needs people help.

Text: Rooms, hallway, and elevators were not vacuumed. Our vanity light would not stay on, it seemed to overheat and reset ever few minutes. The towel rack fell off the wall in the bathroom. My in-laws room smelled of urine. The hotel did move them to a different upgraded room. The pool had trash floating around on the bottom and in the water. Overall most issues were minor but for $150+ the experience should have been much better!
