Text: We just celebrated our first wedding anniversary here, and it was one of the best trips I've ever had! My first time going to a bed and breakfast and I was in awe the minute we walked in. It's extremely cozy , the staff (Erin) was so incredibly nice and gave us great tips on places to see and eat in the area. You can't go wrong with the breakfast in the morning , but also the location is right in the center of town close to all the shops and restaurants and a very close walk to the beach! The rooms are incredibly clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The cozy fireplace was a nice touch. We are definitely coming back to inn at the park! Thank you for the great stay!
