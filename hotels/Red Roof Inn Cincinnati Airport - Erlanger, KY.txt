Text: This is a disgrace! The hotel is STILL being renovated what a joke! We came all the way from New York this is our 2nd year hear. First year, they dint tell us they were renovating and had us in the worst of the worst rooms. There were 20 of us! 
This year, they are STILL renovating and only part of 1st floor was done. It was SLOPPY, paint on carpet,  holes in walls, breakfast bar not equipped and only open from 6am to 9am and then closed for further notice. This hotel is a damn mess and management refused to compensate us for rooms they discounted for walk ins. At the rate they are going, it will never be completed! I was so disappointed especially since we paid high end prices for a roach motel!

Text: Somehow managed a good room last minute,  we didn't have a ride from the airport to our destination and they were nice enough to double check and made sure we had a place to rest for the night. Thumbs up to them

Text: Room was clean and had everything I needed/expected. I didn't expect a fridge so I was very happy about that. It was easy to find and close to Idlewild disc golf course. The kitchen was under construction so there was no breakfast. Staff was quick and courteous. I would go back.
