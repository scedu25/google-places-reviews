Hampton Inn Indianapolis Northwest - Park 100
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is nice. Staff are very helpful, courteous and friendly. A bit noisy as we were located near the noisiest elevator doors I've ever heard. Breakfast buffet is decent. I think better than most. Great pool and whirlpool. FitNess center was typical but ok. Our stay here was nice

Text: Very good staff and building. The room felt a little dirty as the floor was a little sticky. Other than that they had everything we needed for a few nights stay. They had free hot breakfast, free wifi and a shower.

Text: Most elements of the hotel were nice. The beds were comfortable and clean, the breakfast was good and had a lot to choose from. The only problem I had was with the bathroom. The fan, light, and shower all did not work properly. I feel like I probably just got unlucky as I have stayed at Hampton before. The quality at this location was no less than any other I have stayed at.

Text: We stay at Hilton quite often  and specifically chose this location because of the pool and laundry room. Because of other children being unsupervised in the pool area it was closed an hour early so our children only received 15 minutes in the pool. After that incident we went up to the room and I called down to the front desk to get WiFi information. There were loud guests in the lobby so I had to ask the person on the phone a couple times and his response to me was "that when I was done interrupting him he would continue". With that being a very rude comment to make to a guest I went down to speak to a manager.  To my surprise the manager was the same person that spoke to me on the phone.  Very disappointed that this is the way a person in a customer care position especially a manager would treat their hotel guests.
