Text: I would highly recommend. The manager was very helpful in a dispute that I had with Expedia. Very economical and quiet place to stay on a Friday night.

Text: Mattress had HUGE brown stain on it, sheets not clean. Black hairs in shower, not clean. Bathroom floor was dirty. No fridge as advertised on website. Outdated. Odd smell when you walk in. Staff were ok. Did not give wifi password without asking staff. Ice maker on 2nd floor didn't work. Would not recommend or return to this hotel.

Text: If I could give them no stars, I would. The service is HORRID and every person I spoke with at the front desk, both in person and over the phone were blatantly rude and had NO people skills or common sense. Absolutely the worst place I've ever dealt with! Do not stay here!!!!
