Newton KOA

Text: Road noise! I could literally throw a rock and hit a car on I-80. Too noisy for our taste. Clean park. Kamp K9 could use a lawnmower but good area for dogs to run. We will not return. Leaving a day early. :(

Text: Very nice, friendly, and considerate people who work at the Newton KOA. The kabin we rented was super clean and nice. Couldn't have been better! The restrooms are pretty good although the showers could be a little cleaner and the drains didn't drain well. Other than that it was great. 

There is some freeway noise but we didn't notice it at night in the kabin. It was quiet.

Text: Great experience overall.  Rented a small cabin and it was very well kept inside.  Staff was incredibly friendly at each encounter.  Great play options for the kids and events held through the weekend.  Nice little pond for fishing with the kids.

The only missing star on this review is due to the road noise from the nearby interstate.  If road noise doesn't bother you I'd highly suggest this place for a small family weekend camping trip.

Text: Stayed in the cabin with half bath. Very cute. Staff helpful and friendly. Nice grass area for pets. Small pond . Even a gas BBQ which made cooking dinner a pleasure.

Text: Koa was very clean and well maintained.  Close to interstate.  Road noise was definitely noticeable but not enough to keep us awake.  Perfect for an overnight stay.
