Text: Good location, close to shopping, have a decent breakfast & Monday through Wednesday a evening "social" with a few food items & a small salad bar. Rooms are quiet & dark, heating & air conditioning work fantastic. Really nice people working there

Text: Overall not a bad stay, but their internet reliability is SO horrible that they are getting a 2/5.  No matter what device I use, the connection drops constantly, forcing you to re-sign in over and over, half the time the sign in page doesn't even load, and when the internet does work it's frustratingly slow. In fact, I'm using my own cell data to create this very post.  I do like staying here, but I (like everyone else in the 21st century) need my internet, and when I'm here I spend almost as much time re-connecting to the internet as I do using the internet.

Text: Excellent service and a nice room. Our room was a suite but everything was in the same room. However, it was tastefully done and looked quite good. The staff was extremely friendly. My wife and I have three girls under two years old so everything is a challenge. The staff helped us bring all our stuff in and packed up breakfast for us in the morning. Needless to say we will definitely stay again!
