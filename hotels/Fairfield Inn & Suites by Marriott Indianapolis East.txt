Text: We loved the lobby as soon as we walked in. The desk clerk was wonderful and willing to help in any way. We walked into our room on the 2nd floor and were pleasantly surprised by the coziest of the room. The beds were comfortable and we would stay there again.

Text: An absolutely horrible experience! I got in late after flying all day and got to my non-smoking room and it reeked of cigarette smoke. They had no other rooms or nothing close by at other hotels. I had to book my own room 5 miles away. Very unsatisfactory disappointing experience!

Text: Great rooms at great rates. I especially loved the jacuzzi in my bathroom and hot continental breakfast every morning!

Text: This hotel is very nice and clean. I stay at this location often when I visit Indianapolis, but won't again due to the bad customer service experience with Tommy at the front desk. I had a sick child that vomitted in the room; I asked him for a garbage bag and some type of cleaning solution so that I could clean it up myself at about 6:50am. He told me I had to wait until housekeeping came at 8. I then asked him if he could let me know when they get there and I would come back down to get it, he then told me he would be gone by then. I went back to my room, then came back downstairs in the lobby to sit and wait myself. As I sat waiting, Tommy was changing garbage bags in the cans in the lobby. I then asked him for his name, and as I am sitting writing a review as he walked by noticing me do so, he brings me a garbage bag and a bottle of something I could use. I was and still am very upset about my experience this morning.

Text: The staff was reasonably courteous. However they did double book and kicked us to a different hotel. But they honored my remaining nights.
