Text: Room was clean. Check-in person was courteous. Things were worn and there were bad smells in the hallway. It is what you would expect for the price.  Beds were comfortable and rooms were good size.

Text: Night manager was very respectful. I see they have been making improvements to their facility, despite prior bad reviews. Our room was clean and comfortable and they let us check out late.

Text: This place reeks very foul. you can't do anything the reception area stinks to high heaven if you have a pet you have to stay down stairs you can't have a pet in a smoking room. You have to choose one or the other or 
rent 2 room's And as of September 1 you won't be able to smoke inside anyways. So I would not recommend this place to anyone.
