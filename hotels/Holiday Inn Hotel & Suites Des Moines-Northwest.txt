Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Des Moines-Northwest

Text: Overall it was enjoyable experience. Negatives: Shower didn't drain properly in my room, bathroom fan never kicked in so it was steamy as ever and no free breakfast. Positives: Wonderful people working very polite and professional, when I asked for a new room because of the slow drian shower they agreed and moved me to a Suite for free and clean hotel both inside and out. Putting the pros and cons together I would give this stay 4 stars out of 5.

Text: Clean rooms. The bed was very comfortable. Bathrooms are small with little counter space. Staff was quite accommodating to meet us at our room right as we first arrived with a crib requested at check-in.

The pool and hot tub are a nice size with bathrooms and showers available in the pool area.

Overall this hotel worked well for an overnight stay while passing through.

Text: Spent the night before a reptile show there. Great service friendly staff. Rooms was very clean. The only draw back was the bed was kind of hard but that wouldnt stop me from returning there

Text: The price was excellent for just stopping by on our way through town on a road trip. The beds were comfortable and the employees were extremely kind.

Text: Since it was my wife's birthday and we wanted to stay at a nicer hotel this night we thought we would be happy with this hotel. The first room we were given was extremely hot and had a toilet seat that was ready to spill you onto the floor. We were given a new room and the toilet seat was just as bad. They did have the maintenance gal come up and tighten the seat which made us happy. We opted for the 10.00 breakfast deal which gives you 18.00 towards your breakfast at the attached restaurant which when served was cold. This is a very large hotel with only 3 elevators so you spend more time waiting for the elevators than usual. On the bright side, they had soft water.
