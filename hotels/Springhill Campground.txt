Text: First year camping here. Very friendly campers and staff. Very Very clean public areas (pool, playground and showers). Camp store is reasonably priced. Nice stocked pond for fishing.

Text: Folks, if you want to have fun along with convenient camping then this is the place for you. Swimming, fishing, relaxing. Friendly staff. Ron Geyer (owner) and his friendly beautiful manager Julie are great people. Also, thanks to Julie's magagement style and Ron's  determination Springhill Campground has seen improvements over the years. They have found ways to improve each year and are just the kind of folks to keep finding new ideas. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did. Oh, and it is family oriented too.
