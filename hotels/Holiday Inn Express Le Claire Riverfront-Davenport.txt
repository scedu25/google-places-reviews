Text: Staff are very friendly, rooms have been recently renovated. We've booked rooms here for business twice a year for the last five years. We love this hotel, the people even more.

Text: We travel a fair amount and stay in a lot of hotels.  For the price this is a great place to stay. The rooms with a view of the Mississippi River are spacious clean and very comfortable.  The bathroom vanity has ample room for toiletries.  The shower is one piece (no place for grunge to grow) with a nice seat. The offer of complimentary toiletries stood up when I discovered I forgot to replace the deodorant in my bag. Bed and pillows slept well. Plenty of electrical outlets for our various electronics.  Balcony offered a great view of the Mississippi. Chairs were clean and the area was clean and free of cobwebs.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast and coffee was better than average.  All in all it was a good stay and if we get back here for business or pleasure, we will definitely stay here.

Text: Comfortable with clean rooms. Nice views of water. Dependable breakfast fixings. Stayed here many times.
Only problem is that the rooms are getting a little pricey even for business travel.
