Bell's Extended Stay and Suites
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The breakfast bar is excellent, especially with all the different options between warm and cold breakfast foods. The staff is very polite and helpful. We will be booking here with them again in 10 weeks when our son graduates. They have definitely earned their rating off the different websites that have rated them! I would recommend this place to anyone who is going to come here to the area.

Text: Omg this is the cleanest place I have been to in a very long time nice beds, nice pillows, you have a fridge-freezer-stove-microwave-toaster-coffee pot- and a kitchen sink- iron and ironing board. Has real nice big bathrooms. Pool. Only thing is if your hot blooded bring a fan or come prior and turn a.c. on! ????
