Billie Creek Inn Rockville
Rating: 1
Text: Labor day weekend '09 we had motorcycle group visiting Rockville. IN. Not all could be in same motel so we were in the Covered Bridge Motel, Parke Bridge Motel, Forrest Motel & a few at Billie Creek Inn. Everyone was happy with rooms except the Billie Creek Inn. The room smelled of smoke, dirty carpet & the bed was very hard. It was bad enough that one couple managed to get a room at the Covered Bridge Motel and were very pleased at half the price.
The "Billie Creek" room was quite expensive (they did get the last room available with a hot tub, which would be higher). Given that $$ it should have been clean.
