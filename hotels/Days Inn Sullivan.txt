Text: Hallways smelled like moth balls. There was not elevator so I had to walk up two flights of stairs. Rooms were not properly stocked. Air conditioning didn't work very well. Showers weren't cleaned and were moldy. The ceiling was falling down. Almost positive there were bed bugs. Had a problem with the television and nobody answered when we called. Went downstairs to find that the only person working was in the back room watching a video on their phone. Woke up the next morning with a weird rash on my foot and leg. Breakfast was so disgusting that I had to go to the McDonald's across the street to get a better meal. By far the worst hotel I've stayed at and I was glad to get out of there. Camping in the woods would be better. Management needs to be trained or let go. 10/10 would not recommend.
