Text: Sandy's motel is so dirty. The walls are nasty dirty. The owner called my neice and ask her if he could come back and visit her that nite. The health department should go in there and close him down .

Text: The location is within Decatur's city limits, but it is situated with a grocery store and MANY restaurant options from dine in to takeout fast food within eyesight. I have stayed many weeks at a time at this location. Staff has ALWAYS been friendly and willing to assist you however they can. It has been quiet and I've felt like I'm the only guest here.
