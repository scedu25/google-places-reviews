Text: I don't know who wrote the other review but they sure don't know what they are talking about.  I have helped with Camp Bethel for many years.  The kids enjoy themselves, have excellent facilities, they learn and play rather than just be entertained.  The food is home cooked, high quality and good.  The personnel care about the children and do their best to provide a wonderful atmosphere of Christian education and fun.
