Royal Amsterdam Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, which is located downtown.  The room was large and clean.  The comforter and sheets were comfortable.  Also, I left behind an item at the hotel, and their kind staff shipped it to me from afar.  They were very polite and helpful.

Text: I visited the hotel restaurant, Monarchs Restaurant & Lounge, for a business-related lunch. I had been to this restaurant multiple times so I knew what to expect. Our group was seated in the back room, which is furnished with a lone large table that seats 12+. The food was quite good and reasonably-priced. The only complaint anyone in our group had was that the water tasted strange, but I've never had this problem in my multiple visits.

Text: Lovely place. Only issue I had was that they accidentally gave my suite to another person and had to move our bridal party to a king. But the manager was wonderful/professional and fixed the problem first thing the next morning when she got in.

Text: Very quaint almost European in experience. I wouldn't call it swanky, but definitely a cut above your typical hotel. They have a wonderful restaurant that is on the bottom floor of the hotel with fine cuisine and decent prices. The staff is very friendly and professional. Highly recommended.

Text: The rooms are big, but a little outdated. The shower area is small, but clean. Breakfast isn't that great. The location is amazing!
