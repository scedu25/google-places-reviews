Extended Stay America Toledo - Maumee
Rating: 5
Text: Staff was very friendly and helpful. They had no problem getting us a room where we had to cancel our reservation for a different hotel the night before. In my opinion the rooms look like they have had a face lift recently but are still nice. I would stay at this place again if in the area.

Text: We arrived very late at night however the receptionist is still very helpful. The room is clean. I didn't use much of other facilities though. Generally it is a good stay

Text: Came up too visit my better half while she works up here... Staff is very polite on each interaction I've had with them which has been on several shifts. Maintenance is fast when we did have a small issue. The pool is cold tho, so thats a bummer, but the blowing leaves are constantly being netted out. The vending machines are REDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE so bring your own snacks and drinks. The rooms are clean, and there is plenty of room in the kitchen to prepare a nice meal. My favorite part is that there is a HUGE FIELD in the back to run your dog...OH YA~~ IT'S PET FRIENDLY HERE!! WI-FI WORKS GREAT SO UNLESS YOU'RE HERE ON BUSINESS (PC WORK) DON'T BOTHER WITH THE UPGRADE CHARGE FOR FASTER WI-FI...ENJOY...WE SURE ARE?
