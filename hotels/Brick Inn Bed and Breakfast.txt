Text: We were looking for a short get away to celebrate our anniversary.  Overall excellent experience.  The historic house is decorated very nicely.  Art and Kathy are great.  We got a mini tour of Washington once we got settled in.  Breakfast was excellent - highly recommend!

Text: We have stayed here everytime we are in the Rhineland of Missouri. The home is elegant, hospitality is on point, and the breakfast is always wonderful. We love the tour of the town to update us on all the new additions to this historic river oasis.  Then there are the small gardens around the home and the vintage cars. The Inn Keepers are so entertaining and engaging. Very proud of their town and history.
