DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Lexington
Rating: 4
Text: Clean comfortable rooms.  Hotel was convenient to downtown Lexington and UK.  There was a wedding one night and you can definitely hear the music and people, especially from the rooms overlooking the lobby/bar/event rooms.  But I turned on the AC fan and kept that running all night and it certainly helped and I got a good night's sleep.  Plenty of parking in back.

Text: Hotel was located perfectly. It was clean and quiet.  The staff was not so great.  We had a poorly functioning toilet and ask it be fixed multiple times.  Nothing.  Finally a Spanish guy came up, plunged the toilet, and then handed me the plunger and left the room.  Not my job for $130 plus a night.

Overall I would stay here again and recommend it friends.
