Text: So clean but old, decent for the po-dunk area. Its Eastern KY, what can one expect really? Good for a day/night stay, if ya know what I mean.

Text: First off, it's very clean.  However, it's a very old motel.  The carpet and wood paneling is out of the 60s or 70s. They have upgraded to new quiet heat/ac units in the rooms. I was just planning on stopping along the road on a recent trip and this place popped up around the corner.  I was shocked and amused when I handed the owner my credit card and she looked at it like she didn't know what it was.  It's a cash only place.  However, the rooms are extremely inexpensive.  You won't find coffee in your room or a complimentary breakfast in the morning, but for the price, you shouldn't expect it.  They do have cable and as I started, it's very clean.  If you are simply looking for a cheap and safe place to lay your head for the night, this is a good stop along route 23 in KY.
