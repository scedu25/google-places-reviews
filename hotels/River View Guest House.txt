River View Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: The pictures were exactly representative of the room - it was clean, comfortable, quiet, beautifully furnished with high quality decor, easy to access with a key code to get in at any time, perfect location to bars, restaurants, music, etc. There was even a beautiful view of the river from the balcony - it was perfect!

Text: Definitely a nice place to stay.  Not your run of the mill hotel experience. Great views of the river,  able to walk to get food or drinks,  and not to far from the rest of the amenities in Grafton. I loved the room. Unique decor and very clean.  The kitchenette made me wish I was staying longer. Overall would definitely recommend for a nice weekend getaway.

Text: Four of us stayed here on a Sunday night.  It's a wonderful location in Grafton with an unobstructed view of the river.   Walking distance to one or two bars/restaurants . The unit was clean and comfortable and we especially enjoyed the covered patio facing the river.  Nice quiet spot to enjoy with friends or family.
