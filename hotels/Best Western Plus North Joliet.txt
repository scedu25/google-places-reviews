Text: My wife and I needed a night out and away from our 4 kids.  First time in 3 years.  We stayed here for our anniversary and it was AMAZING.  We wanted a very quiet place.  And we got exactly that.  The staff treated us like we were at some sort of fancy resort!  The  beds were comfy and the shower was superb.  6 shower heads!  The Breakfast was a home-run as well!   Hot warm food,  cold food,  tons of beverages.. I used to travel for a living and I'm very picky with hotels.  I've stayed in the worst and the best.  This one falls into the Best category!  I would stay here over and over again and reccomend it to anyone!  I wish we remembered the name of the lady that checked us in.  She was fantastic as well.  Hope this review serves anyone looking for a nice place to stay.

Text: I was there overnight for a college sporting event. The rooms were nice (some better than others) and the pull out couches were less than comfortable. But still friendly and enjoyable enough
