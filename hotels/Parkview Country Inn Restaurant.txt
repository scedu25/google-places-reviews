Text: Website says they’re open until 8 pm.  Thank goodness I called to find out what was on the menu.  I was answered by a very irritable woman who said, “Well, where are you?”  I told her, she gave several deep sighs, then snapped, “We close at 7!”  I guess we’re having hot dogs for supper.  Not sure if we’ll try again, given her attitude.
