Salina Ambassador Hotel and Conference Center
Rating: 3
Text: The staff is friendly that includes house keeping. Breakfast is not the best, not enough selection. The rooms are clean but some need work. Have stayed here quite a few times. One room the towel rack was coming out of the wall. So some rooms need a little TLC. We got the room for $34.00.  The pool was closed because of a new insurance law. Which is not the hotels fault. The court yard is huge. Over all was pleased with the stays.

Text: Nice place for the price. We got a very good deal. Night person at the front desk is very friendly. Clean rooms with decent sized beds. Great place. Would stay again.

Text: This hotel looked much cleaner on the website, but what can you expect from a $50 hotel? It was probably very nice once upon a time, but now? Not so much. However, the staff was very nice. It was good for an overnight stop but not much more.

Text: The rooms smelled like mold, the fire detector was beeping, the toilet ran all night so had to shut the bathroom door and like one review the holes in the parking lot were bad. But you get what you pay for. It was cheap the only thing that was halfway good was the free breakfast

Text: Really nice front desk people. Pleasantly surprised on the inside. The outside is outdated and kind of scary looking, but inside is beautiful. Quiet, everything you need. No updated electronics in rooms, but the and internet work just fine.
