Dixie Haven Resort
Rating: 5
Text: A delightful, clean, happy place with a fantastic location and views of Webster Lake! We stayed four nights on our vacation to Indiana, and LOVED the Dixie Haven. It is quaint, quiet, relaxing, and the owners are just the most precious people, ever. We used the fire pit, pool, and we rented a pontoon boat, too.

Text: I have never stayed but my good friends have while visiting us as we live catty corner from the motel.  They were pleasantly please and thought the place as nice & clean and loved the period decor.  Love that it's open during the winter.
