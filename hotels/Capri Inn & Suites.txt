Text: Road trip took us there. Nice place for the price. Much cheaper than most. I'd stay there again. Breakfast was simple but fresh. Nice room, bed and AC. No complaints for the money!

Text: It was not too bad...when we checked in there were 3 employees and they were just talking....took awhile to get checked in...and I have never been to a hotel where they charged per person instead of beds....but overall not to bad of hotel...

Text: The inn was easy to find and economical. The air conditioner worked perfectly on an extremely warm day, and the bathroom was very clean. The continental breakfast was simple but adequate, consisting of pancakes , waffles, breads, bagels and muffins for toasting, cereals, cold hard-boiled eggs, as well as biscuits and gravy. There's a Wal-Mart across the road, and restaurants in town.

Text: The rooms were just ok. Shower was akin to being pee'd on. No pressure at all. Service staff were friendly.
