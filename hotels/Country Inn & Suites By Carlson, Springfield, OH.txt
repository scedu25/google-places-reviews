Text: The Country Inn is located off of State Hwy 68 at Troy Road. It's close in to shopping, has great access to dining. The hotel us currently being refurbished. It's quite nice. The room was spacious, clean and the staff friendly. The only "down side" is the lack of a clear entrance. The front entrance is located by turning into the parking lot of a now defunct seafood restaurant. There are not signs indicating the appropriate turn.

Text: Clean and we'll keep rooms. Serves breakfast, near shopping and places to eat. I would stay again.

Text: The hotel was nice and clean and of the standard you would expect for a Country Inn. The breakfast was fine but not anything special though adequate seating. The location is a block off the city street and the adjacent seafood restaurant appears closed but other walkable restaurants are nearby. Local, state and tourism taxes added 16% to our room cost which was a little high for the location.  All staff were pleasant.
