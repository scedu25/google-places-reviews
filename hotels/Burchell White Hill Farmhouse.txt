Text: Today we went looking for a local restaurant in Minden Nebraska to celebrate my husband's birthday and found this lovely place. We had Great BBQ meats, pork ribs and beef brisket, with wonderful sides. Everything was delicious and served family style of 2 or 4 servings in each. The chef and his assistant sat with us and talked for awhile. It was wonderful to meet local people and learn More about this Beautiful prairie area.
