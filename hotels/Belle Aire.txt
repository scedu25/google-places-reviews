Text: Crappy place to live. Landlords don't fix anything or answer the phone for that matter. Monthly inspections that they conduct even when you aren't home. Yea that's right the enter your home while you're not there. Rent is sky high for cheap garbage.

Text: We live in a duplex across the street. These people are utter trash! My wife, friend and I were assaulted in our yard on the 4th by their unauthorized block party that we were no part of. She's continually harassed by the residents and their "families" that always come party at their trailers. Many people live off the state falsely. There's always drama with these folks in Belle Aire looking for handouts from 6am to 11pm and fights galore. Much child abuse witnessed and filmed by residents. We never judged how people live, but after this.. we'll never live near a trailer park again!
