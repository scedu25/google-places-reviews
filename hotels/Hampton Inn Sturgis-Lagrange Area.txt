Text: I give this hotel ZERO stars (I had to choose one star or I couldn't post a review). If you like walls that are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the adjoining rooms and the rooms across the hall then this is the hotel for you! the bed was so horrible it was better to sleep on the floor. The maid service turned the heat off so the room was ice cold upon returning at the end of the day. When I complained, the manager was the rudest person I have ever encountered. He yelled at me and said he did not owe me an apology. I truly believe the Hilton company should take this franchise away from him. DO NOT RESERVE A ROOM AT THIS HOTEL... IT IS HOTEL HELL!!!!

Text: Our stay was good. Comfortable bed. Everything in the room was nice and clean. My only complaint was that guests tracked water from the pool everywhere in the lobby.

Text: Clean and comfortable room.  Really nice staff.  The breakfast was great!  Only disappointment was that the jets on the whirlpool didn't work well, but they let us know that when we checked in.
