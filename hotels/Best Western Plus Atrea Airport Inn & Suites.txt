Text: My husband and I stayed at this hotel in May, and had a much better experience than we had this during this visit. The hotel is clean, there are restaurants within walking distance, and the beds are very comfortable.

Text: Hotel was very clean, front desk staff always courteous and helpful, day or night, check in / check out very fast and efficient. Great pool and work out area. Pool crowded at times due to birthday parties. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Only negative is breakfast on weekends is not served until 7 AM, but weekdays is 6 AM. 6AM every day would be very helpful. Overall great hotel and will definitely stay anytime we are in need of a hotel in that area.
