Text: Cozy  and clean place but the beds and pillows needed updated. The breakfast wasn't anything to shout about. The workers were welcoming.

Text: The people who take care of this place are so nice. We have been coming here for years and will continue to do so. It is easy to get to and reasonable.

Text: A friendly, clean, inexpensive place to stay with coffee and breakfast included. TV doesn't show all the headlines because it's pre-HD TV. If they put a new TV in, it wouldn't cut off part of the image.

Text: Super nice until morning when I went to go to the bathroom there was someone else's poop on the seat. I cleaned it up and I am going to tell the front desk person.
