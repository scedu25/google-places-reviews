Text: The host was very welcoming, and very personable. The room was clean and ready when we arrived. Yea and coffee were available, as well as a small refrigerator. Breakfast was very diverse and fresh, and had wonderful touches.

There was music coming from quite far away on the Saturday night that we were there, but there was no way to prevent that.
