Horse Cave Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Great place to stay in Horse Cave! The owner and his wife are very friendly people who will go out of their way to make your stay very comfortable. Quiet area and clean rooms. Comes with mini-fridge and microwave. For the price you can't beat it. Would highly recommended this motel for anyone visiting the area!

Text: Absolutely impressed with this place. Not a lot to look at from the outside, but very clean, cute, vintage and spacious room. We stayed in a non smoking room up the stairs, but lots of comfy chairs and ashtrays on porch.  Newest mattresses I've ever seen in a hotel room. Mini fridge and microwave in room. Only downside is the wash stall bathroom. Toliet was very small, shower was tiny, but it was clean. No breakfast. Paid $55 with taxes for 1 night. Best vintage motel I've stayed at. Will definitely stay again if I'm back in the area!

Text: Loved it.  Cleanliness is the most important thing to me, and I stayed in 2 different rooms, and both were very clean. Was impressed with friendliness of the gentleman, very helpful as well. The exterior and landscape still had the old roadside motel charm. Definitely be going back!

Text: It's a real highway motel that were all over the US before all the chain motels sprung up. Really nice and friendly staff. Service with a smile. That's rare now a days. 
My room has a wall mounted flat screen tv. And a real 12 cup coffee pot just like at home.

Text: This was our 2nd stay in a week. Stayed going to and from Nashville. VERY clean little  place. VERY nice people. Quaint old fashioned little motel like your grandparents used to stay years ago. You definitely won't beat it for the price.
