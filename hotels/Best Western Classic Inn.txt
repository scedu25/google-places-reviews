Best Western Classic Inn
Rating: 5
Text: When I book a hotel, I look at the reviews.  I try to find something reasonably priced, good location and cleanliness.  I found Best Western in Richmond, IN to have all of these qualities, and more.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  They gave me a bag of treats upon arrival, and said I just happened to be the Customer of the Day!  I've never known a hotel to do that!  There was also a bottle of water and a few pieces of chocolate treats left for us in the room.  Everything was clean, and we had everything we needed.  I'm very picky - mostly about cleanliness, but also about comfort.  I felt very comfortable here.  I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone. The breakfast had much to offer, and it was very good.  They even made special order omelettes for us!  The swimming pool area was clean and pleasant.  The water was nice and it was warm, which I really appreciated!

Text: This place is a jewel! It is clean and quiet, and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was absolutely fabulous. They made omelets to order and actually had soy milk in addition to milk as an option to put on your cereal. This hotel gets an A+ in my book.

Text: We were very pleased with our stay. I had read some negative reviews and was a little skeptical. Our room was clean and roomy. Bed was comfortable, although, as someone else stated, pillows were not great but bed was comfy and staff was very pleasant. Dev, Tabetha, mangers provided excellent service and Remmy breakfast attendant was very pleasant and kept items supplied and took omelet orders.  Everything good.
