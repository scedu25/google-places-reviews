The Inn At Tallgrass

Text: NOT for family reunions, we communicated our needs and they were happy on the front end to take our money.  When it came time they let us know that they did not like us using the "clubhouse" (which is just an extension of the lobby, but the only meeting or common space available).  In fairness, they honored our original understanding, but were not cordial about it. We cleaned up during & after each day. When I asked the manager for a trash bag he denied my request, he said they were out and proceeded to use the interaction to express his displeasure with our group. Ever hear of a hotel being out of trash bags?

NO ice machine on campus.

Text: Staff was really nice. Rooms are pretty basic. I slept on the pull out couch. It didn't have sheets or pillows though, so if you're planning to use it I'd bring your own. Pool was pretty small and there was a big family using the whole thing for volleyball so I didn't get to swim much.

Text: I enjoyed the stay. There was free food and drink at dinner and breakfast. They served beer and wine with dinner. The room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable.

Text: Super different hotel. It seems to be renovated from an apartment complex to a hotel. The rooms included a full size fridge, sink, dishwasher, fireplace, balcony and its own dedicated water heater. Super cool and the staff is nice and the breakfast wasnt the best I've ever had at a hotel, but still very good.
