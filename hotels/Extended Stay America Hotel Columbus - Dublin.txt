Text: The lady at the front desk was extremely nice and walked me to my room because it had not been checked since it was cleaned. She changed the bedspread because it had a stain on it. The room is very clean and nice with the kitchen facilities I needed.

Text: It is an extended stay motel, with all the pluses and minuses they have.  It was well-maintained.  We stayed there twice and had different levels of handicapped equipped each time.  The beds were high, but the first room had rails around the toilet, but the toilet was low and the bathtub had no rails or other assists.  The second room had a high toilet and a walk-in shower with rails.  Both rooms had large refrigerators and 2 burner stoves, as well as a microwave.  Based on a sign I saw on one of the rooms, they accept pets.

Text: Was given the key to the wrong room, had to switch rooms. Place looked run down and had some bugs (no, NOT bed bugs).

 Being an extended stay, nothing is provided for without going to the lobby. Towels, cups, coffee, the hairdryer even.

Lobby itself had no bathroom aside from what's in the rooms. No workout area. Breakfast was instant coffee and packaged muffins, so non-existent nonetheless.

A lot of this could be more understandable if the price was cheaper but it was on par with if not more expensive than the other Marriott's and decently run hotels in the area.
