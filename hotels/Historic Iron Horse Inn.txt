Text: This was our first B&B stay in Hermann and it was fantastic! We stayed in the Victorian Room and we had no complaints. It was comfy and cozy and there was plenty of space. Plus, the location is great. It was within walking distance of everything in town.

We did wish a warm breakfast was included, but the pastries were really good! And, cookies were provided each evening. 

If you are looking for a place to stay, this is a good choice!

Text: We stayed in the Victorian room. It had a double jacuzzi, fireplace and everything you could imagine in a top-notch b&b. Riannon was very helpful and friendly.  Our stay was relaxing and romantic.  She served decadent scones the next morning with lovely fruit. A Keurig with fabulous choices...you can tell she has put much thought into making a stay there perfect!  Planning on another stay there!
