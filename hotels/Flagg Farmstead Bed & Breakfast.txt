Flagg Farmstead Bed & Breakfast

Text: If the hosts got any friendlier, they would be family! Breakfast was amazing and well done. Attention to their guests makes you feel at home.

Text: My wife & I plus our son and daughter-in-law stayed here in early OCT and had a great stay. We all got complimentary tickets to the Lincoln Museum which I can't recommend highly enough. The Fall colors were at their peak and the B&B trees were spectacular. The hosts were very warm and friendly and gave us informed recommendations for dinner reservations. All the rooms have their own bathrooms, the rooms are nicely furnished and the bed was comfortable. All-in-all  an excellent choice:)

Text: Doug and Rosalie were wonderful hosts and not only made us feel very welcomed and comfortable in the home, but also gave us great advice on places to eat and sights to see.  Will definitely stay there again if we visit the Springfield addrea.
