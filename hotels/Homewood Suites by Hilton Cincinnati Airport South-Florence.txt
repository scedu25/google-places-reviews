Homewood Suites by Hilton Cincinnati Airport South-Florence
Rating: 4
Text: I had a clean room with all the amenities you would expect. They served a very nice breakfast in the morning. Also when we arrived in the evening they host a social with food and drinks. It was very nice. The hotel is a little back from main roads so it's nice and quiet. Walking distance to shopping and restaurants.

Text: Our first time staying at a suite hotel. The friendly staff were very helpful. Clean and comfortable room. Could have used a few more tables for the breakfast crowd though. 
But we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Homewood.

Text: Wonderful staff! Great location! Pool room was warm but water was cold! Food was great! Room was a great size for a suite but not much soundproof from the main room to inside of hotel. The bedroom was quiet. I would definitely stay again!

Text: The actual room at this hotel was excellent. It was clean, spacious and quiet. The shower had three shower heads and it was very nice. The staff was very kind and helpful. The location is kind of close to the airport, but very close to Florence Mall. My only criticism was the exorbitant price. One night was $200 with tax. This was a very nice hotel, but it was not worth those prices.
