Text: Really nice hotel.  The free beer and wine was lovely.  Breakfast was a slight step up from the usual.  The indoor pool and hot tub was lovely.  Our 2 bedroom suite was amazing and we had the best sleep we'd had in weeks.  We weren't able to check in when we were supposed to,  but they comped us admirably with a free night's stay and goodies for the kids.

Text: Great location and everyone is so friendly here! The rooms are spacious and there are great views of the city on the upper floors. They have a complimentary breakfast every morning to get your day started and a light meal with drinks in the evenings during the week. This is the second time we've stayed here and we have a great experience every time!

Text: We checked in online ahead of time with the fantastic ability to choose our room. We picked an available corner room and looked forward to a little extra space. Upon arrival in our room I couldn't believe how much extra space we had, the room was huge. The pool was nice and warm and the kids loved it. Breakfast was okay, would have loved some non acidic fruit options. The only thing that left a bad impact on me was waiting for our room to get cleaned. They never showed up even after a request after 3pm to make sure we received extra bathroom towels.

Text: Very nice hotel. The rooms were modern and large, and the staff was accommodating. Location was about a 20 minute walk from downtown.
