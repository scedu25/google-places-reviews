Ellis Lakeside Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Great spot. For $20, 50 amp service and water hook ups. Showers were adequate, but could use a good cleaning. Location was great and Ellis seems to be a delightful town. Felt very secure as we saw police patrolling the area. Great value!

Text: Very nice little spot to camp.  The city of Ellis staff are very pleasant and quite helpful.  The local police department is friendly and helpful as well.  
I'd definitely recommend it as a stop for a day or two.
Sites are limited so get here early.  Also, the tent sites don't have water or electric but it's first come first so if you pay for the RV spot but are in a tent, all is good.
Great experience overall....we were happy campers...

Text: I just love this place. A nice town with friendly people. Camping right next to the river. Best of all, great services here power and electronic with a dump station. Fast free internet. All for the price of $20 a night.

Text: We spent 1 night at Ellis Lakeside. $20 with water and 30 amp service. Nice, scenic and quiet. Right off I70. Bathhouse was only in fair condition, but had plenty of hot water. The free WiFi worked well. All in all, a good experience.
