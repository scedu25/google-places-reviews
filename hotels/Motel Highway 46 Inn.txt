Text: Its a place to sleep...no laundry area...can hear people fighting and screaming through the walls...we stayed for a week and they didnt come clean or even as if we wanted fresh towels.  We had to physically walk to the office and request some.   Called the office numerous times and they never answer.  Had to walk over to the BP gas station next door to pay for the room..idk i guess they are owned and operated by the same people.

Text: Bedbugs. Definitely bedbugs. It's too expensive for nothing.. I wouldn't recommend at all.

Text: Very clean, the employees are very friendly, the pillows aren't all flat they actually were better than most I've experienced before.

Text: Bedbugs. I'm covered in bites from my face to my feet! Guy behind the counter wasn't even fazed, just said "Ok, I'll give you some money back and you have an hour to leave." Then followed us to our room to ask which bed had the bedbugs and to again tell us we had one hour. We paid for a week and were there two days before I finally realized it was bedbugs. Room 6.
