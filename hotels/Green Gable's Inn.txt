Green Gable's Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Just returned from a weekend getaway to the Green Gables Inn, and was thoroughly impressed. The weather was unfortunate (heavy rain and wind all weekend) so we couldn't enjoy the grounds, but even in bad weather I could tell they were gorgeous - we'll definitely be making a trip back in better weather. The house itself is a work of it straight out of an old movie, and our hosts Tom and Marie were gracious and friendly but unobtrusive. Beyond that, they demonstrated an excellent knowledge of the area which made planning our time a breeze; the hardest part was narrowing down our options, which is not something I expected from small town Nebraska. All in all, we had a wonderful weekend, and will stay again.
