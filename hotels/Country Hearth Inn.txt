Text: It was a nice basic room and the people were friendly. The room was clean. The complimentary breakfast was great! They had make your own waffle, cereal, fruit, juice, yogurt that seemed to be available all day, and bread to make toast.

Text: Old, run down, musty motel. Lots of sketchy people hanging around. Online it's still listed under America's Best Inn and Suites.  But it's not, just part of the same Corporate  Chain. ABI&S is across town and is a new, slick motel, much preferred.

Text: When you walk into the room it smells like someone died in there. Then we try to turn the AC on and it made hell of noise all night long. The shower Plumbing looks like it was falling apart as well. This definitely need improvements.
