Text: The hubby and I decided this would be a sweet place to go camping on our route for the 4th of July since neither one of us had camped in Nebraska before. It is north of I80 approximately 50-60 minutes, so it's not directly on the way, but worth it. The park is pretty old school with dirt roads, primitive camp sites and tons of space. We found a loop that only had one other couple camping and fishing so we set up camp and took a short stroll around the area before the fireworks began. Every campsite has a grill and picnic table. From our location, we were able to enjoy two different shows. There are no showers and no running water but the bathrooms are clean, considering they are holes in the ground. The campsites work on the honor system and you must pay for entry into the park and then a different fee for the camp site. You are able to purchase a daily park pass online so that you only need to have cash for the camp site. Nice location off the beaten path but going back into town for firewood or supplies is only 10-15 minutes. Definitely pack a tarp or two to place under your tent in case of rain. We had a good time, woke up, broke down camp and headed out for our next adventure. :-)
