Text: This inn was very nice. The staff was very pleasant and extremely helpful. The room was neat and clean and the bed was awesome. The whole stay was above average but the staff made it a huge hit. Thank you Brian.

Text: Got a great room rate after coming in late worked very well in compensating us and all of our needs. Great service.  Very clean rooms and great continental breakfast.

Text: It was fine. This must be an older Hampton Inn. The rooms were pretty small (though oddly the bathroom was large). It worked for one night, but it would be cramped as home base for a weeklong family vacation. The shower emitted a terrifying screech whenever it was on but the water got HOT. Usually Hampton Inns have a mix of families, business people, older couples, etc. This one was almost exclusively families with young kids, like us. It added an element of chaos. I can't comment on breakfast. All the hot breakfast choices contained meat, leaving vegetarians only the sweet cereals and waffles they put out for the sugar crazed under 10 set.

Text: Super friendly here. I can't say enough how great the staff is it Hampton Inn I will definitely be coming here again. They were so nice to my children when we checked in, they quite literally treated us like gold. The rooms are pretty nice, mostly just standard fare but they do have a lot of power outlets and USB plugs to change your devices. A decent breakfast, a pool, and exercise room. A decent hotel indeed.
