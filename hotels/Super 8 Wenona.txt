Text: Pros: We had a lovely time. We had a king non-smoking room that was very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows felt like down pillows. The owner is a very nice man who always asks if there is something he can do for you. He even does room cleaning! It is a great deal for the price, especially if you get a deal from a hotel site. The vending and soda machines were priced lower than I've ever seen. Parking is very close to the front door for those with walking difficulties. The Omega Bar and Grill is next door and their food is delicious and reasonably priced with very friendly staff.

Cons: No protein offered for continental breakfast, just waffles, pastries and cereals. So if you dont want a sugary breakfast you have to go to Subway. No problems with our room except the air was stale smelling until we turned on the fan.

Text: Nice, clean, and quiet. Price was reasonable. Room was relatively small, but had a desk and a table and king size bed. Would be crowded for kids, otherwise a very nice room. Staff was friendly.
Forget the fast food and drive about 2 miles downtown to "Park Place" and talk to the owner "Lance". Excellent food and service.
