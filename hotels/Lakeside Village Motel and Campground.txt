Lakeside Village Motel and Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Very reasonable price, excellent view of Lake Erie from the room and as well on the grounds down by the water.  Room was very clean and just what we needed for a one night stay to visit Point Pelee.

Text: Our family was planning for a great summer but instead it was the worst because of this motel. We stayed in the motel for one night. I used the washroom at night and saw a bunch of centipede crawling out of the drain of the shower. I didn't want to sleep on there bed beacause it seemed like they haven't washed it in ages. When i woke up to check out i was feeling really itchy. The day we arrived home i went to the doctors to get the itchyness checked out, the doctor told me i had scabies. I recommend to not go to this motel
