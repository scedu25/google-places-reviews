Text: We have stayed at Rolling Hills regularly for over 3 years now. Our time spent here is relaxing, refreshing and just what is needed to enjoy friends and family by the camp fire. The campers are warm and friendly with many regulars year after year. Please call the main office to find out when you can  come and be a part of this little gem called Rolling Hills!
