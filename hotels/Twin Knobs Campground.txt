Twin Knobs Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This is one of our favorite campgrounds. We try to come here at least once a year. It's very relaxing and refreshing. The lake is low because they are putting another boat ramp in.

Text: We camped here in July and had a double site, J9.  The site was beautiful and we could even get a glimpse of the lake through the trees.  Even though the campground was full, it was clean and very quiet after 10:00 PM.  The bathrooms were cleaned several times a day and were very nice.  There were trails that led down to the lake which made it easy to put in our kayaks from the campground.  We also swam in the lake from the campground.  The lake is clean with crystal clear water.  We even saw a bald eagle while out kayaking.  Will definitely come back and will recommend to others.

Text: My family goes at least once a year & we have a great time every time. The trails are beautiful & there is plenty of wildlife to see. The beach is clean & the bath house is huge.

Text: We had a great time camping at Twin Knobs. The facilities were the cleanest, most well maintained we've ever seen. The sites are level, clean and offer a good degree of privacy and the staff were all friendly and helpful.

Text: A very clean and well run facility as are most US Forest Service properties I've been to. Twin Knobs has great views and access to CAVE RUN LAKE KY... I have been here nearly a dozen times over the years, both family and group outings, and have enjoyed my stay every time... very high marks!
