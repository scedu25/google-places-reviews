Text: Interior lobby and dining area was very well maintained. Room was clean and all furnishings were in good repair. Horseshoe layout made it inconvenient to meet with friends on the other side as you have to go to the first floor to get there. Courtyard was well maintained and furnished. Overall a very pleasant experience.
