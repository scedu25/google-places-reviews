Text: This hotel was great. The people were very nice. The room was clean. The bed was very comfortable and the shower worked great!

Our room definitely used to be a smoking room, could use some airing out. And whenever the AC kicked off it made a very loud scary sound. But that's definitely not enough for me to not recommend this hotel!

The price was great as well. Don't waste your money to be 5 minutes "closer to town" on the harvester in. The Heritage Inn is still in town. Still really close. A great hotel for a great price.

Text: This hotel is newly remodeled. It's beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Will continue to stay at this hotel when in the area.

Text: There were ants all over my aunt's room and the owner refused to give a refund or even a comparable room! Also he blamed my aunt for bringing the ants.  Sad we have been coming to this hotel for years because of a yearly family get together but since new ownership they may have improved the looks of the hotel but the customer service has declined drastically!

Text: We found an obnoxious amount of ants in our room the second night. We had been gone literally all day at a family reunion. Owner refused to refund us or move us. While packing up our stuff, we found 3 sticky mouse traps. Gross! Disgusting. And horribly managed. He blamed us for the ants. Saying we spilt something to attract them. How did they get in? And how do you explain the mouse traps? I'd give a zero rating if I could. Also, it says non smoking but smells of smoke horribly.
