Fairfield Inn by Marriott Ann Arbor
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed for 2 nights and the experience was exceptional. Rooms were clean and the staff efficiently served me and my other 99 colleagues. Breakfast was pretty good, considering it's provided, and the amenities were maintained.
Rating: 4
Text: Comfortable rooms. Very clean and organized. The staff were nice and quick to attend to issues. Beds were clean and comfortable. Somewhat hard to find as the parking lot and entrance are behind another hotel. Overall a nice place, would stay there again.

Text: Small rooms while relatively clean had old mattresses. With so many other choices literally right there I would think there are better choices.
