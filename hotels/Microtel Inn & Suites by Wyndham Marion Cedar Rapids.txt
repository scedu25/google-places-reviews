Text: The price is great. Staff friendly.  Missed having coffeemaker in room. Chain had been busted off the door and not repaired. Breakfast could have been better.

Text: Lived here for a month and a half while looking at houses. Staff was nice, breakfast was good enough. It's really small but it's called the microtel for a reason. Quiet unless the arena football team is there then not so much...
