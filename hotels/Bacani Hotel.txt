Bacani Hotel

Text: Working out of town and had almost zero choice (they know it as well). $80 a night for a double room with full beds. The room we got had a chemical odor. For the money, I would expect more.

Text: Huge disappointment. Stayed here for business but that was about it. After working overnight I showed up to no employee in the hotel, the continental breakfast was not provided as advertised, my co worker was locked out of his room and had to call and wait until someone drove over to let him in... since they couldn't make him a new key. I hope that this will be the first and last time I get stuck in this dump. The only reason I gave one star, rather then no star is because the woman that checked us in last night was sweet and helpful. She is the only thing this hotel has going for it.

Text: Service on Christmas Eve night was great. The hotel was in good condition and was comfortable for our family.

Text: Definitely not anything fancy, but the rooms seemed cleaner than when I've stayed here in previous years, and they finally got some nicer towels. No hot water last night for the shower but it worked this morning. About half the outlets in the room didn't work either, which scares me a little.
