Best Western Norwalk
Rating: 5
Text: I'm giving this hotel 5 stars because the rooms were clean, the beds were soft and cold ac in the room. It is an older hotel but it is cozy the staff is kind and it's great to put your feet up. Another plus was not being disturbed by anyone else despite the hotel being full. Breakfast was hot and ready early; eggs waffles etc. It is not 5 star in the sense that the Hilton is, but for the low price and clean quiet and safe accommodations you really can't beat it. Would stay again.

Text: I stayed 2 nights at Best Western in Norwalk and was very pleased with my experience. My room was a nice size, very clean, and included a microwave, fridge, and desk. The shower was nice, the beds were clean and very comfortable. The staff were accommodating and very nice. There was an indoor pool & hot tub as well as an outside patio area with tables and chairs. My stay included an extremely impressive complimentary breakfast. Hot oatmeal with toppings available, choices of cereal and milk including gluten free options, a waffle making station with toppings, biscuits and gravy, eggs, omlets, bacon, sausage, 5 choices of bread, yogurts, fruit, muffins, and all sorts of condiments. Hot tea, coffee, and juices were also available. I was overall very impressed with my stay here and hope to stay with Best Western again.

Text: Staff was great. Only problem was my pillows on my bed.  The cases were dirty room them three days to change them only because I left them on the floor with the stains pointed out. Otherwise the place was nice and comfortable
