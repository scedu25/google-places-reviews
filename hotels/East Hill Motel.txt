East Hill Motel
Rating: 2
Text: While the room had been renovated it still smelled dirty and musty. The linoleum floor in the kitchen was bubbled. The cable went out on Friday night and then did not work at all Saturday night. The cost was ridiculously high for what it was. I could have stayed at a higher class hotel for the price of what I had t pay. Had I not been so exhausted from travel I would have searched for a different place to stay. Also the walls are paper thin. I could gear someone in the room above me snoring all night and I don't know if it was the neighbors or the cleaning staff but bright and early Saturday and Sunday morning, 6am it sounded like people were moving furniture in and out. The noise lasted over an hour whike door were slammed shut and reopened and whoever was talking was loud. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

Text: Rooms while small had everything you would need for a comfortable stay. The room did smell of fresh paint as if it was painted day before or within the week of renting it. Bathroom was very clean

Text: With the city water completely out-water system failure, the folks at the hotel went over and above to help everyone get through this together.
