Text: We had a great experience here!  Loved the room, the service and the amenities. The pool was the perfect temperature for me. The breakfast is really good with a great selection and a really homey set up. They even have soft water in the shower!!  Definitely a top pick if you want a great place to stay!!!!  We were on the to floor. Very quiet and nice view.  The surrounding area has so many options for dinner and shopping and a huge beautiful movie theatre within walking distance!!

Text: Spacious room, comfortable bed. Great service from the staff. Food was pretty good too. The exercise room was adequate for cardio, wish they had a few dumbbells also though.

Text: The rooms are very accommodating. They are spacious and provide flexibility for relaxation and home style living. If I could provide a single piece of advice, it would be to add a microwave in each room.

Text: There was a shuttle bus from the venue we were at to the hotel. The bus driver was so funny and polite! The rooms were spacious and very modern. Breakfast in the morning was really good and was served within reasonable times.
