IHG Army Hotels Steindam Apartments

Text: Decent hotel. The room is adequate for extended stay except it is missing a stove. It does have microwave and larger than usual refrigerator.  The room comes the normal amenities as every Holiday Inn but has one little bonus which is that of a patio door. The bathroom was a little small and tight which was the only ding for the 5 star review.

Text: Day 3 and no reliable internet connection. Called tech support with no results. Other than that, room is habitable, but not much more.
