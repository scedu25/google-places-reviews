Text: We had a wonderful stay! The stafg was very friendly and professional. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I liked that they served breakfast until 11 and had more options than other hotels we've stayed at. We would definitely stay here again!

Text: Top notch customer service! They have a great staff who is friendly, helpful, and ensures you are provided with everything you need for your stay. This place is neat and clean with excellent house keeping.

The food is very good and I the breakfast buffet is quite impressive. This is not a cheap hotel, but is fairly priced for what you receive.

Text: The room was very nice and clean. Staff was great even though we arrived late. The AC was very cold and the beds were very comfortable. No continental breakfast but there is a restaurant downstairs. It was near a great deal of businesses.
