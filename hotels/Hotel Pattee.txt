Text: My husband and I stayed for two wonderful nights in the Woodworking Room; it's spectacularly beautiful! We enjoyed several meals in the restaurant and had fun bowling downstairs. The staff were warm, welcoming, helpful and accomodating at all times. If only the fire had been lit in the library; I would've loved spending both evenings reading in there! We also visited The Copper Door Spa downstairs and were incredibly pleased and impressed with Anna's and Summer's foot pampering and massage.. you simply must go to the spa when staying here! We can't wait until our next visit!!

Text: We stayed overnight in the "David A Kids Suite" What a beautiful room! The kids loved the setup as did us adults. The Hotel is as they say  "an experience in and of itself". From the ornate patio to the bowling alley and spa and the great food in their restaurant or if you want some peace and quiet check out their library over by the fireplace. Staff were also very friendly.

Text: Beautifully maintained hotel with themed rooms in historic Perry IA. A great place for a wedding venue.    WARNING! The rails on the platform bed in the Japanese room are VERY slippery!  I fell off the bed in my socks and everyone other than the owner was a little condescending when I explained my troubles.  Apparently I don't look old enough to be warranted a "fall" disclaimer..
Be aware of the stench of the meat processing plant, their aroma fills the town.

Text: Held our wedding ceremony and reception here. Couldn't have imagined a more perfect setting. Mahala, the event coordinator, is so amazing and helpful! The food is so delicious!  We received so many comments on what a beautiful setting it was! We can't say enough great things! It was also a very affordable venue!

Text: AMAZING! A hotel experience unlike any we've ever had. Each room has a different theme - we statyingbin the Dutch King. Absolutely charming in every way. The resurant was equally tasteful and prompt. I can't say enoug about this trip; one we'll remember fondly.
