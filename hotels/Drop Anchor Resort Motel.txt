Text: We really liked this place.   It's nothing fancy but very cute. They have a little pool with a little beach and a little bar called the lil bar.   We were able to walk to the convenient store. We chose this location because it is 2 miles from coconuts.  Really cool place too.

Text: Considering this is a resort area, price is OK, and location is good. There is a pool, you can fish from the bank right there or walk across the road where catfish were being caught earlier today. There are a cafe and a small neighborhood bar within easy walking distance. Ducks can be seen walking the property. The place is kept tidy. I would come back without any qualms.

Text: tried calling three nights in a row. Was told last night I'd get a call back for a room. Nothing. Tonight I called again. They never answer the normal number so you have to contact the lady on a 660 number. Tonight i finally got a hold of her and asked if they had vacancies still. She replied yes but then said it's a holiday weekend and you need to give them a couple days notice... Sorry for cussing on the phone...but surely you understand how ignorant your comment was.
