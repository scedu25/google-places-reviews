Text: The staff was pleasant but the rooms weren't very clean. Our rooms were supposed to be non-smoking but they didn't smell like it - and the wifi wasn't reliable. It'll do in a pinch but I wouldn't recommend it.

Text: It had a few minor issues but over all it was clean and comfortable and was by far the most affordable in the area.  I will stay there again and would recommend it to anyone needing a room.
