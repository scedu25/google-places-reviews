Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Bolingbrook
Rating: 4
Text: The location is in Bolingbrook. The room was clean and a good size. The service was friendly and bar/restaurant was nice. Shuttle driver to our event drove very fast! Driver back was very monotone. So improvement would be, more friendly and engaging and safe drivers.

Text: The hotel is very clean and has all the latest accommodations. Despite a billing mishap by a front desk clerk, the hotel manager (Mike) displayed the excellent qualities of honesty and good business ethics. The values and great communication skills of this manager are exceptional. Five stars for this one!
