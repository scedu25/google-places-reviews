Text: You can't trust anyone around here. Cars get broken into, packages stolen from porches. 
Its a sketchy neighborhood and management couldn't care less. All they care about is you paying your overpriced rent on time. 
I would not recommend living here unless you are out of options

Text: I've lived here for 2 years. NEVER had a problem, NEVER robbed, NEVER vandalized, & really never had a issue here. New management took over 1.5 yrs ago & are great. My trailer is almost brand new and my rent is a untouchable deal. 
Since the new people took over they have got the losers out and have really made great changes. 

Heck, there is a wait to get in  here. Which means people are staying. 

I think that guy that was leaving bad reviews is just a eviction or some disgruntled person. Who knows.  Obviously he used a fake email to leave that review.  That's just childish & cowardly.

Anyone who wants to personally contact me feel free.  I actually live here and have no biased reason to leave a fake review.

Text: Not somewhere you would be proud of living. Lock your car and pick up your UPS deliveries, but most importantly move somewhere else.

Text: If you love 9000 gallon water bills, soppy yards, little brats running around destroying your stuff, thieves. Then this is the place for you. Also if you love extremely high rent, you'll love it. If not, shop around first, drive by at night.
