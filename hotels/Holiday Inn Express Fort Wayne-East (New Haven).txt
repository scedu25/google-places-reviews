Holiday Inn Express Fort Wayne-East (New Haven)
Rating: 1
Text: We stayed at this location on Wednesday 10/11/17. The staff was friendly however our stay was not that impressive. We were told that the breakfast would be phenomenal with cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins which was a reason we stayed and they did not have them. We also had trouble with the phones working and be able to reach the room. Our keys would not work most of the time and had to go get new keys. I have stayed at holiday inns across the country and have not ever had a bad experience until now. I Will not be staying at holiday inn again unless willing to correct the issue. I was bitten by a spider during my stay. One door  did not work to come in or out.  I Will be posting to social media about my experience to let my friends and family know about my experience.

Text: I'm a Platinum Member and stay at Holiday Inn Express on many occasions. The breakfast was very disappointing. The Wifi was slow. The building was very dated and had the style of a hospital. Didn't see much in the way of a staff. The girl at the desk was very indifferent. The office chair for the room wasn't right for the desk. Just not a place for a business stay. I gave it two stars because the place seemed clean.

Text: Charged us for a 2 king bed suite and have us a room with 1 king bed and a fold out couch. Room phone didn't work. Fold out bed didn't come with a blanket or sheet. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls in the bathroom.

Text: We were well attended. The only reason for a 4 star and not a 5 was due to the lack of communication between staff caused us to rush our check out
