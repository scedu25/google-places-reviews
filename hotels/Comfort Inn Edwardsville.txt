Text: This was a newly renovated or brand new hotel, not sure which.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable and clean.  Loved the way the bathroom area was all in one place and offered nice counter space.  Staff was very welcoming.  Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Fantastic hotel! Our power went out so my spouse and I packed up our 16 month old triplets and headed to Comfort Inn. We were checked in quickly and given a room with plenty of space for three pack n plays. Comfortable bed, quiet floor we all slept well. Breakfast was great with a lot more options then other places we have stayed. They even found 3 high chairs for us. Would definitely recommend!
