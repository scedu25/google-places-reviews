Hotel Breakers
Rating: 5
Text: We love this hotel. There's a few different entrances to the park which is nice. Parts of the hotel are being renovated at this time. The rooms are nice, some of the lamps have outlets in them for charging. Bathrooms are a good size and we always have plenty of room. We usually bring a cot for our youngest and there's plenty of room in there to set it up. There's an arcade and an inside pool, as well as an outside pool. There are some large fire pits behind the hotel that are great at night.

Text: The room was great and clean! Lots of staff to keep the place tidy. The front desk never really answered so anything you needed (extra pillows or blankets for example) you had to go to the front desk yourself. Which isn't too much of a hassle, but our room was about a 7min walk from the lobby. Overall it was a nice stay.

Text: So my review is less about the hotel quality and more about the amenities. As in there aren't any. I didn't expect free breakfast since they have restaurants on site, but I did expect coffee in the room. Nope, have to go to Perkins and pay almost $4 a cup. Also, the restaurants are owned by Cedar Point, so they don't have the same specials as the other ones, like all you can eat appetizers at Fridays. But they do have ridiculous prices. We spent $60 for 2 adults and a kid at Fridays and $32 for one adult and a kid at Perkins for breakfast. The hotel is nice enough, small indoor pool. Nicer outside one. Beach was probably nicest part.

Text: Hotel Breakers was everything we could have imagined.  In inside is very nice, well done, and clean.  There are multiple restaurants, ice cream parlor, bar, and Starbucks coffee shop all in the building.  The buzz was so positive and exciting outside at the pools, great for kids and adults alike.  The room (two queen suite) was newly done, spacious, and comfortable - coupled with all the fun activities on the beach and two park entrances (not to mention the water park entrance next door) within a quick walk and this was the perfect was to have a great weekend for the whole family.  It was so nice, we added another night on our stay to take advantage of more activities!  Worth every penny!!

Text: Great place! Very accommodating!  Friendly staff! Great beach! Kid friendly! Loved every minute there! The giant fire pits in back were wonderful to sit around at night. Walked to Cedar Point and the water park. Perfect family vacation!
