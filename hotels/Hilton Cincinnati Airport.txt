Text: I came for a work meeting and the food is delicious. I did not stay in a room but the service was friendly & attentive. The veggies were steamed perfectly & the salad was fresh. Delicious! I will remember this when I host events!

Text: Nice hotel. It felt new and modern. Great shuttle service to the airport. The staff were friendly and helpful. Instead of trying the hotel restaurant, I went to one of several within easy walking distance.

Text: The hotel is located conveniently just putside of downtown Cincinnati. There are restaurants and stores surrounding the hotel. I must say it's one of the more humble Hilton hotels I have visited. The rooms were pretty standard and the bathroom was fairly small, literally a one person bathroom. The staff was very helpful and friendly.

Text: The service is great and the breakfast is delicious and fresh. The staff are friendly and open, from the Bistro staff to the front desk, especially Charmaine & Linda. Housekeeping staff and managers actually speak to clients as they walk the halls. Even the shuttle drivers were lovely. Southern hospitality is never out of style!
