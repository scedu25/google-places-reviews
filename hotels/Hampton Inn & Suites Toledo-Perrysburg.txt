Hampton Inn & Suites Toledo-Perrysburg
Rating: 5
Text: We were here for a family wedding and we had 5 rooms for people from 84 years old to a 1 year old. Shannon, at the front desk made sure we had rooms close to each other and moved some of our rooms when some of the party changed their requirements.  The rooms were spacious and clean. The kids loved the pool.  And it's in a great location to shopping and restaurants. Would definitely return.

Text: Guest services were very nice! I'm allergic to feather pillows, so they gave new feather less pillow cases. The room was excellent with many accommodations. The breakfast food was excellent. The atrium area was nice & roomy. I was able to conduct business in the atrium area while eating a good breakfast. I would highly recommend Hamton Inn & Suites for both business & pleasure.

Text: Clean room. Really good breakfast. Sausage gravy was great.i was disappointed that they didn't have kitchen for room service at night. There were no open restaurants open late nearby either. I would probably stay there again though. Over all a decent hotel.

Text: This hotel is very clean, well appointed, and has a very friendly staff. The beds were comfortable and the climate control worked well. The breakfast was a standard Hampton Inn breakfast, but the fruit was fresh. I recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to visit Bass Pro Shop or downtown Perrysburg.

Text: The hotel is nice and the rooms are a good size with the usual amenities. The staff was friendly and willing to help the guests with any needs. Free coffee round the clock is nice and the"to go" breakfast bags made great on the road snacks. The only complaint if I had to make one was some minor wear and tear maintenance that needed to be addressed but so low on the priority list. For example the handle in the shower needed to be adjusted so it was no longer crooked and the ends were flush. Did not affect my stay and I would totally stay here again.
