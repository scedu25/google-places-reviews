Buffalo Rock State Park
Rating: 2
Text: The sculptures they talk about at the park are big hills that may look like something from an aerial view however from the ground it is hard to tell and most of the descriptive signs are missing to help you figure out what exactly you are looking for. Also, all the riverside trails are temporarily closed so we weren't able to use any of those. Finally the 2 small American Bison on the property were kind of disappointing because they are in a small 50 yard square fenced in area. I expected a better experience after reading other reviews!

Text: Small amount of trails to walk.  The main attraction are the poor bored Buffalo.  If you haven't seen Buffalo before, this is a place to go to see two.

Text: Beautiful place! Entrance is hidden, must slow down to see it. Camp site is across from the mountain. Must park and walk. Only $6.00 per site! Bisons are up in the mountain. Trails were closed due to recent tornados. Richard was very helpful and pleasant.

Text: We enjoyed the trails here very much.  Handicap and wheelchair accessible for the most part.  The bison seemed a little worse for wear.

Text: The trail was really nice, we took a double stroller and made it most of the way with no problems. I wouldn't recommend a wheelchair, because most of the path is gravel.
