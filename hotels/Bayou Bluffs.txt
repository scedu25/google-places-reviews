Text: 1) Entry sign is placed at the corner of an intersection.  The sign does not include an arrow.  One of the ways leads you down a dead end.  Can you guess which way I went first?

2) Upon arrival, we pulled up to the very non-obvious "office" (pole barn) and got out to get registered.  No camp director or staff for 1 hour.  No one knew where they were.  I called a week or so ahead and got a site reserved, or at least I though.  They had no record of my reservation when we were there in person.  I got a site after arguing about it.

2.1) They don't accept anything other than cash.

3) They don't have any maps of sites or roads.  Better have a good memory of where you need to turn!

3.1) I hope your camper/RV has off-road tires!  Their roads are rutted and full of potholes.

4) The campground is used by mostly seasonal campers -- the weekenders are looked down upon.

5) Camp staff coming onto my site and touching my belongings.  Why??? My wife saw it happen through our camper window but was unable to ask why, as she was putting my son down to sleep.

My wife, I and my 18 month old packed up our camper and high tailed it outta there on Saturday night and went to a REAL campground.

All in all, STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!
