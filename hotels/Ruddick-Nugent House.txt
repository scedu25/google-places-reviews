Text: The home is in need of maintenance / repair, the rooms you sleep in are "lived in" and not as clean as you'd hope. 

The owners are very pleasant people. 

Although we didn't stay after we paid due to the filth seen while touring the room. 

We did ask for a refund but no refund policy is in place. We spent $160 for a tour of the home.

The interior of the main floor is beautiful. If you're looking to stay in a grand home, this one has lost its luster. You can buy the place for $649,000 it's forsale
