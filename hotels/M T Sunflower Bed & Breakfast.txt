M T Sunflower Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: This was my second stay at the B&B, just as good as the first. My family and I like to go to Colorado every other summer, and this place is a great stopping point between Wichita and Estes Park for a night's rest. The rooms are nice, clean, and spacious. The breakfast was amazing, I had the cream cheese French toast with eggs and bacon, which was delicious and filling. It's happily recommend this place to anyone who's interested.

Text: Very quaint bed and breakfast in an old, decommissioned church.  The walls are very thick, so I heard the people in the room above walking, but nothing else.  There is an elevator to the first floor, but not the second.  If you have bad knees, stay on the first floor.  This B&B is run by the Wesleyan church in Sharon Springs, so drinking is probably a bad idea.  They have a daily breakfast - nicely done.  We had a family member who diabetes and the ladies whipped up and egg for him so that he wasn't just eating carbs.  The rooms are very comfortable - large, clean, and well-appointed.  There is an ironing board and iron in the closet.  There is no daily maid service, which isn't unusual in a B&B.  There is no light touch service, as far as I know, but there are spare towels available in our closet.

Text: My family absolutely adores this bed and breakfast located in a quiet, relaxing little town.   The staff offer a wonderful, home cooked breakfast each morning and are just kind people.   The rooms are spacey, offer extra linens, and are always clean.   This is a great place for family gatherings as there are plenty of accommodations, the building has a downstairs room plenty adequate for gatherings  and you are a block away from the local grocery store.   (in this town you are a block away from most everything.) I'd definitely choose this place over a hotel.
