Text: Restful and meditative getaway!   After searching throughout northern Illinois for a family campground, we were blessed to have found Mendota Hills Campground.  We have been seasonal campers for many years now and everyone from the owners, our fellow seasonal campers to the weekend campers are just down to earth and fabulous!  We are all searching for a little peace in our busy, crazy lives and you'll find that solitude and sense of community at the Hills!
Fishing, hiking, lake swimming, Frisbee golf, bonfires, archery, BINGO and a non-denominational Sunday service followed by the weekly frog jumping contest are just some of the amenities.

Text: This is a rustic campground and has a wonderful family feeling!  The people are wonderful!  It has hills and grass and lakes.  Like camping used to be!  The seasonal sites are arranged nicely and not on top of each other.  Many tent sites with open green areas! THE FISHING IS TERRIFIC!  There is a swimming lake and beach.  There is a wonderful non-denominational church on the campground and has a 10 am church service with a wonderful congregation.  Families love it here.  Did I mention the frog jumping contest every Sunday morning?  Too fun!  Lotsa of great ice cream at the store--so much fun to sit on the front porch of the store and bump into all the folks.  Just  a great social and safe and happy camgground.  Definitely give it a try--you won't regret it!
