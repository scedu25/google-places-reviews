Text: They changed owners so hopefully it's clean now.  My feet used to turn black from the carpet.   If someone is doing laundry while you're taking a shower,  you have no water pressure.  If you're in the shower and someone is doing laundry and a toilet flushes, you literally get 1 drop of water about every 4 seconds.  You would have to go to the office to pay rent and you could see where the dogs crapped and they picked up the pile but just walked over the rest.  It was NASTY.  I rather sleep in a barn.

Text: Next to the motel is a restaurant, which serves  the best breakfast around from scratch.  Sadly the motel's reviews are correct.  It's not a pleasant place to stay, even for the price.  But the quality of the restaurant is evidenced by the number of cars in the am on any given day. So for the motel, zero but the restaurant a five.
