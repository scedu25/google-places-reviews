Text: We had a last minute reservation with Tin Cup on Saturday night.  Customer service was great, park was very clean.  Playground for the kids and playground (driving range) for the adults. 

Would definitely stay here again!  Not to mention that the owners have a great last name!

Text: Took my 38' motorhome here for what was supposed to be a month. Left after 1 week because they failed to provide a level site for my motorhome after multiple requests. My right front-tire and stairs were so high off the ground I could barely get in or out of my rig. Their 50A power has 40A breakers with a 50A plug, so you don't get 50A as advertised. I did not find the owners to be accommodating or responsive to my needs. Camp here at your own risk.

Text: Good sized rv park well maintained by a retired couple living on site. There's a driving range here also in the park which is pretty cool for golfers.
