Days Inn Wallaceburg

Text: Hotel was under renovations, fire alarm went off all night. Staff was very nice but it looked like they had a hard night. The price was very reasonable, I would give it another try.

Text: I called and got a room rate of $89.99, then once we arrived, the night shift mgr. added an extra $10.00 to the rate and an outrageous tax...by the time all was said and done,  it was almost $120.00. Unfortunately it's the only hotel I'm aware of in Wallaceburg. Decent rooms at best and are a retail worth of $65.00 per night. They definately have the "name their price" market cornered.

Text: Cozy hotel and front desk service was on the slower end of transactions but overall a nice place to stay. No gym and the continental breakfast needs to be stepped up

Text: Was in town 1 night for work, booked two king rooms for myself and a co worker. Both of our rooms had stained towels, my floor and bed sheets also had stains. The shower had brown stuff seeping from under the shower wall joints. The sink facet was broken and to top it all off the A/C unit sounded like a lawnmower running in my room. A lawn mower that turned on and off every five minuted and never did get the room feeling cool.  

We did no eat breakfast here but it is all set up in the front lobby with only about 10 seats. Looked very bad.

Next time I'm driving the 15-20 minutes more and staying in Sarnia.

Text: It was comfortable and functional. Just a weird problem with a broken smoke detector for about 20 mins.
