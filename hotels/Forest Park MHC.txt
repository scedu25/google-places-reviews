Forest Park MHC

Text: This place is a joke. It's full of drugs and the woman (Julie) in the office is stealing money from the park and the tenants..   which is screwing with people's homes. Only good thing about this place is the handyman. I wouldn't not ever live here again and I'll make sure none of my friends or family do either..
