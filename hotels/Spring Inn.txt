Text: Absolutely horrible experience. Owner took our reservation and told us to confirm the day before. We called repeatedly throughout week to confirm. Showed up day before reservation and was promised the room in person for the following day. As we left the day of reservation headed for the room, owner called and claimed we canceled the reservation. When I called back and told him a mistake had been made, he yelled and cursed at me, then hung up the phone. He repeatedly hung   to figure out the confusion. Owner then called an hour later and said he found a room and we had an hour a half to get there. I informed him we were three hours away because we turned around after he cancelled the reservation. Owner then called an hour later asking where we were and charged my card. The sheer impotence is astounding. All of these problems were his self-inflicted stupidity and arrogance.

Text: I dont think this place is a legal business. Looks like an old abandoned motel that was hit by a hurricane and someone just picked up some mattresses off the side of the road and turned the open sign back on. Disgusting. No way they could pass any inspection
