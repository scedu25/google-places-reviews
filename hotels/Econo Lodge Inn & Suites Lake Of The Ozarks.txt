Text: The hotel is old but well maintained.  the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Our room was very clean and we had free WiFi.  The hall smelled a little musty but our room didn't.  It's a good value, we will stay here again.

Text: I only have it a 1 because this is the lowest Google review will allow! Mind you, I am shaking writing this. The morning of checkout,  my friend pulled me into her room to show they had caught 1 of 4 scorpions in her room. The one caught was a baby and we left it under the cup and went to the front to inform Don so the staff and housekeeping wouldn't get stung. After telling Don about the situation, there was no apology, only a quickness to have us sign our final receipt. I asked him if he had grandchildren and how he would feel if his grandson almost got stung? A sincere apology was never given, then he had the nerve to shrug his shoulders in a "it is, what it is" manner! I'm livid, and I would highly recommend people stay away or check your room thoroughly.

Text: Good price in recently upgraded hotel. Good breakfast with eggs and ham. Lots of nice small touches like hand towels to wipe down windshields etc. Close to restaurants. We walked across the street to dinner,  very convenient.
