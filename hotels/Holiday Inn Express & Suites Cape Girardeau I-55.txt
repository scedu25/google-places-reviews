Text: We stayed here while going to see the Eclipse in Carbondale and it was a fantastic stay. 

The room was spacious and modern, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, there were plenty of outlets, and I really liked the extended luggage stand. It's a nice alternative to the chest of drawers, since I tend to just live out of my suitcase during short trips. 

The front desk staff and breakfast staff were very friendly and efficient. The breakfast was excellent-soft biscuits, plenty of options, and the cinnamon rolls are always delicious. The hotel is right near a lot of food options and the Interstate, so it's got a good location too.

Text: Great Hotel and even better Staff.  We stayed here the last four days.  Great large and comfortable room.  Love the room darkening shades!  Staff was awesome.  Suggested places to eat, even helped us today find a great auto shop in the area for a last minute emergency.

Text: Good hotel for passing through, or staying in the area. The location is great for a nice southeast Missouri tour. It is located convenient to the college(s), right off Hwy 55 and within minutes of all cross roads. There are tons of food options in walking distance, with exponentially more in a minutes drive. Its also within 30 minutes of Lamberts Cafe in Sikeston.  Our room was clean as was the breakfast area.  They were friendly and prompt to check-in.  The prices are on par with what you would expect, so this place is worth the stay.  They also server milk and cookies before bed.

Text: Right of the freeway. Good location to food and other places. King size beds are very nice with a decent space for work or junk. The night guy is kinda strange but day service and breakfast ladies are delightful.
