Text: This is a good hotel, it is clean and the staff are polite. They really care that your stay is pleasant and are quick try to help including restaurant recommendations. The fitness room has treadmills, elliptical machine and exercise bikes as well as dumbbells that range from five to fifty pounds. They have a pool and hot tub but I have not used either of those. The breakfast is good it has selections to meet most tastes. I would recommend this place to a friend.

Text: Place charges you $40 extra for a night, staff was seemingly clueless about their own job. The first thing is the door wouldn't shut on it's own like most do, you have to push it fairly hard. Don't expect to bring any left overs into the room with you due to no mini fridge. The access road is a confusing mess of pavement that goes completely around where you think you should go. Decor is nice and pillows are okay. But I will not be coming back. Id rather save the extra $80 and stay at the Super 8 50ft away.

Text: Overall it was a very good night of sleep for me followed by a good breakfast. Regarding the reviews that dock the hotel for being difficult to find, the key is to turn just west of Casey's General Store - that is the road that will lead you to the hotel. Once you have that down, the location is an asset.
