Text: I camp here year around and it is a great place where everyone is willing to help if you need something. We do activitys all the time and are a close comunity. Its more of a place for adults, there are children but are starting to get older. Its just the right place for someone who has a camper amd is looking for a place to come to year around. If you want temporary then I suggest Dawson 2 miles west of here.

Text: Gross. Tent camping area was amid the acorns and mud. Picnic tables are in disrepair. We tent camped and there was one fire pit for all the tent camp sites, we were the only one there however and I can see why. Playground was dangerous and covered with spider webs, equipment falling apart. Bathroom was so rusty and disgusting I wouldn't even use it. And I have been in some pretty rustic places this is the worst. Get a tetanus shot if you plan to camp here
