Text: Perfectly located for easy access from the interstate. Rooms are clean, fresh, and reflect high quality standards. Their free hot breakfast is a great way to start your day. The desk staff are warm and friendly, as well as breakfast staff. They give you the kind of service that will make you want to return again and again. I've been staying there for 11 years now.

Text: The place was clean and reasonably priced. Bed was comfortably but the room was a little noisy. Could hear the neighbors TV all night and we were by the elevator so you could also hear it thru the wall.  Good complimentary breakfast with hot eggs and average sausage patties. Also all of the other usual items like waffles, muffins, and juice.
