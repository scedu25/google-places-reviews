Central Park
Rating: 4
Text: Central park is the town square and also a furniture store on W Side of town square. It has interesting furniture, rotating artwork, and occasional music performances, especially during First Fridays Artwalks.
It is not a hotel and does not serve food or beverages, as it somehow shows up sometimes on maps or reviews.
