Text: I'm a long term resident of the RV Park. This is a great place to live or visit. Clean shower and restroom facilities, firewood, propane, pool, cabins, clubhouse and c-store. Just minutes from two boat ramps on Truman Lake. Randy and Amy are awesome host's and go out of their way to make you feel welcome here.
