HILLSBORO COVE (recgovnpsdata)

Text: We pulled in and realized no one else was here. In the middle of August.  Looks like someone is camped across the water from us in the other section. The entire place is very shady, our site is directly on the water. Several families of Canada geese on other side of campground from us. They swam by to check us out. Small birds are flying back & forth at waters edge. Very quiet. 
At each site the picnic table, cleaning/cutting up table and large grill with cover are under a well made shade pavilion. The Fire ring is just a few feet away.
