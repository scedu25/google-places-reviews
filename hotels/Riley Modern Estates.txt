Text: 1,250 income to qualify. 10,000 is to much for a older trailer. Plus 299 lot rent. I'm thinking trailer maybe 5,000.

Text: Terrible place to live my kids and I have been living here since beginning on July of last year and I have had several issues with my place the only thing they replaced was the hot water heater I have had issues with the electrical wiring in my home since we moved in they wait until the warranty is up to tell me that if they pay for it I would have to pay them back in payments and its their fault why should I have to?? I am already paying over 600.00 A MONTH that's not including the utilities that I am paying as well. They don't fix anything and if they do they charge you an arm and a leg to do so I just had to pay 100.00 to get my outlet fixed that was bad and it could of caused a fire 45 for service 25 for repair and 25 for new outlet he showed me what was the problem and I was disappointed  and shocked that they would just let me move in like this with the electrical wiring being a fire hazard. I am going to call and report this to the board of health and have this issue fixed in my honor :(
