Text: Great place to live.  Within walking distance to grocery store, several restaurants, Family Dollar and the local hardware store.  There is even a bowling alley across the street for a fun night out.  Any repairs that I needed were fixed within a day or two.  Quiet park.  Management has done a good job of NOT tolerating any loud tenants.
