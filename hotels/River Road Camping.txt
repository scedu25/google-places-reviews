Text: I have been coming to this place since I was 9 and its amazing!!! Owners are very nice and kind to everyone! There's a DJ once in a while, pools if fairly big and its big, everyone is so friendly to each other and there's a deck to look over into the beautiful lake??? there's fishing allowed and you can use boats! Bathrooms might not be the cleanest but I dont mind. The mini arcade is nice, there's a volleyball net and a little park, my family and i have the best time when we come here!!! There not strict at all? I completely love it it'd amazing

Text: I really liked this campground. Heated pool, small game room, nice pavilion, clean camping spots, friendly staff.  Excellent location to launch boats or fish from shore.  Only drawback: public bathrooms need a good power washing.
