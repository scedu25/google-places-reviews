Text: Updated, absolutely spotless, reasonable, pleasant owners and staff, COMFY king bed. For the money you can't do better locally I'd say! Then go eat at 10th St Diner!

Text: We stayed in room 20. The room was clean and nice with a mini fridge and microwave. Clean linen and comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Water pressure in the shower was iffy, but water got hot quickly. Staff was nice. Only complaint would be that checkout is at 11 but they started shoving us out after 10. Not rudely or anything like that, but there was definitely polite pressure.
