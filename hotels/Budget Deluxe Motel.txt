Text: I called this place ahead of time and reserved a room. We had a 7 hour drive before hand, so we planned on arriving at midnight. 

We arrived at 11:58 pm and were told they over booked and didn't have our room. The guy at the desk told is the owner had called another place and arranged for is to stay there. We got a room there (Sunset Inn) and saw bed bugs upon pulling back the sheets. Definitely bed bugs. We googled the species to be certain. 

Normally I don't give out 1 star reviews, because I'm an optimist and I have low standards of comfort.. but this was ridiculous. Not only did they not have my reservation and failed to call and inform me of that - but they didn't even secure a room at the same price, much less inform the owners of the referred in of the situation.

I wouldn't try this place again. We ended up at the econolodge and slept in a clean bed.

Text: BED BUGS!!!! Go to rustic motel instead. I visited a friend here for maybe an  hour. It's the only place I could have gotten them because I didn't go anywhere else, the following morning I woke up covered in bed bug bites. As far a clean it appeared clean. Just had bugs and seemed very ran down. I don't recommend this place to anyone unless they already have bugs. Also the floor was wet.
