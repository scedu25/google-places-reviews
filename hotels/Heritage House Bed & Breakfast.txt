Heritage House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Merriam is the most gracious and sweet lady! My family has stayed at the Heritage House for 20 years every time we're in town we stay here because it feels like home. I'm proud to say she has become apart of the family. Hospitality is wonderful and the breakfast is amazing every time! Thanks Merriam for all you do and we'll see you next year!

Text: Great old house with a charming mistress who runs the place on her own.  I grew up across the street from this home so anytime I go "home" for a visit I try and stay here.  Reasonable rates, quiet location, charming little town, beds are incredibly comfortable and the place is immaculate.
