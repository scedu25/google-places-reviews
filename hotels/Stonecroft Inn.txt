Text: What great service and the waitress was very pleasant (Karen). Restrooms were very clean, meal was excellent and done just the way we asked for it. Had a good group of people and a steady flow coming and going. My hat off to the chef! There was no rushing to get you in and out.

Text: This was a great hotel. We were visiting from Germany and were in the hotel for 10 days.  We will definitely be coming back here next year! The room was  clean and spacious. We had a big fridge which was very useful and a coffee maker. The hotel is near lots of shops including Walmart and there is a restaurant which is open until 23.00 on site (a lot of restaurants seem to close at 22.00 in Windsor). Staff were very friendly.

Text: Clean, quiet, elegant, modern, well equipped, and spacious rooms. Staff was friendly and the check-in and check-out process was quick. Wi-Fi was strong and fast. Bathroom was equipped with a VERY large shower staff, but no tub. Great place to stay!
