Quality Inn North
Rating: 5
Text: WOW WOW WOW  are you looking for a discount hotel with a 5 * rating .. this is it . I will always stay here when in cedar rapids so long as it's managed as it is now .

Rooms super clean, staff were incredibly nice , my only wish is that we had more time to stay another night! 

Both the front desk clerk and the manager ( maybe franchisee) were friendly and accommodating... Red Roof TOWNHOUSE in grand forks should take some Choice Brand tips from these people !

Text: Harry was awesome. Always gave a friendly face and fun and playful jokes as I came through the lobby. Room was clean and what I expected at the price point. Fair price and exception accommodations.

Text: While this Quality Inn was an "award winner" we weren't overly impressed.  We had "double" beds which weren't much bigger than "twin" beds.  The pool was tiny and breakfast was just average.  The staff was, however, very courteous and attentive to guests.
