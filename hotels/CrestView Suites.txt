Text: The rooms have kitchenettes which was cool. However the hallways smelled of strong cigarette smoke which wafted into the rooms. Not very clean.

Text: It's a bit dated but it was quiet. The edge of the carpet (dark carpet so shows everything)  was pretty dirty but the rest seemed clean. The outdoor pool area was really pretty and set up with tables so you could eat breakfast outside. I rested very well and appreciated the good night's rest.

Text: Got in late and left early the next morning but was very pleased with the accommodations. The beds were very comfortable. The room was roomy and clean which should be expected but sometimes you might be disappointed  ... not here. The only issue was the AC was blasting and we gave up trying to figure it out. I'm sure it could've been adjusted but we slept well anyway as there were plenty of blankets etc. We'll absolutely book them again next time we're staying in Wichita.

Text: Good experience although not clean everywhere. There was food in the garbage disposal from the last guest I assume but tons of space and very comfortable.
