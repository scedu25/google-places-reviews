Super 8 Reynolds /East Columbus Area
Rating: 4
Text: The room was clean. Stayed there 2 nights. Complimentary breakfast was okay.  Quiet hotel area. Only one complaint, we had unwelcomed visitor's trying to get in at 3 am. The clerk rented them a room we was already occupying. No fridge or mics in the room but overall, it was okay.

Text: We stay at super 8's all over the country.  We were told there was semi parking and there was not.  Super 8's give cdl drivers a discount.l,not this one.  Then it was loud all night, full of riff raff. As truck drivers we stay in motels for comfy beds and showers.  The shower did not work.  The main desk did not even care. He said if we called he would have moved us. Well at 530am we're getting ready to hit the road.  No shower and no sleep.  The guy at the desk did not care one bit.  I will be fighting this credit card charge....do not stay here if you want to rest or shower.  Nasty area too

Text: Do not stay here!!!!!!!!!! I only stayed for about 5 minutes then turned right back around for a refund....  FOUND BED BUGS!!!!! Another woman I spoke to found a roach in her room. But do not risk getting bed bugs brought home with you! The Nastiest and one of the hardest things to deal with. I am still itching just thinking about it!

Text: Accommodating and helpful staff. Clean rooms. Not a classy place but well worth the price.
