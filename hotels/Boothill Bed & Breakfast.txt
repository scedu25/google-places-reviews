Boothill Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We loved our stay! We were treated as if we were family. The Doc Holiday suite was prefect. The room was clean, well stocked and the homemade cookies were a special addition after our long drive.  There were plenty of towels, robes, toiletries, etc. The bed was comfortable and we got plenty of rest. The breakfast was phenomenal and included fresh pastries, eggs, bacon, potatoes, juice, coffee and tea.  The Orange, walnut, honey pastries are still being talked about by my wife. Enid & Kurt are fabulous!  Thank you!

Text: Enjoyed our stay very much! We are not really "planners" and called/stopped by and Kurt & Enid welcomed us into their home on the spot. Breakfast was delicious and we enjoyed the Wyatt Earp room! So nice to stay in a home on our journey.

Text: This was my first stay at a B&B and i was completely and totally surprised. Enid and Kurt are fantastic people and their incredible hospitality was off the chart. I loved my stay and would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone visiting Dodge City. The house is cozy and the breakfast was delicious and HUGE. They treat their guests like family and work very hard to make you comfortable. Thank you so much!! Awesome place.
