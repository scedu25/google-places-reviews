School House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: This adorable school themed B and B was the perfect place to rest our tired legs after a day on the Katy Trail. Wish we could have spent another night to enjoy all the perks. The owners' attention to details was above and beyond the normal, from the bottles of wine for sale, to the sink full of toiletries to use if you forgot, to the water cooler that would fit water bottles. Highly recommend and we will return soon!

Text: First of all -- do NOT let the fact that this inn is a former schoolhouse deter you in any way! It makes for a charming and interesting setting. The inn is tastefully decorated throughout, and each room has a school-related name. We stayed in the 'Honor Roll' room, for example. No, the rooms don't feel like classrooms. The inn is immaculately clean throughout, and the owners seem to have thought of every detail. Forget a toiletry?  There's a basket with commonly needed items at your disposal. Would you like a bottle of wine or a beer? They are available at a reasonable cost on the honor system. The common area is well stocked with games, cards, books and DVDs for your use. A few cookies or snacks were always on hand too. The breakfasts were delicious. Our room had ample space for sitting yet was still cozy. The hosts were friendly and very detail oriented. We set out to have a relaxing weekend, without an itinerary filled with things to do, and it was sooo nice to just take it easy. We enjoyed our stay immensely.

Text: Awesome owners, great breakfast, cozy rooms! Will definitely be returning in the future. We stayed in the Miss. Edna room. Now keep in mind this room came with a low clearance warning in the details as it sits on the top floor and the cielings are sloped. Im 5'11 and the wife is 5,10. We got around just fine in the room, other than one bump on the head in the morning. Aside from this we had a skylight, claw foot tub, and access to all amenities with in the schoolhouse. It was still well worth the stay! The owners are very friendly and are well-acquainted with the area. Upon check-in we were greeted with iced tea and warm peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. Can't wait for the next visit!

Text: Very comfortable experience. We stayed for one night in the Teacher's Pet room. Everything was clean and organized. The breakfast was great too, and they accommodated me and my allergies without hesitation. I am very pleased with my stay and will definitely be back again.
