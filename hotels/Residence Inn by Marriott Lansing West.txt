Text: The staff was awesome. Very friendly. Two different maids took time to say hello and ask about our stay in the morning before we checked out as they were making their rounds cleaning rooms. The room was great. I would love to stay here if I were traveling for work. The kitchen has regular table setting but also bowls, strainer, etc. You could make dinner while on a business trip.
