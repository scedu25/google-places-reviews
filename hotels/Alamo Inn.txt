Text: This place has changed a lot. The new owner has done a great job updating and remodeling. The lobby was gorgeous. All new HD TV's, furniture etc. WiFi worked perfect for business no lagging was able to work on all my websites with no issues. Will definitely be back & recommend to others.

Thanks again Kelly,

Text: Clean & well maintained - the room was very clean and the bed was fantastic. The room I had didn't have a phone didn't have HBO or Cinamax but did have Dish tv and basic tv.   Just a very good place to get some sleep.
