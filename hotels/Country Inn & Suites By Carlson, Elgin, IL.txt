Text: A few things stacked up to a miserable stay. First was rowdy folks staying up and parting through the night. This usually doesn't bother me to much. The next morning I brought it to the attention of the staff. They were well aware and said the group was leaving. Well they didn't leave and the staff did nothing the next night. I wouldn't have wrote this review for just that.
To add the hot tub was out of order, there was no note about that online. Then the ice machine was out and just to poke me...... the internet connection was ridiculously slow. Hello Country Inn!! Its 2017. I mean like dial up slow. Ya I'm old enough to remember dialup.

Text: I had one of my best stays here. Friendly staff. Comfortable rooms. Great breakfast. They are very accommodating. Love the pool area. Overall I would stay here everytime I come to town.

Text: It was loud because of proximity to a bus station. It smelled pretty bad in the common areas (like disinfectant). The bed was lumpy and only had a single cover, a duvet that was far too warm for my taste. Staff was friendly and the place was clean though. Just not up to the standard I expect from a hotel in that price range, or really even most Country Inns.
