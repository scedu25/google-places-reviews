Text: They have bed bugs when I was there, that was three months ago. However, they did give me a refund for my troubles.

Text: Nice, still new, clean. Nice hotel, decent breakfast, quiet area. Rooms are well equipped and modern with nice bedding/pillows.  I only used the wifi a little so I can't comment on other posts about slow internet but it didn't seem slower than some

Text: Decent place, very clean, modern. Fridge and micro in room is always nice.  A/C works great and Fan can run constant for those sleepers that need white noise all night. The parking lot seemed a little small for the size of the hotel yet I never struggled to find a spot.  Breakfast was included and had a lot of choices including something hot everyday.
        The wifi did have some quirks, sometimes it was difficult bringing up the "log-in" page and the inactivity time-out must be set pretty low.  Get up and go to the bathroom while surfing and you may have to log-in again. I've been here twice and the signal was better on floor one than 3. Do yourself a favor and bring an Ethernet patch cord with you, wired is much faster. Good value for the price.
