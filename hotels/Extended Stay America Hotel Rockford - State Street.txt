Extended Stay America Hotel Rockford - State Street
Rating: 3
Text: Rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  The kitchens are great but kind of small. They have a small variety of cooking utensils available but not enough cookware to cook large home cooked  meals. They have a very small workout room with only 3 machines in it. There are no smoking rooms available but there is a small fenced in area where you can sit outside. They have a gazebo with a table and two lawn chairs.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  The place is very quiet usually.

Text: Check in/out was easy and rooms were clean. No coffee pot in room, though. That was unusual but it was available upon request.

Text: Always stay here when I am in Rockford area. Always friendly and easy to get in and out of. Never had any problems and rooms are quiet and clean. Great staff and relaxing. Because of location, there are a decent amount of places to eat that are close and within reasonable driving distance.
