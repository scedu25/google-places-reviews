Canton Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Friendly staff. Parking is somewhat limited to small vehicles. Poor WiFi. Rooms are clean though a little dated. Noise does travel between rooms. Distant from shopping and Restaurants. It is the cheapest motel in Canton however. If you just need a cheap place to stay for the night, I would recommend it. If you are looking for an extended stay, I'd stay elsewhere.

Text: The guy in the office was sweet! He gave us a discount for renting the room so late in the night. The room was clean, no bugs in sight. The rooms come with a little refrigerator and coffee maker! They also provide breakfast and coffee in the AM!
