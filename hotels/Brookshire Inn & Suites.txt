Brookshire Inn & Suites

Text: Booked a room with king size bed and paid online. When I arrived I was informed there is no record of the booking, and they only have a double that's a smoking room. Furthermore, I was instructed to contact and individual that was not even present in hopes that my money gets refunded. No clue what the rooms are like, etc. But to me that is unacceptable when spending 110 bucks and not even able to get refunded immediately

Text: Room was clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The location was near a bunch of shopping and restaurants. Also spent some time at a very nice public library next door. Would stay again.
