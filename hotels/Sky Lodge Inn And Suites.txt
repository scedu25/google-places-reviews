Sky Lodge Inn And Suites

Text: Customer service was awesome. The location is just 10 or so minutes from lake Geneva, you pretty much are on one road in and out of downtown lake Geneva to get here. No real complaints about the room, you're not at the finest place but you have everything you need.

Text: We called three hours before needing a place to stay. They were very accommodating with a rate better than most in the area. Room was very clean. Good bed, a bit firm for me, but that can be so subjective. Dated bed spread, but you probably don't stay here for the style. It's a well maintained, clean property run by good people. The pool here is small but looked well maintained. The breakfast was continental. Choices were cereal, muffins, Danishes, toast, apples, bananas, coffee juice, milk.
