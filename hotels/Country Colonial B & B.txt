Country Colonial B & B
Rating: 5
Text: The house has a nice antique charm to it and the owners are very friendly. They accommodated for our group of 9; when half of us weren't able to make it to the evening carriage tour they offered to change it to a morning tour and had a delicious breakfast ready for us when we returned. It was a nice experience in a small town.

Text: Quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. The sunset carriage ride is a must-see.

Text: The house was old and charming but wasn't clean. The bed sqeaked every time we moved. We were told breakfast would be at 9 am but no breakfast was made. Website stated carriage rides but none available. Very disappointed and will not return.
