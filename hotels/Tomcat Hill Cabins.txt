Tomcat Hill Cabins

Text: Best cabin in the area! My lady and I drove around in 5 mile radius couldn't find anything close to Tomcat cabin. When we stayed for only 2 night, it felt like it was our home. Very cozy place .   . I much enjoyed it! Best part was our phones didn't work. Oh and the hot tub just puts the cherry on top.

Text: I've had some of the best times down at this cabin, sitting in the hot tub, having a few beers after a long day out playing in Cedarlake

Text: My boyfriend and I along with another couple rented a cabin for a weekend. We loved it. The cabin was pretty, clean, great price, with an amsome location for the wine trail. The kitchen was fully supplied and we cook both breakfast one morning and dinner one night. Very relaxing location. This would be the first place I would try to book if we go back this summer!
