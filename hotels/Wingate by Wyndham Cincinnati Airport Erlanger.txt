Text: Nice hotel, nice staff, nice free breakfast. Used point to get the room for very cheap. Stayed in room 120, which was very noisy due to proximity to pool and lobby. Beds looked more like doubles vs the 2 queens I thought we were getting. Otherwise everything was great. Would definitely stay again.

Text: We just stopped for the night but it was very nice!   Very clean rooms, friendly staff, comfy beds and nice breakfast.   The only downfall is they don't have an elevator.

Text: Our kids loved this place!!!  The staff from the front desk to the maids are very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay awesome!  Free continental breakfast was above par and the mini-store had more than expected for a smaller hotel. We will stay here again if in the area!!!  Special thank you to Gail who made cookies (and milk) for the kids while they watched a movie in the lobby before bed!!!

Text: This was a great overnight stay, especially for the price. The room was spacious, well appointed, and felt very new. The location felt very safe - we left our moving truck in the parking lot overnight and it was fine. The hotel is at the end of a cul de sac, and all the parking is in front. I will definitely stay here when I pass through again. Overall great value, and the service was great.

Text: Staff was nice. Room was large and came with a king size bed. This location seemed to have a large breakfast but we didn't try it out. Great experience.
