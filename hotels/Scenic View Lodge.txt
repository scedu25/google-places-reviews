Scenic View Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Second year having women's retreat at this location. Beds galore, two huge meeting areas, a second appartment and a restaurant on site. Good size kitchen with all the things you need. Hot tub and picnic tables. Extremely well maintained with owner/manager on site to respond to any needs. Great place for family reunions, retreats, weekend meetings etc. and very close to Nashville, Indiana for site seeing and shopping! I definitely want to return!

Text: The Scenic View website said they were open till 9:00. We came from a stressful situation and just wanted a sandwich. Arrived at 8:03 and was quickly told they closed, even though the guy at the bar was being served. They need to update their website. Won't be back.
