Double J Campground

Text: Clean campground, level sites, most pull through from what I saw, helpful on the phone and easy night check in. Only issue was the noise from the highway. You can hear every 18 wheeler that passes. Was a cool autumn night but had to close all the windows to try and shut off the road noise to try and sleep. If this isn't an issue for you then nice spot to stay.

Text: Beautiful campground. Very well maintained and extremely clean bathrooms. Sites are long pull through  and roads are easy to maneuver for big RV's. Workers are very friendly. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area.

Text: Nice park. Well-maintained. Sites to accommodate rigs of all sizes although the spacing between sites varies and you can be quite close to your neighbor on some. Good restrooms and decent laundry. Fire pits are a negative in my opinion. When your neighbor's fire pit is only a few feet from your rig, it can get quite smoky inside depending on wind direction. Very friendly staff.
