Text: My wife and I stayed here twice last month. We found it to be a really nice place to stay. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They have redone the entire place and gotten new management. I absolutely love the pillows, I wish I knew where to get them. I would highly recommend staying here.

Text: We found the beds firm not hard as other reviews. Pillows were fluffy soft Our family slept very comfortably. Cleanliness, I would rate as high as many other doubly expensive places I have stayed. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast was ample for continental. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.

Text: It's not fancy pants. But it's very nice. Got the jacuzzi suit and it's perfect for our stay. Montauk is close by for a morning fish. And they also have a polite staff.

Text: This is the second time staying at this location. The rooms are always clean and the staff is nice. Depending on the traffic, it may get loud at night.
