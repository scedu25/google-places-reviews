Country Club Motel

Text: The hotel that nightmares are made of. Would highly recommend to those thrill seekers searching for real life experiences such as those depicted in such movies as "The Shining", "1408", or "Vacancy".  Remarkable that a business owner would neglect such basic things such as cleaning the walls, blankets, etc... and yes, there will be blood. Very charming in a "Bates" sort of way.... Well I think Bates Motel was much cleaner.  Good luck to those of you trying to save a few bucks. This hotel gets one star for price.
