Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Kearney
Rating: 5
Text: Nice, clean rooms with amenities such as microwave, refrigerator, and heat lamp in bathroom. Great value for price. Easy access to I-80 and well-lit parking. Hotel was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. Complementary breakfast was wonderful with great variety of breakfast options (make your own breakfast sandwiches, waffles, yogurt, gluten free and regular cereal, fruit, oatmeal, bagels, pastries, juice, biscuits and gravy, etc.) And breakfast area was well maintained. I look forward to my next stay and would definitely recommend this hotel!

Text: Excellent hotel! It was right off the interstate, which was nice after a LONG day of driving! There were places to eat nearby, another plus. The front desk guy was very knowledgeable and friendly and helpful, but he was also a little "robotic"...very much on auto pilot like he's been at the front desk for a long time. Of course, that's okay. The hotel was very clean. Our room was clean and comfortable. Nothing to complain about at all. The breakfast was decent and the ladies working the breakfast were helpful and friendly. I thought I left my prescription sunglasses there, so I left a message with the hotel. Someone called me back promptly and tried to find them for me; I was very pleased that I heard back and that they looked for them for me. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!

Text: Nice enough place. Small room, a little dated and smells like they are trying to mask some odour. Would not want to stay more than one night but perfectly fine if you are just passing through and need a quick place to sleep.

Text: This little hotel is great! The staff are always friendly and accommodating and the free daily breakfast is a wonderful treat! It is easy to find right at the beginning of town and has ample parking for the late arrivals. The rooms are clean and comfortable and I always appreciate the little make up remover pads that are left along with the shampoo and conditioner. I have stayed here multiple times and will always recommend it and stay again myself.

Text: While relocating from Chicago to Denver, we stopped on our long drive at the Microtel in Kearney. It was one of the only hotels in the area that didn't charge a huge fee to have a dog stay (since we were only going to be there for 12 hours, it seemed silly to pay a huge pet fee.) The Microtel had a $10 pet fee for our dog and even had treats at the front desk. Teresa at the front desk was incredibly nice and welcoming, which was appreciated after being in the car for 11 hours. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were super clean (especially given we were in a pet-friendly room - you would have never known!) It was quiet and allowed us to get a good night's sleep before hitting the road again the next morning. We also parked our moving truck in the lot, amongst a few others, and didn't feel worried about its safety at all. Would definitely recommend, especially if you have pets.
