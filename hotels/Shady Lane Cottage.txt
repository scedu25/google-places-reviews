Text: An Appalachian home away from home. It feels like home... Secluded. Safe. Well appointed and maintained. Hosts Sharon and Kenneth are the nicest of people. I WILL be back!

Text: Shady Lane Cottage is wonderful.  The beautiful and quiet country setting are perfect and just what my best friend and I needed to relax.  The minute we drove down the path to the cottage, I knew we had made a great decision.  Sharon was absolutely wonderful.  We found delicious Krispy Creme raspberry filled donuts waiting for us when we arrived.  The cottage is equipped with everything that you could ever need.  I will not stay in a hotel again when I am visiting this area.  Thanks, Sharon.
