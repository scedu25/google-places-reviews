Restwell Motel

Text: Bit too expensive for a very basic motel, they had the place under pest control except they didn't vacuumed the dead bodies.. wifi was the best I had and flatscreen with Vizio also perfect order.

Text: Over priced rooms with old furniture . Only reason they can get away with charging this much is cause they are the only hotel in this little town.

Text: You should probably stay somewhere else:

1) The WIFI is very hit or miss, told the mgmt of the motel about it and they basically said. "Oh well, nothing we can do."  They refused to let us relocate rooms or fix the wireless on the side of the motel we were staying at. 

2) The double bed rooms are crowded and tiny, (if your a big person there isn't much space to walk around

3) While I was watching TV the manager walked into the room and griped about us having the air conditioner on while the door was cracked. In an overly rude manner. 

4) While you're gone the cleaning people move your stuff in the motel.

5) When entering and exiting there is a half foot dip that will make you scrape the front of your vehicle (if you drive a car or a mini van you'll ruin the front of your vehicle)

6) There is no hair dryer, so be prepared to have wet hair

7) Also there is a roaming kitty that'll walk into your motel room and rub against your things.

You should probably stay in Ulysses, Garden City or Syracuse.
