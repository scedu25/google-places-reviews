Days Inn Sellersburg Louisville
Rating: 1
Text: Very very very very slow check Inn, rooms dilapidated... Guess I've stayed at worse places. If you are running out of options it beats sleeping in your truck.

Text: Awful, dirty, unfriendly. Room not cleaned, hairy soap in shower, door kicked in, batteries missing in smoke detector, stains everywhere, shower is a joke. Had low expectations for this stay, and this days inn didn't come close go meeting my lowest of expectations. Never, ever again would I stay here.
