Text: It is quiet and clean, that is a plus. When I first moved in we could use the pool, now we can't (only Five Seasons can use it). I own my trailer, so I can't speak for the maintenance, other than they do keep the park clean, mowed, and the streets plowed when it snows (they do block us in our driveway when plowing and we have to dig out...can't really expect different).The staff are friendly and accommodating to a point. Overall, I think it's a good place to live.
