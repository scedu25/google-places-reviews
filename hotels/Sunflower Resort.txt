Text: My husband & I have been going to Sunflower Resort for the last 15 years, with our children. 
We love staying in their very clean comfortable suites.
The units are spacious, well equipped 
& clean.
We appreciate the fact that it's family owned. They are  on premises to address any concerns or just  make sure we are comfortable.
It's has a million dollar view for very reasonable prices.
We have access to their dock which is very well kept.
Our family has now grown, and we continue to take our vacations at SR.
Happy LS

Text: I've been going to Sunflower Resort for several years. I always enjoy my stay. It's not fancy, but the place is quiet, clean, and the owners are really nice. It's a perfect, affordable, low-key mini-vaca.

Text: I grew up going to Sunflower Resort and returned to reminisce as an adult. I was happy to see the place looked like I remembered. Reuben and Traci keep it very clean and were extremely friendly. This is a very basic resort but that's what I loved about it. And for the price, what do you expect? We had friends with us so we took up three units. We were all happy and will come back again.
