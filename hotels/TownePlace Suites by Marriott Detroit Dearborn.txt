TownePlace Suites by Marriott Detroit Dearborn
Rating: 4
Text: The location is good. Very quite area of town. Staff were friendly. The rooms were slightly dated but nothing that would make the experience bad. The two bed room is a great option for business travellers who are looking for privacy and to get work done.

Text: Overall a decent stay. Staff was friendly and responsive. The room (single queen with pull-out couch and kitchenette) was nice but felt cramped with the TV oddly placed in the walkway to the bed. The breakfast facility was far too small with people sitting in armchairs or computer kiosks to eat. I was also disappointed that they couldn't find any toothbrushes at the front desk when I realized I forgot mine. Bottom line: Not a bad experience but didn't meet my expectations for a Marriott property.

Text: Very pleasant, helpful staff. Upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite. Very nice accommodations exactly where we needed to be. Have stayed here before & will stay here again.

Text: New rooms, very spacious, semi limited parking near rooms, so you may have to walk a bit from your parking.
