Howard Johnson Inn Nicholasville/Lexington

Text: Overall i agree with some of the posts, if you are looking for a room that is up to date with esthetics this is not the place for you. However if you're looking for something that is affordable, clean and management makes sure you are comfortable than this is the place you want to go. The owner, let me see the room before i reserved it, not many places do that. He was very nice and apologized that i had a small wait for him to come down from the second floor.  Overall my stay was great, i have no complaints. Only reason i did not give 5 stars. Is because no place is truly perfect.

Text: This isn't s Howard Johnson. Its.now independently owned and goes by  a different name. 

It seemed decent enough until we found bed bugs in our room.

Text: It is a decent place. Rooms were a bit dated but overall cleanly. Cheapest place I could find at a weekly rate. Would stay here again.

Text: Reserved a room on Expedia for $60 for 1 night. I showed up, nobody was behind the counter, so I rang the bell on the counter. This homeless looking guy in flip flops came down and immediately started arguing about how we never reserved a room, and that he doesn't honor the $60 per night price that is on Expedia. Also, he explained that he is no longer affiliated with Howard Johnson. Ended up paying $85 for the night. The guy was a real ass, and I didn't want to give him my money, but every hotel room at the neighboring hotels were booked, so we bit the bullet and stayed there. I do not recommend this place at all. It smelled like bad air fresheners and old curry. It was hot and humid, and it was not very clean. Stains all over the bed, and just not a nice place overall.
