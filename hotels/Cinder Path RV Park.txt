Text: the city runs the park. So there is no one on site. the cost is $15 a day for full hookups. It is still maintained and quite. The way you pay is they provide a envelope and you put your money in the envelope then in a metal box.

Text: Very quiet little park and town. Can't figure out how to pay or how much. Assuming someone will come around to collect. It's full hookups.
