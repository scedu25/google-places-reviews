Americas Best Value Inn York
Rating: 3
Text: Facilities were one story older and small but clean. Breakfast was adequate. Room was okay with No Frills or much space. It was fairly distant from the freeway. It seemed a little bit overpriced for the facilities. The night clerk was very helpful and very friendly.
Rating: 4
Text: Decent room, but hard to find outlets. Liked that they had soap dispensers in the bathroom rather than bar soap. Not a great breakfast selection.

Text: Standard inexpensive roadside motel fare. Seems like they might be trying to modernize, but they've got a long way to go. Service is hit or miss. Good homemade cinnamon rolls at breakfast.

Text: Door key card worked only about every 8th time.  Annoying with your hands full trying to get inside.  Breakfast claims are overrated.  Toilet seat wouldn't stay up, which the clean staff would know, but wasn't replaced.  Electric outlet on desk lamp was loose, could be dangerous.

Text: Under New Management. We usually stay here going back and forth to see family, but not anymore. The new management barely speak English and misspelled my contact info so we never received any information after calling in our reservation. When we had to cancel our reservation they stated they now have a 24hr cancellation policy. I can assure you they did not have this policy when we stayed previously. It was up to 6PM the day of. Manager refused to help even after admitting he had our info wrong. He says it's not his problem. Thanks "Mike" I guess that's what ratings are for. One Star.
