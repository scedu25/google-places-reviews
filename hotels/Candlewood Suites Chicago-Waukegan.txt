Candlewood Suites Chicago-Waukegan

Text: Not a bad Hotel. Because it is an extended stay, the rooms are a bit larger with full sized refrigerators and a two burner stove top and microwave. With that said one shouldn't expect a bar or restaurant on premises. Rooms are clean but room service is not daily. Good for people that sleep in and forget to hang the DND on the door. Bad for those that want someone else to make and turn down the bed daily. The staff is friendly.

Text: I was here from Thursday to Saturday to attend the graduation of the recent navy graduation. My wife graduated! I'm so proud of her! Anyways in regards to the hotel, it was perfect! Got there and realized I had accidentally reserved a smoking room, I don't smoke but the lady at the counter was very understanding and got me switched to a non smoking room. 
The room itself was awesome! Full size fridge, really comfortable bed and a warm shower. My wife loved it as well and even though she didn't get a chance to spend the night there, she still loved the bed to take a nap :)

Text: Very clean hotel with large size rooms, nice furniture, clean bathrooms and nice kitchen!! Minutes away from Naval Station Great Lakes if you're in town visiting your sailor. Conveniently near Walmart and restaurants, also minutes away from the Gurnee Mills area for more shopping and entertainment! Very friendly staff willing to help and comfort every guest! I definitely recommend this hotel!!!
