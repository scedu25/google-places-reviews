Text: The room was pretty outdated minus the big flat screen TV in the room. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The facilities were relatively clean though, so there is that. Didn't eat in the restaurant or use the pool.

Text: It looks like this place was build in the 50 and has not seen a coat of paint since then.  I wish these people who come over here from the far East would realize we DO NOT live in a third world county and leaving their hotels run down is just not acceptable.
