Text: Very clean. Staff is awesome. Breakfast is good. Room is awesome. Outlets on lamps don't work. Lights on timers. Noisy a/c. We were on 5th floor. Nice pool. Didn't try exercise room.

Text: Very clean room & comfortable bed! The staff were super friendly (the front desk manager is so nice!), and there were no issues with my stay. Very nice rooms - especially for the price!

Text: Decent rooms, typical holiday inn which, is not a bad thing. They’ve got a standard and this one meets it. Only problem that’s consistent no matter what room I’ve had (low floor, near middle or far ends or higher floor), the WiFi signal is weak which causes it to be really slow. I get that it’s free and it won’t be like home but, it’s nearly useless as it currently stands.

Text: Very peaceful and relaxing getaway! The staff was extremely kind and made us feel like we were definitely at our home away from home!

Text: Fantastic rooms.  Had a separate sitting area with a couch, a breakfast nook with 2 barstools, and a desk and desk chair.  Great space and basic bathroom.  Mattresses need to be updated...it was hard.  But, everything was clean, well taken take of and looked nice.  Check in and out was pleasant.  Would recommend for any groups.  Easy in/out access for downtown events.  Nice neighborhood adjacent to hwy 70.
