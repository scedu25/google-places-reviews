Text: Worst stay I've ever had. Manager swore at me, staff ignored me, bathrooms and showers do not get cleaned, and they are only open when the staff feel like letting other's use them.

Text: Paid for a spot that had showers, bathroom, laundry. But they didnt. They shut them down because they didnt want to clean them. For the day they were actually open, it was disgusting. And when i said "hey, i paid for a spot that had a bathroom and ahower and laundry room" the owner straight up said "to hell with me" absolute ripoff.
