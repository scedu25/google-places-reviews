Text: So when I first got there due to the element around the place I said to my husband oh my god this looks like a meth hotel only to find out those were the people running it while I was checking in they guy in front of me was was checked into a  room with people already in it that should have been my first warning then when I got checked and went to the room I couldn't get in then a second time I still couldn't get it at that point I refused to stay at that Nasty place the doors won't open and the walkway was plywood I learned a valuable lesson tonight never book a room without reading the reviews first for the love of God please dont stay here

Text: IF you are a drug addict its the place for you. Place including staff ARE meth addicts. Staff goes through your personal belongings. NO CLEAN TOWELS for a week. Toilets don't flush. Police there daily.  Owner just doesn't seem to care. They can't get any decent staff they say.....Pay better and maybe. We were told meth capital of the U.S.A.

Text: Worst place I've ever witnessed.. Almost had us walk into a room that was already occupied.. talk about awkward. Then got us a different room and it smelt like mold and beds cracked when we sat on them. Lets just say we ended up leaving and getting a room somewhere else.. FYI never go here!

Text: I worked here about 8 months ago as the housekeeper. The owner Kenny doesn't like changing the sheets if they don't look dirty or if they  looked like they were barely slept in. Rupen likes to work you as if you were a slave. I did everything that wasn't required of me as a housekeeper. They are very rude people.  They are very money hungry people. As well as being very racist, they really hate Mexicans the most. They paid me one free room and $100 a week to work 12 plus hours a day. Please don't go to this hotel. You never know if your sheets are actually clean, nor if your towels are clean as well.
