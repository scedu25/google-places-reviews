Residence Inn by Marriott St. Louis O'Fallon

Text: Our family took advantage of a King suite with a fireplace. Spacious, clean comfortable. Breakfast is good and the evening social gathering food is good. We booked using Marriott rewards points, what a great deal!! Local restraunts are close. Only a 30 minute drive into St. Louis, we will stay again!

Text: Front desk wasn't very friendly. Something I would expect from a cheap motel, not a place like this. I would never visit this place again. They should welcome you and act more professional. Bed wasn't very comfortable. Pool looked cloudy, witch isn't safe can't see the bottom. So I didn't go in.
Breakfast was not fresh. Horrible display. Not clean around food area. They do not care about there guest. It shows!!!
The best part about this place was cracker barrel being so close.......were I got my fresh hot breakfast before checkout:)

Text: Very nice hotel and pretty cheap if staying for a decent amount of time. Right across the street from a QuikTrip so if you need to grab anything you don't have to go hunting just a quick walk to one of the nicest gas stations around.

Text: The room is great, love the set up and the size, perfect for our visit. The staff had been great, all very nice and accommodating. Our tv wasn't working properly, and the maintenance guy (Devin?) Was very nice and able to fix the issue quickly. The only complaint we have had is the breakfast meat was cold and the fruit was gone, bit everything else had been fantastic so far! Would definitely stay here again

Text: The suites are spacious and homey. Sleep on the Sealy mattress was good and the buffet style breakfast was second to none.
