Text: The hotel was nice and every staff member we came into contact with was very friendly. The two negative things I'd have to say about our visit are that the sheets were never changed in our room during the 5 days we stayed there and the tile floor in the pool area looked pretty nasty and in need of some help duty cleaning. Even with this, our room was nice and we really enjoyed the centralized location. It was perfect for us to enjoy Blink that just happened to be going on during our stay. We also really enjoyed the short walk to several restaurants and bars nearby.

Text: My stay was fantastic. One of the most comfortable bed and pillow I have ever stayed in. The place was extremely clean and the hotel bar was quick with the drinks and food. Would highly recommend.

Text: Great hotel. Nice rooms. Nice hotel bar. Free refills on coffee in shop on first floor. Stayed here for a long weekend when my brother got married. Everyone loved the hotel.

Text: I had a very pleasant experience at this location. The staff was very accommodating and professional. I highly recommend staying here for any even or occasion, expecially if you are going to be around the Square. Also, the views were fantastic

Text: The gentleman who checked us in wasn't too notch. He didn't smile, or offer to tell me anything about the hotel and it was my first time here. I had to ask any questions.
The room was mediocre. Needed some updating. Bed and pillows were comfortable! 
Location, though...!! Perfect! Right next to fountain square where there was nightly entertainment!
All in all a great weekend! Will definitely stay here again!
