The Peninsula Chicago
Rating: 5
Text: As always, The Peninsula is beautifully appointed, beautifully run and beautifully located. Our room on the 16th floor was quiet and clean, very comfortable for a good night's sleep. We appreciate how each and ever person working here greets you with a smile and a pleasantry. They manage to maintain the appearance and amenities of the highest-end hotels while also being down-to-earth and friendly. The Peninsula will remain our top choice for our stays in Chicago.

Text: I just remembered how nice this place is. A friend from college envied me for lunch. M Main lobby dining area is absolutely fantastic!!! It is everything you would expect, and more, from a Peninsula Hotel. Great wine choices are handpicked for the meal selections. My steak was truly phenomenal when surrounded by some of Chicago's best Steak Houses!! I highly recommend and will be back!!

Text: Invited to lunch at the lobby restaurant of this 5-star luxury hotel. Food, service, venue - all impeccable. Vegans: the day I was there, they were able to do a roasted corn and mushroom risotto that was out of this world. And, then, they told me they had an assortment of vegan pastries available for desert. I could not believe it how accommodating they were. They also have an incredible rooftop bar/restaurant: Shanghai Terrace. This place isn't cheap, but if you're planning a special anniversary or something, it's incredible.
