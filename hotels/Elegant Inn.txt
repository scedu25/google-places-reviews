Text: The family running the place was very nice, good people. For that they get the 3 stars customer service is half the battle. Unfortunately the hotel itself wasn't in the best condition. It was mostly clean. Except under the bed where for some reason was a pile of leaves, so that's confusing. The WiFi was less than great and at no fault of the people running the place the location was not grand. A good spot for in a pinch like I was.

Text: Their website says they have an outdoor pool. That is not true. There is one nearby but it belongs to the campground next door and is for Campground guests only

Text: Worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  The 3rd room I tried had some heat.  Little baseboard heaters; when it's 8 degrees outside the heating was very inadequate.  I'm hoping not to have any bites on me when I wake up. I should have drive the extra miles.  DO NOT STAY HERE.

Text: Horrible.  Bed bugs everywhere.  Smell of must & mold is overwhelming.  Beds are as comfortable as the concrete floor.  6 tv channels.  Temperature control unit is absolutely filthy.  Owners don't speak any english.  What's breakfast?  Do yourself a favor & drive 6 miles west & pay the extra $5 a night for remodeled rooms, full breakfast & satellite TV.
