Text: We came here from Florida to flee from Hurricane Irma. We got here very late and the staff was very nice and helpful. We got a clean room right away and they welcomed our two small dogs. The room was modern and nice and the outside parking lot and surrounding areas are very clean, and close to tons of restaurants and supermarket. Thanks again, we will back soon!

Text: There's alot of workers staying there most of the time.  It's a decent affordable place.  Just alot of men hanging around outside, as a woman, if I were single I would feel a little uncomfortable being outside at night.  The staff are friendly and helpful and it's a nice place to stay!

Text: Clean. Smells good. Large HD TV, huge bathrooms, allows pets with a $10 charge, close to restaurants and convenience stores, reasonable rates, wifi, refrigerator and microwave in room, no trace of bed bugs. Would have been 5 stars except was a little noisy, but it WAS the 4th of July.
