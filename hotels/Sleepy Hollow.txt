Text: We stayed in unit G, and it was not very clean. First day we got there, there was sand already in our sheets - left from someone else obviously! Not many staples provided in the kitchen, no filters for the coffee machine, no sugar, 1/2 a roll of paper towels, etc. A door mat would have also been helpful to combat the sand from getting everywhere. They do provide chairs at the beach area, but umbrellas would be a nice touch instead of having to lug your own up and down the 80+ stairs. Also, no shower at top of beach stairs to rinse off the sand! Not worth the money, in my opinion.

Text: The grounds are beautiful, and there are plenty of amenities. The private beach access is also fantastic. I stayed in 37a and was not impressed, it was very different from the other cottages. It was dirty and smelled odd. I'm sure if I had stayed in another cottage, it would have been much nicer but that was just not the case

Text: While the place may be really cool new ownership and fired the whole staff to hire new at lower wages now that's not cool will not be going plenty of other campgrounds in west Michigan
