Text: Was told that my family would be able to camp together by the lady at the gate, then a tallish man white grayish/white hair driving several different vehicles who is employed there was threatening me, calling me boy (I am not a child), & overall made my family have a less enjoyable experience. This man is on a power trip. He would not tell me what his name was. This man needs fired.
