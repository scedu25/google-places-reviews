Hampton Inn Chicago/Tinley Park
Rating: 4
Text: Decent place and clean rooms. Friendly staff with pool and hot tub. Been here several times with no problems except my first visit. The toilet didn't flush properly...so annoying. Front desk offered to switch rooms but I declined because it was late night, exhausted and there was a hallway bathroom conveniently outside our door. It was just a quick overnight stay. Hollywood Casino Amphitheater is very close by along with gas stations and fast food restaurants.

Text: Older hotel but upgrades have been made. Price was super right for the area. WiFi was great which is a big deal. Staff was amazing. Room was smaller ten I'm used too but TV was huge. They have upgraded that. Only knock is no TV channel guide. Seems small but I travel a lot

Text: The hotel was beautiful, very modern and comfy. The room itself was clean and the bed was wonderful. I'd stay here again.

Text: Checked in on Friday night and there was a slight change of plans w our room due to a wedding  booking that was cancelled and then immediately remade. Our reservation was made in that small window so we were bumped to another floor. Not a big deal at all but the two women at the desk we're so sweet, apologetic and over accommodating that I'm positive if any real issue arose it would have been resolved quickly and efficiently. Very clean room and warm, friendly atmosphere.

Text: Nice room, the pullout couch bed had some popcorn in it, so I'm not sure how clean it was. No complaints. Breakfast was good.
