Hampton Inn Ottumwa
Rating: 4
Text: Really excellent Ottumwa hotel. Only not 5 Star because it's not 4 Seasons style. Friendly staff, building clean and well maintained, full cooked breakfast. Convenient to food and shopping. My family and I were very happy for 4 days visiting relatives. Would stay here every time.

Text: Hot tub and pool were not working which is one of the primary reasons I stayed here. Had very inconvenient issues with the wifi. from which I was treated with disrespect (I could hear the shift manager in the back room mention I was"wrong"). This woman was also wearing an unprofessional t-shirt when I went through the lobby again.  The curtains in the room were unable to close all the way so light from the parking lot was getting into my room all night.  The clock was 20 minutes off in my room so I was late to my meeting the following morning.

Text: The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean. The spa in the pool room had been drained and emptied so that was super disappointing. The pool was full of screaming kids think they were having a birthday party or something. You could not even here yourself have a conversation with anyone next to you.  The fitness room was nice had some free weights and cardio equipment. Breakfast was like any other hotel a decent variety to choose from. I had heard rumors about bedbugs but we didn't see anything like that at all. I gave it a 3 because the spa being down.
