Text: It's a nice area to have picnics, shelters cost money to use. They have a few tent like areas that you can pay or reserve on the beach area. A diving board and one small wood plank to rest on. Trails too and grills to cook on.. A small snack shop. They only negative part is they have young kids who really don't know customer service skills. Life Guards are on duty as well.

Text: This Quarry entertains both The Young and the old. It entertains The easily bored and easily occupied simultaneously. One of the greatest features is the beach for all of the little toddlers and those who dont want to delve into the deep which is something that you aren't afforded at most quarries. Another great thing about the Quarry is that there are many great and well-kept picnic tables and grills that are functional and not falling apart which is always a plus if you're the type that likes to throw on the barbecue for mealtime. Also if you are the type that likes to pack the sandwiches and chips and go, there is a very affordable snack shop that has candies, chips, popcorn, sodas, and multiple drinks for you to add to the Ensemble that you carried on with you. It is a very welcoming environment.
On top of everything else mentioned there is a wonderful, shade covered playground for the kids with swing sets, slides,  climbing apparatuses, and other fun things for the children to enjoy all set atop soft mulch and complete with benches for the parents to sit on all sides and watch their children safely play. Also, for the active and sports oriented crowd, there is a volleyball net set up on the far end of the park that will allow for plenty of fun for all.
Now if your main interest is just sitting back and basking in the Sun or sitting back and relaxing in the shade, there's an opportunity for both on the long and far Beach that leads up to the water, where they have sun shades setup for multiple people to set underneath and protect themselves from the Sun and plenty of open area for those who love to bask in the Sun and color their skin to a beautiful golden color or even a painful shade of red. This is a recreational area that was very well thought out.
I would also like to add That there are several shelter houses available on the property, some closer to the water some not so close to the water, to accommodate parties and family get-togethers and just plain old large groups enjoying the day. So whether you're young or old, want to be super active or to just chill and relax, entertaining yourself or entertaining your children, or just plain looking for something fun to do with friends or family or all by yourself, you couldn't ask for a better combination of Quarry, Beach, Sun shelter, Park, volleyball, BBQ, picnic bench, and snack shop to accommodate whatever you'll need to make or complete a great memory! Please be sure to visit and have a great time!
