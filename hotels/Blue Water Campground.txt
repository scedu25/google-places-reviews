Text: Great family oriented place to kick back and relax.  Plenty of things for the kids to play on pool and small arcade room.  Clean up to date shower house and more

Text: My daughter and son in law camped at Bluewater for 15 years. This past year was horrible for them. The owner totally changed. He became vindictive, rude and scary. They were harassed every weekend they were there. When they decided to go to another campground the harassment got worse. Tuesday night we all went to the campground to take the remaining items. The owner put a lock on the hitch of the camper. The police were called to get it removed. The owners were impossible to deal with!   As parents we are older and wasn't sure what he would do.  I would NOT recommend this campground to anyone.

Text: Love this campground, it's quieter than those near it, great for kids and families.  Camped here for 3 years and was NEVER bothered by screaming drunks (though nearby campgrounds are FULL of drunken idiots) as recent review states.  Book a site for your next family camping trip, you won't be disappointed!
