3 Margaritas
Rating: 5
Text: From someone who lived just a few hours from Mexico and grew up on true, authentic Mexican food, I can honestly say I have never been more pleased since moving. The food was amazing and the service was great. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant. I felt like I was back home in Arizona. 10/10, will definitely dine again!

Text: This is a great Mexican restaurant! Their food is always delicious their margaritas are delicious and a little over priced. We've been waited on by most all of the wait staff and they're all courteous..there is with some of them a language barrier.  I do recommend 3 Margaritas as long as you are willing to scrutinize the checkout process. 
Open till 10:30 Friday and Saturday. 9pm Sunday-Wednesday.

Text: Terrible experience. Took waiter 10 minutes to get to our table well there is 4 or 5 tables in restaurant. He comes and takes our drink order and takes another 10 minutes to come take our food order. Went with a group of 4. Not one of our orders was correct, then proceeds to tell us we ordered the wrong food. Didn't bother to offer to remake anything. Gave a minimal tip for the terrible experience and the owner has the nerve to ask why we only tipped that much. What a joke of an establishment. Not sure how this place is even open with service like that. Will never be back again and if you want proper service, I certainly would not go here.

Text: They had bland food, bad service, and over priced. The only reason they get two stars is i love the decor in there. But sadly i will never go again.

Text: I lived in Arizona close to the Mexico border and I've had good Mexican food. I moved to stl and I haven't had truly good meal like this in a long time.  This was fantastic, the enchilada alone was worth it, nice and cheesy and sauce was just like I remember. Big meals for the price. Everything was just excellent!
