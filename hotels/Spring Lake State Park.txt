Spring Lake State Park
Rating: 4
Text: This is a beautiful park. I camped here in early fall. The geese were fun to watch and it only cost $15 per night in 2017! Showers were very clean and had plenty of hot water and water pressure. Ample sized camping spots.

Text: I have camped hiked and enjoyed spring lake, the Greene county conservation board oversees the sites managing ranger, I noticed many reviewers mentioning difficulty in contacting the Ranger, the site is very busy year around if you want to rent a shelter or a cabin contact Green county conservation board at the court house in Jefferson they will assist you, leaving messages on a 1970 era tape machine in the Rangers office is at best pointless. It's a gorgeous park open for public use, please call the proper people!

Text: We love Spring Lake.  We stay here several weeks out of the spring,  summer and fall.  Usually two weeks at a time.   It's spacious and beautiful.  We love having the beach,  concession stand and the skating rink all in one place.  The kids can safely ride their bikes and explore the park with no worries.  If I had one wish,  it would be to have water hydrants scattered among sites so a person could just hook up a hose and refill their holding tank.
Spring Lake is a real gem for Greene County.  We're lucky to have a beautiful park like this so close to home to enjoy whenever we want.
