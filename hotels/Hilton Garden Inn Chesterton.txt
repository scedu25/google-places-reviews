Text: I have to say I was surprised by how friendly the staff is. I had a great experience. Mia! Mia! Mia! She was the BEST! I came down for breakfast and asked to soy or dairy free milk. They didn't have it BUT the NEXT day she made sure they had Almond Milk just me little ole me! What a great staff they have here

Text: Location was convenient and easy to find. Our room was spacious, spotless, and comfortable, and the staff were happy and helpful. Pool and workout room were well equipped and clean. A few bucks more than the others locally, but worth it for a problem free stay.

Text: Nice hotel.  Staff is wonderful.   My toilet was broken,  they came to fix it and it broke again,  not good.   Stains on the bed spread.    the room setup is not good,  the bathroom door is to close to the room door.   No towels in the pool area.  The breakfast was ok.  The surrounding area is very nice.   I will not visit again.   Many hotels priced the same with better experiences.

Text: Staff was friendly and the room was well kept and clean. The bathroom in the double bed room was small but still functional. The breakfast is not included. Costs $9.95 plus taxes and gratitude. It is a all you can eat buffet. My party and I decided to go to the Bob Evans right next door instead.

Text: Food was good. Not much interaction with staff so I am neutral. I was there for a seminar so only in a conference room-clean. Restroom was very clean & nice.
