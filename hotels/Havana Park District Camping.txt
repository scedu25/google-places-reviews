Havana Park District Camping
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here in early March as my husband was in town hunting snow geese. We absolutely loved this city park! It was our first time staying in a city park and there was so much to do and see, especially for our kids. The campground is located right next to the Illinois River and has wonderful views of the river itself. The park is a quick walk away, with two playgrounds, picnic areas, a walking trail and an amazing view of the town's bridge. There are 12 sites here, with electrical and water hook ups. Since we were here in the off-season, we did not have water hook ups or restroom facilities as both were closed off for the season, so if you plan to come during the off-season make sure you come equipped with water and restroom facilities. A quick driver over the town's bridge takes you to the heart of the Illinois wildlife country. The Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge is about a 10 minute drive from the campground and is worth a visit. It's unreal! The amound of waterfowl we saw wasa incredible and we were fortunate to see 10 eagles over the course of the weekend. We will definitely be staying in this campground when we return to the area. This little town knows how to utilize it's riverfront and the outskirts of town are just beautiful.
