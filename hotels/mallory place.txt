Text: I lived here for a year and a half. Upon move in it was not clean and was infested with roaches. I spent my own money getting rid of the bugs. The maintenance man never showed up to fix anything. There were leaks above windows that water flooded through when it rained. And now that I've moved out they are charging me $255 when I left that place looking better than it did when I moved in.
