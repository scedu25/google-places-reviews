The Cabins and Cottages at Shale Lake
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed in cabin 1 with 2 girlfriends for a girl's weekend. I loved our view of the lake from the screened-in porch. The cabin itself was much smaller than I'd thought. I slept with the ceiling a foot from my face. Needless to say I didn't sleep well. We found 1 trail from the winery to the cabins, which was really pretty. Wish we knew where more were. There's a canoe to use (get oars from the front office), which was really fun. It was perfect to get away from the kids and enjoy peace and quiet. I'd never stay more than one night bc there's not much to do. The price is too steep to take the kids but they'd like it for a night. Otherwise Susan was super nice and didn't rush us out, which makes her 5 stars, the place a solid 4.
