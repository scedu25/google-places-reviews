Text: Clean but old, could use new bedding and better lighting. Only hotel I've stayed in with a celing fan and pull string light. It could use a good cleaning like the chairs were dusty. I would not stay here again.

Text: The tv was broken, no shampoo, smells like ammonia, looks like boogers all over bathroom walls. Housekeeper literally smokes while he cleans and barged into my room at 9am without knocking. May have been better off sleeping in my car. The cemetery out back was nice.
