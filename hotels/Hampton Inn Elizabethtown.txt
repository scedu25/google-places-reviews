Hampton Inn Elizabethtown

Text: Megan, the Manager here is awesome. She was friendly and accommodating on our unexpected arrival from Florida. We were part of the population that was evacuated from SW Florida due to Hurricane Irma, and Megan made us feel so welcome. She made sure we had everything we needed. This hotel is clean, comfortable, and the location was easy to navigate. We would stay here again without hesitation and highly recommend this location to anyone travelling through Elizabethtown, Kentucky.

Text: Don’t try to get out of a reservation less than 48 hours in advance. They will shut you down and say “you have to give us 48 hours notice. Period.” Yet, I was at SEVERAL Hampton inns in the past 6 months and have been able to change/cancel with less time. Most others understand travel plans change. I stay over 100 nights at a Hilton property each year...Guess it’s time to think about moving to Marriott properties.

Text: Great hotel. Although it is older, the property has been well maintained and updated. Room was clean and comfy. Only complaint was the TV was a bit on the small side.

Text: Love Hampton Inn. Clean comfy rooms. Good convenient breakfast. Pleasant, concerned staff.  Join hhonors. Fantastic military discount. This particular time, my bill went from $169 basic to $91 basic. Most I have ever got at any hotel. I am ecstatic.

Text: We spent the night here and loved it!  We had a great experience from the moment we called to book a room all the way thru to check out.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The whole hotel was clean and very stylish in it's decor. The pool was heated and the gym is next door.  The hotel is in the middle of a lot of great restaurants.  Breakfast was served from 6 to 10 and it was delicious.  Waffles, eggs sausage,  juice,  fruit,  bagels,  pastries,  oatmeal,  and cereal.  Plenty of coffee too! The staff was awesome!  Priscilla and Eva were so warm and friendly.  The young man on night shift,  I didn't get his name,  checked us several times as we sat with friends in the very comfortable lounge. Tiffany had left a note and mint the room after cleaning it. We will stay here again!  Military rate is incredible!!!
