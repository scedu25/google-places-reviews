Text: stayed here for two nights while in town for a friend's wedding and it was great! i don't stay at hotels often anymore but i was pleasantly surprised to find that my room had a full size kitchen and small kitchenette with utensils and dishes and pots and everything! it was very convenient. especially since they offer a free shuttle to and from the airport. would recommend.

Text: The picture of this hotel is very deceiving!  It looks NOTHING like the picture!!  Our room was clean, and the staff was friendly, but the lobby is incredibly small and our stay was terrible mainly because the room was so permeated with smoke that it was actually difficult to breathe!! Maybe the top floor is different than the lower floors.  I woke up during the night and couldn't get back to sleep just because I was worried I'd get sick from breathing in all the smoke!  I've never written a bad review for a hotel before, but felt I had to because I wish someone had written something to keep us from staying there!!

Text: This  is an extended stay hotel  and it more than serves the  purpose  for long visits.  It's  as if one is at home with a small kitchen and free laundry room. The fitness room is great and there is a small commissary for quick snacks.  Your stay is not interrupted every day with maid service.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  It is a very quiet building, sound-proofed, rarely can you hear any planes flying overhead. It is very close to major shopping malls, the airport,  and connecting expressways.  Very happy  with the accommodations.

Text: This hotel is great! My room was clean, and everything was in its place. There is a workout facility, which was awesome! Free laundry and WiFi. I can’t complete the review without mentioning the front desk staff and her name was Nicole. Delightful, professional, and had a make it happen attitude. It was nice to have a friendly face greet me after a horribly, hectic day. I will stay here again.

Text: Anthony at front desk was amazing!! Best customer service we've had at any hotel in a long time. Room was recently remodeled? Well organized layout. Bed was great, pillows were hard. Rain falling from roof on to our room heat and a/c unit kept us up a lot overnight.
