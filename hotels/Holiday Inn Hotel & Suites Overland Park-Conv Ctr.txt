Text: Was this hotel recently remodeled? I had some people telling me not to stay here... They were wrong the rooms were great, but the front desk was the best! I forgot my phone charger and the awesome lady working the front desk let me use hers overnight!

Text: The hotel itself (rooms, parking, pool, etc) are nice, however anything above your room are very expensive for a Holiday Inn. I booked a room here on points, which I acknowledge did not include breakfast, however as a Spire Elite member, they still didn't include it as a courtesy. I went for breakfast one morning and dropped $20 (pre-tip), for a scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, orange juice, and coffee. Their breakfast buffet is $10, for what is complementary at every Holiday Inn Express chain I have stayed at.

Text: Great service here. They give you a free breakfast buffet and one free drink voucher when you arrive. Though the buffet is quite limited it's nice to have it for free. The free WiFi is blazing fast! Rooms are very clean and cool. Typically very quiet when I stay here. Overall it's always been a good place to rest for the night.

Text: So far, so good. I have 4 nights left here, but the room is clean and the staff has been helpful and friendly. We have received clean sheets and towels after the first night. I have no complaints.

Text: This hotel all depends on what you are looking for. The room was nice and clean, so would be okay for a quick stay. For the rate you pay though it's not worth the cost long term. I was traveling for business so I stayed almost 2 weeks. The Wifi was terrible at night. I had to go somewhere just to get work done. The staff was marginal at best. Not much to write home about.
