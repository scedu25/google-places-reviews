Cottonwood Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We are frequent campers here. We have camped half of the state of Michigan and Cottonwood has always been our favorite.  It's right here in our home town,  yet we don't feel like it when we are here.  The staff is wonderful and it's very family orientated. The kids just love it and the campground is all self contained. So convenient.  Very clean.  Just a fun place!

Text: Very basic campground. Fine place to park when in the area for work, but certainly not a destination or vacation campground. Bathrooms were nice. Happy the pool was still open when it was 93 degrees outside after Labor Day, but the pool wasn't heated. I'm pretty sure there are people living in tents here. Ponds and creek we're gross and unusable. Again, very basic place to park.

Text: Great Staff! Clean park! Much bigger than we thought! Great trails in the back. Nice pool. And it was fun seeing the softball games. Best of all, it was so close to where I was working in Lansing! We are going back next year! (Pictures are from a nearby biking trail)

Text: Friendly staff.  If you have company over there is a $2 per person charge and if you use heat or air conditioner there is another charge. This should all be included in camping fees.  This is why I rated it a 3 srar. Kayak and pedal boat rentals at reasonable prices. Trail to walk. Convenient to shopping, restaurants.

Text: Great place to stay..lots of families...very friendly.  Camped on lake...kayaked from our site.  Excellent bathrooms.  Pool for kids.  Great bike trail very close.  They even clean your fire pits!   A gem in the middle of the city....and quiet.
