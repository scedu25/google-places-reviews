Guggisberg Swiss Inn
Rating: 5
Text: So nice and calming, the music was relaxing and it was nice to see the horses outside. They served really good hot breakfast. You can feed the ducks by the pond which is nice and relaxing. The people there are so nice and the rooms were nice. There is wine sample's there as well.

Text: We stayed at the Inn on Friday evening. We enjoyed our stay very much. The music was really nice and relaxing. The grounds were beautiful. The breakfast was awesome. The only thing that needs improvement in my opinion is the bedding in the room. It is very dated and may put some of your guests off. Other than that the room was clean and comfortable.

Text: Beautiful quaint hotel in the town of Millersburg which is full of swiss culture. Loved driving up to the hotel seeing horses all over the entrance and front lawn. Older rooms but extremely clean and staff was fantastic. They offered a very good hot breakfast and snacks before bedtime. They also had wine tasting at the hotel, which gave my husband and I opportunity to taste the local wines. I cant wait to come here again, just a wonderful getaway with tons of local shops and eateries to keep you satisfied.
