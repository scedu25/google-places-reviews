Americas Best Value Inn - Heath/Newark

Text: This used to be a decent motel until they remodeled. Now it feels like an army barracks.  No carpet, fake wood floors. Rooms echo with every step you make. Bathroom was dirty. Construction workers sitting outside their rooms drinking heavily. Very uncomfortable situation for a single woman

Text: This place is terrible. The non smoking room smelled like an ashtray, the toilet, and the neighbors, worked intermittently, there was a patched hole in the floor with plywood and what appeared to be drug deals in the parking lot. No breakfast as advertised and a poor black kitty that someone literally chopped it's tall off and broke it's back leg, crying for food outside our room.

Text: You get what you pay for.  Very basic room, although the room did have a microwave, coffee maker and a mini fridge that was plugged in but not very cold. Breakfast was coffee, bread for toast, and packaged sweet roll.

Text: I just left there a few days ago.  Was there for 13 days.  KATHY at the front desk was the nicest Lady and always was smiling, no matter what I asked.  MITCHELL, whom I booked the room via the phone was the perfect gentlemen.  After reading reviews before I got there, was thinking, oh boy on the room.  BUT, when we entered the room, all was great.  Was clean, bathroom was totally clean, had enough towels, soap and all was neat.  Saw no bugs, except for the ones around the light outside.  The floor was well cleaned and nothing on floor from previous people.  Everyone, from housekeeping staff to maintainence and the front desk we above the call of being friendly.  WILL I GO BACK THERE,  YES I WILL and thank you all there for Our nice stay.  ;-)
