Text: Rooms were clean. Beds were fine. Friendly service. No continental breakfast, but a restaurant is downstairs. Small pool. Good location right off the interstate. Plenty of food/shopping about 5-10min south.

Text: All staff were very nice and helpful. The food for breakfast was great. I didn't like not having a fan in the bathroom. But it was also cool to find a geocache in their lot.

Text: Hilton is a very good hotel. It's in a good location and is near to downtown Chicago. The service is excellent and the staff is great and courteous. We didn't get a chance to see the rooms.
