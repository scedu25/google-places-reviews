Text: Stayed Mar '17.  We had a poor experience.  The week before our stay, feral cats were [ironically?] discovered living in the house.  They were evacuated and things were cleaned, but the smell lingered.  While we were warned, we did not understand how bad things were until we tried to sleep there.  Half of our party almost left in the middle of the night.  There was urine and cat fur on the beds.  

We left the next morning ASAP and lucked into another vacancy in town.  The manager did not charge us for our 2nd booked night, but refused to discount / refund our first night after being contacted multiple times.  Will not patronize this property / manager / owner again.

Text: THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE - We booked a weekend at the Cat Nap Inn over the phone. Although we provided our email address, we never received a confirmation email. As we approached the date of the trip, we unfortunately needed to cancel our stay. We contacted the Cat Nap Inn manager 12 days before our visit. At this time, she forwarded us our booking confirmation email, which conveniently stated that 14 days notice must be given in the event of a cancellation. We pleaded with the manager to help us out since we were unaware of the policy until 12 days prior - we even offered to pay a small fee. The manager refused to help and stated that she was allowed to "keep our money". Seven hundred dollars down the drain.
