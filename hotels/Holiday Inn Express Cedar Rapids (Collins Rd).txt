Text: Upgrade from the next door Marriott. Updated, modern rooms. In-room fridge is a nice touch, but a little loud. Continental breakfast makes things easier with a busy schedule. Their cinnamon rolls rock!

Text: Great room. Comfortable bed. Shower with the loudest high pitch whine coming from the hot water mixer.

Text: Secured a room for one night. Room had clearly been smoked in. Staff attempted to spray the room but did very little else to help. We ended up keeping our belongs in our car so they didn't take on the smoke smell. Super disappointing.
