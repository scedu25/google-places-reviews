Rating: 5
Text: Exceptionally well decorated, clean and comfortable. A hotel employee met us at the door to direct our tour group and answer any questions. Modern and luxurious furnishings. Pool on the 3rd floor! There's even a hotel guide and map in the room.

Text: My room is beautiful and the food is delicious and people very kind! You have a security problem. You shouldn't park women in the back to come into the dark back of the building by themselves. Very dangerous
