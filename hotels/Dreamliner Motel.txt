Text: I disagree with all the recent reviews. I stayed here for four nights last week. Rooms were clean and all the linen were fresh spotless. The parking lot was being redone and many of the rooms are being renovated. I was offered one of the renovated rooms. I recommend anyone to stay here...prices are right ....all amenities are available.

Text: I cannot believe that this place is still open! It is absolutely disgusting!! Mold, bed bugs and water running. Told him that we were not staying there because of how gross it was. He told me that he understood. I told him that I wanted my money back and he said he couldn't give it to me that I had to wait until the owner called me. He also said we could go out there the next day and that the owner would more than likely just give me cash. Showed up the next day and no one was there and they left a note on the door stating no refunds. Such bs!

Text: Lots of mold. Room 107 through 111 shut down due to water leaks and bed bugs. Most of  the bathrooms in the hotel faucets don't shut off. Nasty mattresses with stains sheets all have stains. Mold on baseboards in the rooms and behind desk and head boards. Black mold in some rooms. Just nasty. Not the employees faults it's the owner. Supposably name is Rakesh. Don't want to actually pay to fix the place. Wants someone to take less than min. Wage just to do hard labor.
