Courtyard by Marriott Columbus Worthington
Rating: 5
Text: This is a newly renovated Courtyard Hotel. It is beautiful inside, with a nice bar and a large gathering area with comfortable seating. The rooms are exactly the same.. They look to be what a regular Marriott would provide for its customers.

Text: Good business hotel. Restaurant and breakfast chef are excellent. Some rooms are having a construction site so lots of noise but no noise at courtyard rooms.

Text: Hotel was in a good, quiet location. Great price for room overnight. Room was well maintained and overall hotel had good presentation. Have stayed there before and would happily stay again.

Text: Staff was nice and the room was what you'd expect. They don't have on demand movies though just HBO. The location was very easy to find and convenient.
