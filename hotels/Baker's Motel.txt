Baker's Motel
Rating: 5
Text: This vintage motel has been updated with modern amenities like flat screen TV, available microwave & fridge, great wifi.  My room was comfortable and very clean, crisp fresh linen, roomy.  Pillows a bit uncomfortable but otherwise a great place to stay.  Directly across the street from the National Road Museum.
