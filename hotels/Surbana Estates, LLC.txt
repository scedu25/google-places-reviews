Text: If it weren't for the rude neighbors i would like this place better. Management is ok but they changed owners and now they think our homes are departments and they dictate whatever the think the can do. The speed limit is 15 miles per hour and i usually drive at that speed sometimes up to 20 when no one is around. I always get bad looks from the old ladies there at the park and sometimes they can get intimidating. One lady once stood in front of me and my car and started yelling at me for no reason at all! She is not the first time! I don't feel safe driving in those streets because i don't feel safe or welcomed. I hate it. There's no reason those old ladies should be harassing people like that.

Text: Since the new owners took over the place is going to hell/ They are making us pay for water not then garbage in the future.  We have dead trees out here that can fall on our homes and cars and they don't so anything about it.  They have new people that moved in the back of the park that are trash and park anywhere on the street they want and party all hours of the night. I would NOT recommend anyone moving out here. It was a nice place at one time but like I said  now it is going to hell. They don't clean the streets out here in the winter,

Text: Neighbors are nice but the establishment does very little to up keep the grounds. Waste of money.
