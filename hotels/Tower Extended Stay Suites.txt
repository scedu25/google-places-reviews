Tower Extended Stay Suites
Rating: 5
Text: We visit Marshal every year and recently gave Tower Extended Stay a try.  It was wonderful. Newly remodeled, clean, roomy, bed was very comfortable.  We loved the kitchen and being able to fix meals there and just relax and rent a DVD or watch cable. Great wifi.  Highly recommend it.

Text: Very nice and clean, and new! Great place, especially for the price. Soft towels and bed, 100% cotton sheets, fully supplied kitchen, fast internet, Netflix, ceiling fan and many more amenities. There are other cars in the parking lot, but I don't hear anyone else. Very quiet. I am super picky about hotels, and really lucked out on this one. I would definitely stay here again.
