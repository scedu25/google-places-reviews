Text: Summery: Great food, very comfortable rooms, great amenities, wonderful host and hostess, peaceful surroundings: loved it, hope to stay again. 

My husband and I needed a long weekend to hike and enjoy nature away from Chicago and Adams County and the Rooster's Nest where perfect. We where welcomed with delicious brownies in our room, the room was clean, cute and very comfortable. Great hangout area with games a TV if you would like to use them. We took several walks around their very large property which has several walking trails lined with wild flowers and a cute pond. Breakfast was awesome! Baked bananas with ice cream, yes please! Great conversation and so welcoming we really felt at home and learned so much about the area and where the best places where to hike. It was such a great place to relax, enjoy the surroundings and get away from it all. 

Would we stay again? Yes. Would we recommend it to family and friends? Yes.
