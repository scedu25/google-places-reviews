Indian Springs Family Resort

Text: Love this place. Friendly staff, very inexpensive, and very peaceful. Have been here years ago for a camping trip with friends and really enjoyed ourselves. The campground is well maintained, nice pool, and clean showers. 

Came back just on Monday to float with my wife and we loved it. We rented a canoe and had a very low-key, laid back, 6 1/2 mile float. The river is really beautiful out this way and will be back again later this month. Highly recommend this place.

Text: Great Float, Great Staff, and Beautiful scenery! We come out to our country cabin in Cuba several times a year and always try to make a visit to Indian Springs Resort as much as possible. We love the beauty of floating down the Meramec River. Plus, we love how laid back and relaxing it is here. It's never too rowdy (compared to the Huzzah or Bass River) and the staff here are super friendly and kind. If you're looking to have a nice relaxing trip, I highly recommend Indian Springs Family Resort.

Text: There's lovely, well manicured riverfront campgrounds and beautiful cabins next to fresh water springs. The whole area is scenic and the business itself is well run and affordable

Text: Me and my wife Leah spent a nice quite weekend on the river and at our campsite. Got to meet the owner Larry on the beach ine evening and as busy as he was he stopped and had a conversation with us. That goes a long way. Will definitely return.

Text: Our first time at this resort was not a good one, I gave 2 stars because the staff was friendly and the security guard Mike was amazing. We stayed at the Big Chief motel and it was not a great experience. The rooms smelled moldy and there were ants all in the bathroom, when you walked outside it smelled like sewage. The fencing around the pool was not structurally safe. A little updating and this place would be worth the money they charge.
