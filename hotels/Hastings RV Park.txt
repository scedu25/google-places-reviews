Hastings RV Park

Text: I was needing a place to stay long term in the Grand Island area.  This was THE place.  It is set in a residential area which made me feel safer as it was a community.

The owner is very helpful and available whenever you need something from him.

I am traveling on but I really enjoyed Hastings RV and the town of Hastings!!

Text: Stayed three nights. Quiet residential neighborhood. All hookups provided and easily accessed. Manager is super friendly and cares how your stay is. I will certainly stay here again whenever I'm in town.
8/28/2017 - Update; We spent another weekend at this facility and all went very well. This is certainly our 'go-to place' any time we need to stay in the Hastings / Grand Island area.
