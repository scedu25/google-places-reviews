Text: I loved sitting at a nicely set table for breakfast and having the food brought to us. Communal powder room with first aid supplies, which I found thoughtful. Small sitting room cheery and tastefully decorated. Nice and helpful Innkeepers.

Text: Saturday's breakfast was absolutely delicious. The pancakes were light and fluffy and Paula one of the owners says requires she used buttermilk.
