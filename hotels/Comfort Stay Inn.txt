Comfort Stay Inn
Rating: 5
Text: The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The manager, Jay, goes out of his way to make sure you're satisfied with the stay.  They were doing some improvements and updates while I was there but it was already very nice.  The front desk clerk, the cleaning staff, the maintenance and breakfast attendant are all very polite.
Don't leave anything behind, no one seemed to want to help me get about 6 or 7 pair of shorts sent to me. They're still there, or at a thrift store or an employee's home.

Text: There was some construction while I was staying here, but in general the facilities were adequate. I didn't love having a second floor room with no elevator in the building. Staff was efficient and polite. Breakfast was only barely worthy of the name. You can definitely do worse.

Text: Super cheap but still felt new and fancy with breakfast included as well. The staff was also energetic and friendly. Probably one of the best values I've experienced in a hotel.

Text: One of the nicest places I've ever stayed. Although there's a little construction they make sure you enjoy yourself. The staff and crew are some of the nicest guys ever. If I could rate higher than 5 I would.
