PIGEON RIVER FISH & WILDLIFE AREA
Rating: 3
Text: Lots of pretty wild land. There are many bodies of water here. I never hunted here so I can't comment on that. Fishing truthfully was dissapointing. Caught 0 fish in a four hour period. Might be the time of year or I'm just not skilled, but no live bait that I had or artificial bait that usually works caught anything. Not a good place for the casual fisherman. Maybe if your skilled at fishing pressured water you could catch something. Almost all the water has extreme vegetation covering the surface. this also limits your bait usage a lot. a lot of the time I could only use hollow body frogs as a result.

Text: Drove an hour to shoot there it was raining when I got there at 2:30 it was closed there's no mention online of it being closed if it rains so it was a waste Drive other than that the range is usually great I just think they should mention if it rains they will be closed

Text: Normally a great place to hunt when the deer population is up but 5 years ago it was hit with a disease hard and it's taking time for the Hurd to recover.
