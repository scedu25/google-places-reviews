Text: There isn't a bad thing that I can say about this hotel. The pool and hot tubs are clean and very nice. The rooms are up to date and clean. The breakfast is wonderful. Gareda is a sweet lady. Love her. A sweet, cute place to stay.

Text: Pleasant experience. I was in Independence to visit my family during Neewolah. This hotel was quite a pleasant surprise. The parking spaces were most appreciated, as they were the right size for real cars. The exterior is rather plain, yet inside the hotel was lovely. It has simple, yet pleasing architectural designs that turn the swimming pool, office, and dining area into a well defined, unique area. The hotel is clean and comfortable. There is an elevator. The room was pleasant and QUIET. The full breakfast was very tasty. I had eggs, sausage, and gravy, along with fresh fruit, coffe, and milk. Their seating area is poolside, so it's quite calming. I would recommend Appletree-Independence-KS to everyone.

Text: This is our third visit here, and the best one yet. The hotel has been newly remodeled. If the hotel is busy, they serve a hot breakfast, otherwise it is a continental. Right in downtown Independence, but quiet.
