Text: This hotel is fantastic. all of the staff were devoted to making my stay enjoyable. And who doesn't love a kitchenette. 
Will definitely be staying here again if I come back through. But even if I'm not in cincy for the night I'll still drop in to say hi to the staff that is more like family now.

Text: The staff was exceedingly pleasant, things were clean, and the price was more than fair. However, some things were in need of repair in the room. Such as the toilet seat and the valve on the shower. And while there is absolutely no law that states that it needs to be there, it would be nice to have something more substantial provided for breakfast beyond coffee and granola bars. Not a bad experience by any means, but some minor repairs and a bagel or two would help out.

Text: This was a pleasantly nice hotel stay. Great value for the money. Clean room, reasonably spacious. Decent decor and furniture. Kitchenette was nice enough for a hotel room. Continental breakfast left something to be desired.
