Motel 6 Shepherdsville Ky
Rating: 5
Text: I have stayed at this particular Motel 6 several times over the past few years, and found the recently renovated rooms very comfortable, spacious, and attractive.  While conveniently close to I-65, the rooms were very quiet without traffic noise.  I was traveling with my dogs, and there are lots of large grassy areas around the motel for walking dogs.  The heater/AC appeared fairly new and worked very well, with digital heat controls.  There was a fridge and microwave.  The beds were comfortable and there was a table and several chairs as well as the large bureau.  There are several fast food establishments and gas stations nearby and lots of parking.  There was some newly-established landscaping that will be very attractive when it matures.  Friendly and helpful front desk staff too.  Pet-friendly and a great value, this is one of my go-to Motel 6's when traveling on I-65.

Text: Hello. The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Really, if that’s all you’re looking for, then you’ve come to the right place. 

Here are some-less-than satisfactory notes- The shower wasn’t very powerful, and didn’t come with shampoo. They did have a vending machine that you could pay 2 bucks for a small amount of shampoo though. In addition there isn’t a coffee pot in your room. They do offer free coffee in the morning time though. They also started using a large saw, as well as other construction equipment right next to our room at 8AM that woke me up, and didn’t stop until 11AM. 

It’s minimal in ways, but a nice stay for someone looking for a cheap place to stay for a night. Lots of restaurants near by if you’re looking for a quick bite. Overall a pleasant experience. I would definitely stay again.

Text: Overall a fine hotel. Nothing special. No breakfast and a treadmill in the lobby as a gym. Rooms had hardwood floor and beds were comfy. Bathroom sink was very nice. 3/5 stars.

Text: It looks like this hotel had been Motel M, but was now a Motel 6.  Coffee was not available until 9 in am and the ice machine was broken.  The picture of the motel shown on the Motel 6 web page does not match the motel where we stayed. We like Motel 6 because we have a dog and usually there is an area for walking the dog.  In this case, the manager rushed out to tell us that our dog had to be on a leash.  We were the only guests that we could tell and we were right there with our dog so are not sure what that was all about.  The China Buffet recommended by the manager was good.

Text: If you want fancy, pay for fancy. If you want let friendly and inexpensive, then book with Motel 6. We always look for them. Great location, staff helpful and friendly. Rooms were nice size, clean, its an older building that shows its age , but it's exactly what they advertise
