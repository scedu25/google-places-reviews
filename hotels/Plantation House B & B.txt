Plantation House B & B
Rating: 1
Text: We stayed here in 1998 and it was wonderful. Since then it has gone downhill. The grounds are overgrown, the building is full of stacked junk, the bed was awful, there seems to be mold and overpowering scent to try to mask something. My mother slipped in a tub because the non-slip stickers put in were all loose and my father may have gotten food poisoning. The ultimate negative was that their vicious barking dog attacked my mother and drew blood in the common area of the building.
