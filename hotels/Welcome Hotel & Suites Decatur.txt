Text: I good value with lots to offer. Evening meal included on several weekdays. The rooms are very clean and spacious. It is time to update the beds but they are not in sleep worthy. Pleased with my stay for the price.

Text: Do not stay here! You definitely get your money's worth. I just tried to check in and my first room wasn't cleaned. The toilet wasn't even flushed. The second room had condom wrappers in the drawer next to the bed. GROSS!!

Text: We had stayed two days, it was a nice place to stay while we went to view the Eclipse.  The front desk gal was very helpful. I would stay again.

Text: Door to my room was hard to open, bed wasn't very comfortable. Dinner both nights I was there was nice and hot breakfast each morning was nice. Staff was very nice.
