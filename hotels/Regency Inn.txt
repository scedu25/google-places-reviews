Text: Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel. Couldn't have been more sweet, giving me directions to a function I was attending along with a helpful map, ensuring parking in car park and facilitating an early check in. If nothing else had gone right with hotel this lady ensured I would have left with a good impression. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean,  room itself was  comfortable. I could go on but suffice it to say I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.

Text: It's within walking distance of quite a few restaurants in this charming town. The staff is all wonderful and newly remodeled and extremely clean! Definitely my choice to stay when I'm in town!

Text: Rooms were newly renovated! Nicer than most. They do copy your ID and the manager takes them to a different location and files your "drivers licence" ID in her "office". This by the way is illegal. Want a laugh look up hotels copying drivers license..
