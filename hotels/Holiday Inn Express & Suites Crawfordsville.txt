Holiday Inn Express & Suites Crawfordsville
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfasts and the service were fantastic. Only complaint is something mostly out of their hands in that the water leaves your skin very slick feeling afterwards due to the water softener they use.

Text: Location, rooms and service were as expected from a Holiday Inn Express. The room was clean, the air was fresh inside, bed was comfortable, and service and breakfast set up and stocked well from eight until nine o'clock when we were there. The only reason I lowered my rating to 4 is because the bathroom in our room showed signs of wear in the bath, tile flooring, the edge of the door, and light switch. Everywhere else in our room and hotel appeared in great condition. These cracks were not a deal breaker for me, but I did wonder why they hadn't been attended to.

Text: Had a great experience. Everything was very clean and the pool and hot tub were a wonderful bonuce. The room was spacious and very clean. I loved the little like store at the front desk that had movies you could rent and fun snacks. The service was great, but the maids really should ask if anyone is in the room before they open the door.
