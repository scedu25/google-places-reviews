Text: Good price with some great amenities.  Breakfast had a good selection. Variety of Fresh fruit also available.  Staff kept an eye out to replenish what was low and did though cleaning of tables as customers vacated. Would definitely come back.

Text: Absolutely TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. No correct communication whatsoever. Absolutely not worth this hotel. Spend your time and money somewhere else

Text: Accidentally left my Nintendo 3DS XL in my room when I left. Called that same day and told them right where I left it and they said they would give me a call back after they looked a few places or if they didn't call back that night that I should give them a call back in the morning. Called them back that morning and they still were looking. I called everyday for about 4 days after I left it there and they always said they were still looking for it and that they would give me a call back. It's been over a week now and I still haven't received a call. My guess is that I won't ever see that device ever again :/ I was there on business so hopefully I can get a different hotel next time.
