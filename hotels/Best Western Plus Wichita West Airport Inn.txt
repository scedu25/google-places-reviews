Best Western Plus Wichita West Airport Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This was our first stay at this hotel. We were in town for a family wedding and stayed here with other members of the family and wedding party. We found the location of the hotel to be ideal, the hotel itself was clean and well maintained, the staff was extremely attentive, and our overall experience was exceptional. One of the nicest things about this hotel beside the reasonable price was the number of pillows in our room and the different firmness of the pillows, which allowed us to pick the pillow(s) that were the most comfortable for each of us. We travel to Wichita often for our junior hockey games and this hotel will definitely be a consideration for our next visit!

Text: Enjoy my stay in all best western plus. Accommodation by all staff members surpassed my needs. Only the amminites lacked was mini refrigerator and microwave not available in all rooms as travellers as myself who stay for extended periods is a welcoming convenience, but staff members accommodated with them putting me in a room that had them. Thank you!

Text: Very clean, modern and comfortable! Staff very friendly, even the grounds keeper spoke to us and wanted to make sure we were happy with our experience here. We did not try the breakfast so cannot comment on that. The pricing was very good too.
