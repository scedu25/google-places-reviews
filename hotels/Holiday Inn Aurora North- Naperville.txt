Text: Great so far, clean ,pretty and wonderful bed with good linens, Keurig coffee machine and Blackout Window Shades ! A very nice place. I would highly recommend it, just make sure you're not on the same floor as a wedding party, and get proper directions ahead of time. GPS is very difficult to use at times in this area.

Text: I got married over the weekend and stayed in the bridal or honeymoon suite, with Jacuzzi. The stay was fantastic, but what really made it outstanding was the manager, Andrew. He was so accommodating and really made us feel like we were the only ones staying there. But it wasn't like he gave us the only special attention, as I heard him over the phone and speaking with other customers with the same amount of care and helpfulness. He really made the experience that much better. He also gave us an incredible rate for the room. Thanks so much! Will definitely stay here again.
