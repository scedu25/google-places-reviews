Text: Almost a year ago,  my wife and I spent 5 nights for our honeymoon in the Cottage.  I caught 4 Big Blues, much to the dismay of my wife who wanted to outfish me, but we caught many bluegill, etc in the bigger pond, which helped my wife to "get over it". Lol. 

They were just beginning to build the bigger cottage. John, the owner, was always graceful and very helpful.  He answered our questions clearly. 

Rufus, the friendly dog, couldn't pass up a head scratch & enjoyed it so much he made noises if you hit the right spot. Lol. One sweet dog. Very pretty area. Off the beaten path and felt as if we were out of state,  but this location is only about 42-45 minutes from us... Lol. Limited funds...ya know,  wedding. 

My wife and I highly recommend this place. Might book it for our 1 year anniversary this May of 2017.

Text: I love going to Pleasant Grove Farm every Christmas.  It's so quiet and beautiful.  There will be a rental cottage soon, can't wait to see that!  And they have a new pond.

There is a large dining room at the Main House at PGF.  You can rent that room for large gatherings.  There is a full kitchen to make whatever you like.

Very peaceful, a great vacation!
