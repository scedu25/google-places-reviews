Text: Located in an old, converted movie theater, this restaurant and club has a limited menu featuring beef.  The entire meal was terrific and the cherry cheesecake may very well be the best you'll ever get.  Worth a trip.  Chow down then settle in for a quiet sleep at Lady Di's Court on the south side of town.  The membership fee is (in 2009) $10.68 but if you are staying in town, inquire of your innkeeper as they may have a blanket membership for their guests.
