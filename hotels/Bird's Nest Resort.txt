Text: The few good things I have to say about my stay are that the staff is very friendly, the location of the property is great to get away from the downtown hype, and the bed was pretty comfortable. However, our fridge/freezer did not stay cold. The bathroom tub smelled like pee and the king room was small. There was nowhere to unpack and put clothes and there were also bugs in the bed. I will more than likely never stay there again but I do give the new owners props for what they've done to the property. The cleanliness of the place needs more attention.

Text: Clean place, comfortable beds, and friendly staff. They let us check in via text message. Our cottage could've used a few minor repairs, but you can definitely tell management is working on fixing the place up and I am sure they will get around to it. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would book here again.

Text: If you are a boater this place will be fine. Not the tashmahl, beds are great bathroom and air conditioning, fantastic owner/operator.  Any issue we had was taken care of quickly. Will be back for sure!

Text: Most uncomfortable beds ever. The sheets were so scratchy and stained! The frames were broken on both of our beds in our room. When we looked under the bed to see what happened we found someone's dirty underwear! The fridge didn't work in our room either plus our shower didn't have a shower head! Also the screen doors on everyone's room slam when you close them which is pretty unpleasant at 3am when you are trying to sleep and someone goes to their room. Pretty pricey for a crappy room! Definitely won't be staying here again! 

Edit: to add anytime we went to the office to let them know about the issues or any time we called no one was in there or answered the phone.
