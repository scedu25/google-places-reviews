Kite Hill Vineyards Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We went to Kite Hills to watch the 2017 total eclipse of the sun staying on one of the two bed and breakfast rooms. 
Our host Barb was a friendly, true people-person making us feel instantly at home but also being a knowledgeable and a great cook. 
When I stupidly left my wallet in the room (I blame over indulgence in their wonderful wine) Barb happily mailed it to me at my next accommodation and refused to accept reimbursement. 
As a place to stay this takes some beating.

Text: New to the Bed and Breakfast thing. The room was nice as where the Hosts. Both breakfasts were very good and we ventured over to the Wine tasting room. Sat out on the deck and enjoyed a couple glasses of wine. We liked them enough to pick up a couple of bottles. Overall a great time. I'm just hoping our next B&B experience is this good!

Text: Our first experience at a BnB. Beautiful room with private bath. Very accommodating service and very friendly and engaging host and hostess. We were down for a graduation ceremony and wanted to stay at a place with a more relaxed atmosphere than the college crowd might offer. delicious wine and great, fresh breakfasts.
