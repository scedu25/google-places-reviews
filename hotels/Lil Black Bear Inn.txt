Text: Went here for our anniversary and we loved our stay. Jim and Jill are very nice people who know what they are doing. 
The first night we added a candlelight dinner to our room and it was our best dinner all weekend. The complimentary breakfast each morning is scrumptious. 
There is places around the property to relax and get in touch with your nature side. 
I would highly recommend anyone visiting the brown county area to stay here for your visit.

Text: Absolutely LOVED it! It felt like first class service. This was my first time staying at a bed and breakfast and I can honestly say I will never stay in a hotel/motel again. We adored the family that ran it. They make you feel right at home the second you step out of your car. We got to meet and enjoy time spent with their entire family! The room was so clean and so nice. We were given an ashtray upon check-in and asked to smoke out on the balcony which was very nice for us, as we are used to smoking outside. The bed was so comfortable we didn’t want to get up the next morning. We loved the 9am breakfast time which allowed us time to sleep in a bit before going down and enjoying the amazing food. Breakfast was so filling and absolutely scrumptious! We had a nice romantic getaway out by the pond then enjoyed spending time with Jim, Jill, and their family out at the gazebo area. We cannot wait to come back and spend time at what feels like a second home with a family that feels like an addition to our own family!

Text: Of all the bed and breakfast we have stayed at and that there is to stay at this is the BEST. They were the greatest hosts that any family could ask for. Room was perfect and clean. Breakfast was fabulously homemade and plentiful. We look forward to seeing you all again soon and thank you for being so entertaining to our daughter as she misses you already. Nick, Trisha and Lylian.

Text: The Inn was AMAZING! The Inn Keepers are so nice and friendly and make you feel welcome. The breakfast is top notch and is a great deal for what you pay. The view is so beautiful. It is a few miles outside of Nashville which makes you feel like you are in a secluded paradise.
