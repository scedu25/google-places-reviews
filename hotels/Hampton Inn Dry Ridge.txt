Text: Great!  Staff is friendly and rooms are clean!  Loved the cold air conditioning.  My family loved the free breakfast.  Nicest people EVER work here.  We stayed here to be close to The Ark Encounter.  Wonderful Weekend in EVERY WAY...and the free Chocolate Chip cookies upon arrival made our day!  Kindness and hospitality would make us choose this hotel...AGAIN
..(and neatness and cleanliness for me)!!!

Text: A great hotel. Very clean and comfortable. Staff from front desk employees to house keepers are the greatest and will bend over backwards to help make ones stay enjoyable. Easy to miss entrance as there are a bunch is a short distance.

Text: Very clean. The pool was plenty warm and the breakfast was good. They have awesome luggage carts that are head and shoulders above what I've seen in other hotels. It may sound like a small thing, but made life so much easier.

Text: The absolute WORST hotel ever! Absolutely no respect for customers who have prepaid rooms! Instead of trying to be helpful they push the issue on to someone else and the issue never gets resolved! Will be contacting the BBB. Charges were made to cards that were never authorized and some charges were duplicated and they refuse to help resolve the issue! Clearly this location needs new management and better training for its employees. I would rather sleep in my damn car then stay at a Hampton Inn again!!!!!

Text: If I could give less then 1 star I would because that's what kind of service we received at this location. First off me and my husband booked rooms here for our bridal party for our wedding this past weekend. One of our couples that are in our wedding tried to check in and was told there were no rooms left, when 5 minutes before that there were still 2 rooms open under our reservation when another couple checked in. When they asked the man at the front desk all he had to say was "I don't know where that room went". So two of the couples were forced to share a room. We were guaranteed a locked rate for all 6 rooms we reserved and EVERYONE in our wedding party was charged something different. Finally at 2 am when they arrived back at the hotel, a room magically appeared and they were able to get separate rooms. We were told they were going to discount all the rooms due to the inconvenience which DID NOT happen. Monday morning came and my debit card was charged for 2 rooms I did not authorize and they overcharged my husband by 3 nights. Between me and my husband cards we were charged over $2000. Our Bill should have at the most been around $900. Trying to get this resolved has been going on for 3 days now. We have been transferred from manager to manager. I have never seen such unorganized business tactics. They don't keep track of who checked in. They didn't collect 2 of our guests credit cards so they charged us instead when it was just under our wedding block. They tried to blame my husband for not signing a credit card authorization form when they never told him he had to. We will NEVER be staying here again and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to stay here either!!
