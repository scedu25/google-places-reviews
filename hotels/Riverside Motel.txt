Riverside Motel
Rating: 2
Text: Clean but rough. Very old with out dated things. Shower needed an update and walls needed to be touched up. Over all not the worst place to stay at but the best looking and most recommended in town.

Text: This Motel needs some serious maintenance and updates. I had two chairs in my room. A 30 year old recliner and a metal fold up chair. Carpet is old, blue, and stained. There is no head board on the very firm bed. The toilet uses 10 times more water then a modern toilet. The shower curtain rod fell down every time I used it. This Motel still uses a standard key to open the door and has no dead bolt. Having said all that, sadly, Riverside may still be the best option in Hebron.

Text: The room was clean, the bed was okay and the service was great. We checked in late at night as we had been at another hotel in town which we had to leave in the middle of the night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a decent nights rest. I will be staying here for future visits to the area.

Text: We were told checkout was 11am...it was 1101 when we were told we needed to get out or be charged for an extra hour by the cleaning ppl. My mother in law then went to inform them that in her room the floor was wet in front of the mini fridge which she didn't use or even open and was told that it was her fault bc she unplugged it. Very rude cleaning people. Also had other family staying there as well and they were told they could check in at 1pm and got there at 1 and had to wait and hr and half until they were able to check in bc someone was still in the room they booked. Also noticed when they were "cleaning" rooms, not one comforter was put in the laundry baskets they were pushing.
