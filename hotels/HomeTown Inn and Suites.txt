Text: The hotel staff was very nice and friendly and always greeted us with a smile. The rooms have been remodeled and the beds were very comfortable. The continental breakfast was really good. The whole family was able to enjoy the pool as well. We would definitely stay again.

Text: Great staff and breakfast. But thin walls, and voices carry through the heating unit. I didn't get much sleep because I could hear everyone else who wasn't sleeping.

Text: The room was fairly clean. However, the ac unit was frozen up with frost all over the coils. We slept with the window open to keep cool. The bathroom was acceptable. Breakfast the next morning was OK. The price was very good and that helped make the overall experience acceptable.

Text: Older place. Nice staff and clean. Good for the value. Had everything I needed and was quiet. As a woman staying alone, I felt safe there.

Text: We are writing after checking in and finding what looked like black mold in our bathroom. We brought this up to your staff and they made an excuse about the plumbing and that they weren't supposed to rent out that room but assured us repeatedly that it was safe. They didn't offer us a new room at any point, despite our obvious concern.

We witnessed stained sheets, spiders in the bathroom and moldy carpet, as well as a dirty mattress that was in the parking lot all day. The central door is unlocked and accessible by anyone who walks by. And you're automatically greeted by the smell of smoke and yet another dirty mattress crammed behind a couch. 

We did not end up staying the night and will be requesting a refund. If I could give negative stars, I would.
