Text: I was there for a group interview. The hotel was beautiful. We received lunch with pop, or water which was offered; also several herbal teas, coffee. It was a really nice event. There is a restaurant in the lobby area, computers for checking flight status, a shuttle that takes people to the airport. I would stay in this hotel for sure.

Text: Come here every year for a weekend event. It's always been a decent place to stay, but the renovations and upgrades over the last few years have improved the experience. The staff are v friendly and helpful, rooms are v clean. The fold out beds in the suites are now a large l-couch set that's surprisingly comfy for guests/lounging. Mattresses are a bit soft for my taste, but it's not like you can tailor them individually :)

Text: Very nice hotel. Close to airport , freeway and train station. They had hot complementary breakfast. They have good options for breakfast. We stayed for 2 nights and breakfast menu was different both days. Friendly and helpful hotel staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are vising metro Chicago area. They do have complementary shuttle service to O'Hare and nearest blue line station.

Text: Window missing on side of building. Staff said it was from building "shifting". Was quoted and locked in price on reservation number with credit card. Was then charged $15 more rate when checking out. Kevin manager said he couldn't find who I talked to but had exact time I called.
