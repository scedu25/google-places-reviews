Simmer Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Great little American family owned and operated motel in a quaint town. Single rooms, suites, double rooms with full kitchens, even apartments!  Excellent options for our group. We spent nearly a month here, along with several members of our crew.  The first thing I noted was the attention to detail in the cleanliness of the room.  NO dust on lightbulbs or fans, the window sills were very clean and the curtains were updated and clean.  I am all about a CLEAN room and this place passed my test with flying colors.  The owners and staff were MOST accommodating, helpful and friendly.  Since we were an 'extended stay', they offered any additional appliances we may need, including a larger refrigerator, crock pots, etc. There were two beds in our suite and we only required one - but I needed space to set up an office.  They were great about letting us take down the bed and stored it for the duration of our stay.  Not the most updated bedroom furniture, but what they did have was very clean, inside and out.  There is a laundry room here and it is cheaper than the local laundromat.  Quarters for that are available in the office.  For little ones, there is an amply equipped playground to get them out in the fresh air.  There's an outdoor pool but it was already closed for the season when we arrived.   Overall, this is one place that I highly recommend and will stay again if the opportunity arises.

Text: My husband and I stayed at the Simmer Motel in Wamego, KS years ago and enjoyed our stay.  We were privileged to stay here again this week.  Personality Plus!  Most motels are the same in that they are pretty much the same in decor. NOT this motel!  Every room has a different theme and the minute you walk in the room you feel like you are visiting a friends home. Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Simmer for the love and care that you have put into the restoration of your motel.  I recommend this motel to everyone who passes this way or if you just want to experience a fun place to stay.

Text: No doubt, this is not the fanciest place you're going to stay in your life.  But it is very clean, very comfortable, and very affordable.   What a tremendous asset for a small town like Wamego.  Did not have a single complaint during our two night stay this past weekend.  Definitely plan on coming back and recommending it to our friends.

Text: 5* This motel is cleaner and better maintained than so-called 5 star motels. And then at a reasonable price. Thank you. 
About us: Vintage travelers in a vintage trailer that love stargazing and solitude away from the maddening crowds. Eating only at "mom and pop" establishments which are getting harder and harder to find.

Text: I stayed at Simmer for a couple nights for my honeymoon. The prices were fair, the room was comfy and clean, and the staff was friendly and easy to talk to. I recommend it to anyone in the area with the caveat of no breakfast included, which wasn't an issue for me.
