Text: The rooms are nice. Clean. Very comfortable. My only complaints are that the microwave turntable doesnt even go to the microwave. Due to the turntable not spinning it took me 8 minutes to cook something that was only supposed to take 2 minutes and 20 seconds. And there are no power outlets next to the bed. The only open outlets in the room is the 1 by the entrance and the 1 over the vanity counter by the bathroom. Otherwise it's great. Only $52.50 a night. Air conditioner almost works too well. Cable and wifi. Mini fridge.

Text: Reserved a room on Priceline and check in took a few seconds. The side walks were kinda slimy but I'll chalk that up to the weather. Room was clean but the shower was kinda nasty. Check out was just as quick as check in.
