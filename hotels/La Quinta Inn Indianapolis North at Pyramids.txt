Text: Breakfast is terrible, biscuits always rock hard or like they were dipped in a bucket of butter, and when you got to turn on the shower, brown water comes out EVERYTIME!!! Brought this to the attention of management but they said oh it should stop in the next few days theyre working on the pipes, 1 month later here i am still contemplating if i should shower here or LA fitness. Toilet runs non stop all night long super loud, shower curtains too short so every time you take a shower the whole floor gets soaked Tighten up La Quinta

Text: This place is dirty!!  Dirty hallways, dirty beds, dirty bathrooms, dirty windows....dirty!  Cigarette burn holes in the mattress pad, white stains all over the bed skirts, hair in the tub and on the bed.  The iron was broken.  We did get a second one and it leaked water all over.  

The staff was very pleasant.

Text: Pissed and grossed out doesn't even begin to state how I feel. Walking the dog and there are cigarette buds and other sharp things like glass where the babies walk. THEN getting ready for a bath and a USED PAD falls out of the 'clean' towels and hits me in the face from the rack above the toilet. Not mine, and it had not been through the wash so I know the towels have not been looked at or moved since at least the last room occupant. I will never come back here.
