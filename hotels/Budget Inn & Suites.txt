Budget Inn & Suites

Text: What a hidden gem. Very happy we found this place. Older motel that someone has thoughtfully updated.  Really nice mattresses,  fridge in every room, large space for hanging clothes, and black out curtains. How many times have you stayed at a fancy hotel only to have a light shining through the flimsy curtains all night?  You can make the room pitch black here. And very quiet as well. There was a group of workers barbecuing near our room when we arrived. They were not loud, but you could still hear everything they said when standing outside. But as soon as I closed the door I couldn't hear a thing. Not even their music.   Very nice. We make a point of staying here every time we pass through.

Text: Extremely clean and smelled very fresh.  They take pride in the cleanliness.  Wonderful place to stop and rest on a budget.  Breakfast was the waffles you make yourself or cereal & milk.  We ended up making our own PB&J sandwiches that I had supplies for.  We were 2 adults/ 2 kids.  Very easy to organize my luggage since you park outside your room.  Great to sleep and get refreshed.  We tried calling before getting there and no one answered the phone, so we figured they were busy and we just showed up and booked a room.  Only 8 miles from I-70, so it was easy to get back on the highway.

Text: This isn't a Hilton by no means: this is an "I am suffering from altitude sickness after a 10 hour drive from the mountains and I need a place to stop." The owners were fantastic and very pleasant. They were accommodating on where we could park our vehicle with trailer where we could see it. They have incredibly fast WiFi, bathrooms are clean - they look like my Nana's from the 70's - and the rooms were great. Couldn't beat the price for $50 a night to recover from altitude changes.

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE.  My husband was with two men traveling from out of town and they stopped here for the night.  The first room they were given a key to, they walked in to find the room was in use by someone else.  They were given another room then.  A week after my husband gets home, he gets a call from the owner cussing him out for "stealing" an HDMI cord and stated that we would be charged $50.  My husband was at the hotel not even 7 hours just to sleep for the night.  They never even turned the tv on yet the manager accused him of taking the mounted tv off the wall to steal the HDMI cord and then mounted the tv back.  My husband would never do something like that.  And to be accused of taking something that costs $8 and charging us $50 is ridiculous.  Very sad that they would do something like this.  We do not have $50 lying around this close to the holidays for someone to take advantage of us like this.  AVOID THIS HOTEL or at least do not pay with credit card where they can scam you like they did us.

Text: DO NOT BOOK HERE. First of all, the owner can barely speak English to the point that he gets mad that you can't understand him. THEN, instead of nicely explaining that there is not free cancelling (like it said online), he literally went off on me telling me that I shouldn't believe what's online. Then when I told him he's not going to get business treating his customers like that... he hung up on me.
