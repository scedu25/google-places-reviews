Hampton Inn Indianapolis-SW/Plainfield

Text: Soft water, slimy feeling as if the soap won't come off. Nice hotel other than that, staff included. Similar to back a few years when the front desk asked you "smoking or non smoking room" it would be great if they asked "Soft water or Hard water room". It may be time for a different hotel brand, I hope a soft water movement isn't sweeping the nation....

Text: Location is very convenient for proximity to airport as well as DePauw University! An easy, roughly 30 minute drive for both of those locations! Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The breakfast is a good selection, especially for the length of breakfast service. Having coffee and hot water at all times of day is very nice, especially to get a cup of hot cocoa before taking into one of the luxurious beds.

Text: Hampton Inn are all pretty consistently good, and this one was too. Walking distance from several food choices. Everything in the rooms was clean and in order. The pool has too much chlorine in it, but that's pretty well everywhere. Morning breakfast was great, these bagel scramble things, pretty good. Restful night, back on the road early the next day, thanks guys!
