We had all the ammenities that one would need for a great stay.   Dianne welcomed us when we arrived  and was super friendly.   It shows she takes pride in her business.   We will definately be back.

Text: We had a great weekend fishing.  Our family stayed in cabin 5/6.  The floor plan was spacious for all of us (7) to move about freely.  The kitchen had full size fridge and range.  Plenty of dishes and cookware to make a nice meal. Shower was clean.  Outside had hanging storage for our waders to dry! There was a fire pit for campfire. Clean plastic picnic tables were nice to sit around. Free Wi-fi was great, we had no phone reception at the Park. Pappy and Diana were friendly and courteous, unlike when we stopped at a neighborhood store. We would definitely stay here again.
