Comfort Inn Corydon
Rating: 4
Text: Perfectly adequate overnight stay. I rate the room and amenities as "there". The beds exist. The hot breakfast was exactly where they said it would be. The bathroom had an optimal number of showers and toilets. I didn't wake up covered in bed bugs, always a bonus. The four star rating is due entirely to the staff. Friendliest people ever.

Text: Charged me $25 after I checked out claiming I took a pillow. Manager said tough! lucky will be able to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay in motels a lot for business and never had something like this happen.  Room starts out at a good price.............

Text: Although the room was spacious and clean, it needs updating. The service was adequate. They do provide free WiFi.
