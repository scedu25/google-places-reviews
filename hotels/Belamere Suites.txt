Text: Amazing! The place is perfect for a romantic getaway and to forget all your troubles! We had the grand royal suite and it was totally worth the price. The pool was a cozy 90 degrees and the jacuzzi was amazing! The shower was huge with plenty of room and I could not have been more happy with it. Oh and the staff here treat you like family! I will definitely be coming back here!

Text: Our stay at the Belamere Suites was great! We stayed for our Anniversary and it was better than expected. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We actually had a little treat that we weren't aware of, a lake that we could sit by. It was so romantic. The room was spacious, clean, and private. The only things I would change are having an in-room microwave and having a TV in the pool area. Other than that, it was perfect. Can't wait to go again!

Text: Went for 5 year anniversary. Location was tucked back behind commercial buildings which was peaceful and felt secluded. Room was open and beautiful. Large open double shower with stone floor makes me want to build one in my own house. Jacuzzi was huge and so relaxing with the fireplace and mood lighting. Not sure the name of the front desk girl was but she was awesome and personable. Felt very welcomed and had a great night relaxing.

Text: Great place!!! Extremely clean and private. The staff is so friendly. The one woman at front desk, Kelby, was especially sweet. If you can afford it and are hoping for some isolated and undisturbed time with your loved one, I definitely recommend it!!!

Text: Lots of questions come into mind about this hotel. What does this place offer that a hotel doesn't? Nothing. Was the room clean, Yes but so are most hotels. Was the room nice, Yes but you can get a nice hotel for a fraction of the price. Was the staff friendly, yes but so are most hotels. They provided the same service as any hotel. The only thing that this place offered more was the room was huge. The bed was broke and no microwave in the room or ice machine available for use. They provided them but you had to call for it and then wait 15 minutes for them. I'm sorry but for $400.00 a night I could of stayed at a full cabin in the woods In Hocking Hills with the same amenities at Belamere for $150.00 a night. Actually the cabin was better because they had a full kitchen and a real hot tub and not a bath tub. I hope this helps others in deciding to go there in the future.
