Text: Family friendly, clean campground.  We stayed here during the Great American Eclipse for 3 nights in August 2017 and absolutely loved the place.   Easy access to the lake, beautiful countryside around.   So much to do.  The staff here are very friendly and helpful.   Camp store prices were very reasonable.   We will be back....perhaps for the April 2024 Eclipse!

Text: Amazing staff! Our day out on the lake went smoothly thanks to the guidance and friendliness of the staff. Our international friends and family who spent a week in So ILL said that the day on Little Grassy boating, swimming, and kayaking was the best part of the trip! 
The boats and kayaks were clean and in top condition. The lake was clean. A great spot that is ran very well!

Text: People are so helpful! If you have an idea of what you are doing as well, they will let you do your thing! Very nice! Helpful to have a little store if you forgot somethings as well. Definitely doing it again.
