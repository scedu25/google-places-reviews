Text: Stopped here for a night for a clean and quiet room and that's what I received!  It's an older hotel so expect that some areas will be a little worn. There was 2 different thickness sizes for the beds in my room and I chose the thicker one which was very comfy!
A continental breakfast (rolls/muffins, biscuits with gravy, coffee/juice, cereal) is served also there's a pool and hot tub but it looked to be under repair at the time.  
Amanda at the front desk was friendly and knowledgeable!

Text: If you need a place for the night it's fine but it is nothing out of the ordinary. Free Breakfast. Recliner in room.

Text: Very nice employees and affordable. But the room was very unclean. There were so many stains on one chair we wouldn't sit in it. A copious stain on the bed sheet, we slept on top of the covers on one side. A towel along the bottom of the fridge, I guess it leaked. Empty tissue box.  Not a comfortable stay unfortunately.
