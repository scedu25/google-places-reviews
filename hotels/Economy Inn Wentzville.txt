Economy Inn Wentzville

Text: Decent room. Housekeeping did a good job. Bed sheets were white and clean as well as the towels. Desk people were nice. No free breakfast as was advertised. The room had a mini fridge, and microwave that both worked as expected. My fiance is staying an extended time there for a job and I visited on the weekend and there was no issues with him having a visitor. It's a simple room with a reasonable price. Quiet too, that's a big plus!
