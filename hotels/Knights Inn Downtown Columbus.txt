Knights Inn Downtown Columbus

Text: Decent motel. Reasonably clean, reasonably safe, not too far from downtown . fast food close by. Reasonable rates.

Text: My reservation was sent to another motel with no prior notification due to unspecified circumstances. The manager of the overflow tried to verify with me by facetiming the "owner." The area is right off of an expressway, but in a secluded enough area that I smelled trouble and left immediately. I don't know if their rooms are nice, but the service and organization is bad enough that it's not worth saving the $5 a night and going someplace nicer.
