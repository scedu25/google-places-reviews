Shady Rest Motel
Rating: 3
Text: Not a great deal for the price. Non-smoking room, but had cigarette butts under the bed and had to deal with the smell the whole night. Towels, sheets, carpet, pillows seemed very old/used. Hospitality was pretty meh as well, clerk did bare minimum in providing room and information, office closed earlier than their posted hours as well.

Text: Parents put us up for a few nights at the Shady Rest. Edith was welcoming, and our room was clean and comfortable. They have recently replaced the mattresses, which was a much welcomed change from the last time we stayed. Based on our most recent experience, I would stay again when we visit in the future. Thanks!

Text: I wouldn't say we hated it, It was a shelter. They did upgrade up from a 2 bed because of the a/c not working  to their suite room with 5 twin beds, couch and a tv!  Lady was nice and friendly.  Not much to pick from for miles and miles. Place is big for hunting, fishing.   This place was 5 miles from where we were going.  Big chain hotels Holiday Inn and such are hours away, so very convenient.  Hasn't been updated this decade or maybe 3 or 4.
