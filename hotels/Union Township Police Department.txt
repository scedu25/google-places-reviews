Text: Very nice poice staff and station. They serve tea and Biscotti while being booked. A guard read Goodnight Moon to me before "lights out" which turned into a fun game between of tag between "clients" and the staff...in the dark. Upon release they threw me a small party and wished me well. Oh, and are the cosigner on the car they sent me out with. Love. These. Guys.

Text: Wow is all I can say.  Friday night I went to Shell on the corner of Clough and Mt Caramel Tabasco, there was already a cop in the parking lot dealing with something.  I head inside to get gas and a drink,  the old lady behind the counter is so high she is falling over,  can't talk,  can't even use the register.  Obviously I have to wait for an extended period of time, and that's when the cop walks in and watches this go on for 5 minutes,  and does absolutely nothing.  Doesn't even care. You ever wonder why heroin is such a problem around here,  now you know.  The cops don't care. UT really needs to train their cops to do their jobs,  maybe they wouldn't be called Useless Township anymore.  Please try to care just a little bit. Disgusted.
