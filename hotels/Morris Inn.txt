Morris Inn

Text: The good: Rooms were nice and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean. Breakfast was excellent. We hosted an event in the Joyce room and the food and service for that was great. The not so good: we had a few instances on three different rooms where the key just stopped working and we had to go to the desk to get new ones. They also charged the wrong credit card on one room, which they happily resolved for us. And finally, one small annoyance is the absurdly high charge of $20 to valet the car to the parking lot 100 feet from the door (yet it still somehow took upwards of 15 min to get the car brought out on some occasions), while the free self park is a quarter mile away. Overall, though, a great stay. With their lower room rates since the renovation, it's well worth the convenience if you're visiting to see campus.

Text: The room and service were both excellent. Valet parking was good. The tools were clean and came with many things I didn't expect. Complimentary umbrella for temporary use, robes, many snack options (at a price). Only down side was my room wasn't ready when I got there (only a five minute wait though) and service at the bar was kinda slow.

Text: Spent 4 night here in October, the weather was great. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. I was staying here for a conference which was split between the Morris Inn and the McKenna Conference center across the road. If it's raining to much or there's a foot of snow on the ground don't fret because there's a tunnel connecting the buildings.

Text: The large events in the ballroom was rather cramped, and the server for out table couldn't seem to fulfill the smallest of requests. I had to stop another employee to get proper cream for my coffee.

Text: A causal dining menu with a touch of class. Nice atmosphere, good food, great service and a decent wine list. Not much to complain about.
