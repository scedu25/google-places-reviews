Marquette Cottage
Rating: 4
Text: Decent sized place to rent for a few days for a wedding in town. 3 bedrooms and 1 bath. House is a well kept early 1900s construction. Only complaint is the road running alongside the house is pretty busy so there is certaintly noise both during the day an when sleeping especially in the front bedroom or living room. Back yard is large and well kept, great for entertaining.
