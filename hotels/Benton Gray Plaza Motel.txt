Text: We pull in and to say I was shocked is an understatement!! The on line reviews said it is clean for the price? For a 1hour rental maybe! The lobby has a sign up that says it is a high crime area. When outside keep your keys on you at all times, yikes! The parking lot had old mattresses piled up in it. The room??? The non smoking room had cigarette burns in comforter, sheets, and mattress. The mattress had visable bed bugs in crease of mattress. The best part, in our hast to leave the room so not to take anything with us on our clothes the biggest roach you have ever seen was blocking the door to leave. My husband walks up to kick it away and it's dead..... It had to come from the bed when we threw the covers back. The good thing,  they refunded all of my money so I could go someplace else.  Don't stay here unless bed bugs, safety, and roaches are not a concern for you.
