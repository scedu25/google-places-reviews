Hickory Shores Resorts

Text: Bath house showing its age, but was clean. Mature woods surround/boarder most sites. Access to sites is good. Very affordable rates. Nice common grounds areas for Frisbee and such.

Text: We've had a camper there for over 2 years. Outdoor pool, close to lake, relaxing in the wooded campsites or drive your golf cart around to meet the neighbors. If you're looking for upscale super amenities this is not it. If you want quiet (mostly) wooded sites, pool friendly people then this is it.

Text: Unless you have an RV with special antenna system you will have no data or cellular phone service at Hickory Shores and there is no campground WIFI. We have Verizon unlimited everything plan and can normally get a poor to great signal anywhere we've ever stayed. We were able to get service once we got a couple miles toward town.

So if you are not OK being completely disconnected from the world do not stay here.

Otherwise it is a typical private campground that's a little past it's prime. 

If you don't go with high expectations, don't need to be able to receive/make phone calls or access the Internet, then Hickory Shores iis not bad.
