Text: Room was pretty decent for a $60 hotel room and was clean. No batteries in the remote and no shower curtain. I could have went and let them know but it was late already and not a big deal. Front desk staff was questionable. "Wasn't sure" if he had a room available and not very sociable. All in all a decent place for the money.

Text: Beds felled like just springs. Had a group book several rooms. One friend only had 1 station on tv , no cable, no wifi, NO HOT WATER AT ALL!  We shared bathrooms with others in our group for a shower. Staff was pleasant but still no hot water or TV air conditioning terrible door locks major problems.  For 2 nights. Breakfast area was cleaned and over if at all was there prior to time posted to end. Although cheap, I would spend the extra for a shower and TV and bed comfort. Also,  only a tiny bar of hand soap, no shampoo,etc or bath soap. Would not recommend

Text: We had an issue with dogs near us that were barking and went to complain. The front desk automatically moved us to another room. We were treated with respect and will go back again.

Text: Nice place and decent folks that work here, my only gripe is that I can't use my card to open the door at all. Other than that it's been a nice place to stay.
