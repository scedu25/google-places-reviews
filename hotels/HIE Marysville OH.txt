Text: Everything about our stay was great. The staff was friendly and quick to help. The room was clean and had a personal welcome from the housekeeper Jeremy. The food was what you would expect from free breakfast, but the attendee worked hard to keep things filled and clean.

Text: Very clean and nice hotel! Bethany was very helpful, always smiling, positive, and polite. Sharon, in breakfast, was so sweet and the food and choices were great! Tia was friendly, smiling, fast, efficient, and informative when I was checking in! They offer sleeping aids such  as soft (and very comfortable) eye masks, ear plugs, breath right strips, and "sleepy time" chamomile tea to help relax and fall asleep on super comforting bed and pillows (that I didn't want to get up from). The room was immaculately clean, and my housekeepers were pleasant and efficient. Plus you can swim and work out! I could vacation at the Holiday Inn Express in Marysville, Ohio every single day! I more than recommend it, I completely endorse it!
