Sands Trailer Park

Text: Peaceful, quiet living. Family styled community. Owners great hearted people. I have been living here for 6 yrs now. Owners of Sokol Park across street have been making it unbearable for us home owners to live recently, with ourdoor concerts than are so loud and play for days that our houses and windows shake. Children and hard working people that live here get no sleep. Disabled individuals are suffering medically from this. Sarpy County Police wont follow the law and make them stop. Other than the horrendous abuse of power by council members and law officers, great place to live.
