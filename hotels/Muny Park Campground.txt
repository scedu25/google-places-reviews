Text: Great place to overnight. It's got 30amp service and water hook-up, plus a dump station. Don't waste your time at a rest area or a Walmart parking lot, just come here and you'll be happy.

Text: Great little park. We didn't camp but adopted to dump. The restrooms were clean, dump station clean and easy to get to, camping pads looked nice and each one appeared to have water, easy access; all in all a very good experience.
