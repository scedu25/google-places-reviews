Text: This is where I live, this is my home. I have to say the Peckham's are extremely gracious and kind. Andover is a very expensive place to live and part of the reason for that is the amazing and nationally recognised school system. Because of the Peckham's and Andover Estates we are able to afford a home in Andover, and send our kids to the best schools in the State of Kansas.
