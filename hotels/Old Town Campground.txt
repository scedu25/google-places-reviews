Text: We stayed there two nights. Peaceful and quite. It's a few miles outside town,  its well worth the drive and experience. Stayed during the mothman festival. Very cool and spooky with the full moon out. 
Plenty of room for our rented 30' RV. Hookup for power and water is good. Very decent price for each night. 
Campground has a pool and decent showers and bathrooms. 
Management was very sweet and helpful. Can buy firewood and ice at main office. 
Will plan on going back next year. Highly recommend for those new to the RV scene as we were.
