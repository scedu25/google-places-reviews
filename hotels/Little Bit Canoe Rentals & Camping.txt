Little Bit Canoe Rentals & Camping
Rating: 5
Text: A lovely place. Nice big sites, all level and neatly groomed. Linda and her husband are meticulous owners, and are gracious, kind and super helpful. Very reasonable rates, with a discount for multi-night stays. Primitive sites are a little cheaper than full hook up. 

Everything is kept spotlessly groomed and well-kept. Located right on a quiet river. Fun for kids to explore the banks and find frogs and crayfish.  They have a pop machine on site, as well as almost any supply you could ask for - excellent firewood, ice, snacks, cooking equipment (in case you forgot something), mosquito repellent, etc. They delivered a nice load of firewood right to our site. They have a nice, spotlessly clean indoor shower. It is included in the price of the site, as long as you have your own supplies. If you need towels, soap, shampoo, then there is a small fee. It's located near a road, so there can be some road noise, but it didn't really bother us.

Text: Great rates for canoeing and I like that they take you up stream to any of their drop off points and you float back to your vehicle
