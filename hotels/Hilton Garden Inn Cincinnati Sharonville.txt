Hilton Garden Inn Cincinnati/Sharonville
Rating: 4
Text: Nice hotel. Stayed 7 days while attending GE aviation engine school. Very clean and spacious rooms. Close to interstate 75. Several restaurants nearby. Only negative thing is that you have to pay $10 for continental breakfast. Other than that it's great.

Text: This was the worst place I've ever been too. The manager was on her cellphone while we are saying we need things. Couldn't get a blanket. The Manager said she couldn't make coffee because she didn't work this shift. A manager should know how to do everything. The water  wouldn't get hot. Took an hour or more before it started to get hot. The beds are very wore.  The Manger amaria was most disrespectful manager I ever met.   I am not ever happy with this hotel.

Text: Comfortable room. Contemporary and staff is nice. Two stars because I ordered a $17 Cobb salad and it was the size of a side salad. Two stars because this hotel is located by a freeway and close to nothing. There is a sports bar down the street (albeit it is in an old Pizza Hut building and pretty...well...towny). I've stayed at many Hilton Garden Inns and really enjoy them. This time was a bit off for me. Could have been my mood...who can say.

Text: The hotel is older but they have recently updated the rooms. The only original item that I could detect is the thermostat for the room. The rooms are very clean. There is no musty oder or heavy fragrance from air freshener in the room which is too common in too many hotels. I would recommend.

Text: Rooms are large even on the 2nd and third floor, very high ceilings. Spacious, clean, very modern looking. Right next to the highway, but far enough as to not hear it. Breakfast is not free, and the furniture is a bit out of date. Would very much recommend.
