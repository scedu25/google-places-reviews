Buckhorn Campground

Text: This is the real location for the campground the other marker is up a single lane road at a dead end. Provides very easy access to the lake. Very clean well maintained. Level gravel pads with water and electrical hookups. The sites are a bit close together and in the open.

Text: Nice campground: $24 for a site with hookups, $14 for a primitive site. 
I stayed while bicycle touring the Transam. 

Primitive sites aren't located near the showers, but all sites have a lamppost, fire ring, and picnic table. 

Wi-Fi signal is extremely poor. Doesn't reach farther than a 100'.

If you are pitching a tent ? in the full hookup sites, be aware that the ground is too hard to use stakes, so set your tent up in the grass. 

The lake is very close by, and while the river is murky it is very refreshing to dunk into. 

Oh and there's stay dogs that come out at night! Booooo
