Text: We got this hotel room at the last minute. It's pretty nice. The bed is very cozy and comfortable and the suite is very spacious. However, I give the hotel two stars for a few reasons. The first is that there was a centipede in the bedroom. My husband scooped it up in a cup and put it outside. The second is that there is a little mold on the ceiling of our room. Unfortunately, the vending area leaves a lot to be desired. No Coke products, only plain baked chips, candy bars, cookies and some ice cream. It's also extremely expensive as the hotel doesn't have actual vending machines but a little vending store that it runs. There was also a dead bug in one of the slots that should have had some type of food in it. On the plus side, the hotel is in a five minute drive of plenty of restaurants, a mall and a plaza that has stores like Wal-Mart and Best Buy.

Text: We stayed overnight so that we could meet family for the weekend. The room was a little bit smaller than what I expected, in that furniture send cramped. However, the room itself was very nice, and the staff was extremely helpful. Breakfast was good, very similar to a Hampton breakfast. Pool and hot tub are decent sized for this size of property. I would stay again if the need arises.
