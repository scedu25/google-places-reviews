Text: Our family stayed at the Grace House B&B as we visited Shawnee National Park, Garden of the Gods, and Cave-In-Rock. The Grace House was a comforting, cozy, and relaxing place to stay. The owners and managers were welcoming and took care of our every need. They cooked us a delicious breakfast at 8:00 AM and made sure we had the energy we needed for our hikes. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a quiet and peaceful place to call home for a few days!

Text: Very friendly nice people. Good movie selection for the downstairs TV (I recommend Romancing the Stone!) and overall welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are very cozy, with soft carpet floors, not the hard floors of big name hotels. The breakfast was delicious.
