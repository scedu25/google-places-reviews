Embassy Suites by Hilton Columbus
Rating: 4
Text: Nice rooms with an updated common area. Friendly and welcoming staff. Good overall experience. Temperature in the common area may be a little on the cool side for some but that could have been due to my visit coinciding with a significant turn to colder weather.

Text: Nice rooms, clean areas all around, spacious, and exceptionally friendly staff. Beds were typical of your better hotels in terms of size (smaller than I prefer), but the mattresses were firm and flat. Bar and lounges had plenty of areas to host groups small and large.

Text: GREAT place to stay -- VERY nice folks working there starting with Robert (blond fellow) I think his name, at the front desk!! We accidentally booked the airport Embassy instead of this one RIGHT by the hospital we needed to attend -- he got us fixed up!! Hopefully the Dr will do the same for my lovely gal today!!

Text: Check in was quick and easy even with them having some sort of convention staying there (which I was not a part of). Was able to try the workout room which had some free weights and cardio equipment. The workout room was clean and everything seemed to be fairly well maintained.
