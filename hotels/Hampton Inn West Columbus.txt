Text: Great professional and friendly service. 
Room was clean, just like new, and laid out well. Not cramped and cluttered. Will definitely stay there again.

Text: It is a very nice hotel. The manager was very nice with us. The rooms are comfortable and roomy, the beds are on the softer side. The shower feels a little short though for someone who is 5' 8". Breakfast was great, the omelets they have were very tasty along with the potatoes, but your mileage may vary.

Text: Great place, nice people, pool was great and way to get to. Breakfast was a bit skimpy and cold. All in all great stay.

Text: The staff were wonderful and very accommodating. I was able to check in early and they let me check out late. I would highly recommend staying here.
