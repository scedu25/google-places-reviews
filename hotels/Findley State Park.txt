Findley State Park
Rating: 5
Text: My family just spent the weekend camping here and it was absolutely wonderful. Sure, the weather was perfect and that had something to do with our experience, but it was mostly the park. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. They enforced the park rules forcefully, yet kindly. The park was super clean,  from the camp grounds to the swimming beach. The kayak rentals were well priced. The trails were rustic and woodsy. We fished from the hiking trails and my children (5, 2 & 2) each caught multiple fish, which delighted them. If you want a social camp ground experience, you can have that. If you prefer a more introverted camping experience,  you can have that because the campground has such a variety of sites. The views of the lake were camera made and the stars at night were out of this world. We loved it so much and will return again often.

Text: We have camped here since my kids were little. We have done both tent and RV camped here. Some of the best memories ever. We love the fishing, fire pits, trails, kayaking and the camp store. It's peaceful here. Love the wildlife. Bathrooms are always clean.

Text: Great state park and campground.  Large campsites, easy access, very good facilities at reasonable prices.  The camp store is well stocked and even serves hit food.  The lake has kayak rentals and a beach, and there is a disc gold course here too. It's an easy drive in/out and worth a stop if you are near.  Swing in for camping, hiking, or just a family picnic.

Text: We love Findley. Beautiful wooded campsites. They've really put a lot of work into updating and fixing up the place. Our favorite camping destination.

Text: The best and only state park that I've been too. It offers a nice stereotypical Americana camping experience, complete with canoeing or kayaking on the lake, campfires, and a massive disc golf course that spans through the forest. 

 Along with that there's a sand volleyball court, a basketball court, tetherball, a playground, bike/hiking trails, and a beach.

The showers and restrooms are newer and clean, and nice.
 
The lake is murky, but is clean by EPA standards, has good fishing, some snails and oddly... some clams(?).
