Text: Ms. Seema was very nice. Last minute on a Saturday I was looking for a suite and needed it for a week. She was able to accommodate me. She made sure I had enough face towels, body towels, shampoo and conditioner. Once I got to the room I noticed the room was not vacuumed, I went right back to her and she got the housekeepers to come and clean it Sunday morning. Best associate they have!

Text: Get what you pay for. Carpet kinda dirty. 2/3 of the parking lot was being painted so instead of making sure there were enough spots for guests, they made everyone park on the streets, making the walk back to the building over a block away. Tiny pool with overflowing basket of towels that didn't change the whole 12 hours we were there. Service was fine and the best were comfy.

Text: Right when you walk in you the dirty walls. The room smelled like smoke even though it was non smoking and the bathroom smelled worse. The room was outdated. The only good things were the staff was friendly, the bed was clean, and the bathroom side from the smoke was clean as well.

Text: First time staying at this Super 8. We most definitely enjoyed our stay. The young lady at the front desk that checked us in was very pleasant. 
The room was exceptionally clean, the cleaning person forgot to leave towels and coffee in the room but it's all good. The next morning we had a really good breakfast to start our day, the property and hotel are both very well kept. Great job Super 8

Text: Beds were comfy.  Hallways and elevators smelled.  Floors in room were very dirty.   Breakfast was not good.  Waffle mix too watery.,  orange juice was a strange color,  rolls were old icing on then was discolored.
