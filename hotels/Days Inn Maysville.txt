Text: No late check-outs given and was told it's because housekeeping has a limited amount of time to clean 8 rooms...my question is, who stays in the other 50 plus rooms? 
   They weren't kidding when they said a limited amount of time either, because my room looked like it had only been glanced over, with trash remaining underneath the bed skirts on the floor, as well as crumbs ect...it looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in quite some time.
   The sheets were extremely wrinkled too, not that I care if my sheets are wrinkly, let's just say I'd like to hope that it was because they were left in the dryer too long. #FingersCrossed
   I'm giving this place three stars, merely because the older lady at the front desk overnight, was extremely kind and helpful! 
   The way that she scolded a couple of drunk youngsters though, has me thinking this hotel only remains open, because of its bar, and the fact that this is a great place for 20-somethings to screw around!

Text: Very helpful and friendly. Service was quick. Kids love the pool and the fact we could grill out next to the pool area. Definitely would come again.

Text: Walls were very dirty, water in shower constantly dripped, and front door had large gap. Breakfast may as well come from a vending machine. The only reason we stayed was because all of the other hotels nearby were booked or only had smoking rooms left. However, the price was very cheap (accordingly) and the front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.
