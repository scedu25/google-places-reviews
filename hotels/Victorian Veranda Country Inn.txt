Text: I attended a wedding reception in the "barn". Beautiful place. There was a large area upstairs to eat, and a dance floor downstairs. I think about 200 guests were present. I didn't stay at the inn, but it's a beautiful house. The wedding party stayed there and they loved it.

Text: I got married here in 2013 and I haven't forgotten the wonderful experience. The management really understands how to welcome a bridal party. 5 stars isn't enough.
