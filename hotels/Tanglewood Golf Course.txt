Tanglewood Golf Course

Text: Very friendly staff. Greens in excellent shape, as good as any in the area. Fairways need mowing and the tee boxes in awful shape.Cart paths border on dangerous; in very poor condition.  Challenging, hilly course. For the price not bad, but better courses at similar price in the metro area. We played with a couple who did a Groupon deal with condo rental and they thought it was a great experience.

Text: What a great course! Went out on a weekday morning and it was not busy at all. My girlfriend gets so frustrated and sometimes hates golf. I went here with her because she wanted to try a course once for me, and then never have to go again. She had a frustrating day, but later in the day she was happy with the idea of going again the next week, because she liked the course so much. Its a beautiful, country setting. I am basically a beginner and I handled it just fine. It was challenging as many fairways were a little up and down and hilly, but it wasn't too bad. The course's blue and white tees would be a sure challenge. Example: Even though I played the red, which was challenging but manageable, there are some holes where the blue and white tees are hitting from a far away, weird angle over water, while the red did not even hit over the water. NOTE: The difference between the red tee and blue/white tee is significantly more than just distance on many holes. The fairways were in excellent shape. The grass around the green even got shorter as if it were a real PGA course. The greens were smooth and solid green as they should be. Not one spot on this course and its fairways had any extensive brown color - let alone any brown at all. It was ALL smooth and green, just like a real course. I will be going back very soon because it is fairly close to my house. It is my go-to local course from now on.
