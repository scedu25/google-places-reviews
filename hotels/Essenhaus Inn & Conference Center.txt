Essenhaus Inn & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: It was an excellent, cozy room, with a nice view of the fountain and bridge that were out front. It was also just a very short walk away from all the shops, restaurant with delicious food, bakery and a theater. We were provided with complimentary breakfast and had a nice indoor swimming pool, hot tub and game room to keep us occupied. The employees were all very friendly and took great care of us!

Text: We were recently at the Essenhaus for a reunion.  It was ok.  The rooms are dated, so much so that my son asked if we were in a nursing home.  We chose to have the dinner at the Inn instead of the restaurant... that was a mistake.  It was not the same experience.  Yes, we did have a private room but we had to pay extra for it.  You do not get to chose your pie nor is the popular peanut butter spread or soft drinks included.  We even thought the food was better at the restaurant, even tho we were told it was the same.  Pluses:  Staff was friendly and efficient and it is very family friendly.  The grounds are beautiful.
