Text: Lived here so far 12 years of my 17 year life its a good place but needs better management and upkeep is horrible and lengthy its a good place to live if you have lowish income. Lots of my friends have moved to other places so It could use more things to do rn the things to do are swing, play bball, play soccer without goals and walk around the neighborhood.
