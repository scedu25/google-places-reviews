Text: Had a really good stay the first night. I just wanted to thank you for being pet friendly. It means a lot to a lot of people out there being able to take their pets where they're welcome.

Text: Unfortunately I cannot give a good review. The room was mediocre at best. The floor was so filthy the bottom of your feet would be black after walking on the floor. The mini fridge that I had to ask for barely kept anything cold. The bed was so uncomfortable I woke with a headache and back pain every day. There was almost no water pressure. And the Wi-Fi was so slow I couldn't even stream video. All in all this was a less than desirable experience.

Text: Not a good room for price. A light kept me up all night didn’t turn off. No carpet and the room stank. Can get better amenities for lower price elsewhere.

Text: At first everything was fine until the next morning and I turned the light on and roaches scattered. I couldn't let at first because the floor is dark wood color. But I definitely shook all my bags out a left.
