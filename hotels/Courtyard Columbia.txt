Courtyard Columbia

Text: Our annual employee recognition luncheon was held at Courtyard Columbia. We are a large group, so they used a couple of rooms opened up for us. Since we were in the back & couldn't see, they had large screens for us. Our waiter, Thomas, was great! We started teasing him & started with some great comebacks. All were quite appropriate, but perfect. We would have been happy with someone who just smiled and was polite, but we ended up with someone who made us laugh. Very happy table! The food was pretty good. I'm a picky eater, so that's a compliment. I heard a couple of complaints, but most thought it was good. Overall, a great experience for work! And I found the head of the waiters so I could compliment Thomas before we left!

Text: We were there for a wedding all weekend and this place was great. The room was just what we needed and the event space was amazing. The breakfast situation is a little confusing, there's no continental breakfast and it takes a while to get what you order. The food was great once you get it! Overall, a great stay.

Text: I was here for two weeks. Comfortable and clean rooms and staff was fantastic from front desk, housekeeping and the Bistro. My only complaint is the TVs in the rooms. They are terribly slow when changing channels and although there is a "guide" button on the remote, there is no TV guide, so you have to press every channel to see the programming. Residence Inns by Marriott and other Courtyards where I have stayed all have better TVs, service and guides.

Text: Courtyard is a great place to hold an event. The staff is very helpful. Food is not and but I do wish they had more vegetarian options.
