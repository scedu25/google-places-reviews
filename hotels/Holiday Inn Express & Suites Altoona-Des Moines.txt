Holiday Inn Express & Suites Altoona-Des Moines
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed because of the closeness  to Adventureland and Prairie Meadows. The room was perfect for us and close to the stairs and outdoor card access door. I loved the fact that Adventureland Drive is right outside their parking lot, so a person doesn't have to get onto the interstate to travel to either venue. I found this hotel to be in a perfect place and close distance to our two adventures for the weekend. The breakfast had many choices from cinnamon rolls to pancakes. Our plan is to return to this motel in the very near future.

Text: Clean and staff is very professional. Hotel is starting to show its age compared to the new Hampton Inn next door. Convenient with access to I-80. Can't really complain too much.
