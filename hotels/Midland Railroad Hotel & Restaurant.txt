Text: Gorgeous, historic hotel. Responsive, kind staff. Delicious continental breakfast featuring locally sourced eggs, jellies & jams & artisan sausages. Bar & restaurant with excellent food. Each room has it's own charm. The patio is lovely when weather permits an outdoor gathering.

Text: We enjoyed our stay at the Midland Railroad Hotel this past Friday evening.  We found our room to be very clean and cosy.  All of the staff were so friendly and helpful.  We had dinner in the restaurant and it was delicious.  Our waitress was wonderful.  We also enjoyed our visit with the owner, who was gracious and couldn't have been more down home and friendly.  Our continental breakfast was so very good as well.  Thank you for making this a pleasant stay.  Warm and welcoming from the minute we stepped in until the minute we stepped out.

Text: Booked this hotel on the fly yesterday, as I  was trying to make it home the next day and I have to admit it was a great treat!   Off the highway by a few miles, but worth the drive.  Well maintained, comfortable bed, friendly staff, clean and well decorated.  Stepping inside was like stepping back in time.  Well done throughout. From what I could tell they were full on a Monday night, so if you can plan a night here you should.

Text: Truly magic place. Historic yet modern with old world charm. Great owner who lovingly restored the hotel. Organic garden in tbe patio area smells are inspiring. Great event like Whiskey tasting and murder mysteries.

Text: Attended a wedding at the Hotel. The outdoor location and reception venue were very nice. Room was good but on the smaller side (historic building and all). Staff were friendly and accommodating.
