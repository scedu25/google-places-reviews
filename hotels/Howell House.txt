Text: We had a lovely time. Beds were comfy and it was so clean! The hosts were very kind and they did excellent work to make the whole house feel like we were living in the late 19th century!! Also, the breakfast was the best meal we’ve had on our trip!

Text: This bed and breakfast was wonderful! This was our first experience and now the bar is set high. Extremely clean, nice beds, wonderful breakfast! We stayed in room #2. It accomodated our family nicely, having room for a pack and play as well as a toddler cot. We were still able to more around the room easily with our children. Joan and Steve are very kind! The home is beautiful decorated. The exterior is just as beautiful.  The entire experience is one for the books.
