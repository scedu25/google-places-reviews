Text: Gorgeous place to camp overnight!   Not too far off the highway, and plus it's free!  I stayed in a tent one night and do NOT recommend it..  it's way too windy!  But if you're staying in a camper or a car it's a great location. Plenty of spots. Porta potty available. Fire rings and picnic tables too
