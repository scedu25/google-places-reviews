Holiday Inn Express Portage

Text: This location is not the newest or even newly updated; however, it is very well maintained.  The main reason for the high rating is the staff.  Colletta, at the front desk, is the best.  Besides providing a warm greeting, she was friendly, professional and informative...definitely best face forward to the public.  Additionally, each member of staff we encountered was polite and helpful.  Our stay was a last minute decision, the result of a key breaking off in a deadbolt at home.  The staff at this property helped turn a stressful situation into a pleasant experience.

Text: We stayed here with our two dogs, a toddler, my husband and myself. Upon check in, the two ladies upfront, Collette being one of them, were very sweet. She called after we got settled to see how our room was. The room was clean and pretty quiet. The breakfast was great! We had been traveling from Anchorage in our SUV, and many of the places we got breakfast weren't cooked well or tasted off. This was the best breakfast we'd had in a long time! The warm cinnamon rolls were a big hit with my boys! We were also able to take breakfast up to our room, which is convenient for us with our two dogs needing to be in the room. Thank you for the stay!
