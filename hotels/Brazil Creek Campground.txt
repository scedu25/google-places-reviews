Brazil Creek Campground

Text: Nice clean campground. Stayed here the night before kicking off the Berryman Loop. Was a week day, had the whole place to my self. Plenty of places for a great night hang with your friends. 

I will definitely be back. Couldn't recommend the Berryman Loop more. Trail was gorgeous and one of my favorite places off the OT

Text: A great little campground if passing through the Ozark Trail or just need a cheap place to pitch a tent. I stayed here on a weekday afternoon in July and had the place completely to myself. For being popular for those with horses, it was quite clean as well. About 5-10 campsites, many hidden out of the way, though only one had a picnic table and grate. Only downside was the number of spiders in the area. It seemed as though much of the brush and the trails through it were covered in webs and when I woke up, I had at least 6-10 red daddy-long-leg looking spiders on it. May be common in the area, but a bit disconcerting to someone who doesn't like dealing with them.
