Text: Great location for our purposes. Easy to get on and off I64. Food was good for breakfast and 5:30 kickstart. I love the amenities included in the price of the hotel. I'd stay here again. Parking is easy. Plenty of spaces. Staff is all very friendly. Maid services we're also great and friendly. We went to the restaurant attached. They're extensive but it's convenient so that's great for this hotel!

Text: This review is for the Stony River restaurant in the Drury Plaza Hotel. Stony River restaurant is an underrated gem, in my opinion. Delicious steaks, seafood, salads. Very good wine, beer, cocktail, whiskey and bourbon selection. Usually quieter than some of the other great restaurants in the area. (In other words, if you want to have a conversation over dinner, this is a good place to go.) Food portions are generous, especially the desserts. Try the filet and chocolate cake. Both are delicious.

Text: The Drury Plaza Hotel was pefect. The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was friendly and attentive of our needs. When we had an issue with the bath tub, the front desk immediately sent maintainence to fix the problem. They provide the guests with drinks and food in the evening. They offer a wide selection of food for breakfast.

Text: I recently stayed here for a wedding. The hotel was great. We greatly enjoyed our stay and they were so accommodating. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star rating is because the mini fridge did not cool properly in either room and it is a little confusing to get into the correct parking lot. You enter the parking lot from the back of the building. There are posted signs but they are hard to see at dusk & in the dark. The Breakfast provided was one of the best I have had at a hotel. Plenty of selection and well prepared. All in a all it was a great stay.
