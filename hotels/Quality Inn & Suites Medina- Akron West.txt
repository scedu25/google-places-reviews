Rating: 4
Text: Just returned from a 4 night stay here. Room was great Staff was friendly Housekeeping staff should be more considerate about guests there was one day where housekeeping did not clean my room and I did not have the do not disturb sign on the door thankfully the front desk made a note. Otherwise great stay would defently return.

Text: I don't smoke but was surprised to see this hotel still offers smoking rooms. They also note that there is a $200 penalty for smoking in a non-smoking room, so make sure you select what you prefer. Our non-smoking room was very clean with no indication anyone ever violated the policy, so the fees must work. Everything else was exactly what you expect from a Quality Inn, so we had a great stay at a great value. We would definitely stay here again!

Text: We were utilizing their conference room to host a gender reveal for my sister-in-law and brother's new baby. This location and their sister site in Brunswick are our go-to places for parties and get togethers. The staff are incredibly nice and helpful, the space accommodates our small groups, tables and chairs are provided, and we get to bring in our own food and decorations. We will be back again and again!
