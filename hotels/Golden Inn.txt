Rating: 4
Text: Decent place. Very clean. Very friendly. Bed pretty comfortable. Quaint little room.  Old fashioned.  Would definitely stay again.  Not many frills, but a good value.  Cute little town.

Text: Quaint, super-clean, and well-lit. A person can read or do needlework without eyestrain. A table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, HD-tv, nicer than most budget motels. Staff is welcoming and helpful. We would certainly stay here again. Not wheelchair accessible, but handicap-friendly.

Text: The office was locked,  phone calls not answered, and no services are available after hours. Atrocious. Stay away from this place. Many better choices available within short driving distance.

Text: The staff was very helpful and courteous. Service was excellent with clean towels and linens daily. We expected a run down little place and were greatly surprised with a spacious room that was VERY clean, neat and held all the amenities we needed. Family friendly and no one complained when our little ones were obnoxious and noisy. We will definitely stay here again next time we come to visit the family.
