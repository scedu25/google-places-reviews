Text: The event was fantastic. And the staff seemed super friendly, other than the bar tender on Sunday. They told us the bar would be open at 2. She didn't start setting up till 2, which it then took her 45min to set up. All we wanted was beer in a bottle, which she could have easily gotten for us, but she never asked. That was a terrible experience.

Text: Great place, always look forward to staying there. The salads at the bar are wonderful. Two pools, one indoor, one outdoor. Rooms are clean and beds comfy. Air conditioning units tend to be loud and hard to moderate temps. Nice fitness area as well

Text: It was awesome. I had so much fun at the wedding there. The fish was okay, could have been better but the chicken was really good! Get the chicken!

Text: We had a terrible time to check in the first room they gave us stinks? like mildew and there was a large bug in the bathroom. We had to go back to the desk to tell them what happened. They then sent us to another room to check that out. So it took us 40 minutes to check in. Not once did anyone at the desk offer to assist us or get a luggage cart. I voiced my concerns to the manager and he was very nonchalant about it all. The hotel itself is decent it's a comfortable place to sleep. But the hassle of getting checked in made a very bad impression. Also they have a heated hot tub and heated pool and neither of them are warm at all. Not impressed!!!

Text: I attended a networking event in the ballroom. The space was big enough for a large amount of people, well lit, plenty of entrances/exits, and the temperature stayed comfortable during the 4 hour event. The facility was clean and elegant. I would go back for other events hosted at this facility.
