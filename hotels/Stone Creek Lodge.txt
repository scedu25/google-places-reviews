Stone Creek Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: We  have stayed at several lake resorts and campgrounds, and have never met nicer people and staff.  The room is decorated rustic and the cleanliness cannot be matched.  A very peaceful weekend.  Highly recommended.

Text: I had heard about the great fishing at Stockton lake and a few friends of mine decided to give it a try.  I was surprised how easy Stone Creek Lodge was to find.  The staff was so helpful and accommodating to our needs.  This place basically has everything you need.  Whether you decide to grill set by the fire pit or just order a pizza.  We were pleasantly pleased with the rooms and found them to be very clean and comfortable.  The three days we spent here was amazing and we caught some real nice fish.  I will stay longer next time.

Text: Pizza was amazing! Didn't expect it when we first walked in, but this place turned out to be a little gem. Rooms were clean and beds are comfortable for the price you can beet this place. Boat ramp was very convenient and had a nice dock to tie up to while we loaded coolers and beach bags. We also enjoyed having the fire pits in the evenings. Great for having a few  cocktails and roasting marshmallows. Can't wait to get back on our next lake weekend!

Text: This resort is top notch and highly recommend! The staff is very accommodating, as well on top of keeping the property well maintained. The convenience of staying here is great, the store sells pizza, snacks, beer and other drink options. They also carry a great selection of bait and tackle! We have stayed here multiple times with enjoying Stockton lakes fishing and recreation, also have stayed here during the fall for our public land deer hunts around the lake.

Text: The rooms were very clean with everything we needed for our stay. Great location close to town and a boat ramp right behind the resort. They even have pizza and beer if you don't feel like going to town after a day on the water. Highly recommended!
