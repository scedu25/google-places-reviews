Text: Only one night stay. I got a nice, comfortable and clean room. I hesitated to stay here after reading some negative reviews. Reservation was easy over the phone. Jose was very polite and even offered me no charge if after checking in I was not satisfied with the room. Front desk people also helpful. The gal even let get some orange juice before checking out after 11am. I am giving 3 stars because carpet walkways and stairs showed several dirty spots and needed more attention. Will come back assuming will receive same service.

Text: I would never give them a star! We checked for bed bugs when we checked in! Next morning they were all over! They tried to move us to another room and it still was infested with them! Do not stay here! It should be shut down!
