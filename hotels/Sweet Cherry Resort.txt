Text: Cute little cabins. A fun, laid back atmosphere. And the pool is always sparkling clean. A great place to camp as a family, or gather as a group.

Text: Perfect for a weekend getaway! we absolutely love it, we took our 2 dogs all the time and now every time we go the dogs even know the cabin we always get is really private but please note that we always go the weekend after a holiday weekend like 4th of July or Labor day so is literally us and maybe couple people more in the place so is perfect and private.

Also there is a person on site that you can buy wood for the bonfire or you can collect your own, the staff is really friendly but also they respect your privacy.

The beach on Hagar Park lake Michigan is located in a walking distance from the resort and Saint Joseph is located witting 15 minutes drive in a beautiful road.

The resort has a pool and a playground for the kids.

The cabins are really rustic and also is a camping area on site.

Text: We rented out a row of small cottages for the weekend we got married for all of our bridesmaids and groomsmen along with a few other guests. the owners are super nice and friendly.  The cottages were the perfect colors and size. We had an amazing time.
The bathrooms are cottage size, but you get a whole cottage to yourself for only $65!
It's an adorable place. :)
