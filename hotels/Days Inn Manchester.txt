Text: Good firm beds, basic clean room, nothing fancy, and it comes with Archie Bunker's chair which was comfortable. I sleep w windows open as it was cool and dry. A/C, fan left an odor, so I was lucky to have good weather.

Text: Pool was listed as an amenity.  It had not been working for 8 yrs. Staff ok.  Breakfast consisted of toast and cereal. Overall not the best experience.

Text: The owner boarded up the pool to use the space as storage. The staff are given so little to work with that you can tell the owner is trying to run the hotel as LEAN as possible. The towels were not big enough to wrap around me and I'm a size 8. No amenities, no shampoo, no potty paper. I had to plug in the refrigerator and the microwave. Carpets are dingy and the vacuums when they are used make the rooms smell like a sachet of rotten fruit.
