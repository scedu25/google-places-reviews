Text: Beautiful hotel. Nice location. Service was top notch as expected. Bed was "okay" comfort-wise. Room was clean and the place has been updated. Will definitely stay again.

Text: This is a great place to stay. There's plenty to choose from for breakfast and to go bags if you don't have time to eat before you leave. There's a nice view of a pond to look out at while you enjoy breakfast. There's a pool area and a fitness center.

Text: Friendly, helpful midnight-shift staff. Breakfast was very good & they served an hour longer than normal to accommodate us Eldora Speedway racing fans. Clean & nice.

Text: Nice hotel, very unfriendly and unprofessional front desk staff. Their 'don't give a darn' attitude was very clear. Both the late afternoon and the morning staff the next day.
