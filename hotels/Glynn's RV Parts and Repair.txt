Text: Glynn has everything you need to make the repairs yourself, or have Glynn do it for you. I've found Glynn to be very detailed with everything he does. We would highly recommend Glynn's RV Repair.

Text: I've used Glynn for mainly winterizing my RV. He never leads me to getting things that are not necessary for my 1989 Monaco. He is completely trustworthy. I will always recommend him to others

Text: Hi
I am a single retired women that decided she needed to make a big lifestyle change.  I bougbt a 5th wheel and moved myself to Bennett Springs.
When I first moved here all I heard was....if you need anything call Glynn.  These word of mouth recommendations were exactly what I needed to hear.
It wasn't too long before I started having some issues with my camper and I did what everyone said to.  I called Glynn.  This man has come to my rescue more than once in the last 2 years.  He has taught me the right way to live full time in a RV.  He has my key and at anytime I need his help...I give him my blessing to just go ahead and go into my camper.  He is trusted by everyone.  His honesty is next to none.
His work is impeccable.  I feel safe in knowing that Glynn will be there for me in a flash if at all possible..
Best of luck Glynn
and thank you for everything
Phyllis
