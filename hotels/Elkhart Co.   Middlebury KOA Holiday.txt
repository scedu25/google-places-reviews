Elkhart Co. / Middlebury KOA Holiday
Rating: 5
Text: Another beautiful day here at the Middlebury KOA!  Hope and Nick did it again y'all! Firewood was already waiting at my site when I arrived, and I didn't even order any yet!  They arranged a shuttle for my family and I to go to the exotic animal farm while our RV was getting repaired.  I love this place!

Text: Small campground but close to lots of fun places to visit. The grounds and restrooms were maintained well. I was very happy to see a fenced in dog area where the dogs could run around off leash. Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but seemed friendly. Have stayed here several times and plan to again. I love that it's close to places with lots of fun things to do.

Text: Have stayed here several times while having work done on my trailer at the factory.  Have always had a great stay and they are very willing to accommodate you even when your schedule is a little crazy.  Definitely will stay here again.

Text: This was our first time camping at a KOA campground and we loved every minute of it. Hope and her staff were awesome at making you feel at home. The campground is well maintained, with many activities and beautiful trails to keep busy. Or just pull up a lawn chair and enjoy the camp fire with old and new friends. 
 Thank you for making our stay memorable.

Text: One of the most relaxing campgrounds we've stayed in and we've been traveling in motor homes for over 20 years. Staff were very helpful. Our site was a generous pull through with trees and greenery on our windows side and an open view of the campground in front. Teenagers camping there were happily pedaling the carts around instead of just texting. Kids played basketball too. It still was a quiet place for us seniors. Middlebury is a beautiful area with great food and shopping. We wish we could have stayed longer.
