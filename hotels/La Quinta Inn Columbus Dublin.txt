La Quinta Inn Columbus Dublin

Text: It's OK. The location is quite good for restaurants and convenience stores etc., and easy to access. The building interior is a bit dated and showing a lot of wear, but kept pretty clean considering. The coffee was watery and breakfast was bare minimum. The room was fine. Nothing to impress, but no real disappointment either. The TV actually had a channel/programming guide which was greatly appreciated. So many hotel TVs don't have this obvious feature. The price I got on the room was excellent (much lower than nearby HIE at the time), and I feel the quality of stay was overall very good value. At that price, I would definitely stay again. If I stay in the area again and the rate is more comparable to other options, I'll try somewhere else.

Text: I love this place. Great location, always easy to check in and check out. They always make accommodations for me to check in early. Only thing is their breakfast isn't the best. No hot options and no alternatives for people with dietary restrictions such as almond or soy milk

Text: Place is located on the north west side of Columbus with easy access to the major highways. The area around the hotel is safe and there are many restaurant choices around the hotel.

Text: Bed sheets felt fresh the carpet was decent. We had a king size bed which was very spacious and comfortable. definitely did not want to get out of it in the morning. The TV was in a very comfortable place on a dresser. Bathroom was clean everything seemed really neat in the room I didn't see any scuff marks on any of the dressers or countertops.
The experience was very enjoyable on a road trip. Researched for more La Quintas along the way.
