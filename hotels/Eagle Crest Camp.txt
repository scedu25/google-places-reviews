Text: I love Eagle Creast Camp. The staff is amazing,and the camp is amazing to. This camp was the camp that brought me closer to God. I was really sad when I left,because my parents went in to Training at the Training Collage in Chicago. I made a lot of friends there. Most of My best friends I have today, I met there. I miss Eagle Creast Camp more then ever. I hope I can vist some time.
