Hampton Inn & Suites Omaha Southwest-La Vista
Rating: 5
Text: Great Hampton Inn. I travel a lot for work and would rate this one as of the nicer midrange hotels I've stayed at in the last year. Exceptionally clean all around. Friendly and helpful staff. Quiet, comfortable, spacious rooms. Excellent bathrooms. Delicious  breakfast and nice breakfast area. Would stay again if I find myself in Omaha again.

Text: Rooms are nice. Staff is friendly. Pools, work out room, etc are great. Only complaint was coffee and orange juice we're very watered down and the breakfast was bland.

Text: Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Nice pool. Couldn't ask for more. It actually looks like these guys do change the sheets and comforters- which is a big deal in my travels.
