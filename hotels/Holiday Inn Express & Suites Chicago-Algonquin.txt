Text: Well you know what you get when you sign up to Holiday Inn. I definitely enjoyed my stay. The breakfast is good. The rooms are the usual.
The thing that got this one a review, and even more, a 5 star? The location  was good for my travel purposes which was not vacation but business, so the many shopping centers helped out a lot. The staff is not abundant, but works hard. 
I would like to give a big, big shout out to Jack, a manager that sings like Michael Jackson and looks like Bruno Mars ;).

Text: I thought the room was kind of old, could use a carpet change and some new beds. Felt humid on the room. Just needs a face-lift. Staff was nice.
