Text: Beautiful architectural masterpiece. Owner has instilled much loving care in era appropriate restorations. He loves to share the history of the house and region.

Highlights are original stained glass windows surrounding the beautiful ornate staircase

Breakfast was extravagant.

They went out of their way in helping us with ride arrangements, and have an associated shuttle service.

Text: Beautiful home.  Lovely accommodations.  Great hosts.  Front bedroom next to street was too noisy.  Didn't get one of the rooms I booked, had to settle on that one.  Other than that, our stay was very enjoyable.

Text: Great place to stay the night before or after bicycling the Katy Trail. We enjoyed a delicious meal prepared by Annette and her husband and they greeted us with a very civilized glass of sherry. She's British and her husband is half French. They remodeled and refurbished a few years ago so it's very comfortable with old world charm. A wonderful stay and yummy hot breakfast too.
