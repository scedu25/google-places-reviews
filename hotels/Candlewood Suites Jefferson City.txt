Candlewood Suites Jefferson City
Rating: 5
Text: The Front Desk and staff are friendly and helpful.  Hotel and surroundings are kept up.  Wednesdays are Guest Appreciation Day.  They provide a light meal for the guests.  They also do it on special occasions, such as Great Eclipse Day, the hotel made breakfast for the guests and came around and gave us a goodie bag of space themed snacks and gum.

Text: I had a great stay here. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help you out. The rooms are spacious with a nice kitchenette, dishwasher and a full size fridge.  They have a great gym with good equipment. They have free dinner on Wednesday nights and free coffee 24/7!

Text: This hotel is not for short term stays. It's designed for long term stays - weeks or months at a time. They only clean your room once a week, so if you're a messy person, you have to live with your own mess everyday. There's no breakfast at all, not even simple coffee or tea, which is a pain since even Motel 6s have basic coffee. Doors slam really hard; your walls actually shake when your neighbors go in and out of their rooms. Walls are pretty thin too. Gym is really basic. There's no pool. The YMCA across the street is not free for guests (you get a discount). The free laundry onsite is OK. One of the washing machines has gunk built up in the rubber seal around the door. Doesn't look like anybody's cleaned it in years. I stopped using that machine when I discovered all that nasty gunk.

Text: The rooms were nice for the price point, and I think there was a pool! Everything looked great and was very on par with holiday inn or other nice, mid-price hotels.
