Text: Had an amazing time , Shot of fireworks. The people were pleasant and very helpful. Pool was in great condition kids had a blast. Camped overnight in tents even though they really aren't set up for that and they gave us a very large area to set up for 5 adults and four children we had visitors and they were not unwelcome... All around great place would defiantly go there again.and again.and again.
