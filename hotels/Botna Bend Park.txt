Text: There is a 2.00 usage fee if not camping it was worth it to me. My boys spent an hour on the archery range and I walked the trails. The elk and bison were neat also.

Text: For RV camping it was not for us.  Too far off the highway, no water, sewer or wi-fi.  The park is beautiful and they have concrete pads. The restrooms were disgusting.
