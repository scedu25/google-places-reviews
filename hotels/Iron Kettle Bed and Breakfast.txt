Text: We had a wonderful experience! We had both dinner and breakfast there during our stay and both were delicious! Ben took our dietary requirements (vegetarian) into account and designed creative and amazing meals! We also loved the collection of board games in our room! We would love to stay there again!

Text: Visited the Iron Kettle for a Christmas party - food dishes were delicious and something a little different. Toured the Inn while we were there, very cool place to stay. Host was extremely friendly and chuck full of information on the history of the Inn itself as well as the surround area. He also tries to incorporate as much locally sourced product into the dishes as possible. A uniquely wonderful experience.
