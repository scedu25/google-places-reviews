Text: Very friendly hostess. Machelle was such a sweet person. Talking to her was like reconnecting with an old friend. She made delicious breakfasts for us every day. Already booked to come back next year.?

Text: Superb hospitality by a very personable couple clearly interested in catering to each guest situation wherever possible.
As stated by others, the property and breakfast are impeccable. 
Bigger still, IMO - I cannot say enough about Machelle and Fred as hosts. From the time of booking through leaving the premises, they both are ultimately interested in making sure that all their guests receive the experience they are looking for and make any related adjustments. 
Additionally, as an interesting couple they are great conversationalists, should you be inclined. No pressure. 
Although we are unlikely to pass this way again due to the circumstances bringing us here in the first place, I will go out of my way to stay with Fred and Machelle in the future.

Text: This is a beautiful place to stay.  It is within walking distance of Grace College and the Village at Winona Lake shops.   Machelle is a very nice host and makes some awesome cinnamon rolls.  The bed was very comfortable and the off street parking was nice.  Very reasonably priced.  Will definitely stay there again.

Text: My husband and I chose this bed and breakfast because it was very reasonable and within walking distance of Grace College and the Village at Winona. We enjoyed our stay! We chose the biggest room, which is actually the entire top floor of the house. Everything was immaculately clean. The room was so pretty and relaxing. The breakfast was so delicious, everything was homemade and hot and ready when we came down. The coffee served downstairs is from the coffee roaster down the street. So good. The hostess was so friendly and nice. I cannot recommend this place more highly!
