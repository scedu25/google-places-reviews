Text: Awesome/friendly service, helpful. I was hungry and they pointed out a little 50's dinner in between them and another hotel so I could walk after I unpacked. Pet friendly! Room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and price was very reasonable. Continental breakfast was very nicely laid out. I would go there again and would recommend it to anyone else.

Text: A cheap place to stay but no amenities. All the ice machines were out of order and the breakfast they offer is very minimal. Basically a waffle maker and choices if toast. If your looking for a cheap place to stop for the night this will get the job done and is easy to reach from the interstate. If your looking for a place to hang out a but and actually enjoy your stay id look for something else.

Text: We stayed for the eclipse and it was one of the only places with availability. It's good for one night, but you definitely get what you pay for. Hair in the bathtub, dirty corners and baseboards. The place just needs a lot of updating. On the positive side, the staff is very friendly and nice. Continental breakfast was good and they had a waffle maker, much to the delight of our six year old. They have a popcorn machine, which he also enjoyed.
