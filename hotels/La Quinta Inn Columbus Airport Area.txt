Text: Just returning to the area from a flight  and booked a room so we could watch the Buckeye game, spend the night before we head two more hours to home.  We have stayed at Red Roofs many times because they are pet friendly.  Very disappointed, the room needs a lot of attention.  The room is NOT clean, phone, heater, rug, bathroom floor filthy. Toilet bowl  looks like it hadn't been cleaned in months.  Wood work around door in bad shape.  Heater so loud we had to turn off. If we weren't so tired we would check out. Very very disappointed in Red Roof!!

Text: I liked this location. Stayed two nights. The front desk staff was charming and accommodating. The hotel is older but seems well maintained. The bathroom was tiny - the toilet was super close to the wall but I think that's just the old floor plans. There are also a few restaurants within walking distance which was super convenient. Would stay here again.

Text: AWFUL! My original room - filthy dirty, no towels nor washcloths, they were defrosting the freezer and had water all on bottom of refrigerator, the phone didn't work. They put us in another room, which was no better. Housekeeping never mopped bathroom floor, even after I made it known. Had to go down to get towels and cloths for two out of the 5 days we were there. Had to get cups, toilet paper, and tissues. Housekeeping didn't empty the trash. So we had two days worth of trash in our room. My daughter's socks were nasty because the carpets were filthy. The walls had coffee splashes, dust, on the fixtures......etc.  The hall had not been vacuumed and you could tell. Needless to say, WE WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!!!!

Text: This hotel was a huge disappointment. A dump. When we walked in the carpets were buckled, carpet & walls were stained, the air smelled like stale cigarettes/marijuana, molding & trim were missing throughout the hallways. The bathroom had hair on the floor, mold in the shower & on the walls, and was not stocked with anything but bars of soap. No microwave in the room. More than 1/2 of the electrical outlets in the room weren't working (plugs would just fall out, & not charge any device). The pool was also down, and we stayed over a holiday weekend in the summer (July 1-2, 2017), inexcusable. It was definitely not worth $115/night. The rate should have been discounted. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, I later found out there are other, nicer, cheaper, pet friendly hotels in the area. La Quinta was a name we trusted for quality & service, not any more. Do not stay at this hotel. Read the other 1-star reviews, they are spot-on & some recommend other, better hotels in the area.

UPDATE: Contacted La Quinta through their website with the above feedback. Very pleased with their corporate office's quick response (same day, on a Saturday) & attempts to resolve the matter. Restored my faith in the brand, even though this hotel was deplorable.

Text: ABSOLUTELY WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT...if I could have given ZERO stars I would have. The ENTIRE hotel smelled like marijuana...from the minute we checked in until we checked out the next morning, the smell was coming in our room under the door. (We actually had to put a towel under our door - not something i wanted my 4 yr old exposed to) There was a random pile of dog food in the corner in the bathroom...(we didn't bring a dog) there were stains on the sheets as well as blonde hairs...(I'm brunette) and there was a half empty can of beer next to the bed. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone...no matter how cheap the hotel is there is no excuse for dirtiness!! FILTHY!!
