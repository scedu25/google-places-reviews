Text: Nice small campground with friendly owners. Has a fishing pond, small clean pool, small camp stores with the basic necessities. The shower house is roomy and clean.   Always look forward to our weekend stays here. The only down fall I can think of are the gravel roads but they're really no big deal.

Text: Nice camp ground. We were to close to the play ground kids were screaming and playing until after 9:00 PM.  We would go back just in a different site

Text: A lil pricey but as nice as any KOA. Showers were clean and air conditioned which was damn nice on a rather warm evening.
