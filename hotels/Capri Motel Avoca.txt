Text: Courteous, inexpensive.  No plug for bathtub. After paying for smoking,  was then informed that they had no more available. All in all passable

Text: This motel is so close to 3 or 4 stars with just a few simple fixes. Starting with check in. Could be a lot more friendlier and informative, like handing out the Wi-Fi password. 

The room was nice and large, great business desk and a separate table and chairs. Nice TV, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker.

Bathroom. The bathtub/shower would be just fine with a new shower head and a stopper for the bathtub so you can actually take a bath.

Better check in and a couple small things with the bathtub/shower and this definitely 3 stars. Maybe even 4.

Text: Good location next to Casey's convenience store, pet friendly with an extra $10. Bathrooms are a bit small and could be nicer. Plenty of parking space.
