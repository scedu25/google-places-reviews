Text: My god, Matt from the front desk it's just the nicest guy. He is the reason y'all have this high rating because he helped above and beyond while we were there. The Inn is in a great location located just off from the 1970's. It's right by Purdue and is walking distance from plenty of food sources. You stay here if you want to be close to the college, everything else is bonus.
