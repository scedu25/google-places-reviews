Thunderbird Motel

Text: We drove down from Minneapolis, hit traffic, and arrived at 3am (hours after our expected arrival time). Despite this, the owner was incredibly polite and courteous. Our room was clean and very cozy. I dislike Kansas, but would return to the Thunderbird in a heartbeat.

Text: Grungy little place I would not go back to. Run down, apparently deals with a lot of indigents. Creepy greasy feeling in our room. UGH.
