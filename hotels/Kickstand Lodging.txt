Kickstand Lodging

Text: My husband and I had an amazing time at the Kickstand lodge this weekend . This place gives you the feel of at home while away.  It has all the things you need for home away from home.  Like a kitchen and a living space and and a nice bedroom with  a comfy bed and also a nice bathroom that makes you feel as if you are in a quiet oasis.  This place is tangent to the Little Miami Trail.  One only needs to park the car and ride! Our host was amazing and are the sweetest folk one can know.  We have been here several times and will be back again for the peace and quiet and to again enjoy the amazing trail!  Thank you for such a great place to relax and enjoy life beyond the everyday work life!
