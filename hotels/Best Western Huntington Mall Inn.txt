Text: Touring musician Jeremy Porter stayed here while in the area and had a great stay! The room was perfect, clean and quiet, and there was a laundry room which is really awesome when you're on the road for a long time. Free breakfast in the morning was egg-celent!

Text: Nice place. Friendly staff. Quiet. The only issue I had was the ice machine dispensing black gunk along with the ice. Also, an elevator would have been nice. It is convenient to I-64 and many fine restaurants are nearby. I would stay again.

Text: The staff were really nice. The room was clean, and had plenty of space. The location was fairly close to Huntington but you need a car, definitely.

Text: Fast check-in and friendly staff.  Reasonable prices for rooms too.  Rooms are obviously older, but clean.  Placed near the highway and by good restaurants.  Definitely a good value for the dollar.
