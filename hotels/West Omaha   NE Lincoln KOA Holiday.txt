West Omaha / NE Lincoln KOA Holiday
Rating: 4
Text: Nice location. Close to  interstate but not much noise. Nice sites, easy to get in and out.  Very friendly staff, GOOD PIZZA! Would definitely stay here again! I wish more campgrounds were like this place! And it is kid friendly if that's what you need! Pet friendly too!

Text: Absolutely awesome!  Loved the host and my kiddos loved the playground... especially the ZIP LINE!  Stayed in a deluxe cabin and would definitely come back again. Middle sure you try a bottle of local wine.

Text: Awesome place to stop! Friendly staff/owners, clean and spacious sites,  and the greatest showers ever! Bathrooms/showers are the cleanest and the most well maintained I have seen!  Will stop every time in the area!

Text: Grounds are nice. Stayed in a tent for 1 night. Grass sight, which was nice. Clean bathrooms with showers. Only problem we found (which is why the 3 stars) is that it is located near a highway. We heard traffic all night. Also, we were woken up at 1:45am at the sound of a train. Not the best sleep, but a nice, safe campground.

Text: We spent one night here on the road from California to Wisconsin.  We generally stay at KOA's and this was one of the better ones. They had lots for the kids to do and nice big campsites. We were also happy to find they had pizza so we were able to stay hooked up and just hang at the site rather than going to hunt food down, saving us time in the morning.  We were lucky to get a great site with a little area with chairs and a fire pit.
I would definitely recommend this campground and if we come back through Omaha we will be sure to stay here again.
