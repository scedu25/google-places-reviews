Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Naperville
Rating: 5
Text: Absolutely no issues with a group check in. Sufficient parking and plenty of entry points around the hotel so that getting to you room doesn't require you to go through the lobby or walk very far if you park close enough. Very, very, very clean, and spacious. The housekeeping staff is very courteous and helpful. Extremely close (walking distance) to some really great food options. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.

Text: I was here for a professional event so I did not actually spend the night at the hotel but while I was there the rooms at the event seems very small and out of date and the lobby was also quite small

Text: Very nice and clean rooms with a beautiful courtyard!! Easy to get food delivered if you need too. No microwave but they do have double queen bed rooms. They dont have microwaves but overall I'd stay there again!

Text: This is a good location if you are in a wedding nearby. There is a nail salon and lots of restaurants all within walking distance. The bar has a good selection of wine beer and cocktails although it is located right by the front desk so the ambience is not very bar like. The rooms are clean and the service was prompt and friendly.
