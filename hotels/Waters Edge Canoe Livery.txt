Text: We go kayaking a lot. The owner is great, always recognizes us, is very friendly and strikes up a conversation. His staff is awesome. They work hard loading, unloading the kayaks and the kayaks are always clean and in good condition. We normally go on the 6 mile float, relaxing! We have been on the 11 mile float, takes most of the day unless your a nonstop paddler. On the 11 mile it is pretty neat to see the classic cars on the edge of the creek.. people must not have know what a gold mine they had! Have yet to do the 19 mile. I've been told that Coppers Mountain  ( a hill to a California native ) can be seen. Coppers mountain is beautiful, I've drove to the top of it in the past.

Text: Had fun on the water. I hadn't been on a canoe in 20 years. Paid got life vest then loaded in Van. When we got to the river the unloaded the canoe and we're about to leave. No instructions given had to ask to make sure we just went down stream until we got back to the livery. Had fun but only way I knew we had reached the end was a small sign identify the livery. With really shallow Waters we grounded about 20 feet from shore. No one was around?so we just left vest in canoe on the bank.

Text: Always a fun visit we have our own canoes but they will haul us up river for a small fee water and scenery are beautiful they have great camping spots as well although I think trips should be taken by staff during early morning hrs to advise of the hidden dangers and paths cleared for canoer's and kayaker's like other levary's do to keep there customers safe
