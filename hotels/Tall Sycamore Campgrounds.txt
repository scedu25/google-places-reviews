Tall Sycamore Campgrounds
Rating: 1
Text: We drove into the campground and were so disappointed. It was not well maintained. The kids playground equipment looked extremely unsafe. The basketball hoop was falling down. The campsites are so close together. The pictures online were very deceiving. We had come from several hours away and didn't have another reservation and felt we had no choice but to stay one night. While he was booking us (much to my dismay) I was able to call the nearby Salamonie State Park and find a campsite. I asked him to go back and cancel the transaction he had just made and they owner refused. They charged us and would not give our money back. I WOULD NEVER STAY AT THIS CAMPGROUND. Terrible customer service.

Text: My family and I stayed over Memorial Day weekend. The grounds were very well maintained and it provided a great atmosphere to bring a family to. The staff were very friendly and helpful to anything we needed. The restrooms were the cleanest ones I have ever seen at a camp ground. We look forward to returning and enjoying another stay.

Text: The woman at the front desk is beyond rude. She is racist and was extremely rude to my entire family. I hope this place rots.
