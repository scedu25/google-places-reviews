Text: I live at the trailer park and I find that it is really safe. I also know that this individual is not a drug dealer he is an upstanding citizen that works and lives in this trailer park. He has a fiance that has seizures and she sells AVON and he collects AVON payments for his fiance, so if people want to assume that he is a drug dealer they need to learn the facts before posting nonsense. This is slander and he will prosecute the person once he figures out who the person is. He is already taking this to his attorney and this person who posted this comment will be held accountable for SLANDER!!!! He runs and operates his own lawn care business and works for numerous elderly people in this trailer court.  I am a customer of his and I am appalled about this nonsense being posted about him. I hope he does find out who is spreading lies and I hope he does sue them for SLANDER!!!!!!
