Text: We have stayed at Bunny's at least 3 times and have always been very pleased.  Her rooms are charming, and the common area is stocked with snacks, coffee, tea, wine, and a variety of entertainment.  Breakfast is always delicious with a variety of homemade treats.  This is definitely a great place to relax.
