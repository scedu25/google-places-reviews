Hampton Inn Seymour
Rating: 5
Text: Convenient location at I-65 and U.S. 50. Extremely courteous desk attendant, no problems getting tax exempt bill for stay on state business. Nice landscaping, good coffee in the lobby, good housekeeping. Owing to the proximity of major highways, some noise. But, the blackout shade worked to help with the noise, as well as light. Would recommend .

Text: I have stayed at a number of Hampton Inns and would say this was one of or the best overnight experiences yet. Friendly, not out of the training manual, actually seemed glad to see me.  Clean, comfortable, great fresh breakfast. Also enjoyed the complimentary drink and snacks after a 10 hour drive. Thanks!

Text: A Cut Above All Other Hampton Inns.  This was the best Hampton.  A little trivia.  John Cougar Mellencamp is from Seymour.

Just stayed again on my way back to Florida last week.  I can always count on a good stay at Hampton Seymour.  I'll be back.

Text: I slept in my car outside the hotel. Wifi range was good and I didn't get mugged. An experience worthy of my Hilton Honors Gold status
