Super 8 Gretna

Text: Ok place. By the interstate and a large outlet mall so plenty of traffic. Small bathroom. A/C in our room didn't work great but was adequate. Simple breakfast.

Text: It does have safes in room and the employees were very friendly and helpful. I had 3 kids under the age 5 and they carried my suitcases to the room for me. Not many people or places would do that. I stay here any time I visit my mom.

Text: It was a perfectly fine place to spend a night. Conveniently close to the highway, gas, and the nearby outlet mall. Room was clean, staff was nice. Nothing thrilling but inexpensive and comfortable (they had no singles and gave me a double queen at the single rate, which was nice of them).

Text: Mall right across the street so that was nice. No mini fridge or microwave in the room which surprised me. A person from another crew said he saw cockroaches but we never saw anything.
