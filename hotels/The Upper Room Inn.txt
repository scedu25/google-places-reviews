The Upper Room Inn
Rating: 5
Text: With our daughter graduating from IU Bloomington, we were looking for a nice place to stay that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  What a find this place was!!!  The room was absolutely beautiful...clean and more than accommodating!!  Everything was perfect, and it was only a 45 minute drive to IU.  So well worth every penny (which was not much compared to what we would have had to spend to stay in Bloomington).  I would HIGHLY recommend this Inn to any IU parent or family member.  I only wish we would have stayed another night or two to fully enjoy everything it had to offer :)

Text: It's true that the suites provide a kitchen, living room, full bath and they are very clean. It's convenient if you need to stay in the immediate area. However, the amount of noise overwhelms the comfort and cozy features. Very difficult to sleep in the suite that overlooks the highway; the very bright street lights shine directly into the bedroom. The friendly and courteous staff DID NOT exist. In fact, management was borderline harassing and eager to assess additional bogus charges.
