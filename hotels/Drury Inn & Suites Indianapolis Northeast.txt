Drury Inn & Suites Indianapolis Northeast
Rating: 5
Text: Our room was spacious, comfortable, had recliner chair, microwave and refrigerator. We had a large bathroom with jacuzzi tub, the decor and amenities made it feel very high-end and luxurious. They had complimentary drinks in the evenings, a great hot breakfast in the mornings, really good popcorn they made fresh in the afternoon. The hotel is beautiful, lots of places to gather and visit, nice pool and hot tub. The hotel staff were friendly, extremely helpful, wanted to be sure we enjoyed our stay. We did! I'm only sorry I haven't stayed at this hotel before. I'll be sure to look for Drury Inn and Suites the next time we travel .

Text: Perfect place to stay while in the area!  Our boss put us up here and boy were we all happy!  Stayed 3 days and I'll tell you it was a very nice surprise!  Free manager's reception (dinner) plus 3 alcoholic drinks and then a buffet-style breakfast!  To say the least, we went back for seconds!  Where to begin with the front desk?  In the years I've stayed at many hotels, I've never come across the kind of staff they have employed there - other hotels can take a lesson!!  The big guy that checked us in - Wayne - let me say this...ask for him!  He treated us well!  VERY professional and so funny!  He was on-spot with the area attractions!  He kept the conversation flowing and to watch him in contact with other guests was amazing!  He seemed to work very well with the small Latino girl behind the counter.  Always smiling and laughing!  He wasn't stuck up or rude...made us feel welcome!  Pay attention managers...this guy is going places!  We will be back soon and can't wait to see everyone!  Thanks for your genuine hospitality!

Text: We have stayed at this hotel often and it has fulfilled our expectations pretty much every time. The room we stayed in was an oversized one and was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. The only downside to the stay was that it seems like the food for the kickback is always the same regardless of what night we stay there.

Text: The room (suite) was wonderful. Completely separate living room with a fold-out couch bed. I was surprised at the free dinner, which was really good, and the free breakfast was also nice. Pool and hot tub we're big hits with the kids. I'd highly recommend this hotel. Great value for the money!

Text: The front desk staff were helpful. The room was OK, but the chair could be more comfortable. The free dinner is OK, but not something I would go out of my way for. Overall, not a bad place to stay in the Castleton area.
