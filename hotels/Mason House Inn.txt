Text: Beautiful little  village fully committed to  helping you to visit the past.  Nestled along the river  the scenery is wonderful... The rose garden was gorgeous at peak blooming.  Charming bed and breakfast  style lodging.  Shops with  many interesting things to see and one of kind items for sale.. I  visit  the area regularly  as I  live  close.  But I  thoroughly enjoyed my accommodation at The Inn.  Quiet and old world charm!

Text: The address is 21982 Hawk Drive, in Bentonsport.... not Keosauqua.  Mailing address is Keosauqua, but physical address is Bentonsport.  Just East of the little stores.  Phone number is correct.  Call them to make a reservation. Its a great place!
