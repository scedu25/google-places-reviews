Text: 5 stars is too low of a rating for this retreat center. Never have I run into such hospitable staff, consistently willing and able to go out of their way to make guests feel at home. An incredible amount of activities to do (swimming, high ropes, paintball, shooting, archery, horses, bonfires, hiking, etc.) Add to that some of the most stunning countryside Ohio has to offer and you'll come to understand why thousands of guests come back year after year.
