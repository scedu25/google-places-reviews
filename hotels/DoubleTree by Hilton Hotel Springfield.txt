DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Springfield
Rating: 5
Text: I've stayed at this Double Tree several times and every time they're amazing. Everything is spotless clean. All the staff is friendly and looks like they enjoy their jobs. The rooms are modern, quiet, and comfortable and the WiFi is fast and reliable. The hotel itself is close to a lot of dining and shopping locations, there's even a restaurant in the hotel and BBQ place in the same parking lot.

Text: Nice rooms and great staff.  I forgot to check if there were fridges in-room, and found out that there were none.  I went to the front desk just hoping they would have a freezer I could put some ice packs in, and they actually found a mini fridge to put in my room right away.  This was the second time I have stayed here and would definitely stay again!

Text: Unfortunately I feel the hotel has taken a dip down. I have stayed over the past couple of years several times and up until the last couple of visits within a few months apart, the hotel was great. My last stays not so good. I felt as if the room was not well cleaned, smelled musty and like an old smokie hotel. The bathroom shower dripped and leaked from the corner onto the floor. Just not the same hotel and for the price I have certainly had better. Likely won't stay again.

Text: Hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner and reception here. Very polite and friendly staff. The food is amazing. Would highly recommend the tastes of Tuscany and the chicken Wellington.

Text: Beautiful hotel, the staff is excellent as well. The main lobby makes me feel like I'm in a classy version of Las Vegas. The conference rooms are awesome as well. For the price, it's the best stay in Springfield!
