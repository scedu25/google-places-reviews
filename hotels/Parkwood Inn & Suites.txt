Parkwood Inn & Suites

Text: Great place when travelling with dogs. The hotel is super pet friendly and accommodated our request for a ground floor room. There are grassy areas on the property and a small neighborhood park right across the street. Perfect and convenient  for walking the dogs.

The hotel and staff are lovely. The rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated. There are a number of options at the free breakfast - cereal, muffins, yougurt, fruit, eggs, and waffles.

I would highly recommended Parkwood to travelers with or without pets.

Text: ***THIS LOCATION HAS BEDBUGS!!!!!!!!!!***
Was having a great stay until I found 3 bedbugs within 5 minutes at 2am! Not good!! Thankfully, the staff was very nice, but definitely will never ever be back.
