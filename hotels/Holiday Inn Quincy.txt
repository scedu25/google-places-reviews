Holiday Inn Quincy

Text: I wish this was the standard for all Holiday Inns. Perfect setup. Very good restaurant, rooms are nice/clean and a fitness room with dumbbells up to 50 lbs which not to many have. I like to stay in shape and not waste time looking for places to eat while I travel. Great layout!

Text: Friendly staff. Rooms were very clean and the bed was super soft. The bed was even turned down when we arrived and there was a cold bottle of water waiting for us on the table (this might be only because we are reward club members). For $4 we also got a voucher for $10 for the restaurant. The breakfast was delicious. Not too far of a drive to Hannibal to see the Mark Twain sites either. Great experience overall.

Text: Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Breakfast at the restaurant was a good value when you purchased a voucher at the front desk, although the service was a bit slow.
