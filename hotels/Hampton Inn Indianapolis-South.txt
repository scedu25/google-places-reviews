Text: Nice location since the downtown Hampton was full. Still close to a lot of restaurants and only about 15 minutes from downtown. Friendly staff during a very busy event week. Room layout was a little unusual. Small closet and the window shade was just a shade, no curtains to let light in without leaving it wide open. Besides that no major complaints!

Text: We booked a Accessible room 3 weeks ago because my mother is in a wheelchair.  At check-in they did not give us an Accessible room.  The front desk told us they thought it was for hearing yet there was not anything in the room for a person with hearing problems.  The front desk told us they did not have any other rooms that could accommodate my mom's needs.  I asked her to check the other Hampton Inn in the area and she said she couldn't do that but she said she could give us their phone numbers for us to call them.  I ALWAYS make a point to stay at the Hampton Inn franchise but after today I won't even think twice.  I pay the extra for a better place to stay.  This was a huge inconvenience for me and my mom.  Every time in the night when she needed to use the restroom I had to also get up to help her.  Hampton Inn, you owe me big time!

Text: Paid extra for a room with a pull out bed in addition to a king size. The pull out you can't even sit on much less sleep. Nothing but springs. Supposed to be a smoke free location. Walked up to a guy smoking right in front of the no smoking sign. Turned out to be an employee. He tried to tell us oh it's just inside that's no smoking. The sign says Indiana state law not within 8 feet. And the sign inside says this is a smoke free location. And we were told on the phone the hotel offered a shuttle service. We get here and the guy says they've never had shuttle.
