Text: Delightful stay. The decor was well done--just the right amount to say "welcome" in every room.. The interim Innkeeper was wonderful..friendly and talented. .the condition of the home was great..no deferred maintenance at all. A fire was burning all evening. We will definitely stay here when we return to watch Purdue beat Iowa.

Text: Mark and Bob are such great host. It's in a great location, can walk to the downtown area exploring. They are very knowledgeable of the area and more than happy to answer your questions. Wouldn't hesitant to stay there again.

Text: Had a great time with my wife. The innkeepers were great. They knew a lot about the area and things to do locally. The breakfast was incredible and we greatly enjoyed conversations with guests from all over the country. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a local breakfast in the Iowa City area.

Text: What a delightful B&B! Perfection, from the delicious and beautifully presented breakfast items, to the lovely classical music playing softly in the downstairs living spaces, to the big shady front porch, to the warm and welcoming hosts. If ambience is important to you, this is the place!
