The White House Inn

Text: Overall it was a nice stay. Need to lower prices a bit. They're on the higher side and not as nice as others on the street. The breakfast advertised is just a make your own in the shared kitchen thing, which I really don't want to do on vaca, but some people like that. I would suggest they clean out used food between stays, however, and make sure the eggs are within their due date for the pancakes as well as keep fresh cookies on hand if they're going to advertise their bakery with them. We enjoyed the back patio and grassy area for the kids.
