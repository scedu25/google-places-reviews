Text: I stayed here and they said our room would have double bed  and only King size bed oh well at least it was my brother who got the floor. You can only get two towels which are tiny and bit rough. Toilet seat was bit loose and overall bathroom was tiny. Cable TV was cool.

Text: I have a sensitive nose and highly dislike when a room smells like it was poorly cleand. But this place looked and smelled fairly good. There were no signs of severe damage to walks or anything else. The trash cans, drawers sets, and bathroom were all cleaner than the ones I keep at home, too. It was small, as I expected from the price, but nice enough, and the host was nice, too.
