Text: I was in town for an event at Lucas Oil Arena. The location was excellent. The room was nice and clean with a well stocked kitchenette. I had minimal interaction with the staff but they seemed pleasant.

Text: Waited at front desk for at least 5 minutes before someone was able to help.Opened our room to a funny smell in the room which turned out to be old pizza in fridge. Fans in the bathroom sound like airplanes when running. The 1 staff member was not very pleasent or professional. Hope it gets better after this first hour

Text: Had a great stay! Far enough from downtown to get away from the craziness but close enough that you can quickly drive down there. The pool and hot tub area are nice and everything was super clean!

Text: Clean and quiet. My only peeve is that everyone I went to the desk for something there was no one there.I had to wait at least 5 minutes for someone to come out from the back. Once they came out they there friendly and helpful.
