Cumberland Lodge

Text: This review is based off of a two nights stay during the 127 yard sale. I am disappointed. No continental breakfast to speak of (although they used to have one). Our room did not get cleaned even after we asked for it to be cleaned on the second day. Towels and toilet paper would've been enough but they did not even enter the room. It looks like one person was responsible for the entire Lodge the entire time we stayed there. I will not be going back. However, they're right on 127 and have excellent WiFi. If that's all you need then this is the place for you.

Text: Stay here at your own risk. Do your due diligence. Thus place is bedbug ridden. Owner is Larry Perry and is a rude old man that doesent care for your experience as long as he gets ur payment.

Text: The place is pretty decent. Stains on the floor and the carpet is out dated. But the bed slept good and there was plenty of hot water so I can't complain. Would I come back here? Yes I would.

Text: Fridge due dnt work water didnt shut off completely and infested w bed bugs. When told management they refused another room and asked us to leave. Will b reporting to health department as well as informing others. Sorry management to deny evidence of bed bugs and request people to leave after showing proof of bugs.
