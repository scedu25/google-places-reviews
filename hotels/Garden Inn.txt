Text: The worst place I've ever stayed the rooms aren't clean and the workers are rude. Stayed one night and found a bug in our room and then got moved to a different room the next day we checked out 15 min late and they told us we weren't welcome back because we were checking out 15 min late when I tried explaining that we never received are wake up call and that's why we were checking out a few min late she wanted to start yelling at me and try getting up in my face. I feel sorry for anyone who visits this hotel and has to deal with there disgusting rooms be sure to look around the head bored before getting the room I was disgusted with what was around mine. And they had bed bugs and fleas in the room I've never seen anything like it before

Text: Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If my wife's sister had not been getting married the next day we would have packed up and went home. Dirty everywhere. Morning Manager - Becky West was rude to me and my wife (separate encounters). Night Staff was nice (our only pleasant experience to this hotel).  Lots of spiders. Only seen one in lobby. Most spiders where in our room. One even dropped from the ceiling on to our bed. I would give no stars if google would let me.

Text: Terrible place to stay!!! The commode on my second floor bathroom was backed up from the gate! Hair in the sheets every time. Carpet sticky! No hot water for days!! Which meant no shower!! Was only offered $10 refund for no hot water. Terrible way to do business!!

Text: We stayed here for the second time in the last 6 months.  Rates are cheaper at the hotel than on any of those travel apps, so get rates directly from them.  Keep in mind I am pretty laid back and easy to please, others may not be as generous in their reviews.  I will make a list of pros and cons.

Cons: 
--not very modern
--carpet coming up in hallways with some loose tiles
--pool is small and doesn't seem to have a heater
--stains on comforters (when I asked for clean ones, I was assured they are clean, but stained.  I requested extra sheets to be sure I had one under it and over it and I was fine.  The comforters ARE thick and comfy.
--breakfast is bad.  Cereal, a few pieces of fruit, orange juice and a cheap breakfast roll.  We ate out each morning.
--no elevator
--bathroom is a tight fit

PROS:
--clean!!! (Jessica in housekeeping was so nice, seemed to really care if we were comfortable and cheerfully greeted us daily.  She gave us extra towels every day)
--staff was friendly 
--the beds are comfy
--the windows open, so you can have fresh air
--A/C and heater works
--microwave and mini fridge
--I felt safe
--walmart and white castle in walking distance
--tv/cable worked fine
--we had no trouble with the WiFi at all

We will stay there in the future each time we go home to visit my family.
