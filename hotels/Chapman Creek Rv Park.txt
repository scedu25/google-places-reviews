Text: This is a great place to stop when traveling through the area... it is very easy to get on and off of I-70. The noise from the freeway was not bad and with our air on in the trailer we didn't even hear it. The utility hook ups were all good and worked as expected.

Text: Best camp hosts ever.  Cleanest bunk house I've utilized.  Great for overnighters and long term stays.  15-20 minutes to the base

Text: We were traveling home from Colorado and had trouble with our camper on a late Saturday night. The wonderful hosts of this little campground checked us in late,  offered to run to town for us if we needed anything and just generally were so helpful and nice that they really eased the stress of having to deal with problems on the road. The campground itself is very clean and well maintained. Great facilities,  roomy showers and the washer and dryer was very efficient.  Definitely recommend this campground for a stop over while traveling or longer term if you're staying in the area.
