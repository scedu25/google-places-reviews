Text: Stayed here overnight for a little stay-cation and it was great, staff was great. The room was very clean and cozy. Wish we could of stayed longer. Oh and the breakfast was awesome, scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, fresh fruit and some mimosa's.

Text: Amazing bed and breakfast.  My husband and I stayed for two nights in the Italian room. The room was very comfortable with a huge whirlpool tub. Pam is a great innkeeper. She answered questions about the inn, the area and local attractions. Pam even adjusted the breakfast the second day to deal with dietary preferences. Would definitely recommend the Woodstock Inn.
