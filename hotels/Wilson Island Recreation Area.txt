Text: Stayed overnight 9/13-9/14. Horrible smelling campground; the decomposing swamp next to the sites smelled awful! Showers and restrooms were dirty and overtaken by thousands of worms/centipedes. Mosquitoes were ruthless. The camp host was obviously at the end of his season as he/she did nothing. Firewood totes were empty. Our only saving grace was a DNR employee who brought us some wood so that we could at least try to smoke out the bugs.

Text: Very nice campground, it was closed for several years do to the miss-management of the Missouri river by the upper river states.  Many sites for tent and trailer.  I'd like to see more trees separating the sites though.
