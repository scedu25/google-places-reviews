Holiday Inn Express & Suites Ann Arbor
Rating: 4
Text: Excellent room layout& view. Across street from trendy mall& restaurants, with easy access to highway. Room had a couple remnants from previous tenants but nothing couldn't handle with a couple antiseptic wipes. Fridge& micro in good working order. Would stay here again.

Text: Stayed here as an overnight guest on business. Rooms were very clean however be aware this is close to the highway so depending on your rooms location you may have some traffic noise, nothing terrible though. Breakfast was I believe a typical Holiday Inn Express breakfast - hot sausage, eggs, pancakes, milk, juice, etc and was good overall. I believe the gentleman that checked is in was Chris, he was super friendly and you could tell enjoyed his job. Would stay at again if I was in Ann Arbor in the future.
