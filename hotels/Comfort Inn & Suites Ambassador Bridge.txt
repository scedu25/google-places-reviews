Comfort Inn & Suites Ambassador Bridge

Text: Jennifer was great when we checked in. Very friendly and perky! However once checked into the room we had ants in the sink and they didn't have another room available with one bed. So we were Unable to change rooms. Jennifer did have an ant trap and we used that for the night.. We constantly had key problems and spent more time running up and down stairs trying new ones, then being in the room.  Very loud for sleeping due to being on the highway. The morning we were leaving, I went to have bath and there was hair in the shower and in the tub and under the sink. The outside of the toilet was dirty. Very unimpressed. 
 Will never stay here again and to top it off I lost my necklace that was given to me by someone very special and is unreplaceable. I am hoping someone has found it and would be greatly appreciated if they can return it to the comfort inn...

Text: Not an easy entrance into parking lot. Small entrance off a busy street that won't enable you to turn around. Breakfast is meh. Staff is very friendly rooms are clean. Nice pool, nice rooms. Best hotel I've found in Windsor.

Text: Excellent meeting room for company event. Great Continental breakfast. Lots of options. Friendly front desk staff. Ease of access from the expressway. Only recommendation is for them to fix the GIGANTIC pothole right out front of the main driveway.
