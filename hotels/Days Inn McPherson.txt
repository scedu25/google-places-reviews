Text: A bit hard to get to, as the road is difficult to find being in between to parking lots. And the road is very torn up and rough are you car. The hotel itself is pretty nice for the price. With comfortable beds. They could use some new towels.

Text: Not a bad place for the price. The road to get there is pretty torn up. A bit confusing to get to as well. But the hotel itself is nice. Comfortable beds and clean.

Text: Good clean room, nice service people. Were quick to address issues we had. Only downside was a lack of available plugs for recharging devices

Text: Very clean and nice only downfall was the shower. Water pressure wasn't the greatest and we're a little low so had to bend over the whole time.
