Courtyard by Marriott Cleveland Independence
Rating: 4
Text: I had my doubts about staying at this Courtyard simply because we just checked out of the VIP Suite at the Cleveland Grand Hyatt. What an outstanding surprise! This hotel was spotless, beautifully decorated and had an amazingly courteous staff who went out of their way to make us feel right at home. Our room was immaculate and exactly what Courtyard by Marriott advertises. Very nice television with tons of channels, functional work area where I got a ton of work done and all of the furniture was more than comfortable. Way to go Courtyard! We'll be back!

Text: NO MICROWAVE - I refuse to give any hotel anything better than 2 stars if the room costs over $100.  Additionally, the Bistro/Bar was out of a lot of the food and ran out of most domestic beer.  Stay at the Holiday Inn down the road.  Fitness room had a couple of treadmills, and a StairMaster.  Nothing to write home about.  The rooms were unusually dark, when you enter the room and flip on the light switch you have to meander in the dark to find a light switch next to the bed which is in an odd place, so is the one near the TV (because they don't look like light switches).  The one positive was that the AC/Heat was easier to use than most other hotels.

Text: The Courtyard by Marriott in Independence Ohio is an amazing Hotel! I love that is centrally located to Downtown Cleveland and surrounding attractions. The hotel itself is very modern with plenty of amenities inside. The staff is very friendly and attentive. My last day there I had the romance experience package. Really enjoyed my stay there I will definitely go back!
