The Eco Camp

Text: If you love peace, quiet, and natural surroundings you'll love a nights stay at The ECO Camp. Upon entering the camp of lotus belle tents, the path sports warm solar lights that light up your walk to your luxurious nights stay at this one of a kind home away from home. Through the woods the path is wide and clear to the lotus belle tents. At the entrance to the tent you have a shoe bin to store your personal footwear in to keep them clean and dry. Upon entering the lotus belle you see a nice large bed,  don't sit down because upon testing out the bed you may fall asleep. The layout is simple but functional.  Soft rugs adorn the floor so barefoot or socks it's very comfortable to walk on. There's a spare cot just inside the tent as well as a fold out wooden table the inside is spacious and feels cool even with the hotter weather . With screened vents that sit across from one another the air flow and breeze makes for great sleeping and lounging weather. The soft light from solar lanterns and small Chinese lamps creates a soft ambiance of light. I slept like a baby the weather was hot too but very comfortable inside the tent. The whole feel of the eco camp is worry free and laid back. The campfire spot that's located just past the entrance is great too with a community feel you can cook right over the fire using the grill grate that swings over the pit.  If I get the opportunity to stay again I will, it was one of the newest peaceful and exciting experiences I had the pleasure of having.  Thank you for the opportunity.

Text: I have had the opportunity to visit The Eco Camp in Swanton a few times this summer. I am surprised at each visit how quiet the campground is.  The tents are spacious and comfortable. The queen size beds are comfortable and cozy.  Solor  lighting in each tent and throughout the grounds add a sort of mystical appeal to the campground. The communal fire ring is prepared by the campground host Alex who is great at showing campers around or leaving campers on their own if they prefer. Alex will offer advice on-near by attractions and restaurants.  Kayaking close by on the Maumee River is a fun activity.  Complimentary coffee in the morning is an added benefit to an overall wonderful camping experience.   Surprisingly, the tents retain warmth from the day on cooler nights.  I highly recommend Th Eco Camp for an easy and worry free camping experience.
