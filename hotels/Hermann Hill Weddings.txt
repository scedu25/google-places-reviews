Text: We attended a wedding and reception there. The staff was friendly and attentive and went above and before to make sure all of our needs were met. It was a beautiful venue for any special occasion. The views were also amazing! We would love to visit again.

Text: This was a kind of small Resort where accommodations are available for couples to stay. There is a wedding chapel there for weddings, for banquet facilities, and this is a  location adjacent to the Missouri River right along the banks which is just an Exquisite location. One of the most beautiful locations I've ever experienced, and a nice small quaint town.

Text: This was such a beautiful venue for a wedding. The interior was very comfortable for a warm summer day and the amenities outside provided gorgeous scenery as a backdrop for the wedding. Had a great time.
