Text: Terrible. The manager treated me like dirt, was rude, and hostile.

I had parked in their lot to eat at houlihans (which was amazing, thank you), but before i went in I ran an errand across the street (on campus). When i finished my meal at houlihans, I found a parking ticket on my car, I went in to contest it because I patronized their locale. The manager talked down to me, obviously considering me an ignorant. dumb, and moneygrubbing college student.

Let me be clear. While i don't believe i should have been ticketed for parking there, I'm ok with a policy that says you may only park there for the purposes of patronizing their company. I think its stringent, but i'm not upset about it. I am upset with the MANAGER for treating me like dirt. I cannot say how angry i am to have been treated like that.
