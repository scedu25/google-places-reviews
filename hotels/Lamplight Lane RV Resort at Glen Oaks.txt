Text: Great little place for when you're passing through the area. Has everything you need for a comfortable night. The owners are wonderful and so helpful. The old owners let the place go, but John and Barbara are working hard to make it shine again. I will definitely be back if we're in the area next year. Thanks John and Barbara!

Text: This is a nice little RV Park. Key word being little. We over-nighted here and everything about this park was great except it was a little difficult to maneuver a 40' rig. I did spy several big rigs here so by all means do not be afraid to partake of this parks hospitality which is in abundance. The owner was very nice and right there to help any time we needed him.

Text: We enjoyed our short time very much at this park. The couple that run it are very kind. We had to cut our visit short because my son didn't get any leave after his military training and John was good enough to refund a few days. They were very helpful and kind

Text: This place is wonderful! The other campers were friendly.  The owners are as nice, friendly, hospitable and makes you feel like you are a part of their family! They have so many ideas of fun things to do with the place that I can't wait to visit again! They let us stay later so we could take part in the ice cream social with them and the other campers. What a wonderful stay!

Text: This is a great little park for all types of rigs and visitors. The owners, John and Barbara, are absolutely wonderful - super friendly and helpful with anything you might need. The current grounds and facilities are very well maintained and we're excited for all John and Barbara's upgrade plans for the place. We liked it so much we extended our stay (in a 36' class A, with 3 small weiner dogs) to one month. We'd definitely stay again if back this way.
