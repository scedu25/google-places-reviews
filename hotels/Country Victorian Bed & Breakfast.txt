Country Victorian Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had a very pleasant stay at the Country Victorian Bed & Breakfast. Our hosts, Arnie and Lori, warmly welcomed us into their Inn and did well in making our stay enjoyable. They were very helpful. The breakfasts that Lori prepared were both tasty and filling. The breakfasts we were fed were not traditional breakfast meals, but were well prepared and delicious. 

The house is beautiful and the room we stayed in-- the Serenity Suite-- was nice. Private, spacious, and warm, it was a great place to stay on a cold day in March. 

There were also a lot of other small things about the Country Victorian that made our stay enjoyable: delicious cookies and warm drinks readily available, candy around the house, and more. All in all, the Country Victorian is an excellent choice for a relaxing few days away.

Text: My husband and I loved every minute that we spent at the Country Victorian Bed and Breakfast. The location is absolutely perfect. To wake up to the sounds of the horse buggies going into town was heavenly. Next, you are fed like a king and queen with the best food ever! The hosts are so nice and knowledgeable about the area. The bedrooms are nicely decorated and the beds are so comfortable. Please do not hesitate to make the reservations to this lovely Bed and Breakfast.

Text: There is no way to describe the experience you will have when you visit the Victorian Bed and Breakfast. Arne and Laurie adopt you as family for the days you are in their home. It becomes your home as well. You will remember how to relax and laugh. You will forget the idea of fast food and recall what it is like to have home cooked food set on the table before you. Do you have fond memories of being young and having your Mom make your bed and breakfast? These memories will come back to you as you luxuriate at the Country Victoria Bed & Breakfast. We have taken our family with us for a wonderful weekend that included the Amish buggy ride and dinner at an Amish home. We heartily encourage you to go and enjoy!

Text: We enjoy the English Room when we stay with Lori and Arnie at the Country Victorian. The room is spacious and has two chairs for chatting or watching TV.
The breakfasts are delicious and plentiful. We also enjoy sitting in the evening on the front porch as the Amish buggies pass by. The flea market is not far for some terrific finds. During the summer months you won't want to miss the quilt gardens. You'll always receive a warm welcome, so don't delay make your reservation today.

Text: I simply cannot say enough good things about the Country Victorian Bed & Breakfast. Lori and Arnie are wonderful hosts. The breakfasts are so incredibly yummy, often with several courses served. We've been going there for several years, and I've never had the same breakfast twice - and I've never had anything I haven't loved. Lori is always considerate of my special dietary needs - both my dislikes and my allergy to tree nuts. They are very knowledgeable about the area, and willing to help make our stay the best it can be.
