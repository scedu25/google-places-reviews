Text: Stayed at motel was great. Have remodeled since we were there 3 years ago.  They did a great job with the remodeling and we were treated great when we arrived and when left. Would recommend and rate was good also.

Text: Its easy to get to, Its clean and parking wasnt a problem.  Beds are comfortable enough but the pillows leave a lot to be appreciated.  "Continental breakfast" is the most pathetic I've ever come across.  Microwave and decent fridge in the room but a shower thats a challenge to use.  In a pinch i wouldn't avoid here but i also wont make it a point to stay here.

Text: Check in was easy and the the people were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was good and the room was clean. However i was disappointed with the condition of the bathroom. The bathtub drain was slow and the wall had marks and hair on it like it hadn't been wiped down.

Text: Our King room was clean, spacious and had a chair/ottoman, comfortable desk chair and an extra sink. The breakfast room was small and cramped. Oatmeal, waffles, cold cereal and bread for toast were available with the usual beverages.

Text: I ate at Arby's and Google asked me to rate my stay at the Days Inn. Arby's was really good. Go eat there
