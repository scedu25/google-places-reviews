Irish Creek Outfitters
Rating: 5
Text: I have been turkey hunting on Steve's properties many times for several years. I am an experienced hunter so I was self guided. However, Steve has always taken the time to drive me to the properties beforehand, describe where to go, etc. I have been very successful hunting this area and on 2 different occasions even harvested 2 gobblers on the same day. The lodging is great and Steve will try very hard to make your turkey hunt successful.

Text: Irish creek outfitters in haven Kansas is truly a haven! I have been going since 2009 and will continue as long as Steve and Margy will have us! They treat us like family and served us one of the best thanksgiving dinners I have had! By the way it was at no charge. Some years the hunting was great and some years not as good but that is hunting. I consider them friends that I don't get to see often enough.

Text: I have been to hunting operations all over the country and hunt several in Kansas. Irish Creek Outfitters is the cleanest with every detail kept perfect including the hunting areas. I go for wild birds and Steve always makes every effort to insure a great hunt. I have gone for years and will be there again in Dec. Charles Murphy from Georgia

Text: I  along with 3 of my closest friends have been hunting at Irish Creek for the last 4 years and are scheduled to hunt twice this hunting season as well. I can honestly say that Steve has been nothing but accommodating and he strives to make sure that all of our interests are met and that we have a successful hunting experience.  Couldn't be happier. Now that fall weather has arrived I am looking forward to returning to Irish Creek .

Text: Steve genuinely wants his clients to enjoy their stay. The lodge is comfortable. It is hard work finding birds but there are plenty of them.
