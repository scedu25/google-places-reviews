Holiday Inn & Suites Charleston West
Rating: 4
Text: Everything was great, but the location leaves a little to be desired. It's right near train tracks that are frequently used in the middle of the night. It has an awesome pool, and the staff was pleasant. Prices for drinks and food are a bit pricy in the restaurant though. And, unfortunately, no complimentary breakfast. I'd probably stay here again though.

Text: 100% smoke free is very nice!  Also salt-water indoor pool is uniquely designed with a shallow bubble pool area as well as a long lap area, so both families and those that enjoy swimming laps can easily enjoy it. Breakfast is made to order and a great deal if you pay in advance when booking the room ($5 for two as of August 2017). 
All rooms are suites, and designed so sleeping areas never disturbed by hallway noise.
Really nice facility. Only downside is it is by the train yard (which is near the olde town area) but most the hotels in town seem to be here, and the building itself has very soundproof windows so it is not bothersome.

Text: Very nice hotel! Stylish lobby and pool area, rooms are very nice and with comfortable beds! They are pet friendly for $25 which is the best! Even had doggie trash cans on the grounds. No continental breakfast but room service and a sit down was offered. Overall excellent experience with an affordable rate!

Text: This place has a trendy vibe, it is pet friendly, and the staff is top notch. If you enjoy comedy shows it's definitely worth taking in the Comedy Zone on premises on the weekend. It has a relaxed atmosphere the breakfast is cooked to order if you choose and very well done. It has something for everyone in the hot tub, salt water pool, splash pad, laundry, fitness center, bar, even a pinball machine. It's an easy 3 mile drive to Downtown Charleston.
