Extended Stay America - Kansas City - Airport - Plaza Circle
Rating: 5
Text: Great place, clean rooms. Good rooms with mini kitchen, fridge and microwave.
I did not like the breakfast counter, it had only nutri bars and cup cakes. Coffee was good.

Text: Clean, simple, well run. The light roast drip coffee in the lobby was actually drinkable. I paid less than $60 after taxes for one night. The stay was well worth that price.

Text: This hotel exceeded my expectations. Reading reviews online ahead made me worry that it wouldn't be as good as my previous experienced with this chain, but it was great! Check in was quick and easy, the room was spacious and clean, the shower was relaxing and the bed was comfortable.

Text: Maintenance and housekeeping of common areas is very hit-or-miss.  Staff has a degree of engagement that varies from satisfactory to lackadaisical.  I'm not entirely thrilled to get a sight-unseen hotel booking here, but the rooms are generally passable.

Text: Needed a place over night and ended up here. Shuttle service to and from airport was convenient and on time. The hotel itself could have been cleaner. Front desk had some issues and accidentally gave someone else our room. Everyone was surprised when they opened the door to an occupied room. Not sure how that happens.
