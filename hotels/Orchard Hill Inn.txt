Orchard Hill Inn
Rating: 1
Text: The Orchard Hill has been sold!  It is TERRIBLE.  We made an online reservation for August, 2015.  When we arrived, a family group was hanging out on the sidewalk in front.  One of the women said she was the manager and that she was "not expecting us" and did not have any reservations for the night.  She offered to show us a room - she only had one - all the other's were being used to store "things" for the brewery in town.  We looked at the room - it has the same furniture as the previous owner - but only a blanket on the bed and two crummy pillows.  There was HAIR all over the bed.  She offered to change the sheets to make it acceptable.  GROSS!!!!!   I have stayed there previously and the lady that ran the place was lovely.  She obviously took all the linens and niceties with her.  THE PICTURES ARE A LIE.  DON'T STAY HERE!!!

Text: Our room was clean, comfortable, and well decorated.  You can definitely tell it was recently renovated - the bathroom was immaculate. The room was spacious, had windows you could open (always a plus) and a beautiful view out the back window.  What it lacks in curbside appeal, it makes up for in value and comfort.  Did not mind that on-site staff was not available 24/7; we had no problems and didn’t need a thing during the 3 days we were there. Only a mile from downtown and well worth the $4 to park to stay in a more private location with less noise.  We will definitely return!

Text: The rooms were VERY clean and the staff were helpful.  The outside looks a bit scary but you will be surprised when you look in the room.  It is a good economical place to stay.  No frills, no iron/ironing board or hair dryer.  Just a nice clean and comfy room.  Gave 3 stars just because it is a plain simple room with no extras.
