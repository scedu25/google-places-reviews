Albonee Country Inn

Text: We've stayed here a few times and the rooms are different every time we stay, they always feel new and modern. We stayed in a mountain casita and the room was elegant, modern and comfortable. The bathrooms are enormous with spacious free standing tubs. The room and hotel are elevated over paradise valley providing views of desert and mountains. Our room had a balcony and a fireplace and both a living room and a bedroom. The walls are thick and the room was very quiet.

Text: We went to Albonee for a wine tasting. The owners were nice, the wine was good, and we left with a good supply, for an even better price.

Text: This is our favorite B&B and Winery. Very relaxing atmosphere. B&B overlooks part of the vineyards and pond. Al and Bonnie are exceptional hosts. For us it's like visiting family. We've been going 5 years now, and go at least once a year.
