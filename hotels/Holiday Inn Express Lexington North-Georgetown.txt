Holiday Inn Express Lexington North-Georgetown
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms are always nice and clean. Staff is super friendly. Definitely will stay here again. The only reason I rated them 4 is because the room given to me was directly under a room under renovation. Happened twice. Other than that, everything was great.

Text: Stayed here for a business trip and I brought 2 friend with me for when I wasn't working. >The staff was willing to work around my work schedule for check in and everything else we needed. > The pool was slightly warm, probably near room temperature, but the hot tub was amazing. >The business center worked perfectly. I was able to print out a document and my boys check out the restaurants and activities to do. > Breakfest provided a good variety of things to eat and was well stocked They had an awesome pancake machine that cooked it on a conveyor and came out perfectly done one the side of the machine, no waffle machine but that didn't bother me.
