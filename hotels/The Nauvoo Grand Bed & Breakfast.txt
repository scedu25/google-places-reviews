The Nauvoo Grand Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: I found the rooms to be clean and well kept. The floors are creaky and you can hear most of what goes on in other rooms but you can't expect much in terms of barriers in a really old house. The breakfasts were delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful.

Text: Charming, with a hearty and delicious breakfast. The floors are so creaky that you are constantly worried about waking the neighbors.

Text: Overall, we had a great stay.  Interactions with the owners were pleasant. Breakfast was delicious and our host was very accommodating. The room was clean, but don't expect anything too fancy. The building is old and that brings along everything you'd expect: charm, character, and squeaky floors! Would definitely consider coming back for another stay.
