Text: I couldn't have been happier with this hotel. The gentleman who checked me in was friendly add the room was great. Newly remodeled and more than just a coat of paint. I would gladly stay here again.

Text: Our room was very clean. Free breakfast includes two choices of cereal ,yogurt ,waffles and pastries, but get there early. It is an older hotel but looks like they are working on trying to update it. Our beds had been upgraded and were very comfortable and there was newer carpet in our room.

Text: Stayed at the knights inn and suites in salem. Not bad for the cheap price, but nothing special either. Expect a basic room, and basic service. Until you check... then they run your card twice....
