Economy Inn McCook
Rating: 5
Text: Low key inexpensive hotel. All the basic necessities. Flat screen, microwave, fridge. Beds and pillows are comfortable. Water pressure is insane. Located conveniently at the end of town. Hospitality is absolutely great and way above average. I travel for a living and this place was a great find!

Text: The people here are no nice. Nice isn't even a strong enough word for it. They are fantastic! I come to mccook at least once a month & I always stay here with my son and mother in law at times as well. They are always so pleasant. Always go above & beyond to make my stay the best they can. The rooms are pretty well kept up, I would have to say there was one time though that I was really looking forward to taking a relaxing hot bath and the tub was kind of dirty but over all the room was great. There was also a time when I got there early (before 3 which is the time they normally say rooms will be ready to check in)  and my room was still not ready since there had been other guests staying there the night before but since I was kind of in a hurry to get to where I needed to be they asked the house keeper to wait on cleaning the other rooms & go clean the one where I was going to stay at first. She gladly did it and that really made my day. I appreciate how polite all of the staff here is and how they always meet my needs. Thank you! I will continue to stay here in the future. ?
