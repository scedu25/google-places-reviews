Baymont Inn & Suites Logan

Text: The location of this hotel was pretty good, right off of 664. My girlfriend and I stayed the night there before going to OU's homecoming the next morning. The room itself was comfortable, just your typical hotel room. My only real complaint was with the breakfast provided. It was weird because each item was individually bagged in a sandwich bag. This includes bread, waffles, and fruit. You could not tell how fresh the food was.

Text: The hotel is in a great location and reasonably priced. It is clean and all of the staff is very friendly and helpful. All of the hocking hills attractions are just a few minutes away. There are all kinds of restaurants and and little stores just down the road. It isn't the most modern hotel yet still very comfortable. Also the pool and hot tub were very nice at the end of the day. All around, it was a very enjoyable stay.

Text: Decent hotel, offers breakfast daily. Breakfast does leave something to be desired but it's edible and free. Staff was wonderful!

Text: Clean hotel, great pool, decent breakfast. 
Absolutely the worst in customer service. 
The lady that checked me in, needs a reality check in life or a new job.

Text: Second time staying at this hotel. Hotel staff has been great both times. The hotel halls and rooms were clean and quiet. TV is newer, with HDMI, so I recommend bringing your Chromecast or Apple TV if needed. Wi-Fi was free and fast enough to stream netflix without a problem.
