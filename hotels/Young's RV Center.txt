Text: If you value customer service, this is where you can still find it. Just took delivery of a new Cougar fifth wheel and couldn't be happier with the experience. Shawn in sales was excellent to work with, professional without being pushy and very knowledgeable. And the orientation and delivery by Jay in the service department was excellent as well. We are new to RV's and had tons of questions, all of which were patiently and professionally answered by them. Very happy that we chose to buy locally from Young's RV!

Text: I looked online and found a supposedly nice 5th wheel camper on their inventory page. I emailed them Friday and asked if this unit was still available to look at because I wanted to come up Saturday morning they replied yes it is available to look at. The pictures of it looked great. A clean used 5th wheel that seemed to be a trade in maybe from an older couple that was well taken care of or so it seemed. It said in the description enough to make me think it was all ready to go on a camping trip. So I took the hour and a half drive up to Fremont to check it out. I got to the dealership that the address was listed at and not a single used camper was to be found all new ones and what looked to be customer units that may have been getting worked on. We drove around a lot that had some new units and scattered in that lot was some old campers that people were seemingly living in not sure what was going on here? Anyway I looked online to find the used lot which is probably 1/4 mile away from the new lot and I found the camper that I saw online. It was dirty on the outside no big deal but when I got out of the car I should have immediately got back in and left as soon as I found a note in the window saying "Buy It Fix It". I found the 5th wheel camper that I saw online and thought was a nice unit was actually a ragged out piece of junk. The siding was getting pulled away from the camper due to rotting wood from a water leak all over the camper. The unit was unlocked which I thought was odd so I went inside and found what looked to be like a mobile animal shelter. The carpet was filthy, the linoleum was yellowed the kitchen countertops were covered in nasty brown crap from a water leak. The floor was soft and it smelled musty the back wall had a hole in it where a water leak rotted the wall out. I sent the company a email thanking them for their awesome photoshop skills and for wasting my time on a weekend only to get a reply from them saying that unit was in need of repair and needed a complete rear wall replaced. You would think a dealership with any type of reputation or care for their customers or potential customers would tell them upfront that this unit is a fixer upper or at least put something in the description online that is in need of repair before they would waste 3 hours driving back and forth to go see a camper that isn't worth a darn. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a used camper at all period. It seems to me the new units are all they may be good at selling, used units, not a chance.
