Text: If I could give no stars I would. The owners are disrespectful and just all out rude. They let their campers do what they please, trespass, vandalize/steal from bass lake property owners, and don't take responsibility of the damage they do. Don't even get me started on how many boating laws the campers violate. This place is an all out joke, it's  just a place for people to get hammered and party. Bass lake as a whole will be a much nicer place when this sorry excuse for a campground closes. Or at the very least gets new ownership that will monitor and take responsibility of their campers.

Text: TERRIABLE!! It is a total party spot. If you plan on sleeping at night while you are here, you might as well forget it! Came back to our campsite on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend to find the campsite next to us lit up with swirling laser lights and a DJ blasting music. Talked to the owner of the campground and they said there was nothing they could do about it. Finally at 3:00am we had enough and packed all of our stuff in the truck and left! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
