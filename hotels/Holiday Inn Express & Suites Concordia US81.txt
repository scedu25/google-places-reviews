Text: Let me start by saying I started off at roach motel 8 ????..after cancelling my reservations there I was lost knowing there were No rooms in town ???. So I took a chance and walked in . in a panic.. They showed nothing but compassion and did All they could to get me a room 4 days out of the 5. . God is good.. All rooms were booked because of the eclipse. . Staff was So friendly. Rooms clean I slept like a baby .. Hard time for me .. I was bringing my son to school a long way from home. The general manager Alisa also another young women I think her name was Gail .. They were Angles sent .. Thank you all for making my stay comfortable ?

Text: The Ms. at the check in counter was very rude and really slow getting information from on 8/ 20/17 A.M. shift. She even rolled her eyes at me when I was asking a question about the town. I would probably drive to another town (because I like the better hotels to stay in) before being treated like this in the future. The five star rating is because the hotel itself is very nice and clean.

Text: Nice hotel, with a decent breakfast. Didn't get to check out the pool. A bit pricey for the location
