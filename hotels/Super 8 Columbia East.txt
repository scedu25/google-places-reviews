Text: I didn't sleep well the first night between the pounding and whatever was going on.  woke up took a shower and I noticed the towels were dirty. I threw them on the floor hoping that room service would change them. Which they did. The hallway stunk like so I'm awful. I have been to smokers motels/hotels  and they've never smelled that bad. I think it's time for them to open the doors and let the place air out.  I felt that it was dirty and I will never stay there again.

Text: The motel itself was good. Did not use any of the amenities except for the WiFi.  Looked over at the pool area and it looked good. 
3 big downsides. 1) The main doors were harder to open than should be. 2) We asked for a cart for the luggage and there wasn't one and they only had one. (Found out the next morning someone had kept it in their room and their stuff on it reason being they were only there overnight and leaving early.)
3. The elevator is very small. 
The staff were great and apologized for the absence of the cart. Room was clean.

Text: Was not bad at all. Was just stopping in to visit a friend, everything seemed clean and nice, the front desk clerks were extremely friendly. I'd stay there if I didn't live a mile away!
