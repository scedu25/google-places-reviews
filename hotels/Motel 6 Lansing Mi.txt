Motel 6 Lansing Mi
Rating: 2
Text: Shower curtain had visible black mold on it. There was some kind of food splattered on the wall behind the TV and the room smelled like cigarettes even though it was a non-smoking room. I stayed here about 2 years ago and came back because the room was cheap and most importantly clean, but I believe it was newly remodeled at the time. These rooms are definitely not being maintained very well. I would've gotten another hotel but stuck with this one because there was no other availability in the area, and I was pressed for time. I won't stay at this Motel 6 again.

Text: Staff was nice, very nice rates. However, when we woke up in the morning, we noticed a condom out of the wrapper lying on the floor half way under the bed. It definitely was not ours and my wife was disgusted. When I told the front desk, they offered me $25 off of the room. I probably will not be returning.

Text: Front Desk Staff was wonderful.  A++.  Couldn't have been more friendly or more helpful.  The room was substandard.  Filthy carpet, and one of the legs on my bed had broken off.  When I got into bed, it tipped.  I had to find the leg under the bed, and wedge it back to keep the bed level and stable.

Text: I have used motel 6 before and had excellent experiences. This time was not so nice for me. The staff was very polite but the room condition was horrible. It was either room 222 or 223 and was very dirty. Both beds comforters look like someone had been murdered on them and the carpet had stains everywhere. I'm very glad I was just in town hunting and only stayed in the room for a few hours each night sleeping on top of the blankets in my hunting gear. I honestly would never stay at a motel 6 ever again after being in that room.

Text: It could have been worse, but it could have been better. The room had a few bugs. The soap from the previous guests was still in the shower, and the room smelled of cigarettes. There was one bath towel for a double occupancy room. Would probably not stay again unless it was a last resort.
