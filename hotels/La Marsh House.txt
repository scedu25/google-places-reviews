Rating: 5
Text: Last spring my friend and I took a day trip up to Grafton to check out some winery's and the shops. We had such a good time we decided to see if we could find a place to stay for the evening!  the owner of the La Marsh house happend to own the ice cream shop up the road and heard we needed a place to stay so she hooked us up! She was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed.
