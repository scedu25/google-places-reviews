Candlewood Suites Louisville Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Secured doors after 8pm is great security feature. Staff is excellent, very professional. Rooms are very professionally designed with the business person in mind but still able to accommodate the family atmosphere and great appeal. 5 star hands down.

Text: Nice little Candlewood, extremely over priced and not updated. Recently stayed here for a night and all of the laundry equipment was working. If I remember correctly they have at least 4 washers and several more dryers and all free of charge.
Small gym but at least they have weights and a bench.
Friendly staff too.
