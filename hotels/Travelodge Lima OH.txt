Text: We've been staying at this location a few times already, along with other family members, and find it much better than some people are trying to imply. The owner's and Staff are very polite and most certainly friendly. Cleanliness has not ever been a problem at anytime, either. I would recommend this location to those who enjoy a peaceful night, or weekend stay.

Text: This is a two star motel.  For an over night stay it is excellent and provided everything we needed at a reasonable price.  A bit dated but no problem.  Breakfast was the usual and all you need before hitting the road again.  The staff were excellent, friendly and kept checking the breakfast area to restock and clean up if required.  Would be happy to stay here again.

Text: Superb 
I liked this motel. Good staff, good and cleaned room, good customer service, breakfast is hot and delicious. I was there before but this time I found there was a new management so everything was superb. I was there for 1 week. Everyday there is variety of breakfast and staffs over there is always ready to help. Friendly and kind.
From my side this is the one of the best lodge I have traveled this year. 
Best Travelodge ever Lima Ohio 
Love to visit there again???
