Jailer's Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Awesome place with great history. The staff was great, especially Paul. Got to view all the rooms and they are beautiful and full of period furniture. Met some wonderful people during the stay and had an awesome breakfast in the courtyard. The tour was fun and the information about this early 1800 jail was enjoyable. My wife and I are already talking about our next stay!

Text: An incredible history meets incredible service and comfortable rooms! Don't miss out on either breakfast or the tour. If all you're looking for is a bed for the night, you're gonna get way more than you bargained for here!

Text: I loved the Jailer's Inn during our 4 night stay there. Breakfast was a hit with our group to with Paul or Lisa or others serving it. Always lots of fruit to go with the Jailhouse Rock or French Toast. The rooms are as individual as the people staying there. Throughly charming.

Text: There was an issue with a room and the manager didn't let us know until we got there. Two people in our group had to leave. Then we were advised that we could not run the blow dryer and the window a.c. unit at the same time in our room. The power in our room went off three times within a few hours and we hadn't ran the blow dryer. Apparently you couldn't run the microwave in the hallway either. Pretty certain this place is not up to fire code. They need to do some work before they allow more visitors. And Lisa needs to learn how to handle situations better. Was not the best of visits.
