Text: Excellent hotel. Everything you need for a good night stay. AC worked wonderful, very chilly at night like I like it. Rooms were very clean. Large Direct TV channel selection. Quick and easy check in.

Text: Very poor service ,very  expensive , poor equipment and very rude dealing with the employees in charge. Will never book an event or stay at the Inn at Depaul ever again.

Text: One of the worst dining experiences ever - maybe even THE worst. I was here for breakfast. There was a party of, like, 20 already seated. A server approached me and said - and I quote - "What do YOU want?" That should have been a red flag, but I went ahead and had breakfast there anyway. The service was beyond slow (although she was quick enough about bringing me my check). Pathetic.
