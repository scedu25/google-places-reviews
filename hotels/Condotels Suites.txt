Text: I use this hotel several times a year with our business. The manager and staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms look nice and are kept up to date. It has a nice size living and kitchen area and the option of up to 3 bedrooms.

Text: Older buildings with older amenities.   Including bedclothes.  Located a good distance from anything of interest aside from a grocery store.  Price was OK considering it had separate bedrooms for 3.  Though 2 paid the same price and didn't get the "master suite".

Text: Iffy wifi, bad hours on the pools, unstable toilet seats, and we told them we'd be there for two months and we were pitched out at a month and a day with four pets in the rain, without a courtesy call. Probably for someone else that was renting the third room, a shame what some businesses will do for a little bit of extra money.
