Text: Doing construction but hotel was very clean.  The construction just made parking very difficult.  Had several handicapped spaces blocked along with construction equipment blocking front entrance.  Then when waliking out debris falling like dust and Styrofoam on you.  Staff was very polite.  Construction just hindered thing.  We will stay again.  Also, same exact breakfast both days on a weekend.  It was hot but not great.  Had to go out for breakfast second day.

Text: LOST OUR BUSINESS TO ALL HOLIDAY INNS!!!
 This hotel would have gotten 5 stars.  They are currently remodeling it.  Our room had just been painted and upgraded.  The bathroom was very nice, there were 2 sinks in the room, 2 TV's, the coffee was decent, the breakfast was good, and the bed was brand new.  However when we left we had forgotten our oscillating fan which was left in front of the television by the bed.  We didn't notice that we had forgotten it until we arrived home some 6+ hours later and were unpacking the car.  We called the hotel to see if housekeeping had turned it in.  At first Marybeth didn't see a fan, just one they had around for what looked like awhile.  She then called back and said she needed to discuss the fan she was looking at with housekeeping because when an item is found they are suppose to put the room number with it and they didn't.  That was fair to us.  We waited 2 days before calling again.  This time Ashely at the front desk answered the phone and told us that the fan had not been found.  We proceeded to describe the fan and she said that it matched the description of the fan she was looking at but couldn't return it since "it was there's".  So basically, we paid for a nice room all so they could turn around and steal a fan.  We only stay at 2 hotel chains when we go on vacation Country Inn & Suites and Holiday Inn Express.  Well I can say we WILL NOT be staying at any Holiday Inn's anymore if that is how they are going to treat a customer who paid for a room that was the second most expensive room they had! Don't forget something here.....your loss!

Text: Trisha will run this into the ground that's why I think Holiday Inn express is getting away from this location and selling it to LaQuinta.   She lacks hospitality and you don't just buy something and make money you put an effort into just like her Dad Vernon is doing.   She could learn so much from her Dad and Mom too great people.   But her attitude leaves something to be desired.  I will be going back once holiday inn changes venues.

Text: Hotel is being remodeled but the room we had was complete and beautiful. Bad thing is that we mistakenly forgot a fan and they claimed it couldn't be found after telling me they found one exactly matching my description. Guess that was my last stay at a Holiday Inn unless it is made right which I highly doubt

Text: The hotel was being renovated but it was being done in a way that was orderly and considerate to the guest. The location was great with access to restaurants and other necessary needs.
