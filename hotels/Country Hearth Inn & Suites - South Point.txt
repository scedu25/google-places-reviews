Text: This place is horrible it smells bad from the time you walk in the door. The prices change week to week. It's infested with mice and roaches. The staff isn't friendly and most of them live there. They go into your room when your not there even if you have a do not disturb sign on the door. When it rains the Windows leak. They have sex offenders living there with children on the same floor they charge .25 cents for a scoop of ice. The mattresses look like there from the 70s and very dirty I would not recommend anyone stay there it was the worst experience I've ever had at any hotel from east cost to the west and Canada. So do not under any circumstance go here the place is falling apart they have signs up that says there "remodeling" but didn't see anyone doing anything in the two months we were there. The vending machines never work. I would have gave it negative stars if it would let me.
