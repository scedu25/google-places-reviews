Holiday Motel

Text: Didn't stay there but a couple friends recently did. No staff on site to check in or out, had to call the owner who spoke basically no English, didn't have any cash to make change, and didn't hardly know how to fill out a receipt. Smelled really musty, like it was very humid or there was mold or something. Had the shower on full hot and it was cold. Hot water finally seemed to kick in on the next shower. Would not recommend, there is a reason they were the only room booked on one of the busiest weekends of the year in town (balloon days)

Text: Dirty, owners/employees speak very little English. Charged my card an extra $180 and took 2 weeks and a fight to get it back.
