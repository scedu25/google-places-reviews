Lebanon / Bennett Spring KOA
Rating: 5
Text: Very happy with our stay at Lebanon KOA!

The staff are incredibly nice,  we were a few hours out when we called to make a same night reservation and someone stayed and waited for us,  and also left us a friendly note on the back of our map inviting us up for complimentary coffee in the morning. 
On top of the kindness,  the bathrooms were very nice and perfectly clean! The showers even had upgraded rain shower heads!
The only criticism i have is that they could use a little more gravel,  it would really freshen up the look of the park,  but its the end of the season - so you can't blame them for not doing that. 

Great place - highly recommend

Text: Nice place. Well kept. No basketball court, even though they show one. It's just an old concrete slab of what may have been a building, big drop off behind it, no basketball hoops.

Text: Seriously?...How did this place ever get a KOA Status?  Where do I start? The newest thing on the property is the bright yellow KOA sign. The grass had not been cut in weeks. Electric boxes propped up, warped picnic tables. This is a Ghetto campground .  If all the above reviews were all true, this place would be packed, as we drove thru, not one rig or camper on the property. Unless you want to count the few seasonal rigs with green mold all over them with their make shift decks and the grass growing up thru them. all fairness, it had a pool, a small pool, but it had one, a couch and a ping-pong table for a game room. KOA's are supposed to meet a standard!!, while on the road they should be like coming home, I wouldn't let my ex-mother in Law stay here. Clean this place up, it gives KOA a bad name.
