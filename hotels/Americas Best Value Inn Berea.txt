Text: My reservation was canceled before we even got to the hotel.  I contacted the manager to ask questions because we made the reservation through a third party.  He argued with me that I already should know and refused to answer my questions.  Why would I be taking the time to call if I already knew the answers?  After continuously arguing with me, I said that I didn't appreciate the way he was treating me.  He told me not to come, then he called the third party and told them that I was not allowed because "I treated him badly."  I guess the customer isn't always right, even when they are.   Winning an argument is apparently more important than having satisfied customers at his hotel.
