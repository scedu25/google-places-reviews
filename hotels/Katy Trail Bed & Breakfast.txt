Katy Trail Bed & Breakfast

Text: I rode in late on my bike transiting the Katy Trail, after getting soaked in rainstorm and somehow entered the wrong apartment, but the folks were not only understanding, they were very helpful. I recommend staying here. The modified boxcar was very clean and comfortable. Thanks!
