Text: Nice room but ... no safety features in bathroom (no grab bars and tub slippery). Toilet is loose -- not supposed to be a rocking chair. Dirty bathtub drain plug. Light/fan switch on OUTSIDE of bathroom so turning it on is very disturbing to others sleeping in room. Sink is out in the room, not in bathroom. Beds, though, are great. TV has working sleep feature, another plus. And, in general, a very quiet place to get a good night's rest.

Text: Nice updated place, quiet, does have a "damp" smell to it. A/C works great. Nice staff!!

Text: Nice rooms and clean. Great deal for the price. Don't count on the "breakfast" filling you up in the morning. It was lacking.
