Motel 6 Des Moines North

Text: Check in was very quick
 Not the most friendly assistant but not rude either.
Booked two rooms and even though we booked one family room and a double room we got two identical rooms. Charged different rates too. Fortunately there were enough beds to sleep everyone.
Best way to describe rooms was grotty. The beds may have been clean bit there appeared to be years worth of stains on the sheets and pillows. Same for the walls and bathroom floor. Room had probably been cleaned given the overpowering bleach smell.
TV reception was good however.

Text: I booked a reservation at the Des Moines North Motel 6, as I was judging a BBQ event about 7 minutes away and wanted to be as close as possible. Once we arrived, we had to wait about 20 minutes to get checked in as there were 2 staff but only one who seemed like he was allowed to use a computer. All this would have been okay, but once we for in the room right away we saw stains on the comforter, cigarette holes in the sheets, holes in the sheets that looked dirty. We moved to the bathroom and the shower floor looked dirty - almost rusty. And on the wall to the right of the mirror was a fly that had been smashed/smeared across the wall. There were also a few other flies in the room, but what this tells me is that either the person cleaning the room killed it and decided not to clean it up - or more likely the room hadn't been cleaned at all based on the rest of the appearance. 

I brought these concerns to the office roughly 30 minutes after we checked in, telling the management we were not going to stay and wanted either  a refund or even partial refund for cancelling and all they had to say is "It's a smoking room" - and declined any money back at all, or even another room.  I've stayed in other smoking rooms before and none have ever smelled as bad or were kept as poorly as this hotel.

I had to just eat the $100 we spent booking this hotel, and just went a few miles down the road and for another $20 had a much better experience that had pillows I wasn't afraid to put my head on. I wasn't planning on spending that much money to literally sleep overnight and leave early in the morning - but decided I was better off spending money I didn't have on another hotel than staying at this location.

This was my first time staying at a Motel 6 and likely the last after this experience. I hope your other locations are not kept like this.

Text: If I could give no stars I would... I was traveling and my car broke down in Des Monies.. my google search brought up this motel and the price was reasonable or so I thought... $97 for a dirty room... the bed had hair all over it and there was even a shoe print on the sheet.. everything in the room was dirty. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.. I was afraid to use the shower or sleep on the bed.

Text: Don't stay here! Very dirty room. Bed's look like newer change and newer clean. Price $60/night incredibly high for this level of services. If you booking your room aviation internet about 1am, you spend lot your time for explain that you need room NOT but not after 2 or 3pm.

Text: Room was not cleaned before second afternoon. They said we had dead bolted it from the inside. Not sure how we could have done that. When i complained, the guy at the desk suddenly could not speak very good English. Toilet was plugged up and wouldn't flush. Shower drain was plugged and wouldn't drain. No night light. Dog barking in room next door all night.
