Text: Really nice campground. Very nice bathrooms. The whole place is clean and well manicured. The staff went above and beyond to help us when we had trouble with our truck. Great place to stay!

Text: I give this KOA extreme kudos!!!! We travel around the United States and I've been at this KOA in 2010 and it was very nice at that time since that time they've done many improvements to their sights and as the pictures I just posted show they are adding more sites.  So many KOA and private campgrounds seem to do very little to improve or just general upkeep.  Will stop again if we travel by this way.

Text: LOVE this place. So much fun for the whole family. Lots of activities for the kids all the way through Halloween! We come at least 3 times a year and always have a blast.

Text: Very nice, would stay here again. Highly recommend. Immaculate, organized, quiet. On a good county road that is very quiet at night. Friendly, helpful staff. Good store and made to order pizza + on site. Much grounds work done over the last months makes the gravel roads and sites near perfect. New cabins with amenities recently added.
