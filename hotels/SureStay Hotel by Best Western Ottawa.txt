SureStay Hotel by Best Western Ottawa

Text: I was not expecting the quality and service we received. But I was proven wrong. The gentleman with concierge was very polite and courteous. The room had ample space with a living area and a kitchen nook (fridge, micro, coffee maker) and desk area. What blew my mind was the restroom was set up with complimentary shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in dispensers! I loved this because as a girl the little bottles that are usually provided aren't enough and sure you can ask for more but who wants to do that when you can have it all ready when you get there. The towels were great quality and they provided plenty. Oh, and the showerhead was amazing! It provided different settings.  Overall I had an amazing experience. (Disclaimer: I am speaking only to the new building of this hotel.  I do not know if the older section was remodeled to have all the same features)

Text: The staff here is very kind and accommodating. Linda went out of her way to call me about a forgotten bag. She kept it at the front desk until a friend could pick it up for me. I am so grateful!

Text: Room was damp feeling/smelly; leaking bathtub faucet all night long; noise from room next to us couldn't be blocked out with TV; cable then stopped working and we called front desk, she said there's nothing she could do about it. All around horrible night.
