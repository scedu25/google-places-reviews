Text: Had fun in a rustic cabin! Had a lake to fish and a swimming area. Close to trails with waterfalls. Reasonably priced.

Text: Excellent - the 'bunkhouse' worked really well for our large group. Very clean!  The kitchen was super - well supplied with appliances (large & small), the dining room was good size for the large group, and the back decks were nice for morning/evening times with everyone. The owners were very accommodating. Bath house also very clean and well maintained.  Our kids really enjoyed the play ground too.  "5 Stars" !

Text: The basic cabin was the perfect fit for us...we avoided setting up the tent in the dark, and we avoided high priced hotels when all we needed was a place to sleep on our trip through Ohio. Owners were nice and plenty helpful. Easy online reservations and then I called 20 min ahead since it was going to be 10pm before we arrived. You can tell it's just a small family operation. Bathhouse was great...clean and nice!

Text: Camped here over Labor Day Weekend.  The owners were great and the sites were wonderful!!  It was quiet , relaxing and serene.  We ended up making friends with our neighbors who were wonderful.  We really didn't do any except for relax!!  If you want to get back to nature and enjoy yourself, this is the place!
