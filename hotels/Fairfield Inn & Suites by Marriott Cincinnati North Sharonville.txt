Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Cincinnati North/Sharonville

Text: I was in a group tour. It's unfortunate that the one assigning the rooms started with the list from page 3 then back to page 1. The people on pages 1-2 were expected to arrive earlier. I was among those on page 1 that waited for 30 minutes while the others were already resting and the ones expected to arrive later already have their room. 
Day 2, the whole day rained. We're on the top floor and had leak on the roof. The TV and lamp were wet. Even the TV channel guide that's laminated was soaked. Good that the response was quick. We were transferred from the top floor to ground floor. 
Breakfast was below my expectations. No pancake maker. Bread toaster was not functioning. 
Carpets were not clean. No enough towels for each of the room occupant. We're 4 in the room but shampoo, conditioner and lotion is just one set. 
Maybe the hotel staff was overwhelmed preparing for 28 rooms for my group. 
Overall,  the staff were very accommodating.

Text: We stayed there on 10/7/17.  This is not bad for an older hotel.  Be warned, they sell them as two bedroom suites, but the bed in the second room is a pullout couch with only a twin bed.  A lot of things have been repainted and freshened, but it still feels like an old hotel.  That in itself is not that bad, and only worthy of losing one star.  The reason for the second star drop is the advertised continental breakfast was complete rubbish.  They had one fruit option, and out of everything else. The meat and eggs trays were constantly empty.  The oatmeal was so watered down that it looked like some kind of nasty soup.  The "out of order" sign on the ONLY waffle maker (a hotel breakfast staple) has been there so long it was starting to yellow.

Yeah, we saved a little bit of money compared to some of the other hotels we've stayed at in the area, but it was not worth it.  The next time we'll stay at a different hotel were the management seems to care a little more about your experience.  We will not stay here again because they are not delivering the quality we're used to from the Marriott brand.

Text: I'm sure it was a great place to stay about 10 years ago. Better options simply sprang up around it and the ownership has failed to adapt and keep up. 

Pros: 
- Close to many attractions in the Cincinnati area. 

Cons: (in relation to my family's stay)
- Broken pool with no forewarning that it was not going to be fixed soon.
- Room key system is dated and faulty. Room keys took 20+ swipes to work after multiple reissuings.
- Cleaning staff did not vacuum room. 
- TVs in rooms were, again, dated and faulty 
- Front desk staff told me to "hold on" while he fixed his hair when I walked up to ask him a question. 
- 2 luggage trolleys for an entire hotel
- Leather room furniture had large pieces of leather peeled off of it.
- Low water pressure 
- A/C units were circa late 1990s, inefficient, and LOUD

I have stayed in many Fairfield Inns by Marriott, and unfortunately this one was not a good representative of the brand.

Text: Hotel is older but in decent shape. Staff were super nice. So nice that when I forgot my room key, they gave me a new one without verifying any of the information on file.

Text: If you are a tea drinker, free tea is located upstairs in the breakfast area. The coffee up there is also available 24/7. Very quiet on floor and good for business professionals. Good variety for breakfast as well. Halls and room smell kinda weird and elevators are far from lobby.
