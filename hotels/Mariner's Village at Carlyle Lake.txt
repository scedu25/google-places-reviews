Mariner's Village at Carlyle Lake
Rating: 4
Text: Had a pleasant visit overall.  Definitely a budget hotel but clean and neat.  I would go back and recommend it others.  Bring your own soap for showering and shampoo.  Breakfast offered was fine.  Staff was polite and helpful.  Nice location and within easy driving distance of local attractions.  Right by the lake.

Text: Very reasonable price and courteous service. My wife is in a wheelchair and the room we got couldn't have worked any better for her. Hotel was clean and well laid out. It was a pleasure staying here.

Text: John, pancake batter should have been made prior to opening same with biscuits and gravy. A one handed cook should have been able to put that check out within 15 minutes.  Please listen to your bad reviews today so your restaurant is ready for tomorrow.  CHEF.
