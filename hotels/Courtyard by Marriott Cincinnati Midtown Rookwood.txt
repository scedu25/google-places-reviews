Courtyard by Marriott Cincinnati Midtown/Rookwood
Rating: 5
Text: The room was beautiful and very clean. The only negative was that the wallpaper was peeling a bit in my room but otherwise it was perfect. The hotel staff was very friendly and helped with a few questions. The parking is $8/night whether you self park or valet, so the valet is a no brainer! Close to tons of restaurants and shopping and right off I71. Very convenient location. Highly recommend this hotel!

Text: Great place, clean rooms, and good service. Bit difficult to find the drive in though and didn't realize you had to drive into the plaza, so we had to circle around. Other then that, great hotel.

Text: It was conveniently located. We were able to walk to a choice of nice restaurants and coffee and wine bars. They offered secure parking in a garage. The room was nice and comfortable. It was very clean. There was a small coffee maker with coffee and tea an ice machine and soda machine right down the hall. It was quiet and the staff courteous. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby and wine for sale if you wanted it. There is construction going on but since it was the weekend the job site was vacant and quiet. They do offer valet. We checked in and out using our smart phone. We like Marriot hotels and that's where we always stay. Was a nice experience.

Text: Rooms are new, clean, and filled with all the best amenities. We were surprised at how large the rooms were. Unfortunately no free breakfast and with kids that's a bigger deal than it sounds. Loved the staff though. They are the best. Especially the front desk guy Joe.
