Hampton Inn Terre Haute
Rating: 5
Text: Very nice, good service, quiet and very clean rooms. Classy space, slept well. A drunk female biker was there in the lobby when I checked in, but they can't control every guest. She was just loud..and I never saw her again. I definitely recommend. Terra Haute itself is generally an awful slice of America in my opinion, but if you gotta stop, this is a good place to do so.  AVOID the Days Inn nearby!  The front desk gal was super! (stayed 7/29/17, checked in at @ 9 PM, management!)  I did figure out she was the ONLY staff apparently at the hotel!  That is not so great.. she was hustling like stock trader on the floor of the stock exchange, smiling the whole time, and handling 5 conversations like a pro!  I wish I had a business because I would hire her to manage it and treat her better than that! She was gold.   The staff the next morning were very good as well, and the hotel appeared well staffed the next day. Hopefully that was a fluke.

Text: Hello! I am sorry, but I never actually went into the building. I was just driving around in the parking lot playing Pokemon. From from the outside it looks like a nice and clean place. It is right next to a Thorntons gas station and right off of the I-70 interstate.

Text: Lovely hotel and nice staff. Thank you everyone for you awesome hospitality, especially Brandi she was very nice and attentive to our needs. The only thing I hated was the Wifi. This was the 1st hotel I ever had an issue with the wifi and that's why I have you guys 4 of 5 stars otherwise it would have been 5 out 5.

Text: We stayed here on our way through town - the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. It was easy on and off the highway. Absolutely no complaints.

Text: Had a wonderful stay. Service is great and breakfast was delicious. Visit the front desk if you forget toiletries. Very happy. Minor caveat is that people can be loud in parking lot at night.
