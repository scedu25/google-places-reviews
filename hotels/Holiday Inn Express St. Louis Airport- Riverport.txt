Holiday Inn Express St. Louis Airport- Riverport
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms are clean and beds are comfy. They had a crib available for our youngest. The Continental breakfast was awesome with a lot of variety. Only critique is that our bathtub stopper didn't work and front desk told me to "shove a wash cloth in it" well that didn't work was hard to bathe our kids. Also asked if they sold milk and they said they didn't have milk however it is available all every breakfast. Overall it was a good experience.

Text: Starting off, as soon as I arrived at the airport we called the hotel and requested a shuttle service, which is complimentary. The hotel sent a van the arrived quickly and drive us stright to the hotel where we were greeted by the hotels friendly staff. After that we went and checked in to our room which was super easy. Our room was very clean. It had hand soap, body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in the bathroom ready to go. Along with plenty of bath towels and hand towels. It even had a hair dryer. Our room also had coffee ready to brew. The room was terrific. After checking out the room it was getting time for us to go to our event. The hotel's shuttle service also offered us a ride to and back from our event at no extra charge. The next morning the hotel offered a complimentary breakfast from 6am to 9am. We went at around 8am the food was all hot and ready, and was enjoyable to eat. The check out time was at noon, but our flight back home wasn't until 2. Even then the hotel still offered us a shuttle ride to the hotel. Over all I was very satisfied with the hotel and it's services. I'll definitely be staying there again.

Text: Very nice hotel in St. Louis. Located further out of the city center, but has good highway access. Really good breakfast, there were ample choices for people who wanted something light or people who wanted heavier fare. Beds were comfortable in the room, and the rooms were a little smaller than what I was used to seeing, but the prices were good and it was only for a night. Would stay again!

Text: Good location if you want to run Creve Coeur Lake. Burger King, Subway, and the convenience store are a short walk. Dave & Busters is close but most everything there is pricey.
Great staff. Sandy is the friendly boss and always there to help.
Some of the rooms need work, so let the front desk know before blasting them online.
One of the best free hotel breakfasts I've ever had.

Text: I stayed at this Holiday Inn Express while driving across the country. Since I was driving from one side of the country to the other I did get there rather late for check in which proved to be quite an issue even though I had never had an issue with late check ins before. All of the staff was friendly and professional. The room was perfect and I was happy to find that the air conditioning was on when I arrived at my room. The only real issue I have with this location is that there's no markings of what it is. Since I'm not familiar with the area and there were other hotels nearby I was not sure that the building was actually the Holiday Inn Express. If it weren't for the Holiday Inn Express van out front I would have driven right past it.
