Super 8 Hutchinson

Text: reservation specifically stated both handicap, must have a bottom floor. somehow a smoking request got added to our reservation. we got to the hotel and he had us on the 3rd floor with no elevator because we "had requested smoking" never mind that it stated we were disabled and needed ground floor. he refused to help us in anyway and acted very non interested because he knew he would get paid anyway by the reservation card - we are disputing the charge with them. this motel is old and smelly. the "ground floor" is 4 or 5 steps downstairs while the second is 4 or 5 up. then another flight to the 3rd floor.

Text: Put us in the garden view room. Exterior door lock broke. Strange smell as we went down stairs to basement. Room was musty smelling. Walked down hallway to swim and even worse smells. Pool was dirty so we passed. Shower didn't work at 5 a.m. when we needed to be somewhere at 5:30 a.m. One star because it was cheap but never again. Suprised Super 8 allows their name on this place.

Text: Place was good for price. Breakfast was ok. Toilet didn't flush well but was otherwise ok. Next time we go to the fair we'll probably stay there again.
