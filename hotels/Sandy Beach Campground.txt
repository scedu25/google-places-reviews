Sandy Beach Campground

Text: A large group of friends and family go out every year. It's a wonderful place to spend the week in a hammock. Nothing better than swimming all day in the beautiful lake, and warming up by a campfire when the sun goes down. I would definitely recommend

Text: Awesome campground!  It can be quite packed but if you search down every road you can find some very nice and secluded campsites.  Beautiful lake too!
