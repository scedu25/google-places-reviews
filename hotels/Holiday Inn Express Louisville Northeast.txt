Text: The gentleman at the desk 'Marc' made this the most pleasant hotel booking I have ever made! I didn't even stay at the hotel but I booked it for my wife and kids who had an out of town emergency and needed a room just for a few hours late at night. I was stressed and worried about my kids who were stranded while my wife drove to them. I must have called 4 or 5 times with some concerns and Mark helped me and actually calmed me down with humor and awesome hospitality!  I will definitely stay here because there is nothing better than being made to feel so welcome while away from home. Big thumbs up to Marc!

Text: This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed.  Recently remodeled very modern but warm.  The bedding is like a cloud.  The shower is awesome.  Staff friendly.  Very clean. They even have little wipes that you can wipe your remote off with.   Will stay here again.
