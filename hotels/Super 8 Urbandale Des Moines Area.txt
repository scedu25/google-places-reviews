Super 8 Urbandale/Des Moines Area
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed here for a week and they were awesome. The rooms are newly remodeled, gorgeous, and clean. They don't allow smoking, so even tho I am a smoker I love that clean smell in my room. They always helped me with anything I needed, pronto. It's close to a few different fast food places, grocery store, and clothing stores. And the best part is it's not right on the busy street so there's never a lot of traffic or noise. It's actually behind a car lot. The car lot blocks all of that congestion. I'd stay here again and again.

Text: nicest super 8 I've ever stayed in. fully remodeled and pool actually is open and well kept unlike most super 8s that always say they have it but it's always shut down.  rooms look more like a holiday inn then super 8s.  5 star for price, friendly service and for quality of the hotel.

Text: Shae was very respectful at the front desk. The room price did end up being different than advertised. I was plesently surprised by the cleanliness of the room. I would suggest this hotel to fellow colleagues. There was minimal staining on the sheets however this can be solved by bringing your own.
