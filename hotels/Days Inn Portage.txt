Text: Stopped here for an overnight on a road trip. The room was clean, the bed was good, the staff were friendly and it was a great value. They do have a AAA member discount. 

The hotel was a little older and in general a little rough around the edges, but for $50 a night we didn't have super high expectations. 

At breakfast they had toast, oatmeal, microwaveable omlets, orange and apple juice, coffee, tea and some flake cereals. 

Overall, we would stop here again.

Text: Pretty cheap. Really nice staff, very accommodating too.A Denny"s right next door. A pool too. Do not choose a room by the pool, they are musty back there. Large rooms, a bit run down . Comfortable beds, free breakfast too. Good value. Next time I'll get a room not by the pool. Very nice stafg

Text: Was an awesome time with family. Rooms were clean, pool and hot tub was fun. Wish they had a little more for breakfast like donuts n bagels with cream cheese. But our stay was fun. I didn'T take any pics cause we was too busy having fun.

Text: This is a nicer version of the room they gave me last time. Second floor . . . nicer paint job . . . a bit of laminate in the "entryway to the room." I would be happy to stay here again. It's convenient to the highway and many of the major trucking companies in the area.
