Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Galesburg
Rating: 3
Text: You pretty much know what you are getting at a Fairfield inn - cheap room with no frills. Lobby is nice, room was clean, breakfast is great, and the service at this location is possibly the best I've ever had short of staying at vacation resort. Only drawback is that the whole place smelled a bit "damp." Not sure if it was just humid or what, but it was a bit off putting. I got used to it eventually. Tub also filled with water a minute or two into my shower.

Text: My Mom and I stayed at the Fairfield and really enjoyed it. The rooms were clean, the staff was warm and friendly, the breakfast in the morning was great and it was quiet at night while we were sleeping. We didn't have a chance to swim, but they do have an amazing indoor pool. We would definitely stay there again.

Text: I love the comfort at Fairfield Inn in Marion Il.   The pillows are to die for.  The front desk and other hospitality employees go out of their way to make my stay perfect in all ways. 

I really like their happy hours, after driving for hours I enjoy that cocktail to bring me back down to reality.  Thanh You Fairfield Inn by Marriott for making my seven hour drive a comfortable night to remember

Text: Our family dreads travel because we never know what the hotel we will end up at will be like. We have loved this place since we first happened upon it. Now when. We travel, we know there is one place we can stay where we know we will enjoy our stay. It has taken a lot of the stress out of traveling for our family.

Text: Had a power outage during our stay that knocked out our TV so the manager quickly reassigned us to another room. Very good staff and the breakfast was excellent as well. Very comfortable beds and a great location in close proximity to US 34.
