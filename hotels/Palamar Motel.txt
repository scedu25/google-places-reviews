Palamar Motel

Text: Wow.  It was $50 for two adults.  The smell of reefer is strong when you pull up.  One of the buildings is boarded up.  Another abandoned building just in the other side of it.  Wind howls through the cracks around the door.  No ice machine or wifi, but there is a fridge in the room and an antique microwave.  No coat hangers.  Shady characters in parking lot, looks like it's become a long term indigent hotel.  Saw some kind of "deal" happen in the parking lot.    Non smoking room smells like an ashtray. Absolutely nothing around it. Otherwise lovely.

Text: Desk clerk was friendly enough. It was extremely quiet and the room was clean. Checkout time wasn't extremely early either. I'd come back and recommend it.

Text: Good location, rooms are old and worn, very old hotel and not in a rustic way. Carpets are worn, beds are worn, everthing smells old.
