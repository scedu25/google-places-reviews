Bass Point Resort
Rating: 5
Text: An amazing family resort. The rooms are very nice with new updates each year. The pool is very nice for all ages. The managers are the kindest, sweetest, hard working couple ever. There is a banquet room with a pool that can be reserved for big family gatherings. The covered boat docks are great and the fishing dock is very nice also. Bass Point is a fantastic family resort.
