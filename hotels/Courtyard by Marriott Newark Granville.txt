Courtyard by Marriott Newark Granville

Text: Wonderful hotel, great location next to the McDonald's & Texas Roadhouse. Our rooms were clean, comfortable, & quiet. The smart TV was a nice surprise. We will stay again if we are in the area, and I highly recommend staying here. The pool area was nice, was a little disappointing to not have a hot tub, but their fitness center was awesome. The only thing is there is no continental breakfast, there is a Starbucks inside though.

Text: Having just spent the night at another hotel in town, I was not very impressed with my time at this one. While the front desk staff was very kind and courteous, we had an issue with the pool and the maintenance staff was not kind or helpful. The pool was dirty and they said it's supposed to be that way. If you're coming for a hotel with a nice pool, stay elsewhere. Location was great though and the drinks at the bar were good as well.

Text: Nice rooms. We could hear other guests and the air conditioner can wake a light sleeper when it turns on in the middle of the night. The lobby bar was accommodating. Overall I recommend this hotel.

Text: First room smelled like cigarette smoke. Front desk was quick to move us to another, nicer room. Second room smelled like cleaning supplies.
