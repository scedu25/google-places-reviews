Best Western Plus Portage Hotel & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Best Western Plus in Portage was a fun and relaxing stop on our trip. The staff were friendly and super helpful. Check in was quick and convenient and our room was super clean and comfy. They also have great towels here. It's a simple luxury but a one to be taken note of. The pool area is really nice with a spa tub and kids play area with water features as well as a game room. This would be a great hotel for a family stay but was still quiet and very relaxed. Free breakfast was great with hot and cold items. Very convenient to plenty of restaurants and shopping. With for sure be staying here again!

Text: We had a great stay at this hotel. Our room had two double beds and was HUGE - like probably three people could do yoga at the same time. Great bathroom and shower. We didn't get to go swimming, but the pool area looked nice too. Check it was easy and friendly and we had a very peaceful stay, even though they seem to be doing some renovations. It was a quick drive (a little over an hour) from Chicago on our way to Michigan so the routing was perfect.

Text: I thought this hotel was great. Employees were helpful and the hotel was clean. We had 2 adults and 5 kids in a king suite. 1 adult and 3 kids fit great in the kings bed and 1 adult and 2 kids fit on the pullout couch. Each room in the suite has a tv. We ate breakfast and it was pretty good and free. :) We also went down yo the pool and had a very good time. The kid splash pad is a plus! We will definitely come here again.

Text: I stayed there October 21, 2017. Our room was filthy. We were moved to another room and it was filthy too. Finally the 3rd room was tolerant better but still found garbage in the desk drawer. I am still trying to talk to management about the situation. No resolution has happened at this time. The 2 rating was only because the breakfast was ok and staff could have been worse.

Text: Stay here often,  always great.  From check in to check out always a pleasure.  Beds are outstanding,  clean quiet rooms. Nice little bar with great food. I'm always on business  but they have a great pool with kids area, jacuzzi,  game room and workout room that look very nice also. When in the area it's the only place I stay, very convenient to Chicago also.
