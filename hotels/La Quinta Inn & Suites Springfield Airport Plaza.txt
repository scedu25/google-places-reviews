La Quinta Inn & Suites Springfield Airport Plaza
Rating: 4
Text: Standard hotel room. As a female traveling alone, I felt very comfortable here. Was able to park right in front of the building - nicely lit lot. 

Bed was comfortable, pillows were meh, room was fairly quiet. First floor room had a high ceiling which was a nice feature. The staff was super friendly and check-in/checkout were a breeze. Breakfast looked pretty decent with warm options like eggs, sausage, biscuits, etc. I was meeting someone for breakfast though so I didn't eat anything and they didn't really have anything to grab and go.

Text: This hotel is a very nice clean example of a La Quinta. It is not brand new, but has had updates and is VERY clean. I truly appreciate this company being pet friendly, and they keep the place family friendly and welcoming. I have to say I thought the price a bit high, (over $150 for two queens), but again, thankful for their pet policy and I understand it takes more time to clean because of this feature.

Text: Preface: I don't usually stay at La Quinta's. I've had bad experiences... This one, while dated, is clean, has good WiFi, and an incredibly friendly staff. The ac worked well, the bed was comfortable. The pillows were not so great, but... All in all, I'd stay here again, and I'm a bit of a hotel snob.

Text: It's comfortable, it's nice, and there's tons of food in the area. Margaritas and nachos down the street at mexican.
You just have to remember the wifi code is in your room on the desk when you walk in. For some reason they don't put it on key cards like everyone else.

Text: This La Quinta was okay. The room was smaller than I thought it would be. Bathroom was decent. If looking for hottub don't go to this one they don't have one.
