Coronado Motel & RV Park
Rating: 1
Text: We stayed to attend a tournament in the area. I called in advance to make a reservation. I should have looked at the room first, lots of dead bugs in the room & bathroom. Room had an unpleasant odor in it. The washcloths were like sandpaper. Breakfast consisted of bread a few mini muffins & hard boiled eggs (which were not under any refrigeration. the two containers of yogurt were both open. Overall experience, I would not recommend staying here. I like to support small business, but not this time.

Text: This was a lovely small-town motel. Since I checked in during the afternoon, when no one was in the office, I was instructed on how to check myself in; a uniquely small-town experience. The room was clean and amenities were standard. Nothing was strikingly good or bad. I would stay there again.
