Hampton Inn Wichita-East
Rating: 5
Text: Came to check in, was immediately greeted by front desk staff, who was giving others recommendations for dining. Check in was simple, room was clean, workout facilities were simple, but clean and continent. Lots of choices around for dinner and drinks. Breakfast was good, and checkout was easy. Would stay again on next time through!

Text: They got clean rooms and great breakfast. Reasonable prices too! I didn't like the woman at the reception because she acted like she didn't care if we checked ourselves. Good employees will get more business!
