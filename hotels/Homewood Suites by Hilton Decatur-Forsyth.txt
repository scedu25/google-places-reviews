Text: Smooth check in and staff was friendly. The room itself is in a strong second to the Residence Inn by Marriott across the street. The featured a full size kitchen with table and chairs. In addition, the free breakfast, large pool and jacuzzi were also one of the better facilities I have seen. This hotel is great for longer stays. I would recommend this hotel if in the area. Staff were super nice at my very late arrival and accommodated the flight delays and held my room. Thanks for reading and video on the youtube channel.

Text: Zero water pressure so shower takes 3 times longer. Breakfast worse than awful. Artificial eggs with cheese in them. Sausages cold and hard. No forks 15 minutes after breakfast started with 6 people in the dining area. This used to be one of my favorite hotels. So many corners cut that stay is cheapened.

Text: Very nice hotel! Staying for the weekend for a Assembly. Our room use a living room and full kitchen that comes with dishes and a dishwasher. Bathroom is a great size. They serve dinner during the weekdays and it is actually fairly good! My only big complaint is they don't serve dinner on the weekend
