Days Inn Detroit Metropolitan Airport

Text: I got the park sleep fly package. For the price it was quite acceptable. The hotel is run down a little bit but they are making upgrades slowly. Could use a second front desk associate but the woman working it was very efficient and super friendly. The beds we're very comfortable and the room was very clean. I would stay there again.

Text: Went just to get a place to sleep and park while on holidays and got a gorgeous huge room at hardly more than the cost of parking at the airport. 
Shuttles are busy so don't miss your ride.
 Getting your car back is painless if your sure of your return date, otherwise saw a traveler have to wait a bit while they got his car.

Text: Kailey at the front desk is a super star! Twice she helped us in a very professional manner despite being swamped with a long line up of guests and juggling many balls at once.

The room was fine and clean and comfortable.

Text: Five stars because this place is a good value. Don't expect them to respond to your every whim, however the place is clean and comfortable. We did get some noise from the floor above, I might have been better off on the top floor.
