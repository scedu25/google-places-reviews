Holiday Inn Express Mt. Vernon

Text: Newly remodeled hotel which is really nice. IHG check in process is poor to begin with so I don't want to to dock this hotel for that. The parking lot is a little small if you have a large vehicle, but next door is a big parking lot. The bed was comfortable, the room clean, but the shower lacked real water pressure. Overall a great hotel though.

Text: Since renovations the place doesn't look like much on the outside but as you walk through the front door the lobby and breakfast area look very nice and modern.  The lobby and breakfast area are both air conditioned so it's very cool in the summer. They just need to hire more staff.

Text: Friendly, clean, contemporary, and good breakfasts! The remodeling is almost finished and looking good. Semi-rural setting--field across the street. But close to shopping and colleges.
