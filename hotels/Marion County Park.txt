Marion County Park

Text: End of the season camping. The park is almost empty but that just allows you to see how lovely the grounds look. The sites are nice in size ( we have a 30ft motorhome and Jeep Unlimited with plenty of space left). The lake is nice and the old  covered bridge is a nice touch. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Good amount of space between lots. We camped with a 41 foot 5th wheel and didn't have any issues. Does require a certain amount of leveling - come prepared.

Text: The kids love to hang out with their friends & the dog loves going for walks.  If your looking for a place to camp they have some of the best facilities around.  The old historical town is always neat to see.  Very family friendly & lots to do.
