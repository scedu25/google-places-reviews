Text: Quaint "mom and pop" place. What a great experience we had. I'm all about the comforts and conveniences of modern big named hotels but this place was really cool. Set in what I would call a farming community, they had wifi, pop and snacks for puchase @ the office, ice cold a/c etc...  But the best thing was the people.  We were in town for a fishing tournament and had an issue with our boat. While I was out working on it the younger gentleman that worked there who I assume was the son came over to see if he could help. Not long after that they were all out there, and we were in their garage looking through parts and brackets trying to find what I needed to fix the problem. After we found what we were looking for they proceeded to clean the paint and rust off these brackets which was totally unnecessary and would have worked fine just the way they were, but the fact that they went the extra mile and cleaned them up and helped us showed just how important it was to them to make sure we had a great experience. Just seemed like genuine great people.  Thanks again to all of you @ Motel Somerset.
