Text: The hotel was nice,  clean,  safe and affordable and just far enough away from downtown.  Our king size, Jacuzzi suite was very clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful.  They had a very good continental breakfast with any attendant.  Ive often found that front desk person has to double duty to attend to the breakfast, and things get neglected.  I appreciated that small touch.

Text: Our ministry, (Dwelling Place House of Prayer) has our weekly Worship services here and the staff is always so welcoming! They greet us with a smile. It's very clean and always smells nice. They have good Gourmet coffee, fresh cookies and candy ;). I am unable to make it when they serve the continental breakfast but I hear they have a nice variety. Shout out to the GM, Nicole, Sandeep, all Front-End staff, Callisto (Maintenance Supervisor), and all the Housekeeping staff who make it possible for us to enjoy an environment where we don't cringe when we walk in or have to question the service of the business. Thank you all! We appreciate you!

Text: Really nicely kept up, friendly staff, good breakfast to get your day started. It is about 30-45 min or so from downtown depending on traffic of course. It is the perfect distance out of Chicago to avoid the city prices but not r far that you can't go into the city for an evening of fun.

Text: Excellent new property. Convenient location with variety of fast food in walking distance, better dining options not too much farther. Enjoy a cookie at the speedy and friendly check-in. Upgrade to a Jacuzzi room for just a few dollars more. Ask for a free pass to the Lifetime Fitness gym nearby, or use the minimalist gym on site. Rooms have numerous outlets and USB charge ports built into the headboard. Climate control works well. Everything is still in very new condition. The lobby looks like it would be cozy in the winter. The breakfast isn't amazing, but what free breakfast at a two and a half star property is? Enjoy this place if you're in the area for work, or as a comfy place to rest in between destinations. Not convenient to Chicago, so don't stay here if you're looking to spend most of your time in the city.
