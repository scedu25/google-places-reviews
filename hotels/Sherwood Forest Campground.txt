Text: Very friendly staff, clean (including the bathrooms And shower facilities), pet friendly, and good fishing. This is the first year that I have been here as an actual camper, but have visited My parents while they have camper here. My parents have a permanent seasonal site here, and they love it.

Text: The grounds are nice, but there are no sewer hook ups. The bathrooms are fairly clean. They take reservations which the spot I had reserved was given to another camper. I awoke almost ever morning to the sound of a bobcat backup alarm that went on for the better part of the day. Until I moved to the other side of the lake away from the main grounds was I happy. The photo on Google was my first spot and was happy there until I had to move due to a reservation. Most lots are shaded and altered are lots of permanent live in people there.
