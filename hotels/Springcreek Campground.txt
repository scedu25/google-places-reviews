Springcreek Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Small well kept grounds.  Nice playground can be seen from all camp sights .   Very friendly owners and campers. Quaint little lake perfect for taking the littles fishing. 
Some sights a bit tight but work.

Text: Nice sites, quiet. Bathroom/ shower house is basic but well taken care of. $20 RV, $10 tent for a night.  Hard to beat! GPS leads to owners home.  Campground is about 800 yards further down the road.

Text: We came upon this cute little campground while heading home. A quick stop off 1-70. I called for a spot but the owner was just in the midst of opening for the season so there was no water but we were self contained in a 31' 5th wheel so it didn't matter. We had electricity hook up so all was good. We paid $20. We were the only ones there - we had our own little haven for the night. The park has a pavilion for gatherings, a playground and a small lake for peace and tranquility. We definitely have this place starred if we are back in this area. A nice find.
