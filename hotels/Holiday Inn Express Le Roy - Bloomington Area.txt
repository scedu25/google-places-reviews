Text: This was an excellent place to stay. Room and linens were clean. Very accommodating to our dog we were traveling with. Breakfast was hot, fresh, and delicious. There were eggs, omelettes, Greek yogurt, oatmeal, bacon, sausage and much more. The lady running the breakfast was very attentive.   Staff was phenomenal and responded to needs quickly. Would definitely stay here again!

Text: The hotel was fine, not great but not bad. The bed wasn't very comfortable and at one point the water turned brown but quickly went back to clear. Those are the only complaints that I have about the room.

Text: Rooms were great, really comfortable beds. The staff was really friendly and helpful. I had to leave early every morning during my stay and the staff had some breakfast items out an hour and a half early for our crew before we left.
