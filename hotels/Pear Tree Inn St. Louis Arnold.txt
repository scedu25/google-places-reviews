Pear Tree Inn St. Louis Arnold

Text: This was my first time I've ever stayed in a 2-star hotel in my life, and we stayed for a night here as our last night for a school trip. Though on the older side, the rooms were very clean and everything was in good condition. Our room had two full size beds, a chair and other amedimes. The shower had two knobs to adjust the temperature of the heat rather than your average side wheel. The beds were comfortable and the free breakfast was delicious. (great waffles!) There is also free popcorn and other things at night, which is a plus. We never got the chance to use the pool, but it looked nice from afar. We hit the road in a good mood. Definitely a good place to stay for a cheap price!

Text: This is an incredible value. It really is no problem to get to anywhere in St Louis from here. Close to I 55 and 270 so you can go downtown to a game or concert or any of the major shopping areas fairly quickly. 

Great full breakfast including scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, waffles, hot and cold cereals, yogurts,  bagels, and variety of bread, donuts, muffins. Everything tastes great and it's always hot and nicely presented. Also evening snacks with soda, wine or beer are included. 

Rooms are great and well kept. But the best aspect which makes it wonderful is its value and the staff. The front desk employees are wonderful. Ann, Pam, Sharon and Cindy are outstanding! So friendly and helpful. They go out of their  way to make your stay great. Housekeepers are all excellent! Wish I could list them all. They are so friendly and professional. They are very accommodating and keep the rooms immaculate. 

I've been on an extended stay here and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Definitely will stay here again and highly recommend the Pear Tree in Arnold.

Text: The hotel was nice for the most part. The room was smaller than expected but was clean. Pear Tree provides evening snacks that were ok and free coffee and sodas. The morning brunch was OK. It consists of eggs, sausage, waffles, biscuits and gravy and assorted muffins. Overall it was good. Housekeeping likes to enter your room very early so keep the do not disturb sign out. Parking is free. The hotel was quiet also.

Text: The front desk guy Andrew was great!! Upon getting settled into our room we noticed the chair leg was broke. We called the front desk who immediately changed us to another room. It did stink moving since we were already settled, but we moved to the room next to ours. Andrew did call twice after to make sure we were good. I was disappointed that when we couldn't find my son's shoes and I called down to ask if they were found in the other room they said yes.. They were still there.  The pool is small but clean. As long as there's not a lot of people in the pool it's good! The beds and pillows are comfy, the room was nice and cold, and they had a descent hot breakfast with sausage, eggs, biscuits, bagels, cereal, waffles, juice and milk. And if you did not have shampoo, conditioner, soap..it is in a dispenser in the shower. I do, however, wish they had taller commodes. They also have a "happy hour" with free drinks (alcohol and Pepsi) and popcorn, but unfortunately we missed out since we were out late.  I would definitely stay again!!
