Days Inn Morton
Rating: 5
Text: The staff and management were very friendly and helpful and made sure all things in our room worked. A manager even came in late to fix our TV. The room was very clean and the normal breakfast I was expecting became above average with the great rest I got there and the fresh coffee. Definitely worth the 80$ dollars I spent a night and would return to stay again.

Text: Very accommodating, when Super 8 Pekin was discriminating against people with disabilities that have a pet. But the Days Inn wad great.

Text: The front desk clerk, Stephanie, was extremely helpful and very courteous! She made sure I was well taken care of and was very hospitable. Can't recommend her and this hotel enough!

Text: Location is easily accessible, right off the highway. Although I drove past it twice because the sign is blocked by a tree. Room was nice, albeit with a musty smell.
