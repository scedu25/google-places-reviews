Text: Six good friends from the last class of Jefferson high school..class of 1960, Upland.. (before consolidation)
Spent from Thursday afternoon, until late am on Fri.   What a warm, beautiful renovated home.  The housekeeper, Beth made us so welcome.  We took our own supper and asked her to share her time with us.  Beds were very comfortable, each room had its own Tv and beautiful bathroom. ..  highly recommend.
