SpringHill Suites by Marriott St. Louis Airport/Earth City

Text: Overall a nice stay. The staff is friendly. The rooms are nice. They offer an airport shuttle and free breakfast, I did not use either, but it's nice to know it's available. Only minor issues are, shower floor looks dirty and is incredibly slippery. Also the pillows, which were comfortable are really small, about the same size as a decorative couch pillow. Other than that everything was great, and I would stay again

Text: Had a great stay here. The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was good. The area is nice. All in all a great place. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems like the walls are thin. Heard snoring and heard people getting in and out of their rooms. Beyond that, I recommend.

Text: The rooms are amazing and clean! But I was moved to this hotel because they messed up the confirmation at the hotel I originally booked. The room was free which is why I didn't complain. I booked the other hotel because distance to six Flags and this hotel was another 30 minutes away. Also I knew we would be walking at six flags for 12 hours so the other hotel had a hot tub and this one had no hot tub to soak my aching body!!!  Lol and then the room didn't even have a bath tub to soak in a hot bath. BE CAREFUL IN THE STAND UP SHOWERS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO SO SLIPPERY AND HAVE NO SHOWER MAT OR SLIP RESISTANT ANYTHING!!! But all together it was comfy,  clean,  and quiet, just not what I booked or wanted from my stay!

Text: Nice, quiet hotel. Strict "quiet hours", and no parties rules. Perfect for families or business. The free breakfast was OUTSTANDING. The room was fine, nothing spectacular, but good enough. Staff was helpful.

Text: Great room, well appointed and modern. Front desk service was very good as well. The weekend breakfast buffet was busy but staff kept up. Food was better than average for the "free variety". Good location for those needing access to the airport as well.
