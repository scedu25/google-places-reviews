Baymont Inn & Suites Topeka
Rating: 4
Text: Quality stay for a great price! Our room was clean and comfortable. The bedding is fresh and modern. We had a welcome reception during check-in. Others complained of bugs, while we did not encounter any bugs, I think it is to be expected when rooms are accessed from outside, and not to be seen as a lack of cleanliness. The hotel provided a good breakfast.

Text: This hotel is right off the highway close to everything that you're looking for in Topeka. There's nothing special about this hotel. It's pretty worn down. I think the staff does an amazing job of keeping it clean. Kate at the front desk is exactly what you would expect the customer service and area knowledge of a high-end Hotel.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for the price.

Text: The breakfast was what you'd expect, not bad but not too many options. The rooms seemed fairly clean when we got there, but as I was falling asleep a bug crawled across my bed. I only saw the one, but still wasn't a very pleasant experience. I did not swim, but the pool did look nice when I walked by it.

Text: It was one of the worst motels all around. The room was bad, but the hospitality was worse.
