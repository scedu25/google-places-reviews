Text: A great hotel, the staff is warm and inviting.  We come once a year on a business trip.  Billie Jo remembers the entire group by name. Everyone that I have had contact with has been awesome.  Rooms are neat and clean, housekeeping does a great job.  
We have even seen one guest from year to year.  

The decore is nice, not so fancy to make you uncomfortable but not shabby, it feels like home.  Thanks to the staff for making us feel at home!
