La Quinta Inn & Suites Cincinnati Airport Florence
Rating: 5
Text: Clean, remodeled, dog friendly room. Hallway noise was at a minimum which was surprising as it was over a holiday weekend and fully booked. We were able to sleep through the night in comfort, peace and quiet. 

The complimentary breakfast is one of the better I have come across and unlike some other hotel chains, they allow you to take it back to your room...definitely a plus when you are traveling with dogs that are not to be left unattended per hotel policy. This allowed one of us to go down, get our breakfast and bring it back to the room while the other remained with the dogs. 

The only downside is that they were still in the remodeling process and because of that, the washer and dryer were out of service. Normally this would not be an issue for me, but as luck would have it, this was the first time I have needed to use a hotel's laundry facilities.

We did not check out the pool; therfore I cannot comment on it. 

I am still willing to give 5 stars as overall it was a good experience. This is now my go to hotel when passing through Florence.

Text: LaQuinta Inn was very clean and conveniently located to the airport. Hot breakfast always a plus. I did have an issue with the drain in the bathroom sink. Over all excellent hotel for the price.

Text: Stayed next to elevator so it was very noisy won't make that mistake again. But overall the hotel was well taken care of and the staff was excellent. Bathroom had some previous water damage but nothing major. Beds were comfortable and the breakfast was very good in the morning with adequate selection.
