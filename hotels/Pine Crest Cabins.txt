Pine Crest Cabins

Text: Our issues began before we even got to the cabins. They would not confirm room booking cost. They told me "we will give you a price when you arrive" ... THEN once we got there our check in time was 3:00pm. One of the rooms was ready but we had to wait an hour for the other room. Once inside we instantly seen a cockroach climbing up the wall. Black hair on the pillows and sheets. Once in the second room there were ants on the walls next to the bed. One of the guests was using the bathroom and watch a roach crawl out of the outlet. When we said something to the keeper she responded laughing " I'm sure it's just a wood roach".  There was nobody in the office or would answer the phone when we called. We did not expect a high-end cabin, just something clean. (wifi didn't work) On a positive note it is in a good location, warm water, cute pavilion and fire pit.

Text: Fraud!! They made false charges to my account also. I canceled over 2 weeks in advance. I canceled July 7th. My stay would have been on the 21st and 22nd of July. They charged my card $60.00 on Aug. 14th, like a month after I would have been there. When I called my bank they told me me that in the month of August they also charged my account $23.00 and $29.00 and separate occasions. Also four different charges of .99 cents. AND TRIED TO CHARGE $400.00 TWICE!!! Luckily I had "insufficient funds", lol. I tried to contact the owner, Tammy, all day. She would answer"Tammy here" then when I asked for Tammy she said "oh, she will be back in a few. I  called 4 times with this same run around. Tammy never returned my calls. WOW!!! I have never had this happen in my life!!! Worst case of fraud I've had. Makes me want to never give anyone my card number to "hold".

Text: Very clean! Great room for a rural area. Room had a mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, towels, TV with satellite, alarm clock, coffee pot and coffee. We had 2 full size beds and plenty of room. Also each room has a fire pit, BBQ grill and picnic table right outside. As well as chairs and table on the porch. Smoking is allowed outside and ashtrays are provided. We will definitely stay here again on our next float trip!

Text: So clean!! and the Hot water is never ending!!  Now this isn't a 5 star rating for NYC.. this is a 5 star rating for Eminence MO. Although I travel a lot for work and must say this is one of the cleanest places I've stayed at. The cabins look brand new and the molding, tubs, floors are spotless. The linens smell amazingly clean and fresh. We were in a king suite and the bed was very comfortable. Coffee, towels, and soap was provided. No blow dryer or shampoo so bring your own. There is a mini frig. Great location about 1/2 city block away from center of downtown so it's quiet except for the turkey's calling. Tammy was very helpful and friendly but left us alone. She has ice and laundry facilities. The grocery store and liquor store and diner are all 1/2 block in downtown. Definitely a 5 star for Eminence!

Text: We had no toilet seat and plenty of ants could be found going down the wall from window unit to the waste basket. I will never go back.
