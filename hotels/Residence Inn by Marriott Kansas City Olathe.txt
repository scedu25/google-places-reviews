Residence Inn by Marriott Kansas City Olathe

Text: Odd layout with only one elevator and stairways only on the end wings. Clean and homely, nicely equipped rooms. Somewhat thin walls between rooms. Service was good but lacked a little control over noisy hallway runners.

Text: Their rooms are very comfortable. Bed comforters fluffy and cuddly. The maid service is impeccable. Love the hot breakfast - tons of variety. Great way to spend comfortable vacation.

Text: If a SIX star existed...it wouldn't be enough stars.   The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay the best.  They are all suites so bring a roommate or two.   They have an outside gas grill, fire pit, ball court, indoor pool!!   The washers and dryers will keep you neat and clean.  The breakfast options are nice as well as the mixed beer and wine after 6 m-w.    Mention bryan123 sent you to Ashley.

Text: I love the location of the hotel, close to so many places to eat and convenient for the places we want to go. The room size is fantastic and it's wonderful to have a kitchen and living room. We did have a few issues with lights flickering (quickly fixed) and the kitchen was full of dirty dishes and tye oven was dirty when we arrived (neither fixed.) The AC blows extra cold in one bedroom, just right in the living room, and sadly doesn't hardly work in our bedroom. My sleep is affected because I'm waking early because I'm so hot. Overall it's a great value and I'd give them another try.
