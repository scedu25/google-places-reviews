Text: Good price, great staff, clean but old and very small rooms if you get a single queen or single king. I"m sure suites are much bigger. Limited parking especially for trucks.

Text: The place is old but the room was recently renovated and was comfortable for the price. The breakfast was your standard continental breakfast. The a.c. didn't seem to work but the temperature stayed comfortable. Even though I had it on 65 it felt 70 and it would turn on after a while and then shut off. Overall it was an ok place to lay our heads for a night.
