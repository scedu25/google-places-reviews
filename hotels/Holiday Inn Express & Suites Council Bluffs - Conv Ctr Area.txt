Text: Great facility... clean, modern, comfy beds, and friendly staff.  Normal hotel breakfast included... nothing fancy.  Great pool and mini-gym facilities.  Well lite parking in a safe part of town near I29

Text: Our baseball team stayed at this hotel for a youth world series, total of 5 days. All the staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel was nice enough to turn their banquet room into a game room for all the baseball players staying there, also the lobby was decorated with baseball themed things, and the kids were given goody bags with baseball goodies upon arrival. The best part for me as a parent who decide to drive from Texas to Nebraska with 5 kids is they let us check in early!! Great hotel, I will return if we are ever out that way again.

Text: Pretty good hotel. Nice breakfast options with HIE's usual cinnamon rolls and other options. The parking lot was getting refinished so it should be nice for a while.

Text: We were in town for a concert, and the location was close enough to the event center/downtown Omaha without being overpriced. Free breakfast was nice. Bed was comfy. Did not use the pool or fitness center, so cannot comment. Would stay again.
