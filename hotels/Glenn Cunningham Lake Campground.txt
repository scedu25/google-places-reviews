Glenn Cunningham Lake Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Great crappie fishing.  Nice place to canoe (no wake lake) and simple, fairly clean walking trails around the park.  I usually park by the marina side of the lake and there's a small sand beach for wading and canoe rentals.  The campground is well situated, but there's no campground host that I know of so you may be camping by Hufflepuffs or rednecks on any given night, so camp at your own risk.  (ie. no penalties for barking dogs, etc etc).

Text: The first night was really nice. Real nice park. However, the second night someone moved in next to us. Barking dog never stopped
They had 8 other cars show up for party. Never picked up after the dog. Broke every park rule. Bad thing is no camp host to enforce anything. Where is the enforcement!!

Text: Very nice lake area. Great for photography! We did not stay at the campgrounds, but did visit while in the area. We would go back.

Text: This review is only on the camping aspects of the park. The fishing and other lake activities might be great, but the campground was a disappointment. Yes, it is cheap and we just needed a site with electricity for one night so, based on the good reviews, we decided to stop here. The first thing we noticed was the road dust. Second, it became obvious that absolutely no rules are enforced. There are tents pitched on the pull-through RV sites, there are people that have "reserved" sites by just putting an envelop on a site with no RV there, and the site across from the one we set up on had seven cars parked around it. Expect there to be rude, messy people with loud music, barking dogs and trash left around. Even at $15 a night, I'm not sure I would stay here again.
