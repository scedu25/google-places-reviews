Red Roof Inn Detroit - Plymouth/ Canton
Rating: 5
Text: Very helpful and kind staff. Miranda at the front desk helped me with all my questions and had me to my beautiful room in minutes. Definitely coming back for another stay! If you are in the area there are many places to eat near by. There is a gas station and Dunkin Donuts literally right next to the Red Roof Inn. Get your sleep, fuel up and have your breakfast before going on your trip all in one spot! Rooms are around 60 to 70 bucks on average with taxes. My stay was absolutely great. Well worth the price. You don't find hospitality like this anymore. I highly recommend.

Text: A great place to stay for the price. Staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Rooms were clean with very comfortable beds. As someone else stated, there were some cigarette burn holes in the bedspreads. Even though the motel is conveniently located right off the interstate, it was very quiet. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Clean and nice. Shower is great. Ceiling is peeling a little and the covers had a burn whole or two in them. It was a budget hotel for us so we're not complaining.

Text: Really reasonable rates, I think we paid $66 per night. Rooms were clean and updated, the AC worked great and the beds were very comfortable. It perfectly located halfway between Detroit and Ann Arbor. I will stay again.

Text: Front staff were friendly and helpful. Like most Red Roof Inns, the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though the rooms are all "non smoking". Rooms here are remodeled and in OK condition. Clientele leave a lot to be desired and love to talk on their cell phones outside your room at any and all hours.
