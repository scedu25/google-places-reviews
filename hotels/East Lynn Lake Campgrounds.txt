Text: Camp ground was ok . The bathrooms are old and dirty .I was afraid to take a shower .  The people in the area wasn't very friendly. Maybe because we were from out of state .  Not sure . Went fishing and it was good .  Came back to camp and someone had cut my brand new water line going to the camper.   I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.
