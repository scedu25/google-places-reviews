Terre Du Lac, Inc
Rating: 5
Text: My family has owned property here for my entire life, and I'm 32 years old.  MANY great memories were made on the lakes and golf course here!  I'd HIGHLY recommend Terre Du Lac to anyone looking for a safe, clean community with LOTS to do.  There are other lakes nearby, but none that offer everything from golfing, hiking, boating, fishing, etc.
