Text: The new management placed a year ago is horrible. The park has a lot of good people in it but the management insists on tormenting them. Like placing cameras to monitor the activities of individual homes with no substantial reasons other than general dislike of family members. The management is rude, disrespectful and intentionally oppressive.
