Text: We were there only for a day to see the eclipse. However, they were very nice- only charged $10 per car for access to a great vantage point. Didn't eat at the restaurant but I wish we had- What I saw people eating looked delicious! The whole place appeared very clean and well run. I would like to go back and camp there sometime.
