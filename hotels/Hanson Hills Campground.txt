Text: This place is always awesome! My dad and I fish at Little Dixie Lake and this campground is a convienent place to pitch a tent. The owners are so welcoming and are willing to help out with anything you need! The pool is always clean and the bathrooms are decent for being camp bathrooms, no complaints! Love it here!

Text: I only give a 4 star due to the lack of grassy area for tent camping. However as far as atmosphere, activities and friendliness,  this camp ground goes beyond any I have ever stayed. If you want to swim, theres a pool, fish, two very well stocked ponds, (I know becuase I listened to them jumping all night and day.) Forgot you pole, not a problem they have them. No fishing licence,  no issue, it's private property.  Other than dirt the campground is kept very clean and free of dangers. The lodge comes with WiFi, Arcade games and pool tables. The owner, well what can you say, fun, energetic, helpful and just great people eager to make your stay the best possible.  I can not wait for the next chance I get to go back. This time I am bringing the family. Was am unforgettable stay.

Text: Owners seem very eager to make sure you are happy.  Price is reasonable.  Tad dusty and our neighbor had a German Shepherd that was outside and barked quite a bit.  Other review cited the gravel road leading in as too rough.  I didn't think it was that bad.

Text: Not recommended. Its fun, but when you really know the people, like live across the street from these people, you'll realize what's really up :)

Text: Great place to just get away from it all. Lots of stuff to do there at the camp ground and surrounding area.
