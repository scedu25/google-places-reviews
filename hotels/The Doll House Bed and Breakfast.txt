The Doll House Bed and Breakfast

Text: Where to even start! Ken and Melissa are amazing at what they do here at the Dollhouse Bed and Breakfast! Right when you pull up the fall decor gave us a homey feel. We were greeted with such excitement and were welcomed in immediately! They gave us a tour of the place which is so classic in every detail. My boyfriend and I came for his birthday and stayed in the loft. Missy baked fresh bread and cookies to welcome us for the occasion and set up champagne and glasses. They had everything we needed to feel right at home. They knew everything going on in the local area and gave us suggestions on where to eat, drink, etc. Their information made for a relaxing and fun weekend. Don't even get me started on the delicious breakfast prepared every morning at the connivence of your own time and when you wake up. They made sure you were full and focused for your day of activities. The French toast is amazing with sides and options such as eggs potatoes fruit bacon sausage you name it!! They always kept a stocked fridge full of waters which was very important after drinking at the wineries all day. We always ended our nights around the fire pit relaxing and drinking and getting to know the owners and other residents. It was so great meeting new people and heading off to the privacy of your own room. This couldn't have been anymore perfect of a weekend and we owe it all the kindness and hospitality of the amazing owners Melissa and Ken. We definitely recommend everyone to come and stay, and as hard as it was to leave we know we'll definitely be back soon!!!!

Text: Awesome owners and loved the ambience.  The outdoor patio is a great place to take in a nice glass of wine or enjoy an evening around the outdoor fireplace!

Text: This was a great Bed & Breakfast experience - the host Amanda has been doing this for 13 years and still works as hard as if it were day one. We arrived and were offered home-baked cookies and an ice-cold glass of lemonade. The room was great and the breakfast was VERY filling and yummy! She's a great person and was fun to talk with, giving us great tips on what to do at Hermann!
