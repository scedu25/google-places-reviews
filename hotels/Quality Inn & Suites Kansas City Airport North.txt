Text: Stayed overnights a catch an early am flight. The parking is adequate and we could park our car there while we were gone several days. They had van service to and from the airport. This made it very useful.  The hotel itself was dated but clean. The room was fine but was dated. The experience was good.

Text: Very nicely decorated lobby, dining area.  Hallways look a little dated.  Room was spacious and clean. Bed was very comfortable.  The walls were thin and could hear other people nearby. Breakfast was good.. waffles, eggs, sausage etc.

Text: Our nicest stay this trip! Great front desk experience. The whole hotel is surprisingly beautiful. The honoring our nation's heroes in the halls was a nice touch. The breakfast was like you'd expect of a higher priced hotel! One of us had a cough and even the Kleenex was nice unlike competitors.

Text: For the quality of room, price was high. The outside lock doesn't work so anyone could walk in. Walked into the room, it was a king suite, and on the smaller end. There was a terrible overpowering musty smell. We were guessing water damage/leaking until we opened a drawer... old rotten food!! It was late though driving 17 hours with kids we just wanted to sleep! We did notify the front desk gal right away but it didn't seem like a big deal to her. GROSS. No type of apology was offered. Also, half the bathroom towels had hair in them! Yuk. Won't be back to any Quality for a long time if at all.
