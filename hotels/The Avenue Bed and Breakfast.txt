The Avenue Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: When our son graduated from college, we wanted to do something special.  We had stayed at The Avenue several times while our son was a student and always felt that it was a great place to stay.  Paul and Catherine, our hosts, helped us create a memorable weekend.  First, for graduation weekend, the home is set aside for one family who reserves all 3 rooms.  Dinner on Saturday evening is included in the reservation.  We got to choose the theme and we could have up to 10 people for dinner.  Our son wanted to have a French dinner and he wanted to try escargot and frog legs.  Catherine is a classically trained chef and gave us a fabulous 7 course dinner, including the requested escargot and frog legs.  She also constructed a meal around various food allergies.  Paul had several different wines available which paired up nicely with the different courses.  In typical French style, the meal was paced to be the evening's entertainment. After dinner, some of us moved to the living room for a post-dinner drink and more talk.  It was an evening for laughter and celebration.  Essentially, we had a private dinner party, without the crowds and challenges of a local restaurant.  If I had another graduation or special occasion, with people traveling in from different locations, I would highly recommend The Avenue.
