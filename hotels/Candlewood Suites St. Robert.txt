Text: I stayed at this hotel for over 5 months, and my experience was remarkable! The manager, Marsha is a wonderful person and will go to any length to ensure everyone is happy. The hotel staff is friendly, professional, and an overall pleasure to talk to. Everyone takes pride through the attention to detail in every facet. I have been in the military for quite some time, done extensive travel and this is by far the best hotel experience I've ever had. Thank you Marsha and staff for everything! Mike White May-Oct 2016.

Text: This property is really great especially if you happen to be visiting the Fort Leonard Wood area. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the local area. The prices are fair, and the rooms are large. They have cooking facilities in the rooms, they have a workout area and also a place you can do laundry. If you are staying in the area for an extended amount of time I highly recommend this property.

Text: Great hotel.  Great for long term stays for TDY or contractors staying in the area.  Rooms have a stove top, sink, dishwasher, and full fridge/freezer.  The Lending Locker allows those staying to borrow (as they put it) "a blender or a board game."  I was impressed with the fact they have everything from a juicer to a blender to a toaster oven to a crock-pot to a fondue pot. They even had DVD players and fans for checkout.  The free laundry room was also a definite plus.
