Text: Not too bad for an economy place. The worst was the shower water pressure was very weak. Likely the worst or second worst I have experienced. It was on the second floor so 1st might be better.

Text: Phones does not work in room. Room was stated non-smoking but smelled of smoke when we arrived. Breakfast bar was pretty good. Good choices for breakfast.

Text: The place needs repairing .our sink was loose the shower pressure was bad. Other than that this place was great the staff was very friendly. The rooms were clean the beds were comfy. The room was quiet. I slept really well . I was amazed because I usually don't stay in hotels like this but this place has changed my view point.

Text: Easy check-in, with a tiny hiccup, and nice staff. Decent room for a night stop. Respectable breakfast with some of the best biscuits and gravy my wife has ever had...and she's had a lot. Would stay again.
