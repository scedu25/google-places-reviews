Text: Four stars only because no coffee maker in the room or else would give 5 stars.  Cheap and clean rooms.

Text: This place has a lot of character.  The room was spotless. Great rate. The owner is the sweetest lady! She held her last open room for us. Very nice to arrive to after a long day of driving. Great bar "1 eleven" right across the street. Ogallala was a wonderful pit stop for us.
