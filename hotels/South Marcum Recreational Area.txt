Text: 2 stars because of the shore line swimming/views and ok fall fishing. It's stocked often but too shallow for summer fishing. Beaches are crowd with litter and Hoosiers. Lake is dangerous. Very shallow resulting in horrible waves with minimal wind. When busy with boat traffic it's essentially a man-made wave pool. Another ACE disaster, obviously ran by the fed gov. Over priced with zero perks.
