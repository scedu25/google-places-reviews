Text: Wonderful little cabins perfect for a romantic getaway. Dogwood cabin is the most secluded but they're all lovely! About 15 minutes from the hocking hills parks and 25 from Logan. Would stay here again!

Text: Set behind the owners house up on a hill overlooking their pond. Very nice inside fully furnished just needed to bring a couple of your own things. Close to the many different hiking trails and still only 15 miles from Logan

Text: Beechwood Cabin is a beautiful, peaceful and fairly private romantic getaway.  Hot tub was perfect and the enclosed, screened-in porch was a great place to hang out.  The fireplace is a nice place to warm up (if needed) and the loft bedroom was a nice addition.  The bed was a little too firm for our tastes, but we weren't there to sleep.  The TV is small and in a strange place, but again, we weren't there to watch TV.  Overall atmosphere is rustic, quiet and serene.  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get away from the world for a few days.  Make sure you say hi to the gray and white kitty, who welcomed us all weekend.
