Text: I travel for work, and spend about 6 months of the year in hotels. With that said, I was disappointed with my experience here.  My room was clean, for the most part, but had definitely not been vacuumed.  I found change, bobby pins, and other debris on the floor.  The breakfast area was very poorly maintained.  The juice dispenser was out, the pancake dispenser was out, and several food containers sat empty for the duration of my time eating.  Tables were not wiped down and there were no napkins stocked.  The only real options were pre-made foods like oatmeal or cinnamon rolls.  I was here for four days, and ran into this every day, so I don't believe it's an isolated thing. I won't be staying at this hotel again.

Text: Great place to stay for the price. The rooms are large and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. I had what I thought was a short wait to check in but the woman at the front desk apologized and gave me extra points. Recommend.

Text: The stay was ok but they rushed us out the door. Checkout is 11am. Housekeeping kept banging on the door to see if we were gone yet starting earlier than I liked 4 times. We were gone by 1030. Customer service after the fact stepped up and admitted they were in the wrong however and made amends.
