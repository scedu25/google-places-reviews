Holiday Inn Express & Suites Kansas City-Grandview
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed with my wife and daughter overnight for a mini vacation. We picked this place because the ratings were good and the pool was also well reviewed. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean as well, and we had no problems with check in. Our daughter insisted on using the hideaway bed under the couch and it was just fine. The room had a mini fridge, a Keurig coffeemaker, and a microwave. The pool (the primary reason we went) was a salt water pool with somewhat heated water. It wasn't hot tub warm (though there was a hot tub there) but it was warm enough to be tolerable in early November. Breakfast was about what you would expect, with some healthier options thrown in like egg white omelettes and turkey sausage. It all tasted fine, and the cinnamon rolls were awesome.

Text: Easy check in, nice pool and hot tub. Spacious room. Complimentary coffee and keurig in the room for use there. Hot complimentary breakfast included, oatmeal, pancakes, eggs, Turkey sausage, egg white and veggies omelet, biscuits and gravy. Pool card reader had to be reset so it was closed for an hour but otherwise a great trip.

Text: We always stay at Holiday Inn Express in Kansas City when we are on our way to Branson. it never disappoints and the cinnamon rolls are awesome. They will even pack them up and let you take them with you and this morning I'm enjoying a wonderful cup of coffee with pumpkin spice creamer in it. Does it get any better than that and we had an awesome night sleep in a super comfortable bed.

Text: The location was very convenient for us as we were traveling and it was just off the highway. We were hauling a large pop up camper and had no trouble parking in their lot. Check in was quick. Room was very clean. Full express breakfast in the morning with options for everyone. Not the best food ever but still good.

Text: New facility, good breakfast, and comfortable rooms.  A little bit of back tracking off the hwy and currently some road construction near by.  Otherwise, the staff is helpful and the stay was pleasant.
