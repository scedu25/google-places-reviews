Motel 6 Cleveland - Middleburg Heights
Rating: 4
Text: I love the fact that Motel 6 is pet friendly.  This along with the cleanliness of the rooms and affordable prices is why I always stay at Motel 6 when possible.  However, the Motel 6 I stayed at in Middleburg Heights could of had a better toilet seat.  The one we had had gouges taken out of it.  It seemed that Motel 6 had updated the entire room except for that part.

Text: I hesitate to rate this 5 stars because clearly a Motel 6 is not a 5-star hotel, BUT for what it was, it was definitely a decent night's stay. The woman at the front desk (late night), whose name I unfortunately forget, was SUCH a sweetheart and really wanted me to feel safe as a woman traveling alone. The room was as clean and comfortable as was expected.

Text: I had no room key for the entire stay (3 nights) with no offer of compensation. Extremely inconvenient to say the least. Kept promising me the key problem would be corrected. Always had to flush toilet twice to remove all solids. Very low lighting (inadequate). Occasional loud pipe noises. Low water pressure. No ice machine. I can understand "Green" with no change of towels/sheets each day but garbage should have been removed and floors swept. Lower price does make up for all of the above.

Text: Best motel I ever stayed at. Incredible. More like a hotel than a motel. My wife would have loved this place. Great experience. She left me. Fridge and A/C in the room as well as towels. 5 stars for cleanliness and service, and complimentary coffee in the morning
