Red Roof Inn #375
Rating: 3
Text: Fair price. Decent mattress. Comforter was blood stained. Bottom sheet was not a fitted sheet, simply another top sheet. Owner was friendly. We weren't upset enough to complain. And there was cold Yeungling in the fridge, so that was nice.

Text: This is a Red Roof Inn now.  "Non smoking" room smelled badly of smoke.  Not at all as advertised.   Claims "now open" and "new rooms."  Makes it sound like this is a new place.  It is not. It's old, dirty and run down.  Catalog also says hair dryers are available.  They have none in any rooms or any to borrow.

Text: Room was dirty upon check in.  Mattress and sheets had blood stains on it, told house keeping and was given clean sheets to cover it up.  Air conditioner did not work.  Free Wi-Fi didn't reach our room.  The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it is conveniently located.
