Hyatt Place Chicago/Lombard/Oak Brook
Rating: 4
Text: The Hyatt was great! I really liked the room layout. I slept on a pullout bed which was not as bad as a regular pullout. I did not really enjoy the breakfast all that much this morning. It was decent but nothing special. Besides that it is a very nice hotel, good experience. 4/5 stars

Text: Great breakfast and coffee included. Full yogurt fruit and granola bar. Eggs, bacon and add ins plus great cinnamon toast. Lots of other bread, bagel and cereal options. Coffee is Seattle's Best and quite good. Clean rooms. Very friendly staff. Starbucks coffee and treats sold in the lobby. Gym is open 24 hours. Pool is open until 10pm. Close to the airport and plenty of shopping.

Text: Good amenities for the price.  Breakfast was great with a lot of options.  The room was spacious.  The pool is large and deep enough for adults but shallow enough for my 4 year old.  My only complaints are the lack of towels by the pool which lead to wet footprints and slick floors in the lobby and the pool water is a bit chilly for an indoor pool.  Overall we enjoyed it, we'd recommend it to others, and we'd  stay here again

Text: This hotel is nice. Good breakfast every day.  The rooms are adequate although we had to ask for a room with a bathtub. More bathrooms needed on the main floor.  It would be nice if there was a hot tub in the pool area. Also the exercise room could be bigger.

Text: Unfortunately my bank debit card was charged, when I was told that it would be just a hold! Then I got stuck in the elevator for 9 minutes...but Was reimbursed for 2 nights. And the REAL breakfast was great! As well as the beds were comfortable to sleep in.
