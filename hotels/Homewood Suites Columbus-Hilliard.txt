Homewood Suites Columbus-Hilliard
Rating: 5
Text: Have stayed here a few times. Staff are extremely friendly. They went out of their way to get me an early check-in. Hotel is clean; pool is decent; breakfast a bit above some in this class. The location is also convenient to highway and Hilliard area.

Text: Behind this wonderful Escape is a delightful pond where you can ponder your worries away and relax. It's only about 70 Paces from the backside of this wonderful Hotel. Hope you get to see it along with the comical dragonflies popping in and out from behind the brush that lines the edge of the pond.
