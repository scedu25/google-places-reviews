Glenview Motel

Text: A hotel need only be clean and feel secure.
This was not the case.
There was black mold growing up the wall in the bathroom. The room smelled terribly of mold and mildew. Something black (more mold perhaps) came out of the faucet in the sink.
The shower floor was so mildew-y, neither of us took a shower.
You will save a few bucks staying here, but it's not worth the price. I'd rather have slept in my car, it would have felt safer than this place did.

Text: The first room we were given was full of mold and was extremely strong smelling of the mold. It also had no towels. The people running the place could barely speak English and could not be understood. We also found out from locals that the place is one of the worst motels in Dubuque and quite often rents the rooms by the hour, if you get my meaning. The second room was better but still left a great deal to be desired. The doors appeared to be falling apart. Areas of the walls and ceiling were stained brown from water damage. The shower floor was not very clean. The shower curtain had brown slime on it. The window was already open and was rotting away. The he mattresses were both stained and stunk. And the blankets and comforters were full of holes. All in all, we will NEVER return to this place and would NEVER recommend it to anyone!

Text: Mold, boiling hot or stone cold water nothing in between. Digital broadcast T.V. no cable. Stairway with a broken hand. A cheap price is one thing. Not staying there ever again.

Text: I don't know if I can even give it 1 star. This was the only hotel in a 2 hour distance that had a room and it was late. Don't stay here! Holes in walls,  holes in blankets, missing wall tile, smelled bad, toilet barely worked, but it was cheap. Was not worth the $59 though.
