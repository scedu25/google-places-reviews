Lincolnshire Marriott Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Room was on the small side but my wife and two kids fit comfortably in our room. The lobby bar and restaurant were terrific. Service was great. Pool was nice and had a lot of good event space. Will definitely be back.

Text: Coming from Chicago, this is probably the least convenient place to go see some theatre. I'm not even sure why they would build a resort like this in Lincolnshire, but what do I know? The theatre itself is quite nice, a good size, and they put on decent productions. However, if you're there for a show and need to use the restroom, you'll have to walk quite a ways into the resort, beyond some conference rooms, in order to get there! I only experienced the theatre, so that's all I'm able to review.

Text: The restaurant we originally were trying to eat at turned out to be closed, we went to a different restaurant which was set up in a banquet hall. Atmosphere was somewhat lacking, food was okay. Beer selection was good. Just kind of an "okay" experience

Text: Marriott Lincolnshire is a great place for a corporate event. Plenty of space for just about any kind of meeting, picnic, reception. I have never stayed overnight, so I can't speak to that, but their private event space is excellent.
