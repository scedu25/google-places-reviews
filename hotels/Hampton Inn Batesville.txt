Text: Nice place to stay, w/ friendly staff and well kept rooms. Breakfast is okay.
Only problem I had was the same as all hotels, you can hear the flushing of toilets and showers from rooms near yours.
Don't park under the tree in the front lot...bird poo. Lol

Area 4 depending on who you are
Good clean hotel with great people. Better than average accomadations since it has a pool and decent breakfast. Rooms are of good size for 1-2 people in the one I'm in. I would recommend.
