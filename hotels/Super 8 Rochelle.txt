Super 8 Rochelle
Rating: 5
Text: Super 8 at Rochelle is my "home away from home" and I am so appreciative of the service that the staff provides. The front desk people, Liz, Cheryl, Mike, Diane and James always make sure that my room is ready and comfortable.  I need to rest during the day hours and they do their best to make sure that I am given a quiet room in which to rest in.  The cleaning staff always supplies me with a clean room,.and it is always properly supplied. Many thanks to the staff at the Rochelle Super 8. Keep up the good work!!!

Text: Pretty decent, clean room. Friendly staff. Only reason why I give it a 4 ?? is because i asked for a king size bed and got a queen instead. Oh well it was still comfy..

Text: I was surprised to see the parking spot closest to the door reserved for veterans.  A beautiful gesture that costs nothing but sensitivity.  Very warm opinions over that.

Text: This hotel has just what I want. A clean quiet place to stay that is not very fancy and is a good value. We stayed on a Saturday night and had no problems with rowdiness or noisy guests. The rooms were very clean although furnishings were a little worn. Perfect for me!
