Text: When you walk in to the hotel lobby it looks like a decent hotel. That's where the good looks ended. The rooms where horribly outdated and gross. My first room smelled musty. My second room smelled fine but needed a deep clean and repairs. The staff was friendly and apologetic but I'll be staying elsewhere next time I'm in Ames.

Text: Carpet was filthy as well as couch. Front desk person ran to my room with a vacuum and discounted my room. Why doesn't housekeeping report this stuff. Second? time in 3 weeks,  different hotels. Carpet and couch need cleaned not vacuumed. Restaurant was good and not overpriced at all, salmon was good. Other than carpet this hotel is fine, thank you Jarret for trying and do g everything you could.

Text: Clean.  A few bad seams in the wall paper and some minor water damage.  Some gross spots between the tiles.  

They are not pet friendly...they are only pet tolerant.  Your furry friend is not allowed to use the main entrance or be in the lobby.  The only elevator is in the lobby 

The exec suite is roomy.

Text: Stayed overnight for a business trip. The bed was comfortable but that's the only good thing I can say about my stay. The place is in desperate need of updates. Wallpaper is starting to peel. There was no hot water in my room's sink. It's June and the heat was still on in the exercise room so it was around 90 in the room. Asked the girl at the front desk if she could turn on the ac but she had no idea how to do it. Besides the heat the equipment was old and worn out. Not a place I would recommend.
