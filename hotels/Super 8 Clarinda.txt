Text: The Super 8 welcomed our large family group in town for a funeral.  They accommodated our need to gather in the common area and were empathetic as we enjoyed being together.  We appreciated the fresh cookies and friendly staff ,who helped us with directions and information. Rooms were pleasant and roomy. Hotel was tidy and had really clean windows.

Text: The General Manager is charging me for a night I didn't want - someone entered the wrong date for my two night reservation, so I was listed as a 'no show' for the first night according to their records!  I was NOT sent an email confirmation, so I didn't know there was an error until I checked in the next night!  But I thought it would be an easy fix prior to check out.  When the gal at the front desk said I was still going to be charged for the 'extra' night, I asked to speak to the General Manager - I was told she was not available!  And to this date I have not heard from her!  Very frustrating to say the least!
