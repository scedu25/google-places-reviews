Days Inn Grove City Columbus South
Rating: 5
Text: This place was much better than some reviews. I think there's an old wing, and a new wing....the new wing we stayed in: clean, open, great space and comfy and again very clean and I was impressed (with low expectations coming in). It was perfect for a night, no issues at all. (Except the owner/manager at the desk seemed like a total dick, but we had limited interaction with him)
But: Waffle house basically in the parking lot so woot woot!!!

Text: *READ READ READ* TRUTH ABOUT DAYS INN
In my personal opinion id rate this place as a big ol zero. I stayed 2 nights in a row, except i paid for one night at a time. So i accidentally over slept and instead of calling the room phone a lady and a man came in my room yelling at me and told me i had to get out, i was getting my stuff togethere and getting ready to walk out the door and the lady at the front fesk called the room phone and was very rude and then threatened to call the cops on me. So i got out and sat outside and waited for my boyfriend to cone pay for another room and i was put back into the same room i was in the night before and i noticed that they didnt even change ANY of the blankets (sam cigarette burn holes as before.) As well as that my boyfriend found 2 cockroaches one in the bathroom and one on the floor by the bed. Also the rooms dont even look lime the pictures. Days Inn is definitely one of the worst hotels in grove city. Very rude employees (front desk lady) and they dont even change the beding.

Text: Old white man that works here is an idiot. After running out of my service hours to drive I was forced to get off of this exit. Upon getting off the exit, across the street was a Waffle House with trucks parked behind it so I went there, went inside and asked the Waffle House staff if it was ok to park out back or if we would get towed, and she said it was ok. Wow was she wrong! At around 3 am I woke up to a white man swinging from my mirrors and rocking my truck!!!!! What kind of a fool does that? I only had one more hour before I could start up again, but he called the police and made me drive illegally. The police are just as bad because they told me I had to drive away or go to jail for criminal trespass. How am I a criminal for sleeping? Crazy!

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE!!    So dirty and smelly! My feet never touched the floor.  Wore flip flops in the shower. We were in a "non smoking room"    smelled like I was  sleeping in an ash tray!   If I could give negative stars I would.  Never again!
