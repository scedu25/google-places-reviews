Inn On Crescent Lake

Text: We went here in the spring.  We're currently contemplating a late fall trip back.  This place is great.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I remember feeling like our "welcome" and being shown where things are was very, very rushed.  I do understand that the innkeepers are probably busy and have a lot of things to do, but I think it's ALWAYS worth it to take an extra 5 minutes to be sure guests feel fully welcomed and appreciated.  Other than that, everything about this place was fantastic.  I just saw slight room for improvement in the first impression.

Text: The hosts are wonderful! I suggest checking in during regular hours. We were late and missed the tour. Also, they offer many additional treats and massage. Do it! We didn't and regret it.

Text: Keys to a Mansion? A moat with paddle boats? A couples message? Great food within 5 minutes? Yup I'd go back! We went midweek and felt almost like we had the place to ourselves.  Oh yeah it was clean with a friendly caring staff too!

Text: Nice place, caring staff. But maybe a bed and breakfast just wasn't what my wife and I, both 23, were expecting. A bit too close quarters with other strangers. Clean rooms, beautiful area.
