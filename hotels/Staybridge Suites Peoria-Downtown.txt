Staybridge Suites Peoria-Downtown

Text: This hotel was very nice and clean. I was only there one night and checked in very late. The woman at the front desk couldn't have been any nicer! She was amazing. I wish I knew her name. They do not have ice machines on the floors, but she went to the restaurant and grabbed some for us. She went above and beyond the steps if service for us. She was working the 3rd shift in Sat 9/23/17(for management reference)

This hotel is NOT in a good neighborhood and I would not walk anywhere from there. It is a convenient location to downtown, but I would probably not stay again because of the surrounding area. I am giving 5 stars because of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel. They can't help the location!

Text: Very modern and furnished well. The queen sized bed is not like any I've ever owned, very stable, solid and comfy, yet it seemed small, compared to others. 

Lots of amenities here that we didn't have time to take advantage of, outdoor patio, pool, firepit, basketball court, and they advertise a library, but I didn't see it.

The shower room didn't have a garbage can, then we discovered it was under the sink, just outside the shower room. 

The breakfast was absolutely amazing! Good selections of many different offerings. Cold, hot, fruit, cereal, breads, baked goods, and more! 

The staff was friendly and helpful and they accommodated us when we asked for a late checkout.

Shower was very hot and powerful water pressure, towels were a little rough to the touch.
