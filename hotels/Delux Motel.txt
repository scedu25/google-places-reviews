Delux Motel

Text: I liked staying here. The kids are free. But there really isn't any children shows after PBS is done and on to their news. The shower looks like it was recently redone. But there is soap scum and mildew. Other wise it was very clean!

Text: After reading some of these I would like to clarify a few things 

1. There's wifi and I've NEVER seen any kind of bugs let alone roaches. Everyone knows that Super 8 is the Bug Motel

2. There's NEVER hot breakfast, nowhere does it say there is. No employees have ever told us there was. That's just dumb. It's a motel, most don't even have muffins and pastries

3. ALL hotels charge rooms BY THE PERSON so yes if you bring your wife, it's an extra charge

4. Management recently changed and there is new maintenance 

5. This place is clean and quiet regardless but ESPECIALLY for the price tag. It isn't the Hilton but it's a good place to sleep, shower and spend your down time

Text: It is the last time we will ever stay here I would rather pay the extra money for two room then ever stay here again as we was the only people staying here and it wasn't worth for them to supply a hot breakfast as they told us so all we got was store bought muffins NEVER EVER AGAIN ! I am being nice at rating it a one if there was a negative 5 I would have given it that and the heat doesn't work either as it was down to 45 and we had no heat!

Text: Extremely friendly staff, free breakfast from 6 to 11, definitely would return.
