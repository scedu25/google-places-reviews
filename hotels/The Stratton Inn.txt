The Stratton Inn
Rating: 2
Text: dilapidated and Extremely overpriced. Came to Princeton to visit my parents and the only room we could find was worth too much and the room wasn't that great. Half the lights worked, floor was dirty and only one working tv channel. After one night, we decided to stay at America's Best Value Inn down the road and the cost and room was very reasonable and worth the stay.

Text: It was quiet and the owners were very nice and helpful. They provided complimentary soap, the towels were clean, the AC worked well, and they had cable & internet. However, the sheets had many stains and holes (looked like semen splatters and cigarette burns), the wallpaper was peeling, and there was mold in some places. Because of the sheets, I wouldn't want to stay there again. If stained sheets dont bother you, then it's an ok place to stay.

Text: We stayed here for the 2017 eclipse. The room was subpar and extremely overpriced. The bathroom smelled of urine, the shower rod was broken, wallpaper was peeling, waterspots on the wall & ceiling, there was no telephone in the room, barely any toiletries, no toliet paper. On top of that customer service was lackadaisical. Please never consider staying here.

Text: Rooms are clean but we were put clear in the back corner by ourselves. Felt secluded

Text: Nothing special. There were no bugs inside the room, and there was a mini fridge. So that was cool.
