The Dwelling Place

Text: The Terpstras are charming and accommodating hosts. They pay great attention to detail all the way from the ultra comfortable beds down to the elegant soaps. We had a very restful night in a beautifully decorated and quiet room. The Dwelling Place has a great location, just a short walk to the Pella town square. All of this for a very reasonable price. We definitely recommend a stay here and would absolutely come back for another visit.
