Text: We are just completely Amazed and stunned by our Experience with this Relaxing Gettaway!  Joseph and Tina are the owners, and they are such Sweet and Accomodating Hosts!  The Atmosphere is just Absolutely Gorgeous... With A comfortable and cozy arrangement.  The Breakfast was very Delicious!!!!! My favorite was Tina's Homemade Cinnamon Rolls.  It is also pet and kid friendly too!  We enjoyed our stay so much, that we decided to stay another night!

Text: It was really pretty and well kept. A lot of rooms to choose from. And we were asked about dietary needs / accommodations when booking! They both were very nice.

The only thing keeping it a 4 star was the admin side. We booked for a three bed bedroom, 1 for us and 2 for the 3 kids to share. When we got there the room had been given away! We were moved into another option with 2 beds and a couch for pine puff us to sleep on. Or one with a huge bed for all of us. Umm, no. The option was given to use both bedrooms. Not what we preferred or booked originally, but ok. And then only pay an extra $50 a night, for the use of 2 bedrooms. What?!?? Umm, no.  After discussing it 3 times she finally agreed. I'm not sure of the circumstances; an oversight and double booked, or forgot and gave it away, or just figured we'd agreed to it. I understand things happen, but the trying to upcharge us for her mistake was what got to me. We were being moved and split up to allow the others to keep "our" room. It ended well enough though.
