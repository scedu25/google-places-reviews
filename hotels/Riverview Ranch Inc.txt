Text: Our Favorite!  We booked floats at Riverview Ranch for 8 years straight , until most of our friends finally moved away and it was tough to plan again!  This place is awesome, people are super cool.  The office AND security guys are very understanding with large groups (20+).  A++

Text: As a MO transplant, I've come to love float trips and it's become my favorite thing to do in the summer here. Riverview ranch provides bus service up to the put-in spot so you can take your time coming down and finish at your cars. No need to wait for a bus and try and time it. The rafts and tubes are great and can fit plenty of coolers, snacks, and people. It's totally reasonably price too. We've come here at least one or twice a summer for the last 5 years.
