Text: Nice a place as any to break up a long drive. Lots of grass and trees instead of concrete and rocks. 50 amp, water, showers, laundry, nice office lady that lives on site. Feels safe. There are a few mobile homes on the property with residents, but otherwise, most of the property is set up for RVs and 5th wheels. I would stay here again.
