Super 8 - Harrison OH
Rating: 2
Text: Lots of things that do not work.  Slow shower drain,  cracked toilet seat. Clock radio didn't work.  Guide for TV channels not correct.  No water in exercise room. Av in exercise room does not work.  No drinks for breakfast but coffee.  Not even water. I'm no interior decorator,  but the shade of green for the walls is ugly. 

It was cheap compared to nearby hotels and the beds are comfortable,  but I can't recommend this place.

Text: It is what you'd expect for a Super 8.  The hotel itself is dated and shows a lot of wear.  The room itself was clean and well kept.  That tells me the staff is doing a good job.  The only concern we had is there was nothing stopping people from coming in any of the back doors - there was no key-card reader on any of the doors.

Text: This was an unexpected pleasure. We were traveling home from a family visit and just needed a good night slerp. The price was right, the room very large and clean and the bed was really comfy. To top it all, a hot breakfast was right there before we got back on the road. Not sure if we'll be back that way again soon but if we are, they can count on a return visit.

Text: I stayed in a room on the first floor. The room smelled a little musty. The beds were comfortable but I was not a fan of the pillows. It had a mini fridge and microwave. Tv was nice but no good selection of channels.

Text: Adequate for an overnight stay. Comfy clean room. Friendly staff. Small kidney Shaker pool. Internet. Very nice furniture, surprising. Near freeway. "Breakfast" not much to speak of but eating establishments nearby.
