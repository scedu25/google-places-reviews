Trails of Terror Haunted Woods

Text: If I could give this place more then 5 I would. My kids had a blast props were great and they even got me a few times. It was fun seeing my kids get the scare of their life. After a mishap with my oldest son and having to close the place down (which was embarrassing as well as scary) they found my son and all helped look for him. I couldn't thank them enough and how kind they are. They even offered for us to come back for free the next day. I am a little undecided if I want to come but love the offer. It was a great experience and we will be back next year. Minus my oldest son who can't seem to handle it.

Text: This trail was awesome, it scared all the girls in my group and me a couple times.  I would recommend going for sure.  We will probably make it a tradition here on out.
