Text: The facility is great! Clean and modern. The staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that the hot tub did not work. Upon alerting the staff to the issue, they had a technician working on it within the hour. It was back up the next day. I would stay here again. Included breakfast was full of variety and the food was fresh.

Text: The staff was very friendly. I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste and they gave me some for free. They made me feel very welcome. Room was nice, loved the pool, and the free breakfast buffet wasn't stale donuts but meat and eggs and a great meal. I will return.

Text: Manager very unprofessional. Be prepared if you choose to stay at this hotel. Should have been 4 stars but the manager decided that this facility was only ZERO STARS (Not an option to pick ZERO. Wish I could have ). My work ended earlier than expected and had to cancel at 4:30pm but was charged full price. This was a Friday and a major car show was in town so the room could have been easily purchased. I am a gold account member but not treated as such. On the next trip I will be staying at the Hampton Inn near this Holiday Inn. I did not dispute the charge at the time with the manager. Here is my response.
On a better note the holiday inn in Dublin took great care on me during my stay. I hope the low rating was worth treating a customer badly.

Text: If you are looking for a wonderful hotel, polite staff willing to accommodate to whatever needs you have, this is the hotel you need to book! My girlfriend and I booked the king size bed leisure room, and they upgraded us to the king size bed with jacuzzi room for no extra cost! Clean, and friendly! BOOK HERE!
