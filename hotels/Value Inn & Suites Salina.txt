Text: Not impressed.  They were rude to my granddaughter when she requested extra towels, poor channel selection, non working remote, uncomfortable bed. You get what you pay for. Next time, I will spend a little more for better accommodations.

Text: Polite service. At times no one answered the phone. Bed slept in was a very used bed that had a dip from long wear.

Text: If I could give this hotel negative zero stars I would! The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful when we had questions. When my boyfriend called down to ask for more pillows the lady at the front desk replied with "You don't own this room so I don't want to talk to you." The place is disgusting. The first night we were here we found a syringe under the shelf the TV was sitting on. There's a huge hole burned in the carpet in our room. We had to kill coach roaches we found in the bathroom. Save your money and go somewhere else!

Plus tge sign out side said weekly room is 173.00 not 230.00  but it my time of need i was ok with it. Really did not have choice at the time... But f y i. Koa kampground rents out cabins and they are amazing. With a club house. Fishing pond. And an amazing enviroment.... Lol
