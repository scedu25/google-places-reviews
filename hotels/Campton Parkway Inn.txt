Text: Nice, clean, quiet, not far from all attraction...was perfect for is. The staff was friendly, and helpful. They get a four starts for the following....Not a lot of amenities, like; fridge, coffee, microwave in the rooms (cost more $) swimming pool, if you are into all that, and they can improve on their breakfast..ie...fresh variety doughnuts and fruit.

Text: It's a very clean basic roadside inn with a touch of charm.  Friendly staff makes it inviting.  They need to update their Tvs.

Text: The room was clean and everything was in good shape. The staff was helpful and took some time to recommend a great route for motorcycling. Their lounge has very reasonably priced alcohol for sale as well. Overall we found it stay to be pleasant and a good value.

Text: This place looks old on the outside but it's nicer then a lot of other hotels. The staff was friendly and helpful. Free breakfast in the morning was nice. It's not much but it's a bite to eat. Would stay again if I was in the area.
