Text: Wonderful and clean RV Park. Larry brought us to our site and made us feel very comfortable. Full hook up and 50 amp service, great WiFi. Extremely reasonable rate, much less than expected for all of the services. We stayed in our 40 foot class A with toad. Big rig friendly, right off Route75.

Text: Small, very quiet, nice park. Larry, the owner, is wonderful. If we ever get back this way,  we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
