Text: Clean and comfortable stay.  Staff was friendly, responsive, and helpful. We were there for an event that had us leaving the hotel earlier than their scheduled breakfast time so they moved things up so there would be food for folks that would be leaving early.

Text: Good location, you have easy access to restaurants and stores. Rooms are clean and with good space. The only thing is that my 212 room has a very sensitive floor and you can hear crack sounds as you walk.
