Black River Camping at Horse Shoe
Rating: 3
Text: Disclaimer: I've grown up floating and camping in Missouri so I've seen many places and experienced a lot of campgrounds.  Campsites are right next to one another along a nice grassy/dirt tree line bordering a large field; of which the backside borders the river.  A handful of sites are not on the river; there aren't many sites in all.  There is no space/privacy from site to site.  There are no playgrounds or play areas beyond the river or in the grassy areas near your campsite for kids, but this is a good spot to star gaze at night.  Bathrooms near the campsites are port-a-pots; around 1/3 mile up the gravel road (to the front of the field) at the entrance there is a descent men/women bathroom and shower with hot water in a red metal shed where the check-in and very small/basic camp store are found.  The people do live on the property and are nice, helpful, try to accommodate, and seem to enjoy what they are doing, but are not your A+ organized, prompt, with-it business people.  The tubes were old black tire tubes...but OK to float on.  Large rafts are nice and canoes are standard. The river is pretty good; not a lot of scenery (cliffs/rock-sand bars, etc), but peaceful.  It is in good proximity to the Shut-Ins and Elephant Rock; both 'have-to' visit spots if you've never been.  I'd probably go to this spot again only if the other places nearby were full.

Text: BRO was fantastic! Friendly staff, well maintained campsites and clean porta-potties conveniently placed just steps from our site. The owner, Billy, personally welcomed us and the quiet location was perfect for our family. The site backs up to the river and has easy access for floating. After a snafu on the river, Billy and his staff quickly came to our rescue. They went above and beyond and we will definitely be coming back! I can't recommend Black River Camping and Outfitters enough.
