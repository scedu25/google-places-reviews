Text: Food was good but not as good as Dotties restaurant. I would rate it a three star.  It was about 15 miles south of Rolla Missouri.

Text: Clean affordable rooms, friendly staff, minimalist,  minutes from the main town off Route 66 near Uranus.  Yes Uranus and that is what made it worth the stay. Bwahaha

Text: The inside of the rooms where decent. Needs are comfy. But there are small things about the rooms that are sloppy. Bathroom door doesn't close properly. There's a gap at the bottom of the door large enough for outside critters to get in. But showers work fine. Beds are clean. Towels are clean. Air conditioning worked great. Purple monkey dishwasher

Text: The desk clerk was friendly. The room was clean. The free breakfast was good, not many choices, but the biscuits and gravy were good.
