Red Roof Inn Lexington
Rating: 1
Text: Dog owners stay elsewhere!! I found a red pill under the bed which could've been a trip to the emergency vet had I not seen it. I am hoping there was only one because I did let my dog on the floor once before checking. I have stayed at red roof inns in the past and have mixed experiences, but after this incident I will not be back. Dog friendly hotels should vacuum more than others and this clearly does not happen. Don't risk a possible expensive vet trip because of this hotel!!

Text: The front desk clerk was very nice and very helpful when my debit card messed up and I needed to find a Speedway to load money onto another card. The room was clean and smelled good. The hotel was quiet. The only negative thing I can think of was that it was very busy and there just isn't enough parking. I had to leave my rental on the opposite side of the hotel which made me nervous, but it was fine the next morning so I guess I was worried for nothing.

Text: Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Bedding was stained on one bed, cigarette burn on the other. If your not to picky an inexpensive option.

Text: Clean, lots of parking, and conveniently right off the interstate. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was bc the bathroom was TINY (hard to close the door while you're in there. But overall great place.

Text: They let your pet stay for free without restriction or unecessary fees. Red roof inn should be commended for this. Rooms are nicely remodeled. Close to Horseshoes Bar and Pub that has live music. 
Other than that, standard interstate motel.
