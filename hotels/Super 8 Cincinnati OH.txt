Text: You get what u pay for!  I requested NON smoking but my room reeked of smoke, even more when the air conditioner was on. Not sure the reason but the door frame was partially missing. Looked like the door had been kicked in. The lock wasn't secure, and there was a gap I could see through to the outdoors. There was glitter everywhere on the floor and the chairs. It was obvious that no one vacuumed. But despite all that the shower was HOT, the bed was comfortable and there was breakfast, and  Thats really all I needed.

Text: This motel is a sad exscue for a motel. Some of the rooms were clean some were dirty with roaches and bed bugs. The front desk personnel are rude, and disrespectful. No customer service skills at all. I will never stay there again.
