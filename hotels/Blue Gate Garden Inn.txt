Blue Gate Garden Inn

Text: The room was very nice. Very clean. The pool area was great. The pizza at ice cream place was good. My only complaint would be is... There were 5 of us girls. We had a room with a king and a queen bed plus a roll away. There was a wall in the middle of the room that divided the beds. Those of us on the side of the wall where the air conditioner was not could not feel the air.

Text: No problem getting a table at 4:45 PM. It got crazy busy right after that.  Wait staff super friendly. Apple butter on table for fresh bread loaf.  Very complete desert menu.  Wonderful gift shop of baked goods and hand crafted knick knacks. Home cooked style food, and plenty of it.

Text: Beautiful inn.  It's everything it claims to be.  The rooms look clean, feel clean because they are clean.  Microwave, coffee maker, blow dryer, and even a small closet.  Great amenities - pool, hot tub, social room, tennis, ice cream bar, and a large patio with a gas fire every evening.  A full breakfast every morning with an omlette chef to take your order.  A spacious lobby and plenty of room to roam.  We spent three  nights at the Blue Gate Garden Inn and will be the first choice when we return.  Highly recommend for couples or family.

Text: Would highly recommend staying here.  Great breakfast buffet, enjoyed the coffee, water and cookies pit out.  Very big and nice pool and pool area.  Cute ice cream parlor.  My favorite is the outside patio area.  Enjoyed that the most.  From sitting out in the sun to the fire pit.  Love the polyvinyl gliders.  Will stay here again.
