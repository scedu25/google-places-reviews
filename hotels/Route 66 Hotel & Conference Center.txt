Rating: 5
Text: Nice rooms excellent prices. Mother road restaurant downstairs has the best fish and chicken. Owner is very quick to fix any issues.  Accessible parking for large vehicles. Public grill. I recommend route 66 better than Motel 6

Text: VERY nice hotel. Really cool too. There's a lot of Route 66 memorabilia scattered throughout the main areas. There's some old cars as well. The restaurant inside served good food at a good price. All the wait staff was really friendly. The room was nice. Nice TV, comfy beds, bathroom was really nice. Nothing bad I can about it. Stay here if you're looking for a place to stay in Springfield, IL

Text: This was a very neat place to visit. Can't wait to take my son back there. The front of the place looks like the Wheel well Inn from Disneys Cars.
