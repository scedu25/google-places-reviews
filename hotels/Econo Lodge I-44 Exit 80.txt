Text: Researched possible hotels in Springfield for overnight to split up move from NM to OH.  Spoke to Christine.  She is wonderful and worked with my budget.  Great, efficient, knowledgeable, friendly check-in staff.  Great overnight stay.  Clean.  Wonderful sleep.  Thanks.  The high ratings online are accurate.

Text: Great hotel to stay. Not sure why people give such bad ratings for this place- you're not staying at a Hilton Resort it's econo lodge. The guy and the girl who run the front desk are both great, really friendly and helpful. Housekeeping is friendly no problems getting extra coffee and towels. Laundry is cheap- $1 to wash $1 to dry. The gas station next door is what attracts the beggars but I've never felt not safe here. They have smoking rooms and truck parking and every time I'm in Springfield this is where I go first.

Text: Night desk person was very nice. In a very bad part of town. We were harassed by 2 homeless men as soon as we got out of our vehicle, and then a again as they roam the parking lot all night. Because of the location we saw a lot of homeless constantly walking by the front entrance. Thankfully police were there for something else, so felt a little more safe with them as we unloaded our van. Because of the area, and the problem with homeless they question you if you happen to roll out of bed unkempt to get breakfast. A bit insulted as the front desk person in the morning looked homeless herself. The room was clean though! :)

Text: Always clean. Convenient location is walking distance from several restaurants and a Walmart. My favorite was the always helpful and friendly staff from management to housekeeping. And my next favorite was breakfast. Best in all budget motels I've been to. Eggs, sausage, biscuits-n-gravy, orange juice (real OJ, not fake SunnyD or Tropicana).  Alert security and ain't just anyone getting on the premises.
