Holiday Inn Express & Suites St. Louis West - Fenton
Rating: 5
Text: Booked room an hour before arriving. Great rate and very accommodating. We originally asked for a 2 bed room, but were able to change to king room with no issue. Room was clean, internet was adequate, and shower was one of the best I've had. Room was equipped with tv, desk, refrigerator, and chair with ottoman. I would stay there again if in the area.

Text: I will not be coming back to this hotel. The shower hardly worked, the toliet flushed so violently that it was scary. The staff was not very friendly. The pool was very small and the room had a very loud echo which made it almost impossible to enjoy over the loud children screaming and throwing foam footballs around. The only redeeming factor was the pancake printer. That was cool, which is the only reason it gets a second star.

Text: They had donuts in the morning, and decent selection of breakfast food. Room was clean and didn't smell. Shower/bath tub was newer and roomy. Very pleasant stay.
