Text: The food and many of the staff were very attentive.  However, be careful in getting your boat serviced there.  Extra labor hours were added to the bill after we agreed to the amount - I was present and assisting with the work performed.  When trying to reach the harbor master to discuss the overcharge via email - twice over the course of a month - there was no reply.  I would not return for boat repairs unless absolutely necessary.

Text: We rented a condo for two nights and loved it! We were able to bring our dog. We really enjoyed hanging out on the balcony, enjoying the views while our dog relaxed with us.
