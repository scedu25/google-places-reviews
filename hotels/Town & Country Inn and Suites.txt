Town & Country Inn and Suites
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed for a week for business trip. We also used the business facilities on the 4th floor. The staff was great. Rooms were clean. The pool and hot tub were pretty small, but nice. I would give five stars, but the shuttle only goes to the airport. The website states they will take you to area businesses, but front desk said the airport is the only destination available. It is a little far away from the downtown businesses, but not terrible. Overall, great stay.
