Text: Great place to stay for a great price. Staff was very friendly. My room was very clean and comfortable. Safe area with a lot of stuff around so it was very convenient. It's a little dated but other than that it's a great place to stay.

Text: I was truly impressed with the transportation the hotel referred me to. It was a limo but I got a taxi price customer service was top notch.  This is a wonderful hotel and all the employees seem to be very happy and love their jobs I will definitely refer people to this hotel in the future
