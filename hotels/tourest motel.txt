Text: This motel is not fancy by any means, but it is clean, the WiFi works just fine, and the people are friendly. Definitely works in a pinch.

Text: It kind of adds insult to injury when the sheets of the bed in your non-smoking room have multiple cigarette-burns in them. Also, the wifi was completely non-functional, and by the way that situation was described in the front office, I wouldn't expect it to be functional any time soon.
