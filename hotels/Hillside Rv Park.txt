Text: This is a basic no frills campground. It is maintained very well and quiet. The owners also own the mobile home park next door and it is very clean and neat. The sites are good sized, gravel with a nice grassy area, and  long enough for our 37-foot RV, tow-dolly and parking the car. Some sites have trees for shade and there are open ones as well. The owners were wonderful. We got all hooked up and discovered that the electric didn't work. We called them and they came right over and put in a new breaker so we didn't have to unhook everything and move to a new spot. There is a large field for dog walking. We had full hook-ups, the WiFi was slow a few times but most of the time it worked well. Our Verizon signal was moderate but our hotspot worked fine when we needed it. We stayed the last week in September 2016 and paid $18 a night with our Passport America discount.
