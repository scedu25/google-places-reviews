Text: Nice place. Beds were pretty comfortable, docked 1/2 star for pillows being flat, needed 2 to get comfortable. Pool and hot tub were fine. And docked 1/2 star for breakfast being really bland. The bacon was really sad. The bathroom was recently remodeled. Nice modern finishes. Would stay again.

Text: Good visit, quiet hotel with nice rooms. We slept great and overall enjoyed our stay. I wish we had gotten down to the breakfast because it looked great but we had other plans.

Text: This was a clean Hotel with very friendly staff. Some of the Furnishings are dated but everything function as designed. The breakfast was average but free. The orange juice pasted great.

Text: Place was the pits.  Surprised by all the good reviews.  First room they offered smelled so much of must and cigarette smoke we turned and went right to front desk to ask for another room.  Next room.. still a bit of musty smell, .. I should have complained but this time about all the filth/hair in the bathroom on the counter and floor.  I used one of hand towels to clean the place up before my sister saw how bad the place was.  uggg.. never again.  cringed crawling into bed. why did I suffer through this???!!!  I'd give 0 stars if it was an option.
