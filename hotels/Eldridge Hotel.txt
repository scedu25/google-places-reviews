Eldridge Hotel

Text: Brunch with family was the occasion, my first time for the breakfast menu. There were selections to please each guest at our table. The presentations were lovely, the food delicious. Two of us had Bagels and Lox, two chose the French toast and last but not least was a skillet breakfast. We all agreed we would order our selections again. Service was excellent and our server most attentive.

Text: One of the cleanest hotels I've stayed at. Conveniently located on Massachusetts Street in downtown Lawrence, it boasts spacious rooms and spacious bathrooms with 2 Tv's in each room and a friendly staff. Even though I arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night, my check-in was seamless and painless. My room (and bathroom) was spacious and super clean. Most of all, the pillows and the bed were extremely comfortable. The hotel also has two on-site restaurants. I didn't eat there but I have been reliably informed that the food at both restaurants is divine. I would stay at the Eldridge again, and again, and again... you get the picture.
