Text: Staff were especially accommodating. Place was clean and quiet. We talked to a couple who had been there several weeks while going through a home remodel and had nothing but nice things to say. Breakfast was great. Pool was refreshing. Highly recommend.

Text: Beautiful rooms, friendly and welcoming staff. Great breakfast buffet with options for everyone’s different dietary needs. I felt safe, secure, and was able to relax and enjoy my stay. Our housekeeper, don’t recall her name, she had our floor (the 2nd) during our stay. She always took a moment to speak with us, not only asking if we needed anything, but making us feel as home and welcome. Great customer service!

Text: We stayed at the Residence Inn by Marriott this weekend. It was a great place to stay. We had the studio suite room. Very nice clean. The bed was awesome. Free wifi. Comfortable room all the way around. The staff was very friendly. Each person we encountered was very nice. Spoke to you, with a smile. The breakfast was great! Freah food. We will stay there again.
