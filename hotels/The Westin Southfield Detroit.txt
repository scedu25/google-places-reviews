The Westin Southfield Detroit
Rating: 4
Text: Good for conference but parking was an issue. Had I known there was a separate conference area I would have parked on the other side of the entrance. There are three handicap spots for this place. Usually I'd complain about too many handicap spots for places but this is obviously not enough. Valet is available. Conference rooms spacious, clean and above normal but bathrooms are a hike, seems like a bus station but slightly cleaner, meaning it could be improved for maintenance. All staffing was good and helpful. Didn't see the guest rooms or restaurant so can't comment with knowledge there. Easy to find once on the proper road but easy to get twisted before that. I used GPS and I'm glad I did.

Text: Nice Hotel but the restaurant serves cafeteria food. It was very bad... the people in the hotel were nice, the beds were comfortable and the showers were great.

Text: I attended a professional conference with provided breakfast. The facilities were clean, well laid out, and comfortable. The breakfast was amazing! Plentiful and varied with both sweet and savory. All in all, things could not have been set up better. I look forward to my next event at this location.

Text: I enjoyed my stay at the Westin Southfield. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. It isn't too far away from downtown Detroit and is situated right beside a highway that'll get toy there in 20 minutes or so. The parking garage is conveniently located as well. Recommended!

Text: Among other great amenities, they have workout clothes rentals! How cool is that? I didn't think to bring athletic shoes, but they are about to deliver them to my room for a REALLY nominal fee!
