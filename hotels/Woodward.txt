Woodward

Text: The Woodward is an excellent bed and breakfast in the middle of Topeka. There is an quaint charm of staying there and breakfasts are wonderful. This is an excellent place to stay as a couple. There are several room options available. I have stayed at two of them and they are both really good. I most recently stayed at the Master bedroom and it is a very nice space to stay in.

Text: My husband surprised me with a 2 night stay for our 45th anniversary! Lovely place, quiet, serene - just what I needed.  We stayed in the Master Suite and loved it.  Dessert at 9  every night  - ours was an amazing lemon cake the first night.  Breakfast was also very good - a lover's pancake, bananas & whipped cream concoction - yum. Beautiful place, Elizabeth was a very gracious host.  Has massages in the library!  Would love to go back.  Thank you!

Text: Living at the Wisteria is a dream. The most beautiful furnished apartment with everything needed, you truly can walk in with your clothes and food and need nothing. It's quiet serenity and safety made it so I was able to be alone at night while my other worked and he could sleep during the day while I enjoined the grounds, library or near by parks and business. Love it!

Text: Located in a neighborhood setting, the Woodward is a group of houses that have been renovated as part of a neighborhood restoration project by the owner. Each house has been carefully preserved to maintain its individual charm as well as its historical architecture. Located within 5 minutes of the Capital, you will have easy access to all of the facilities and events in the area. But its neighborhood atmosphere let's you feel like you are at home.
