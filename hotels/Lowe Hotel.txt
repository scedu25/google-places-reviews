Lowe Hotel

Text: Neat place. It was charming, had an authentic old time feel. If you're looking for all the modern conveniences this may not be the place, but my room had cable, frig, hair dryer, and Jacuzzi. The owners were friendly toward my wife and I. No paranormal experiences,  but the moth man museum was right across the street and was cool. 139 bucks for weekend nights was a goid rate

Text: Really unique place. We got the Jacuzzi suite and the room was so cute and very worth it. Great to just walk around looking at all the art and finding all the tucked away reading rooms. We heard it was haunted so we walked around at night which was very creepy. Be warned that most of the restaurants around here are fast food, with a few meh chain restaurants. I think an italian place is opening near it soon through. Great place will def come back.

Text: We stayed at The Lowe overnight while in town to visit the Mothman Museum. We were greeted by the very friendly owner who told us about the town and what to see and do. The Lowe is over 100 years old with a lot of character and love in the building. Our rooms were spacious and kept in theme with the hotels historic theme with big comfortable beds. Amenities were simple which was all we needed. The hotel is conveniently located near the Mothman museum, a coffee shop, a Mexican restaurant, and a state park. If you are exploring the little town of Point Pleasant then The Lowe Hotel is highly recommended.
