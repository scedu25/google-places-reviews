Text: My husband and I called at the spur of the moment and stayed for two nights. What a wonderful facility, beautiful grounds and extremely friendly staff. If we get the chance again this would be the first on our list. Thank you to the owners Bruce and Gina. They made us feel like family.

Text: Don't book here unless you are 100% sure you can make it.  I cancelled 2 days prior to my check in due to a father in law getting scheduled for a brain tumor and they hit me with a cancellation fee and a deposit for over $161.  I will never stay here nor recommend it.

Text: Excellent rooms with good space and furnishings, and everything is taken care of well. The pool is nice and a good size, and the lake of course is right out front.
