Text: Horrible place! Bathrooms have moss growing on floor. One toilet didnt work. Second set of bathrooms didnt have door on stalls, just shower curtain. Toilet was full of paper towels. Had to cleam shower before you could use it. Floor was filthy. Someone in the campgroind has a pet skunk, it stinks. Dogs running lose. Rooster crowing eakes you up at the crack of dawn. Would never stay there again!
