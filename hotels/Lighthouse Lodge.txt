Text: So you are accustomed to staying in four-star hotels? Pull up in front of this 1955-era brick motel and you might be tempted to punch the accelerator back toward the interstate. Then you would miss out on one of the last remaining real bargains in the USA. Clean if spartan rooms, refrigerator and microwave, satellite tv and a self-service laundry only a few steps away, all for only $49.95 (tax included). We did not see any bugs except the normal insects common to an Illinois summer evening, all of them outdoors. We repeat and re-phrase: this place does not have roaches. We did not hear our neighbors nor any traffic noise. Dead quiet all night. It is a clean and cheap place to spend the night in the middle of rural America. Our family would certainly stay here again, given the opportunity.
