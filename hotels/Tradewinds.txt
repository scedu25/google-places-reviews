Text: We have been staying here for years. Sure, you have a short drive to the park, but you also don't have all the strict rules of the park.  We have dogs.  One is high energy.  We are able to have her off a leash to play Frisbee in an open field.  It's not a fancy campground,  but to us, it's well worth the drive!
