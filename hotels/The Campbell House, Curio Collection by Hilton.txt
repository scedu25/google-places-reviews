The Campbell House, Curio Collection by Hilton

Text: Really nice hotel that is part of the Historic Hotels of Kentucky. Friendly staff, spacious rooms. Rooms seemed a little dark, mostly due to choice of paint color for the walls, and the bathrooms are a little small. There is an indoor pool and plenty of conference rooms and a great ballroom for your business needs. Definitely grab a map at the front desk as you can easily get lost wandering the many hallways here.

Text: Nice lunch buffet. I had a great beef stew, salad & dessert combo. Hubby had full buffet choice of sausage w/ cabbage, mixed veggies, sauteed fish, rice, warm bread pudding, rolls + the combo I had. I think there were also a couple of other choices but I can't recall what they were just now. Our 1st time there. Will be back 4 the Sunday buffet. Lovely hotel.

Text: My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I really liked the art in the lobby. I was surprised by the more modern style, but that was a good surprise. The rooms were also nice and clean. Overall, a nice place to stay.

Text: Loved it! Very spacious and comfortable rooms! Bathrooms were clean and nice--except FOR NO counter space, and the glass shelf was not much help. If they'd take the EXTRA space next to the bathroom, they could DOUBLE the size, without affecting ting the useable floor space.

The food was good--especially their Campbell House Burger! Gift Shop by Madonna was GREAT--lovely items from an array of merchandise! 

Staff were very accommodating--brought me a refrigerator and a microwave upon request--though, they ought to have those installed in every guest room.

I'm very pleased to have had the opportunity to stay here!
