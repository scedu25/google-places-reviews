Text: The pictures that were posted on the internet were false. The bathroom shown was very nice, but what we got was very disgusting. Moldy walls and bathmat, paint peeling from the bathtub, and under the bed hadn't been cleaned for a long time. Will never stay there again.

Text: Thought i would come and leave a review i have been here for about 3 weeks now....the staff is friendly and amazing i could not ask for a better place to stay...i have not had any issues staying here. The houskeeper comes to my room daily to clean my room and provide clean fresh linens. They are in the process of remodelimg some rooms but i never see a mess like you would think during a remodel.  This is probably the only motel that i have ever been to that has a NO DRUG policy and enforces it. The owners and staff really do a great job at makimg sure the guests are comfortable and safe. There is 24 hours surveillance on the property which makes my wife feel better...i have left a couple timea and forgot to lock my door and when i returned nothing had been touched which made me feel even more secure because of the staff that is always watching the property. I want to say merry christmas and God Bless to the staff and owners

Text: If you're looking for a quiet, inexpensive place in El Dorado, this is it.  I've stayed here a couple of times, and always felt very welcome and comfortable.  
The owners are very friendly, and while this is a pretty old building, it's well-maintained. And you can't beat the location!
