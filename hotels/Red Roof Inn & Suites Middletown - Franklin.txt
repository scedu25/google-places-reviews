Text: Charged 10 per night extra for my service dog!  I had 1 pet and a service animal that works for me.  I always stay at red roofs, first time I've ever heard of this policy!  
Update... Fixed the situation right away!  VERY MUCH APPRECIATED!  Thank you

Text: Check in for a weekly rate. 1 st night my wife killed 6 roaches and killed 5 the next morning. When I informed the front desk of this and that we were going to check out the desk clerk said we can change you to another room. When I still insisted on checking our she then told me the remaining of the room fees wouldn't be refunded  I then informed that I would be calling corporate over this matter. When then called the manager while I was calling corporate. Money was returned after the hassle

Text: Bathroom was dirty, floors feel gross. Was told on the phone that hotel has been updated...really? Where? Holes in the furniture. Shower curtain to small for shower.  There were stains on towels and hole in wash cloths.  Side door doesn't work and i killed 2 roaches crawling up tbe wall..yuck! Hallways and  stairs need a good cleaning. There is no elevator. Room smells musty.  If not needing a hotel very late at night and if not being exhausted from travel....i would have NOT stayed here. Staff was friendly.  That is the only plus about this hotel.

Text: GROSS!! My family and i was there to stay a night and were there for an hr and i look over on the other bed where my kids were sleeping and there were 2 bed begs crawling on my daughters chest. I pull the kids out off bed and to the bath while my husband went to walmart to get us new clothes to put on.. I pulled the covers back and both beds are covered in crawling bed begs!! I took pictures and even caught some in the cups provided in the room took them and the pictures to the front desk and demanded my money back for the room, the deposit, and the clothes we had to purchase and the owner refused to refund us for anything!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!

Text: Horrible stay. I was traveling with my three month old daughter and was afraid to even sit or lay her down anywhere. One of the first things I did was look for bed bugs, that's how unkept it was. Surprisingly I didn't see any, but when wiping down surfaces every single wipe I used was black. Disgusting! The bathroom was teeny tiny. There were several hairs on our sheets and the bed looked like it had been made in a hurry. There was a dirty sock in the floor! I honestly don't think our room was even cleaned. If we didn't have our baby with us and it wasn't late we would have found another hotel.
