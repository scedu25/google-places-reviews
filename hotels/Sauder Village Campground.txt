Sauder Village Campground
Rating: 4
Text: We are new to RV travel and Sauder was the first place we stayed.  We didn't realize what a nice facility it was until further along in our trip.  We stayed for one night and didn't use the bathroom facilities.  Pros: really nice sites with shade - it didn't feel crowded.  It is about 2.5 miles from the highway so it was nice and quiet.  They have quiet hours as well so we slept well.  Access to indoor pool although we were too late to enjoy.  Great wifi which we are finding to be hit or miss on our trip.  Only con is that there didn't seem to be much around the site such as grocery etc.

Text: Beautiful campground. some people that bring their RVs here don't know proper camping etiquette but I can't blame the campground for that. They have great package deals with the village also. Very affordable.

Text: It was a very pretty campground, we loved the splash pad and that you could use the hotel pool and hot tub. We had a campsite on the lake and it was absolutely beautiful! We will definitely be back!

Text: Super clean facility and very friendly staff. We unfortunately didn't get to visit the Village, but enjoyed our stay at the campground. Our neighbors in the slot next to us we're really nice too. Be sure to try the sugar cookies if you get a chance. They were tasty!
