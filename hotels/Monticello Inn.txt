Monticello Inn

Text: Clean sheets and towels. They advertise cheapest rates in town, and they are. We are spending time with family nearby so we just needed a place to shower and sleep. I was not discouraged by the one start rating I saw, and I'm happy with my decision. Not sure what people expect from a low price motel, but what we got was well worth what we paid.

Text: Undergoing renovations, many improvements!  Freshly painted, new bathtub and sink, hairdryer,  new ceiling tiles, new closet, microwave, and mini-fridge.  All rooms are non-smoking and pet-free.  The management is super friendly as well.  Can't wait to see how this place will only continue to improve!

Text: This is what I'd consider a high end motel. It's not a 5 star hotel but that's not what we were looking for. The owners were very accommodating with a broken air conditioner, moving us to another room without a problem. There's no bugs, no noticable bad smells, and the rooms are very cozy. They are obviously working hard to renovate to make it look nicer than it already looks. I'd stay here again!

Text: Close to Indiana Beach. It is easy to find. The room prices are great  for this area. The rooms are  clean and its easy to check in. However, the walls are a little thin so you hear the other guests at the hotel.

Text: Manager is eager to please.  My husband has some disabilities and she went out of her way to accommodate us.  The price and facility is very nice for the price.
