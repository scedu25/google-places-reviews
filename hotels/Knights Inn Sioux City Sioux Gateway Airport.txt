Text: First of all it looks like a huge dump on the outside. The room was dirty. It wasn't vacuumed and the toilet was disgusting! The sink, floor and shower all dirty and old meat in the fridge. We asked for a different room and they were very accommodating. That room was also dirty but not as bad. We were given the excuse that the houskeeper is new and that she would talk to her and have the riom cleaned by the time we got back... we got back at 2am and our key wouldn't work. The person working downstairs shut off the phone you are supposed to use for assistance so I had to yell for someone to help. He took the key and went and unlocked the door, made my husband feel like an ass. Like we were supposed to know your tricks. We were never informed. I will never ever ever be back to that place ever!
