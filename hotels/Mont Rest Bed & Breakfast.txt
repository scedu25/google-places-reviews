Mont Rest Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We were greeted as soon as we entered and were given a tour of the house and shown to our room. We stayed in Bridget's French Rose room and it was beautiful! It had ornate decoration, as did the entire house. We came for the murder mystery, which was so well orchestrated, and the other people were fun to do it with as well. Would definitely recommend and we would certainly return.

Text: My wife and I stayed in the SL Baker room on Saturday, September 23, 2017 to celebrate our anniversary.  We had never visited Mont Rest or Bellevue before, but we ran across the bed & breakfast when looking online for somewhere to stay.

Everything about our stay at Mont Rest was fantastic!  The room was spacious and beautifully decorated.  The king bed was very comfortable and the Jacuzzi was relaxing.  There were many nice touches about the room that just made us smile, but we will definitely be back and would like to try a different room.

The full breakfast in the morning was extremely good with a perfect atmosphere.  Even though you eat around a very large table with other guests, it never felt uncomfortable or awkward (and this is from someone who is usually reserved).

The bed & breakfast hosts were friendly and accommodating from the moment we arrived (right about check-in time at 4pm).  Since most guests hadn't arrived yet, we were able to view many of the rooms and have a nice tour of the place.  The central staircase is absolutely beautiful with a gorgeous covered atrium of glass letting light in.  There are neat paintings and antiques all over the place, and they add a great deal to the atmosphere.  As a guest, you are allowed to use the kitchen, roam the entire hotel (except other guest rooms of course), and even enjoy an outdoor porch that wraps around.

We had an absolutely splendid time here, and we can't wait to come back and stay in a different room.  We would also like to try either the Murder Mystery with another couple we're friends with, or perhaps the Titanic dress up dinner.

The only negatives that I could think of were the swarms of wasps all around the premises (that time of year), and perhaps the fact that some rooms don't have the nice Jacuzzi to enjoy.  Other than that, however, this is one of the nicest places we've ever stayed as a couple.

Text: This bed and breakfast exceeded expectations in every way!  The food was amazing, our room was very romantic. I loved the home-made goodies, robes, large Jacuzzi bath and fireplace.  We will be returning here for sure and I cant say enough about the nice staff and how relaxing this was.  Mont Rest has perfected the art of bed and breakfast....Thank you!

Text: The host Niomie (sorry if spelled wrong!!) Was fantastic.  She gave us a tour of this beautiful home when we arrived for our stay.  We happened to be the only ones staying that night so we had the house to ourselves.  We were welcomed to the kitchen and drinks, she also left us some DELICIOUS brownies!  Breakfast the next morning was delicious with fruit, hash browns, quiche, rhubarb bread, sausage and baked apples along with oj and coffee.  I definitely recommend this place and their wonderful staff!
