Text: Drive far, far away from here!!
All the reviews are true!  Bugs, stained sheets, holes in the floor and it smells like a cross between dead mice and a dirty diaper!  Horrible rude, rude people that run the place!  Shady for sure!!  If it's your only option, I would sleep in your car!

Text: I'm writing this review from the back of my jeep grand Cherokee. This is where I choose to sleep tonight after I seen my room. The office says no refunds. So I guess I'll leave a floater in the am lol. The carpet is from the 60s. The bathroom floor vinyl is just as old and has a huge piece missing and you can see through a Crack in the subfloor. The bed has hair in it and has sheets that the pattern looks like it's designed for a 10 year old boy. The door won't lock unless you fidget with it for a minute or 2. The shower knob is old and tricky. The drain was clogged with 100s of people's hair and barely drained. Dead flies in the sink (probably died from the black mold that has been spray painted over) and the smell reminds me of the time I went to jail. I'd rather sleep in that jail tonight honestly. This place is a shyt hole. Drive 60 more miles in ANY direction to stay in a nice hotel.

Text: this is a bad place to stay fridge doesn't work old microwave, room was not dusted, A/C half works, needs to get new towels and sheets, bathroom needs to be redone, cobwebs in the corners, They did have a new LG flat screen TV and cable TV.  The TV was the only thing good about this place. Not worth the $ 58.00. Office was a mess and smelled like a wet dog, had a dog in the office.  Will not stay here again will go to Liberal, KS better places there to stay
