Text: The campground posted "quiet hours" 11pm-8am are not observed or enforced.  Saturday night a party of 30-50 people went on until after 2:30am (last time I looked at my watch) and Sunday night the camp hosted a DJ that started at 7pm and played until 2am.  After that the chaos continued into the campground until after 4am.  Had we been told upfront there was no "quiet hours" we wouldn't have stayed.

Text: We went in the beginning of July with no reservations and had no problem finding a good site. We were able to camp literally RIGHT ON the river and next to the beach. The campground owner was very nice to us. The sites were decent sized and each had their own water, electric, picnic table and fire pit. However, the fire pits didn't have any grill/grates on them, which made it difficult to cook food over the fire. The beach and swimming area weren't too deep, muddy, or seaweedy. The bathrooms were really the only part of the campground that I disliked. I think there was only 1 bathroom building and in the women's restroom, there were only 2 stalls and one (pretty nasty looking) shower stall. The only sink available was outside of the restrooms, had trash and debris in it, and didn't have any soap or paper towels.
