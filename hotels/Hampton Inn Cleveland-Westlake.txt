Hampton Inn Cleveland-Westlake
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is in a good location for people traveling on I 90. It's also close to a lot of retail stores and restaurants, but be aware there is a lot of traffic in the area. We stayed two nights in a good sized room with a king bed for $82 per night which was the AARP rate. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The bathroom sink area was small but acceptable for 2 people. For a short term stay at this price and for the location I would stay there again.

Text: Check in was great. Very simple and pleasant. Rooms are very nice. There is no included refrigerator in my king room, but it wasn't needed or asked for. Bathrooms and clean and up to date. Room layout is great. If I were in the area I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The room is fairly small, relatively old. The window overlooks the parking lot, which means leaving it open/unshaded isn't really an option. Found a dirty washcloth in the bathroom. The bathroom is a bit small as well. Service at the front desk was amazing. The breakfast looks good. The lobby is nice, clean, neat.

Text: The staff is always nice and even though we're there for a work meeting they never mind if I take a cookie or some coffee or even tea. The place is always clean and aesthetically pleasing. No complaints I love when we join meetings there for Mary Kay
