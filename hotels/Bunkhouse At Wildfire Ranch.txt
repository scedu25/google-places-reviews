Text: I have stayed with the Ringers on two separate occasions and have never stayed with a more hospitable family. The cabin and the bunkhouse both are immaculately kept and clean enough for a germaphobe! Whether it's sunrises, sunsets, or pancakes, the Ringers have the spot for the best! If you're passing through or in the area for several days, you cannot beat their price!
