Text: My wife and I had a great stay at Lindenhof.  The bed was comfy, room tastefully decorated and the breakfast each morning was something to really look forward to.  I could go on and on, but I'll keep it short and say that if your planning on a weekend in Missouri's wine country in Augusta they'll take great care of you.

Text: Someone gifted me a three day stay at the Lindenhof B&B for a writing retreat - and what a gift it was! Such a beautiful, peaceful and inspiring place. I stayed in "The Artist's Room" and enjoyed doodling in the sketch pad provided during my breaks from writing. The hosts were so accommodating to my night owl writing schedule - as just one example, leaving a fresh pot of coffee out for me before they retired. So much more to say, but I'm working on another book so here's a bullet point list:

* The breakfasts were amazing! 
* The town is lovely - antiques, cafes, wineries, arts and beautiful scenery. I spent a day writing at Klondike park.
* The "champagne massage" tub was a wonderful way to relax.
* Loved the patio and garden.
* The house itself if beautiful - lovely furnishings, beautiful artwork and many antiques and collectables to view. 
* For the few hours that I did sleep, the bed, pillows and down comforter were incredibly comfortable.

Can't say enough about this place. I will be back.
