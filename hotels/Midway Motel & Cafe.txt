Text: We have stayed at Midway several times on our trips to Kansas. It serves our needs every time!  A modest little motel, it's clean and it's there every time we come back to Jennings! We found Midway the other night in the dark and the rain and we were really glad to be there! We enjoy our trips to Kansas, partly because of Midway and the owner. She is becoming an old friend. She cooks up breakfast in her café and local people come by to eat. Like she said the other day, "We're kind of like being out in the country here!" Just call ahead so they know you're coming.
