Days Inn Le Roy

Text: 0 out of 5. For a 100 bucks or more a night I should not be finding the dirty towels from the previous guests. That aside the cost feels staggeringly high. I try my best to avoid staying in Leroy at all costs the hotels are a racket.

Text: Stayed a couple of weeks ago. Checked in late and the lady was prompt and polite. Breakfast was ready and made a little extra (5:45) for me since I had to be on the road before 6 for my job, kindness especially not knowing our tight budget. My husband didn't book ahead for our next stop and the lady  helped us find a hotel. . The service given was wonderful and unexpected. The room were nice and big and updated and the breakfast was good.Liked that it was all nonsmoking rooms. No elevator. Very reasonable price. Would happily recommend
