Text: Overall experience was good. Night staff super friendly. Lobby is beautiful. Plenty of parking. Decided to skip Max and Erma's because they're breakfast menu is small and a bit pricey. Bed was comfortable. Room was clean. Booked hotel because they are affordable and pet friendly. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the bathroom was in rough shape. Sink faucet leaked all over the counter with each use. Toilet paper holder wouldn't hold the TP. No microwave or mini fridge but mini keurig was a nice touch.

Text: Half a star if I could. I simply stopped in the parking lot to feed my 19 month old and consider whether or not I should get a room. Nosey employees felt I was a bad presence to the area, by simply doing that. So the sheriff was called to investigate the disruption. If I cannot even park and tend to my child for 15 minutes (given that it was late at night, and I needed a rest) I would rather NOT stay at this establishment.
