Text: WiFi not working, even after router reboot. Ceiling tile above tub are falling down. No hanger hook on inside bathroom door, only the mount for one. Room was clean and well kept and quiet.

Text: For motels in this price range, this Days Inn is right up there. We didn't use the pool but others appeared to be enjoying it. Clean and comfortable with all the usual amenities. Very nice breakfast with hot options. We'd stay again.

Text: Awful hotel. Bathroom was filthy. They never bothered to clean our room the first day. Had to ask them to clean our room. The pool was very cloudy and dirty. No way we could use it. Would have given this place zero stars but that was not available.
