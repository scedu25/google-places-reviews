Text: I have been a resident here for over a year and am not happy with the owners (RV Horizons) of this "community" at all. We had to take them to the city Council to get them to fix safety issues after I complained for over nine months and other residents had complained since they took ownership of it in September of 2014. They have sold property illegally. They do not follow through with what they promise you. They change the rules to suit themselves. They ignore repeated attempts to contact them. They refuse to take care of vacant trailers. There is NO onsite management or maintenance. The local manager (Lilaneya Goorhouse) has no authority except to pass out citations; yet you can't get in contact with anyone that has authority. They raise the rent without properly maintaining the park. The lots are not "legal size" (the trailer next to mine that is vacant is less than 15' from my steps and is less than 2' from my driveway). My electrical pole (and many others) is less than 20" from my trailer.  They have allowed aggressive animals (cats with rabies; dogs that have attacked kids and other dogs) to remain on the premises after complaints were turned in. They dictate how your lot and inside of your trailer look yet they refuse to take care of the empty ones they own. They come on/in your property without proper notifications.
As long as RV Horizons owns this park I would not refer it to anyone I know including people I don't like.
