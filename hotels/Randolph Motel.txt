Randolph Motel
Rating: 1
Text: I showed up there tonight around midnight and he very rudely opens the window saying he's closed. I ask him if I could just get a room. I've been driving over 12 hours and have no idea where the next hotel is. He said no and called me an a-hole for ringing the 'night bell' and told me to f off.
