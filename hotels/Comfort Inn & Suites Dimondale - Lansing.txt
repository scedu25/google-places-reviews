Text: Quiet, safe, clean.  Right off of 496,  good price for the stay - perfect for a couple nights or more.  Seems family friendly. Free breakfast. Room had microwave and mini fridge.  I recommend.

Text: Nice bed, ok staff- only seemed half interested in issues, decent/cheap breakfast food... the room I reserved almost a month before was not reserved so I was not in the same block as the wedding party i was a part of. I was upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite so that was nice.

Text: We show up for go to a dinner cruise birthday party and are staying at this hotel.  We called weeks in advance to be sure to have a shuttle to go back and forth and were assured we were all set up.  Now they say they have nothing scheduled and there is nothing they can do.  The front desk girl who was stuck In the middle called her manager Melody Tupper who told her that she will not be in until the morning and can talk to us then which is extremely unhelpful when the shuttle is for tonight.  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Text: We have been staying at this hotel for years but the quality has been declining. This last stay we arrived late after a long drive and bad traffic. There was no one at the desk but a phone and a sign to call. That phone did not work. I called from my cell phone and never got an answer after 5 minutes of ringing. Once we finally found the desk clerk, who was outside smoking and on her cell phone, she insisted on charging us again for the stay even though we prepaid when we made the reservation. I have yet to argue with the manager about that issue. They have also removed the towel rods from the bathroom so there is no place to put your towe while you shower other than the top of the toilet. That is not my preferred place to put the clean towel I plan to use.
