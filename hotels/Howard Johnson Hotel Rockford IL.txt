Howard Johnson Hotel Rockford IL
Rating: 2
Text: This place is relatively clean although my mother in law found bugs in her room and they happily moved her to a new one. There are many windows that are cracked. I can't say it's the worst hotel I've ever stayed at but that's not saying much. I've never seen a Howard Johnson in such disrepair. If you need a comfy bed to sleep in it's ok, but, it's surely not luxurious by any means.

Text: If you're looking for a cheap place to stay, this is the place. The service is good, but it's definitely old and run down. There is a pool, but the hot tub is shut down. Overall better than motel 6, but nothing too fancy.

Text: The rooms are a nice basic room and the pool area is fantastic! Front desk staff were very nice and the breakfast was your typical continental.

Text: The building is old.  They are trying to make updates.  2nd floor rooms have high ceilings which are nice.  Pool is very large and great for kids.  It's clean, it's just old and run down.
