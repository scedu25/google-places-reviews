Text: Staff is amazing. Understanding. Friendly. And rooms are quiet. Seem sound proof... We have dogs here and there is grass and woods around most of the property for walking them.

Text: We really enjoyed our stay. As a mom of small children I appreciate the wood floors! The housekeeping staff were extremely nice (thank you Kim) and did a fantastic job cleaning our room. My husband has been here 7 weeks and myself and the kids 1 week. I feel safe here and haven't had any complaints. There are plenty of things to do around the area. If we are ever in this area again we will definitely choose this location.

Text: Our room was very clean. The beds were comfortable. I don't understand why I got charged for a safe that was in the room that we did not use and they did not tell me they were adding it to my bill. Room was great though.

Text: Almost like lipstick on a pig. It's tidy, but in no way"clean". Affordable, yes. Best place for the price to go in the area, no.
