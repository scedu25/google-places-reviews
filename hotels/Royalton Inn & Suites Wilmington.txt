Royalton Inn & Suites Wilmington

Text: It looked pretty good from the outside and the room looked pretty nice. The price was good.  Newer carpet!  The heater in the pool was broken... no apology from the owner.  There was poop in the hallway that may not have been avoidable.  They said that a horse owner was staying there. They did apologize.  I noticed what looked like small blood stains on my pillow.  I didn't see any signs of bed bugs, so I threw the pillow aside.  The next morning I had a little bleeding hole on my leg.  The owner's wife said in very broken English that it must have been a flying bug. (at least I think that is what she said) That was that.  No apology. So, I do not like to leave poor feedback, but one thing is clear, I will never stay there again.

Text: I was here for a week of training. Spacious room with a desk, fridge, and microwave. Decent bed. Clean and well maintained. AC worked well. Decent breakfast. I would definitely recommend this place for the price.

Text: For those that have said the staff was rude, it has bed bugs and the management follows you around. I have to wonder if you even stayed  here. I gave it 5 stars for the manager gave us one room, then changed it after seeing that my wife walks with a cane. Got a room next to the exit that was for handicapped. Nice big beds, A/C worked, large shower room with sitting options in the stall, plenty of towels. Room was clean, no sings of bugs, clean pool and a self serve breakfast setting. Will always stop here when we go back.

Text: I really like the location of this place but the rooms are a mess. A/C was too loud, customer service isn't very nice, no hot water it takes about 25 mins to get it started and i also found roaches.
