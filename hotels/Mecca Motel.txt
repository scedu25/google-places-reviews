Text: It's a very basic Hotel. It is a great place to sleep if you're trying to visit Cedar Point. We stayed for 3 nights and felt totally comfortable. The lady at the front desk was very very nice. We will definitely return if ever back in the area.

Text: Cheap and clean, not very pretty but functional after all we didn't spend much time in room. Close to Cedar Point, only one right turn worked out great for us

Text: The room wasn't bad, it was clean. Had problems with the cable and the hot water. Decent price for being right down the road from cedar point.
