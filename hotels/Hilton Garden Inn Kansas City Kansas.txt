Hilton Garden Inn Kansas City/Kansas
Rating: 3
Text: Restaurant is over priced. Food is ok, but not "great". I think the thing that boggles my mind the most is that the towels aren't plush. I mean, come on.... it's a Hilton for heaven's sake! Nice exercise area. Small lap pool. Not as pictured on the website. The front desk people are what make this place. They are super friendly and helpful!

Text: Good location for going out, including the haunted houses at this time of year which were only a few minutes away. The walls were thin in the rooms - could hear the neighbor's bathroom and the elevator. Staff was friendly and accommodating.

Text: Just across the river from downtown KC, this hotel is located in a nice area with easy access to the highway. Staff was friendly, and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. The front desk recommended a great pizza place for delivery as we were very tired and didn't want to sit in their restaurant, which also looked nice. The kids enjoyed the pool, which was pretty busy, as we were there on a Saturday night.

Text: Room near the elevator/vending machine was too loud to sleep. After several hours of trying I went to the desk and asked to switch rooms. They were very nice and accommodating and switched my room right away. The second room was much better.

Text: The rooms are small but the beds are very nice with feather pillows. THE BAR IS ONLY OPEN TILL 10PM!!!! Honestly the room seem over priced, did not feel like a Hilton. Also hard water in the shower gives you that slick feeling when trying to get clean. No complimentary breakfast, it's  $10 per person.
