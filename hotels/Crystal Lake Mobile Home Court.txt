Text: Lady in the office is always yelling and screaming profanity at people. Always very unprofessional and even starting arguments with tenants in open and doesnt Care if anyone is out side and listening. Very very disrespectful and rude.

Text: I lived there with my parents, I knew a lot of people that lived there and I've heard a lot about bed bugs being a problem. The manager Mary is very rude and disrespectful, although pretty lenient if you can't get rent on time, when I was a minor I was yelled at for standing in my driveway at 8pm instead of in the grass. When we moved in there were multiple holes in the floor under the carpet, and the ceiling was cracked.

Text: I think its sad that so many reviews have been posted on here about Mary Reese and she still has not even been fired. Everything negative everyone is saying about her is absolutely true. She wants nothing more than to ruin as many peoples day as she can in one day. Mary does an absolute terrible job at addressing any issues the tennants have. Good luck getting ahold of her if you ever call her because your chances of getting a phone call back are slim to none nomatter how many times you call and nomatter the importance. Also good luck finding her in the office if you cannot reach her by phone. I have not been able to get in touch with her for months now. She is not available during office hours. She sets her own times. When you ever do hear from her its because she wants to ask you for dirt on your neighbor or to yell at you for anything and everything. If evil had a name it would be Mary Reese. DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! You have been warned
