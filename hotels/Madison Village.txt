Text: Trashy af. Horrible management. Only want to sell/rent to people they think they are smarter than and can easily screw over. Very rude and dont obey by their own rules. They also like to pick 'Park Pets' to do tbeir female dog work for them and in return get special exclusion from a variety of tbeir already ridiculous rules & regulations
