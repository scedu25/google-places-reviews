Family Budget Inn Bethany
Rating: 4
Text: For a budget motel, this place is a jewel. It is quite basic, but the rooms are clean and like new - much better than average. The bed sheets are pretty old but the towels are good. Bathrooms are like new. No nasty carpet, just wood laminate. The breakfast is basic, but they have a nifty pancake machine. They serve real orange juice but no fresh fruit. They only charge $5 for our  cat to stay too! For a place to lay your head overnight it's great!

Text: I really enjoyed my stay here. The room was large and clean, with a bed and a couch. Everything worked, there was an abundance of outlets. There is a fridge and microwave. The location is right off I-35,  so very convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Felt safe and secure, it is a one-level but rooms can only be accessed from the inside of the building. Lots of restaurants and gas stations nearby, even within walking distance. Excellent. Would stay there again.

Text: Older motel kept in good shape by local owners.  Room was nice and clean.  No extra charge for the cat.  Go to the Toot Toot restaurant!

Text: Carpeting in the room I had was new and incredibly soft. Room was clean. Only complaint I have is the proximity to the interstate.

Text: Clean, quiet, comfy beds. Nothing fancy, but the price was right, the people were nice, the a/c worked, the breakfast was, well, breakfast. I will absolutely stay here again.
