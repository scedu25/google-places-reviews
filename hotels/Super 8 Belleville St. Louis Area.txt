Super 8 Belleville St. Louis Area
Rating: 3
Text: Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating because the bathtub/shower needs an update. The water pressure from the shower wasn't the best (but I've definitely seen worse) we were able to get clean at least!!!! The shower knobs are quite rusted..Like I said just needs a bit of an upgrade.Staff was nice and very helpful!! Visited with other travelers,everyone was nice!!!! Would definitely stay again,even without an updated shower/tub :)

Text: First got hooked onto this super 8 by my girlfriend. We like to just go and hang sometimes away from  the noise of our lives. Wanted a clean and comfy experience and this super 8 has not disappointed. Very comfy bed, good hot water, nice cable, WiFi could be better though but still decent overall. We come here often and will continue

Text: Staff was very helpful and friendly. Downtown location is very convenient. WiFi is mediocre at best, but they also have a computer in the lobby for guests. Breakfast was average, but the coffee is very good. Fix the WiFi for a fifth star.
