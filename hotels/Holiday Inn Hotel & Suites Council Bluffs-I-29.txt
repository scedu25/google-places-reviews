Text: Professional, friendly & efficient front desk personnel. Personable cleaning & dining room attendants. Nice size room (double Queen w/mini refrigerator & microwave) and a picturesque view of "Muddy Mo" (Missouri) River & Omaha banks. Fantastic hot & cold breakfast (omelettes are to die for)!  Great location for family fun (Kid Quest & pool available), business or leisure trip! I give it - "2 Thumbs up & A Pinkie"

Text: My best friend and I had the misfortune of having to stay here for a night. The staff, especially at the front desk, was incredibly rude. Our room was absolutely disgusting. Within the first five minutes of entering the room, we found three bugs, on the curtains, stained sheets, hairs everywhere, and a faucet that couldn't produce a non-smelling substance. In addition, I can't put into words how foul smelling the AC unit's air was.
We complained to the front desk and they couldn't care less. Their "5 minute break" from the desk was around a 20 minute wait for us. 
Staying here was quite aggravating and we don't plan to ever come back. 
Save your worthwhile money for the casino next door. You'll be in a better mood and people will actually treat you with some respect.

Text: I'm an elite member with holiday inn. They are usually always great. Some of the cheaper a little less then stellar but always clean, comfortable and nice people.  This is to be a good holiday inn and they didn't even put sheets on the sofa bed.  When i called and asked they sent someone up who literally just shoved them in my arms.  Then today when they cleaned the room they made the bed but didn't touch the sofa bed.  Came back to the room still a mess other then the main bed being made.

Text: A great venue for our meeting. The service was great with an awesome breakfast and the server coming around taking plates and keeping the place clean without disturbing the event. Very professional.
