Text: My boyfriend and I have stayed here a few times over the past couple years and I love this place.....never had a problem bringing my little furbabies here because they only charge a few dollars more so I can have them with me. Would I recommend Budget Host to others for an overnight place to stay? Yes....yes I definitely would ????

Text: My first--and most pleasant--stay at this motel.  Rooms were clean; flat-screen TV; microwave; small refrigerator; properly functioning air conditioner and the cost, most reasonable.  Would I stay at this motel again?  Most certainly!

Text: I had come into the Budget Host In to ask if they were hiring. The lobby was small and dark, and the rooms from the outside look quite old but I didn't get to see much of the motel as a whole.

Text: I've been staying here a few months already for work. The owners have been wonderful, friendly, and considerate. I get my mail delivered here, including packages. Their customer service is top notch. The amenities are good, especially considering the low cost.
