Drury Suites Paducah
Rating: 5
Text: What the Drury provides over all others is quality food, without adding to your bottom line. I checked in at 10pm and was greeted warmly by the front desk person. She told me to make sure to go around the corner, as there was fresh popcorn and a pop machine available at no extra cost. Brought this snack up to my room and watched a movie on the large flat screen before I went to bed. 

A lot of hotels add the word suites to their name, but Drury truly has one. A large sitting area that has it's own flat screen, with a kitchen between the well designed bedroom area. 

Oh and to cap it off, no one has a better free breakfast, as the eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, plus everything else you would typically find were top-notch. Oh and the woman working the breakfast had a friendly attitude that energized you in the morning like their strong coffee. 

This was my 2nd time staying here and it will be my go-to every time I stay in the Paducah area!

Text: I love staying here. They are extremely friendly and are a bargain with their breakfast AND dinner meals included. They are also pet friendly while staying clean and respectable. I stay here whenever I come to Paducah!

Text: This place was awesome. It was clean, friendly, served a light dinner, warm breakfast, room was large and clean.  It was quiet.  We travel this way twice a year and have made a note to stay here every time.

Text: Very nice hotel. Comfortable beds. Clean rooms with nice separate area to watch TV. Friendly, helpful staff. Decent breakfast and evening "snack" (was more like dinner the night we were there - tacos). Many families stay there, but we had no problem whatsoever with noise.

My only minor "complaint" is that the pool is pretty small and was jam packed with all the families that were there when we were. Not really an issue, but something to keep in mind if staying there during peak summer vacation time.

Text: I have nothing but good things to say about our stay!  The staff was super friendly....every one we met. The FREE hot breakfast and dinner was delicious. The kids enjoyed the free popcorn and soft drinks in the evening. The building is secure and you feel very safe staying there. Everything was clean and nice. Having a separate living area was so great and made our room even more comfortable. I would highly recommend to anyone and I will be looking for a Drury Suites whenever I book now!
