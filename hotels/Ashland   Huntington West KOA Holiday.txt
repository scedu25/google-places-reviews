Ashland / Huntington West KOA Holiday
Rating: 1
Text: I have always spent Halloween at a KOA Campground. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had! The owners were extremely rude. They have a rule that children over 12 are not allowed to trick or treat, then interrogated my daughter, who was of age according to their rules, for several minutes about how old she actually was before handing out candy to her. They refused candy to a special needs boy because he was over the age, even though his mentality was not. I witnessed them literally holding the candy away from him!! This surely isn't how KOA would want to be represented. There are closer KOA'S from this one, for those looking for a great camping experience.

Text: My grandfather and I camp here and we love the fact that there is a little convenient store in case we forget something. We are looking forward to coming back next year for their camp and jam.

Text: Very friendly staff. We used their dump station but the facilities look nice and wouldn't hesitate to stay here. They have a nice small dog park for your four legged friends to stretch their legs.

Text: It was the best experience I've ever had at a campground. The owner was extremely nice and personable. The cabin was very clean and it contained fresh smelling towels and blankets. I would stay here over a hotel any day. It has two playgrounds. And, this KOA is part of the Tents for Troops network which donates camping sites to military servicemembers and retirees. I'll stay here again.
