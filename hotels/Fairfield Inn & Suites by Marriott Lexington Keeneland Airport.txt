Text: Nice hotel. Very clean and new looking. The staff is very friendly and the free breakfast is awesome! This morning they had eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruit, oatmeal and lots more! It is where I stay through the week when I'm working in Lexington.

Text: Very friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Breakfast wasn't great, but not terrible. The best part about breakfast was the waffle maker. The room was very comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well. Comfortable beds, with a mix of firm and soft pillows.
