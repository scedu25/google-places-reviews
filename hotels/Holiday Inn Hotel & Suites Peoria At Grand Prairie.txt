Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Peoria At Grand Prairie
Rating: 5
Text: My husband, coworker and I stayed at the new Holiday Inn & Suites in Peoria, IL for the last two nights for a corporate meeting we were attending, and we loved it so much that I wanted to write a review — something I rarely do, unless I feel compelled to do so. Well, this was one of those times. I was beyond  impressed! It had been a very long time since we had stayed at a Holiday Inn, and believe me when I tell you that this is not your daddy’s Holiday Inn! It was brand-new and very well-appointed, impeccably clean, and had everything you could want — from a fun (and inexpensive) pretty hip little bar, a fabulous lounge area complete with fireplace and current magazines, and a great convenience area. Our room was, like the rest of the hotel, immaculate and well-decorated, and once again they had thought of everything we could have wanted or needed in the room. And, finally, the staff was sharp, friendly and knowledgeable! From someone who has stayed at hotels such as The Four Seasons and the Ritz, I’m telling you this was an awesome experience for the very reasonable price!

Text: Clean and very upscale rooms. The staff here are absolutely amazing. I've spent a lot of time in hotels and this Holiday Inn has some of the best. Front desk is always friendly and attentive. Housekeeping does a great job especially handling random requests. Coffee in the lobby is wonderful as well. The restaurant inside the hotel is out of this world! You have to try the fried strawberries! Breakfast isnt included but it's very reasonable and so delicious. The Eggs Benedict is my go to when staying here. The hotel bar has a great selection of draft and bottled beers as well as some specialty mixed drinks. Bartender is probably one of the nicest people I've met.

Text: Very impressed with this hotel. The service is at the same level as any 5 star hotel. Excellent food for multiple meals. It is easy to see management has a great attention to detail. Hope there is a reason to return in the future.

Text: The staff are absolutely  fantastic, they went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. From housekeeping to management I cannot say one negative thing. The hotel itself is nicely designed, the rooms are roomy, clean. Hardwood floors, large bathrooms, and comfortable  beds. The food is great. The location is great for all your needs;  dining, shopping,and just three minutes from the Louisville Slugger Sports Complex which is also beautifully designed.  We plan on staying here again when in Peoria and would definitely  recommend the hotel to everyone.
