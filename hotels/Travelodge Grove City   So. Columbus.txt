Travelodge Grove City / So. Columbus
Rating: 4
Text: Nice and simple hotel for a short stay. The room was clean however it costs extra for room cleaning. The Travelodge is in a good location close to the freeway. Overall a good stay with the exception of thin walls.

Text: From coast to coast over the last decade and a half of travels and experiences... hands down the best long term relationship with the owner and staff at this establishment.  Attention to detail, return investment into upkeep and improvement, no expense spared on security and consistency.  It's an experience you can't rate or gauge with price, though the prices are as fair as they get as well.

Text: Staff was awesome. Room was better than expected. I've spent a few nights here. Just be careful booking online because they get double booked that way.

Text: Brand new carpet. This place does not deserve any of the less than 4-5 star ratings it should get. I was more than pleased with the staff, service, rooms, & breakfast. Manager would have done whatever it took to please us. I will recommend this hotel and stay there again.
