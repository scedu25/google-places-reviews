Text: Small quiet place. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it. Room was clean and the gentleman was friendly and trust worthy. Would stay there again.

Text: Hidden gem between Kearney and Grand island and cheaper than the rest. Owner is very relaxed/ flexible and everything has a small town feeling. The room was very clean and gave more than some of the motels in the previous mentioned cities, our room had a mini fridge and a spare single bed.

Text: I had a reservation but arrived earlier than expected. I called the owner and he said "pick a room, we can settle up later". Very economical, extremely friendly owner, nice place .
