Pony Express RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice staff, clean campground, lots of permanent sites but not permanent livers, and sites are very much in order.  Very flexible and accommodating to campsite visitors   Sites could be a bit more level, but all full hookups at each site are great.   Bathhouse and laundry was clean, Ice, Drinks, and firewood available at the store very reasonably priced.  Just a small ways off I35 if your headed north of KC.

Text: This is a great little campground if you are in the area. The woman who runs the place is very friendly and accommodating.  The sites are full hookup and reasonably easy to get in and out of.  They have some animals that are entertaining to see. It seems like quite a few campers may park there for longer periods and spend weekends there, but we were just there for one night. Clean restrooms with nice showers. Great experience.
