Residence Inn by Marriott Lexington Keeneland/Airport

Text: We didn't stay overnight, but our other family members did. My review is about the conference room we used, as well as the lobby. They were both very clean and comfy, and the workers were all very friendly and helpful, even late into the night. We didn't end up leaving the lobby until about 1am, and they didn't hassle us at all. Next time we're in Lexington again, we'll definitely have to stay here.

Text: We got a room here because we wanted to be able to make some food during our trip but we didn't know that there wouldn't be an oven and that the stove would just be two burners set up in a way that a larger pot wouldn't fit alongside a smaller one. Other than that, the breakfasts provided were good. Our room was nice. The staff were friendly. We enjoyed the pool and the hot tub. Parking was relatively convenient for us because our room was near the side door.

Text: The location was perfect! It is near everything to do in Lexington. The woman at the desk, Miranda, was so sweet and helpful!

Text: Very clean and upper class looking. Had a home feel to it despite it simply being a hotel. Suite had a fireplace, full kitchen, nice bathroom, and big bed. The colors made it feel warm and inviting. A+

Text: Stay here frequently when in town for business.  Corporate rates are reasonable.  Two burner cooktops in each room.  Pots, pans and dishes are supplied. There is a pool and hot tub.  There is a gas grill available if you want to cook outside.  They do have dinner for residents Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  The menu changes daily.  Food, soft drinks, beer and wine are provided.  They have a small store on site for essentials.  Amazing staff on site.
