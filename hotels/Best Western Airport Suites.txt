Text: Nice clean hotel. Close to downtown, airport and areas we needed to access.  No frills hotel but safe and comfortable for my family. Breakfast was just what we needed;hot items. Quick and easy.

Text: Room was spacious and clean but lacking in the details. Neither TV remote had working batteries. Was informed rudely that we don't have any. Had to go back down and ask for shampoo & conditioner because house keeping left 2 body lotions instead. Could have called the front desk if the phone worked. If you like the room cool forget it. The AC unit is locked behind a door and is set at almost comfortable. I know most places don't offer soft water' but this place offers sand blasting. Tons of amenities that need to be fixed. Breakfast was surprisingly good. Not great but good.

Text: This hotel is located close to the freeway so it's easy to get around from. the hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are nice but not overly fancy. The bed is comfortable and it has a separate little seating area with a couch and a television. The breakfast is okay but you have to remember you get what you pay for.

Text: The room was clean and a nice setup. The second latch on the door was almost broken off, which didn't encourage feelings of safety. The breakfast was okay, adequate with hot coffee but nothing special. The TV had only low-definition channels and the remote was not working well. The bed was hard and the pillows were flat. If you just need to sleep and don't need a fancy bed, the room is clean. If you want a more comfortable stay, it probably isn't the best spot.
