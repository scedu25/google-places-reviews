Text: Very good place for its price. Large rooms , comfy beds. My room had the sink outside the toilet/shower area which is a plus for its convience getting ready in the morning. Don't expect hot breakfast. Although it's free its only bread, waffles, cereal and yogurt. No hot breakfast. Perfect location as its within walking distance of different eateries including STARBUCKS!

Text: Desk staff not friendly.  I had a non smoking room but the entire hotel on the first floor smelled like smoke.  There was a fight in the very early morning hours and couldn't sleep.   Someone did call the police but couldn't sleep the rest of the night.  I was traveling with a group of ladies and headed to an event that we paid to attend.  No sleep so missed out on something we paid for.  Also had a roach in the bathroom on the shower wall.

Text: There are a lot of restaurants near the hotel. The hotel itself does not look like much from the outside. The rooms are average in size to other hotels but the whole hotel smells like cigarettes even in the non smoking area. Otherwise, not to bad.

Text: The property is located in the middle of so many places to shop and dine at.  The rooms are nicely appointed and I loved the indoor pool and breakfast room.  Noreen, the front desk clerk was friendly, cheerful and helpful with information on places to see and things to do. I will be back!
