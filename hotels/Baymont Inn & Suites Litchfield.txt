Text: Very nice room. Plenty of room, amenities were all there. I had a dog with and he found no issues with the room either. When something is not fresh or not clean he seeks it out and i usually pay attention to what he finds. The staff was friendly and helpful. 4 stars instead of 5 only because the "free" breakfast was a little on the slim side. It was all warm, prepared correctly and covered most of the normal breakfast items but it appeared there was only warmed up premade items - an example - no bacon, fresh eggs etc. The eggs were premade patties I assume you have with a biscuit etc. We will stay here again, but I will be more realistic about exceptions for breakfast.

Text: This hotel is clean and comfortable, with friendly, helpful staff; but the rooms,while comfortable,  could be a bit more spacious (the reason that I rated it four stars instead of five).  The desk clerk was able to direct us to an excellent restaurant on historic Route 66, and the complimentary breakfast was very good.
