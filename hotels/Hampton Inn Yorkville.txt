Text: Great customer service! We have booked a large room block for our upcoming wedding - for all our family and friends. Myself and my bridesmaids are getting ready in the Bridal Suite,  I showed up one day in hopes to see it, and Leah at the front desk was wonderful! She helped us to understand what brides have done in the past in regards to step up, as well as helped us to work with the remainder of our guests at the hotel. This Hampton Inn could use a little up date, however it does not feel old and dingy. Very excited to get ready there with all my friends.

Text: Great customer service. Gave only 3 stars because they said our room would be ready at a certain time and it's been 30 min and our room is still not ready. Don't tell people a certain time then tell me it's still not ready.

Text: I attended an open house in the banquet room. The room was a perfect fit for about 60 people, food, and photo booth. We had a fabulous time. The hotel staff was very friendly including allowing us to use thier refrigerator for the duration of the day. I highly recommend hosting an event here in the future.

Text: Stayed at this hotel as part of a wedding party. We booked last minute and they still had rooms available. The prices are a tad expensive, but it is a nicer hotel. The hotel has a water softener, which is a plus to not have to deal with hard water (if you're used to the difference). Shower head was a little crummy, and the air conditioner was a bit noisey, but overall a nice stay.
