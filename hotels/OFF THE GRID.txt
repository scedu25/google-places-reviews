OFF THE GRID

Text: The owner is goofy as hell. He's this tall, lanky guy with sallow skin and a haunting hundred yard stare. 

He has an abnormally long torso and the odd gait of a mortician. One hes not doubt developed over the years due to his need to approach people silently, as not to horrify them with his on coming looks.

He's kept looking at our dogs with love in eyes, not man loves Connecticut love either. 

It is nice and secluded, and as long as his wife is with him, the owner seems to stay in line, staring lustily at squirrels and talking about mushrooms.
