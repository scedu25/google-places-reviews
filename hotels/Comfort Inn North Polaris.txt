Text: Rooms are very clean and nice. Pool and hot tub very clean and we'll kept. Breakfast was actually pretty good too. 
Vending machines could have had better choices. But many stores and restaurants in the area

Text: The guest service phenomenal. From pre-booking the reservation to check out, everyone we interacted with was great. We were there with a large group for a wedding and they're very accommodating. The breakfast and pool hours were great. Each lasted a little longer than your typical time range. Breakfast was delicious and everyone in my family with happy with it. The containers were constantly being refilled so it was never empty. The rooms were clean and the bed and sheets were very comfortable. We all slept great. There were a few little things here and there that I didn't like, but the main reason I'm giving the hotel 4 stars instead of a perfect 5 is that we discovered mold in and around the windows of my room. We didn't notice it until we were packing up so we didn't look at the other rooms our group were in. Before you read the remaining list of my "cons", understand that I know these are petty, just small things I think that would have made the visit better. Shower heads: I'm pretty tall and the shower head couldn't be adjusted, so it was kind of annoying to have it shooting at my stomach without kneeling over. Pool and towels: The towels supplied at the pool were too small. Needed 3-4 to just dry myself off. Pool temp was a little cold for an indoor pool. My kids were in for a few seconds and were done. Couldn't get used to the temp. Room amenities: My coffee pot was missing so I couldn't make coffee in my room. I probably could have asked for one, but wasn't in any dire need of coffee. I just walked out to the lobby and filled up at one of their pumps that were kept filled at all times. I booked a room with a fridge so we could store my baby's food and bottles, but there was no fridge. Used our cooler and ice from the machine.

Text: Staff were polite. Rooms were nice and beds were soft. Shower was melt-your-face-off hot if on full blast. There was a bit of noise in the night as it is near a lot in the city but it quiets down. Overall great stay.
