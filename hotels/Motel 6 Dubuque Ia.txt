Motel 6 Dubuque Ia

Text: The room was nice and clean. My only complaint is the shower. We were in an "accessible" room. The shower was nice sized. It had what looked a piece of weather stripping across the shower entry, presumably to keep the water in. However, the curtain rod was on that bows out to accommodate larger people. This cause the curtain to hang out past the weather stripping. Consequently, the floor became very wet when we took a shower. The tile floor was very slick when it was wet.

Text: This was one of the worst Motel 6's I've ever stayed at. The room smelled of cigarette smoke, the sheets had cigarette burn holes (it was a non-smoking room), and there was actual garbage on the vanity. Definitely not worth the money, felt cheated.

Text: The light for the sink was super dim, the toilet would constintly fill, even after I checked it and it looked normal, there we electrical wires sticking out of outlet covers, cheap, extension cords were used for light, tv, and fridge. The sinks pressure was either little or full blast spray. The windowsill had dirt and dead bugs on it. The top blanket for the bed was thin and crunchy feeling.

Text: Floors were filthy.  Wiped up water on floor and towell was black.  How hard is it to get housekeeping to mop the floors?
I've noticed on good reviews the owner responds, but not a peep with the bad reviews.  Must not care!

Text: I booked my stay through the Motel 6 website. On the website they advertised internet is available for 1.00. I get there and they say internet is 3.99. I asked why and they said they had upgraded there systems the website just hadn't updated the price. I unfortunately paid it because I needed internet for some things I was doing. Due to false advertising I will defintely not stay at this Motel 6 again.
