Text: Hotel personnel were very courteous and helpful when calling to make reservations a few hours before arrival. The room was very clean and inviting with great amenities: coffee maker, microwave and frig. Nice large TV with cable. The bathroom was fully stocked with necessities and luscious towels. Bed mattress was extremely comfy with a wonderful assortment of pillows to choose from. No backaches or neckaches while sleeping! Hotel hot breakfast was very good with lots of variety and was kept well stocked! Would recommend and will stay there again if a journey takes us through the area again!
