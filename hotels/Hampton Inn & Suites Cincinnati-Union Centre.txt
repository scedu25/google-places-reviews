Rating: 4
Text: Staff was excellent. Friendly, efficient and very helpful. Location very convenient to many locations. Cleanliness of our room could have been better, but still good.

Text: Easy to get to location right off the interstate with lots of shopping and food nearby. The staff at check-in was great and the breakfast staff was friendly and accommodating and kept the food full. The rooms were very clean. They had an indoor pool, but I did not use it. The only thing I can say negative would be that the interstate was able to be heard from the room.

Text: Perfect for business travel. Nice and clean. Lots of chain restaurants nearby. Not the most interesting neighborhood, but plenty of the usual options

Text: Stayed at Hampton Inn & Suites Cincinnati-Union to shop at IKEA next day. Late check-in was not a hassle. Room and bathroom looked very nice and clean. One of the beds was extremely squeaky, and every one of the pillows was way too soft, vent in bathroom didn't seem to work and shower curtain was a little too short. But these were the only negatives. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty. Shower was fine.
