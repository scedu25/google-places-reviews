Text: Lovely spacious place, I really like the hardwood floor, since my allergy to dust, it's hard to find places like this this days. Very home welcome feeling while staying here.
If you ever come by the town and staying for few days, the downtown here might not be like other places, but if you are seeking peacefulness, having the sense of a quiet downtown, with it's beautiful historical buildings, and the street lights. While during the day time there are many historical places to visit.
Most of it, the owner is very friendly and helpful during our visit, makes everything so much easier.
