Text: Lady was rude and is procrastinating on getting my cousin her refund for her lot rent after my cousin sold the trailer. The campground allowed new ownership to move on and never in formed my cousin prior. Now the owner of the campground is saying they have to wait for things to clear. Our family has a reunion there every year, thinking of asking a change of location with all the problems.
