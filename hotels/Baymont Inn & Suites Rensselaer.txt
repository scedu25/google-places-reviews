Text: Front desk service was courteous, helpful, and patient. Our room was perfectly clean. The linens were all in good shape. Heated outdoor pool was perfect for our family. Shallow only, went up to 5'. Breakfast was fresh and the pancake machine was a hit. Just press a button and yep little pancakes room out on a conveyor belt. Lovely hotel. Would stay again.
