AmericInn Hotel & Suites Indianapolis NE
Rating: 5
Text: I like the rooms at the American Hotel and Suites there were large air conditioned and comfortable. the bathroom came with a washcloth swan. Super classy :-). It also had a jacuzzi and a decent-sized pool. The breakfast was decent. I would say good but I didn't like the fact that it ended at 9:30. The food was tasty but was definitely the store bought brand similarly to Tussin brand of Robitussin. :-) they gave me late check-out like super late check-out it was awesome. Totally go check this place out never go to the Red Roof Inn Indianapolis Airport. Ever.

Text: The suite itself was clean but the tub was not. Staff was friendly, there is pool and hot tub, the decor seems a little run down. Great prices for the area.

Text: Nice hotel with low-carb breakfast options, which is important to me. Common areas could use carpet cleaning, but everything else was great. 

We splurged and rented the executive suite, which includes a two-person Jacuzzi tub. Very nice room with a living room, dining area, and huge bathroom. There is a TV in the bedroom and another in the living room. Dining area has a mini fridge, microwave, and sink.

Text: Our room is clean, and the bathroom is spacious. From the name of the hotel, I thought it would have a kitchenette, but we only have a small fridge, microwave and coffee pot. Stag have been friendly and helpful. Area seems safe with lots of restaurants close by.
