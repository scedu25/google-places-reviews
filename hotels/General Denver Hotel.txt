General Denver Hotel

Text: From the Hotel to the food you'll be happy you picked the General Denver! The beds are great and the pillows are awesome! I love that its downtown and you can cruise around and explore. We ate and drank at their bar restaurant both days. Everything we had was wonderful and exceeded my expectations.

Text: Great food and atmosphere. The staff is wonderful, the bar is one of the best in the state for beer selection. Live music is also pretty good. I've been a dozen times, never been disappointed. Best brunch in Ohio, IMHO.

Text: Great atmosphere and fantastic food.  Service is always good and there's a good selection of draft beer that is rotated regularly.  My wife and I also stayed at the hotel and accommodations were perfect for our needs and budget plus brunch was provided.  Highly recommend

Text: The rooms are nice and cozy with antique decor. The staff is friendly and helpful (offered directions around local construction and helped find parking when it was busy downtown). The attached restaurant is great and the included breakfast is the best I've seen for the price.

Text: Went for lunch and had a ceasar salad w/chicken and a craft beer. Friendly efficient service with good food at reasonable plus pricing. Historic ambiance made experience even better. Went through a few different wait staff but totally seamless.
