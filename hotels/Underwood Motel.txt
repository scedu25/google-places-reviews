Underwood Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I spend 100 nights a year in motels.  I work on a budget, so I'm always looking to spend less for a bed.  The Underwood is a real treat, because for $20 or $30 less then I often must pay, I got a great, clean room with a nice desk & chair.  I hope to find myself near here when night finds me on the road again.  The staff is great, too!

Text: The Underwood Motel was a nice stop for a comfortable rest.  Initially, I didn't think it was going to be as nice because of the low price for a room But to my suprise Oh What a Wonderful Night!!!  I highly reccomend it!!!

Text: New manager is really improving the place! I've been here two years And the new management is really helpful and their maintenance man is always happy to help and knows how to fix just about anything I came here for a place to stay but what makes me keep coming back is how nice everybody is and how well they treat everybody.
