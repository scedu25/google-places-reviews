Super 8 Pontiac

Text: Very comfortable, very clean, very safe, very friendly. Easy to get to with plenty of parking. A good bargain for the traveler seeking a good night's sleep. I especially liked waking you up to see the corn fields. Pleasant Midwest farm country views. I will be back.

Text: It's a nice hotel. Everything is exactly as I expected it to be. The staff is really nice and they had a good breakfast.

Text: Decent place to rest your head for a night or two in the area.  Although the motel claims to be non-smoking and you having to sign a form saying you will not smoke there was definitely smoking going on down the hall.  Our allergies were set off by something in the room , the room had a stale smell.  The full bed was firm and clean. The toilet seat was not clean and I had to clean it off myself - GROSS! The water pressure was abysmal as the water is super hard and the shower head had NEVER been cleaned.  The breakfast was very basic.  Expect to hear diesel trucks running their engines most of the night.   The furniture was over-sized for the size of the room and arranged very awkwardly.
