Text: The staff are friendly, helpful and courteous. Rooms are more like apartments with a kitchenette, lounge area, eating area, and workspace. Hotel provided shuttle twice a week to Wal-Mart is great to stock up on snacks, drinks, or other needs for longer stays, and there are most necessities and some food available for purchase at the convinience area.
