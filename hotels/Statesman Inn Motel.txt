Statesman Inn Motel

Text: Good, cheap, friendly and simple. You'll appreciate a place like this when your driving  around at 3am looking for a place to stay that isn't fully booked. Close to the road so its a bit noisy but earplugs'll solve that.

Text: While they've resolved the roach problem the sheets, mattress and boxspring had blood splatter stains. The sheets also had many burn holes. The tubs have been painted and are peeling.

Text: Value priced, close to campus, but far from most shopping. The demographic may leave something to be desired.

Text: I would Give this place a Negative 5 if I could. The rooms smelled moldy, the sheets were stained and dirty, the matress looked like it had been drugged thru the mud. Really low water Pressure.
