Radisson Hotel at The University of Toledo

Text: The atmosphere was great. Love the feeling of luxury for an affordable price. The staff was so friendly and helpful...even offered late check out with the already generous non checkout. The pool and hot tub was very nice after a long drive. The pool is larger then most hotel pools. We used the exercise room which was pleasantly cooled! Utilized their private work room and sitting areas too. Near 3 Catholic church's too! Definately a great stay for 10 min. Off the I-80.

Text: Very comfortable room. I enjoyed my stay the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The location has ample parking. It can be a little hard to find in the dark but it was probably just my gps. If you are attending something at UT then it would be perfect. I also ate at the restaurant and the food was excellent as well as the service.

Text: For a couple hundred person conference, it was a nice facility. Good meeting rooms, friendly people and decent food. A bit of a maze, but manageable.

Text: Everything went smooth and the place was wonderful. our check in attendant was fabulous, friendly, and personable. The conference room was good for what we needed. Lunch at the 31Hundred was so delicious and the chef came to check on us. The kids loved the pool!! My only negatives are at reservation and at check in I was not informed of an "occupancy tax" and fans in the bathroom would have put this place over the top.
