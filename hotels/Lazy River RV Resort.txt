Lazy River RV Resort

Text: My wife and I started coming to Lazy K about 4 years ago to be with the grandkids. It immediately won our affection because it was so friendly and peaceful. So when a camper came up for sale here we decided to buy it and take up residence. We have never regretted that decision. The camp manager always goes over and above what his job duties require and has helped me multiple times with camper issues without charge (well, maybe a bowl of ice cream or two).  Contrary to a couple other negative posts I have never witnessed any ill-will or discrimination towards any group of people here. It is a family friendly environment and the campers here respect that AND protect that. Our camper is located right next to one the cabins for rent and one weekend a bi-racial couple from St Louis were our neighbors. After talking with the young man for some time he finally told me that they have camped in several parks around the area and this was the first one they had stayed at where they felt "safe and comfortable."  And that is what Lazy K Campground is...safe and comfortable. I would highly recommend this campground to anyone I meet no matter what flavor they are.
