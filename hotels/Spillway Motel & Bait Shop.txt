Spillway Motel & Bait Shop
Rating: 1
Text: Worst motel I've ever stayed in. Floors were falling apart and caving in, smelt like dead mice in the walls, stains on the carpets couch walls pillow cases and ceiling. Closet had the kitchen table mashed into it, but no chairs. Water color was a dark yellow, lots of flies in the room. All the trim/molding was rotten and falling apart. Front door didn't lock and was large gaps that allowed bugs to get into the room. I slept for 30 minutes and left to go sleep in the truck, I'd never come back and advise you to spend the extra 25 dollars to go into town. Hands down the nastiest place I've ever been

Text: The motel is right next the the spillway from the Shelbyville lake to the Kaskaskia river, a nice view for sure. The rooms we have been in are pretty decent, a couple of issues but nothing to complain to the manager about. So far it has been a decent stay, we still have about a week left.

Text: Absolutely horrible. Unfortunately I trusted the reviews saying this place had been remodeled.  I will not stay here again, dead bugs under covers. Not cleaned between guests, yes I have proof. Overall it has the appearance of the motels you see in low budget horror movies. Would have asked for refund and left had it not been nearly midnight  by the time I realized my mistake.

Text: Good for a short stay. Stores, fishing and restaurants close by. Rooms on the right side are crappy but cheaper. You get what you pay for though.
