Text: It was a little tricky to get to, but the location setting was very nice. Service was top notch. They have a very nice selection of food and drinks. Along with it being delicious of course. The golf course looked very well maintained. We will be back to play and dine in the future.

Text: Fantastic meal. Everything was phenomenal. One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. A bit hard to find the place without GPS.

Text: Standard golf club menu. Service was friendly but slow. Food tasted good but mostly because it wasn't attempting to be healthy.
