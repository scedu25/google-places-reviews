Text: This hotel was great! The owner greeted me and was very professional. The room was clean and well stocked. I felt safe and secure staying there. The owner watches all vehicles that come in and out and approaches people he knows that are not staying. The one thing I would change would be the bedding. I toss and turn a lot at night and the fitted sheet fell off a few times. Other than that, it was great! Might be a bit outdated, but the price was perfect and it exceeded my expectations. Thank you for a great stay!

Text: Rusty water from shower. Hard beds, room was dusty, carpet borders havent been vaccuumed in quite some time, thin walls. They triple plus the room rate for ND games. Not worth $60 a night moreless 225.

Text: It was a good place to for a quick overnight stay. They had rooms for people who didn't deserve in advance, late at night. The only thing was that they didn't have a microwave.

Text: Never again...Ughhh its really gross, and the bedding is even worse. Waste of money, I need to be more aware when booking at the last minute.
