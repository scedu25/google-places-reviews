Wild Boar Ridge Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Campground is really nice. Each site has a lamp post for your latern, picnic table, fire ring, a covered type shelf for keeping supplies off the ground and dry, and level cleared tent pitching area that would accommodate roughly a 12'x12' tent. Fresh water spouts are plenty and right along the drive that goes through the campground. Bathroom facilities are plenty with one or two newer bathrooms in the camp area. If you come before memorial day the beach area is closed and that is where the shower facilities are. When I say closed, I mean there is a gate across the road to get to the area. Also firewood vendors are not easy to locate, so make sure you find where they are before you get there and save their location as a way point in your GPS if you use one. Cell service is almost non existent,  ( using Verizon) which is fine with us but if you have to Google a location to get directions, it isn't going to happen. Mark all way points before getting out there in your GPS. Great place, family, kids, dogs.

Text: Quite campground just above the 475 acre Enough Lake. Lots of sites for tent or hammock camping. None of the sites have electricity but there are numerous frost free water faucets. There are vaulted toilets spread throughout too. Showers are available on a seasonal basis by the beach. There is a trail from the campground that connects to a 12 mile loop around the lake, which is good for hiking and mountain biking. The 12 mile lake loop has a connector trail to the Trace Creek section of the Ozark Trail. There is good fishing in the lake and it has a motor limit of 9.9 HP. The lake is also good for canoeing and swimming.

Text: Good campground for a night of camping. No attendant at the campground, you just leave the payment in an envelope.
From the end of the campground you can catch a 12-mile trail around the lake. It is a good 5 hour hike, including stops.
