Homewood Suites by Hilton Detroit -Troy

Text: It was a nice place, and the staff was friendly and greeted me whenever I passed them in the halls. The biggest issue was that the "no smoking" rule was not strongly enforced. There were people smoking right outside the entrance, in front of the sign that said specifically not to smoke by the entrance.

Text: My husband and I were matched at the last minute with a mother to adopt our baby girl. We chose to stay at this hotel, and we could not be more grateful to the staff! The room was amazing and perfect for us as we adjusted to having a new child in a city far from home. We were treated super kindly by everyone at the hotel. The staff accommodated our changing needs and were quick to bring us any items we needed in our room. We even had staff members volunteer help unsolicited which was incredibly kind. And we were floored when the staff delivered a gift basket to our room for our daughter congratulating us on our little miracle. The stay in this wonderful hotel has altered our view of what hotel stays can be like forever. And in the future anytime we need to travel, we will certainly be looking for a nearby Homewood Suites. Because truly - no other hotel can compare!
