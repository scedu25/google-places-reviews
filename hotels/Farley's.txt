Text: A Charming place to stay! Beautifully restored building,  comfortable bedrooms with roomy bathrooms. We loved our two night stay. Great breakfasts. Carole spoilt us?. Especially our 6-yr old grand-daughter. Being on main street of a small country town was neat! I strongly recommend this B&B.

Text: This quaint B&B is one of the oldest houses in town that was just beautifully renovated. Carole oozes hospitality and is a wonderful cook. All of her food (breakfast, lunch, desserts) are made from scratch!

Text: d.basler   Farley's was absolutely lovely.  Our room was spacious, homey and tastefully decorated. I would rate it a 10 if I could. The food was delicious and the owners were eager to help us feel comfortable and at home. A special thank you for opening up your home for members of the McClean County 1975-1976 Girls Basketball Team that was inducted into Inaugural Hall of Fame. After the Banquet you allowed us to visit together and share memories and laughter. Thank you once again Carol & Louis Robertson, for a lovely home that was first class.????
