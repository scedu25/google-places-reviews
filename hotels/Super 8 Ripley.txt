Super 8 Ripley
Rating: 4
Text: Very easy place to stay.  I have never had an issue, rooms are clean, not the greatest smell when you walk in, but it's an older hotel but the staff really keeps up with it. Single rooms have a king size bed and I had no issues putting a Pack n Play and pet friendly. Continental breakfast and coffee is available in the morning as grab-n-go, if you tables are in the reception area or you can take it to your room.

Plenty of other amenities are within walking distance of the hotel. Gas stations, Mexican restaurant, fast-food, grocery store, ect...

Text: Room are clean but shower makes a shrill noise as the water runs through it the tile is crack in front of the tube and the shower floor  creaks as u move around in it ..the sink drain drains very slowly like it is half way plugged up. Most of the staff is nice .. very small parking lot for large trucks and have had to park on side of the road to park for the night only 3 trucks can get in it.

Text: This is one of the nicest Super 8s I've stayed in. It's clean, affordable, convenient and rather updated. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. You can tell they take pride in maintaining the hotel. If I am ever back in Ripley and need a place to stay, this will be my go to.
