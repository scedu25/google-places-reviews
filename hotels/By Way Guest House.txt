Text: It says they recently remodeled the place, but poor mechanics and early inefficient room design can't be easily fixed. The A.C. has been running regularly, but can't seem to pull humidity from the room.  No place to hang wash cloths and towels by the sink, and no counter space - you could get by as a single, but no way 2 can have items by the sink! Room is spacious, fridge is large and works. Mattress is not all that comfy. And, don't let them put you by the back door...your room door will rattle all night.

Text: The historic house was both interesting and beautiful and the owner graciously allowed a very early check-in time to accommodate our situation. The groceries provided for the do-it-yourself breakfast were generous. The bed mattress was adequate, but not deluxe. Everything was very clean and well kept. We would not hesitate to recommend this to family and friends.
