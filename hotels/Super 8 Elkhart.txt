Text: This started out to be a 4 star review. This hotel has nice rooms, Clean beds and Comfortable mattress's The only thing I could complain about is the bathroom sink and counter look like whoever installed them had no idea what they were doing. Don't let the lobby decor turn you off, the rooms are great. BUT... the customer service stinks. We were 5 minutes after the 9:00 end of breakfast when we walked in the dining room. I realize we were late but everything was still set up and people were still eating. We were going to grab a quick bowl of cereal when the manger jumped up from his breakfast and started throwing supplies in to the cupboards. A polite, I'm sorry the dining room is closed would have sufficed.  We felt we were given the bus rush. He babbled something but his English is none to inteligable. Too bad for them. We owns a vacation resort and we're scouting out hotels en to recommend to our clients. This one is no longer on the list. Customer Service is important to us.

Text: Great customer service. Mediocre accommodations. Rooms were clean and kinda updated. It's a good room for a cheap travel stop-over. Very pet friendly. Parking was an iasue as the small hotel was full. Did I mention GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Helped us out of a bad reservation at a hotel down the street. I'll put up with a lot for good, friendly employees.

Text: Great place. Cheryl restaurants nearby. Room was clean and slept well.  And actual truck parking. Not the pretend truck parking. 
Staff did a great job accommodating my needs.
