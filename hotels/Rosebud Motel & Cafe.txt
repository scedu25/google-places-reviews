Text: It was comfortable and cozy. Bathroom little small but this is a small town. Only issue I had is with the spiders but what is a person to expect by a crop field . Food in cafe was great.  If your ever out this way I recommend  this place...

Text: The staff is very friendly and the food is made fresh to order. It's an older cafe and is very nice.  Also on Fridays and Saturdays they're open 24hrs. There is gaming here. ?? There's also overnight semi parking. ?? It has a nice little motel in the back.  ?
