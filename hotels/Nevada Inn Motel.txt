Text: Low price, good clean beds, huge rooms.  The bathrooms were the biggest motel/hotel bathrooms I've ever seen.  Rooms have a mini fridge, microwave, and a large flat screen TV.  The only downside is that the rooms are a bit worn.  Overall, a good value.

Text: Cockroaches dirty towels front desk lady was rude. Mini frig didnt work. Pizza smeared down side of bed. This management should be canned I have been a maid at a few motels this place is a germ infested joke. Not the type to complain but after the front desk told us we were snooping after we went looking for coffee at 6am and there was five us needing towels and soap I'm done pissed off. You can stay at a nicer place for less I will never again come here. The rudeness and disquesting room rip off. Had my daughter and brother had to wear shoes in the shower and I'm not a clean freak. No effort vintage if you want tetnus shot OMG!

Text: Nasty rooms, rodents (mice & more) and management is very rude. Maid service never happened.  They prefer you clean you're own room.  We were there for, two weeks.  My husbands, job was there working construction for two weeks.  We had to change rooms.  Because of the rodents in our room. And other people that rented the same room. Also changed rooms right away.   The motels old.  But it's filthy dirty to.  I wouldn't ever stay there again. And I don't recommend anyone to stay in Nevada, Missouri at the Nevada Inn. My photo will show a snake coming out of my waistband. Of my brown slacks, on right side of the plastic container.  I was treated awfully bad after I confronted her about a snake in my clothes.  Never will I return there ever again.
