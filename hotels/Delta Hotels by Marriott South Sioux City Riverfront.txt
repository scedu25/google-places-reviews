Text: We were here for a family wedding and were so impressed by the hotel staffs friendliness (from check in, to the housekeepers, to the hotel bar staff, and the wonderful staff working the wedding). The entire hotel is newly remodeled with nice warm colors-truly amazing! Thank you for making our stay so wonderful, it was a great place to stay and enjoy the weekend with family! 
We will definitely be back!

Text: I recently stayed at the Marina Inn for the Nebraska District Optimist Convention. This is the 3rd time our organization hosted a conference here that I have been in attendance. Past experiences have been pleasurable and this was too except the hotel is currently in the process of remodeling to become a Delta Hotel by Marriott. As with any construction project there are some pitfalls to be expected. I had a king room that had been just finished and it was a sleek, clean room. Other attendees had rooms that were missing room numbers and desk chair so things were not completely guest ready. The staff was very apologetic for the inconveniences the construction caused but very attentive and professional. The front desk clerks at check in and checkout were most helpful explaining all features and amenities. Checking in and out was a breeze. The review garners four stars only because of the construction, once the construction is complete the hotel will be five stars.

Text: The rooms were excellent. I must start of with the beds as they were super comfortable and plush. The bathroom was spacious and had a comfortable lay out. Not much in the near vicinity of the hotel but there is a Hard Rock Cafe that would be walkable on a nice sunny day.

Text: Stayed here one night on our weekend getaway. Wished we would have just stayed here both nights. We dined at the restaurant and dropped a little over $100 on two meals with drinks and desserts. Wanting to try something I don't usually get I ordered the tuna. OMG what an explosion of flavor. After dinner we headed to the outside pool. Water was clear and clean. Plenty of towels we're provided at the pool. Sleep came easy. The beds we're comfortable. The only negative would be half the cable channels did not work. Overall it was a pleasant stay. Worth the money.

Text: Wonderful hotel. Updated and nicely furnished. Dog friendly; inexpensive for Marriott standards. Service in the bar/restaurant was kinda slow, though.
