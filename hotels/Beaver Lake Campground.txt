Beaver Lake Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Small quiet (if guess 15-20 sites) campground is off of interstate 80 but pretty close.
$20 a night for water and electric (30 amp). Dump station near the entrance. In the middle of alot of farmland.
We would stay again. 
No activities small swingset to play on for children, if looking for that type of campground.

Bathrooms are a bit dated but were clean and functioning.

Text: There are 15 spaces with power and water for $20/night and the groundskeeper said we could pitch a tent by the playground for $15. We opted for the former simply because we wanted the picnic table and fire ring. The bathrooms could've been cleaner, there's no ventilation so mildew grows pretty quickly. There's a firing range nearby which was irritating. There were 3 camper trailers there that seemed to have been stopped there for months, giving the place a trailer park feel more than camp ground.
All we needed was a place to sleep and shower while driving cross country so this place fit the bill. There are no perks but we slept fine.

Text: Very simple, bare bones, basic campground.  No amenities, but the sites are spacious and the view is not too shabby.  This wasn't our first choice, but it turned out just fine and for the price I would definitely stay here again.
