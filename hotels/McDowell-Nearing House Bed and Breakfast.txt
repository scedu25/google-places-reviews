Text: My husband and I spent two days at McDowell's. This was our first bed and breakfast. Everything was absolutely wonderful! Ms.Jane was very hospitable. The room was cozy yet updated. Our breakfast was delicious! Ms.Jane is very knowledgeable about Muncie and gave suggestions on some things we may have wanted to see. Lastly, the location is great. It's on a main street and in close proximity to Ball State. If there is room here, we will no longer stay in a hotel in Muncie?. We will stay here. It was a great experience!

Text: My all time favorite B&B in Indiana. Close to Ball State, I pick this quaint B&B over a hotel, there is so much more on offer here.  The owners have made it a haven from the busy world, soft furnishings, a warm welcome and homemade breakfasts every morning.

I love this place! The innkeeper can recommend fun things to see and do in the area, and the best picks for dining.
