Text: I took my family to Char'd for lunch. The breakfast buffet was open until 2pm so we tried it. It was one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had. They had on demand omelets and waffles with a variety of toppings for the waffles. The whole family as pleased with the food. The service was great also.

Text: Incredible experience. Food was a little more than my comfort level needed. Just need one or two simple things for us simple folk. But it is not a reason to make me not go back. It was awesome.

Text: On  a corporate event, the staff at this location make you feel like you are the only guest there! They accommodate EVERYONE. The bar staff are highly educated on all brands they carry, and can educate even the most seasoned diners and drinkers. Nick and his team could not be more welcoming and hospitable. They all deserve recognition, if not a promotion! Thank you for making Louisville memorable from check in!

Text: Our family members are in Louisville for a wedding. This Marriott is wonderful, clean, quite, and the staff members are friendly and welcoming. Our breakfast experience in the Club  Lounge Room was excellent. Jennifer made our day start great.

Text: Internet was the absolute worst I've? ever experienced, and for a supposedly large city and decent chain! The room itself was fine- but the bathroom was absolutely unacceptable. I had to skip my shower for the lack of heated water. I suppose that the beds were fine, in that they were made. The  lack of hot water and internet means I will never stay at a Marriott in Kentucky ever again.
