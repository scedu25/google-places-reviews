Text: We had a very nice stay here. The employees were very friendly. Danielle( the lady at the front desk) was especially helpful. We were going to church with family on Sunday morning and needed an iron for a shirt, there wasn't one in the room, she stopped what she was doing to go find one for me. The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was adequate for our needs. Pool and hot tub were clean. All and all, would definitely stay here again.
