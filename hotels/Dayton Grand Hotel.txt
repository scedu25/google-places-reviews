Dayton Grand Hotel

Text: I booked a room in this hotel after looking at the images of what it USED to look like. I like old hotels with character but unfortunately this place has fallen into a rather sad state of disrepair. The parking deck is somewhat of a labyrinth with approximately two parking spots per floor (seriously). Upon arriving into the lobby I was greeted with a rather dungeonous space but I was willing to dismiss this due to the "renovations". So I rather optimistically checked in and and off we went to our room. The trip to the room felt a bit like urban exploring an abandoned building. Upon arrival to the room I began assessing the situation. At this time I realized neither the TV nor the air conditioning worked. I made the journey back down to the lobby to inquire about another room and was informed that the cable was out building wide and the AC is weak everywhere. The girl at the front desk was very nice, understanding, and asked if I'd like to check out (this is a regular occurrence there). I apologized and did so promptly.

Text: Booked room online for 7-24-16 stay. What sold me was the double tree name and the online photos. When we arrived late the building looked vacant, no cars in the parking deck. Makeshift registration desk was visible from outside while all doors where locked and entrance was unlit. Finally a sleepy, barefoot employee opened the door and let us in. Once inside I was stunned. One step above a crack house is the quickest way to explain it. The online pictures for this hotel are completely false. When I called double tree I got customer service in Central America - need I say more. Another call to Hilton was equally frustrating. Bottom line Hilton didn't seem to care either. Buyer beware, this is not a functioning hotel, avoid this place!

Text: Apparently the hotel has been under renovation for over 2 years and have NO amenities...like you literally can't even watch TV because there's no cable. The room was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been touched in well...2 years. Spots and stains on every upholstered surface and the room was dark and dank. Overall a big disappointment so much in fact that after about 15 minutes we went downstairs and cancelled the room and checked into a much nicer hotel nearby. They really need to update the website so you can get an accurate representation of what you're getting yourself into.

Text: The hotel is currently under renovation and boy does it need it. It has the smallest and strangest parking garage I've ever seen. The garage had a few spots per level and was very dark, plus I didn't see an elevator and the concrete for the stairs was sketchy. They didn't have my reservation, but I still secure a room. The floors creaked terribly in my room. There was a gaping hole in the bottom of the room door that they tried to cover up with a steel plate, but half the plates screws were out. The bed was sketchy and the bath looked like it was in demo mode. I slept in my cloths and left early, around 4am. A woman and a dog were sleeping in the lobby. It turned out to be the front desk person. The doors wouldn't open so we had to pry them open for me to get out.

Text: The worst customer experience I've ever received from a hotel. I called the Dayton grand (thinking I was planning in advance) fourth months in advance before my wedding to book a room.  When I initially called, the desk clerk advised they were remodeling and that I needed to call closer to my date and they could not book a room because the pricing would change. I told the clerk I wanted to stay at the Dayton grand regardless or price and they said to call back. I called two more additional time and received the same message, never once did someone ask to take my name and number. 
I called again 45 days out from my wedding and they said they were BOOKED. I called and spoke with the desk manager and she told me that they gave all of their rooms to a third party site and it wasn't their fault they booked. So a hotel had given all their rooms to other third party sites and you couldn't book a hotel room through their own site. 
Now, even though I thought I was planning in advance... thanks to the Dayton grand I have no where to stay the night of my wedding in the Dayton area as all other hotels are also booked this close in advance.
