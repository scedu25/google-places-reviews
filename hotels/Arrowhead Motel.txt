Arrowhead Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Love this place! Came to sight see the river town of Burlington and found Arrowhead Motel which is perfect because it's not a big chain hotel.  It's cute, clean,  and the hosts are very gracious.  We stayed in a kitchenette which was very nice and had everything we needed to cook a meal. We will stay here again!!
