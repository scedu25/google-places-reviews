Text: Fantastic hotel for concerts at Bankers Life Fieldhouse! Perfect accommodations, updates and big rooms, friendly staff and very short walk to the venue. Only complaint is the price... High due to sold out concert and the Monumental Marathon. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Text: The location was great for my work travel. There is a parking garage across the the street for around $14 a night. Service at the hotel was great. After a long day at work they made it more manageable with snacks on the house. The rooms were very high ceilings as well.

Text: My husband and I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff was always friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms were kept clean and stocked of toiletries. The beds were comfortable enough. I really liked the on-site restaurant. The made to order breakfasts were delicious every single day, and we stayed there Monday through Friday. Great location too, easy walking distance to so many great historical sites, shopping, museums, etc.
