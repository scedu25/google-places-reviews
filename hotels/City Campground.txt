Text: We had a great time.  folks Springleaf I might have her I would leave your big rug at home. The reproductive of the glass, also parking would be a premium you’re only allowed one vehicle on your site and you better not park it in on the grass.   leave your big rug and home, they are extremely protective of the glass,  !otherwise a great time there. we will go back !

Text: Stayed here in our fifthweel.  View cannot be any better of the Ohio river. Only reason for not giving a five is there is no sewer hookup.  However the camp host were very accommodating and there is a dump station on site. Camp hosts very friendly and willing to assist with your needs. Very close to downtown Madison. Restrooms need paint but are kept clean. Would stay here again without question.

Text: We have been staying in this campground 3-4 times per summer for years and love it. It is very quiet, relaxing and Burlyn the previous host was awesome. Can't been the view!
We are headed there soon and can then comment on current host as they have huge shoes to fill. Fingers crossed they are friendly and helpful as past.
Restrooms need updating as they have been basically same for years.

Text: Host took money for 4 nights but made bookkeeping error and made us move. Did give our money for one night back. Very unpleasant hostess! Very unpleasant!

Text: Love this place and going back again this year too which makes our 3rd. year in a row.
Historic Broadway Tavern has the best food for dining and fried green tomatoes are the bomb. Red Pepper is the place to be for pizza & pasta! 
Shop till you drop in Historic Madison, In.
