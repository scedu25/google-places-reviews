Ohio River House
Rating: 5
Text: The Ohio River house has the best view, and largest area to enjoy of waterfront property at a guesthouse in this area.The stay is peaceful, quiet, private, and the views are absolutely gorgeous. I found my space clean, well kept, renovated, and comfortable. 

I was there on holiday, but The River House would be a great place to attend or give a workshop for writers, painters, authors, designers, musicians, cooking classes, etc. There are generous amounts of space for gatherings, weddings, celebrations, photo sessions. Very impressive property. I'll be back.
