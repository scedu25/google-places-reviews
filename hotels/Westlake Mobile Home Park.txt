Text: It was a nice stay. No one bothered you and the neighbors are friendly. 
The laundry room is very clean and cheap. 1 washer 1 dryer and its $1 each. 

The rate is good to. 

I do wish they'd mow up by the campers while your staying there. Had to mow my own yard. If you ask, they'll do it, but it should just be done. 

The "office" isn't their office anymore. It's a time capsule. Neat but confusing. 

And the BIGGEST complaint. Bathrooms. If you're going to provide public restrooms CLEAN THEM. And put useful lighting up. The bathroom/shower room was so gross. 

I scrubbed the floor and walls in the shower to feel better about being in there.

Text: On July 31, 2017 those living at the park found notices stuck to their doors notifying them of a 12% rent increase on October 1, 2017, this park has no manager on site, the road is in deplorable condition, rutted out and causing damage to cars, old trees that should be removed, people parking wherever and blocking the road (if there was a fire or rescue the vehicles could not get through), if there's a tornado shelter, I've yet to find it, and the "adult community" I thought I bought a mobile home is no longer, at one point, there was a sex offender living in the park.
