Text: The staff at the front desk were kind and accommodating. Breakfast was edible but nothing to write home about. Rooms were spacious and well worth the fee. Clean and we'll stocked rooms. I love staying at the Hampton!!

Text: I was very surprised to come to this hotel and find that it was quality because I always thought this hotel was below average however, this hotel was excellent. Room was very clean, nice and up to date amenities as well as a soft bed. Overall four stars. The staff was accommodating and friendly. I know this sounds minor but that's important, I dislike bad customer service. I don't write reviews and especially for hotels. I use only four star hotels so there is a level of expectation but when I couldn't find that hotel in this area I had to result to this one and was pleasantly surprised. Also they charged me for a king and did not have one available when I got there so they upgraded me to this room so, I'm not sure how they all looked but this room was nice.

Text: Love the layout, it was the quietest stay at a hotel I have ever had!  And my room was across from the exercise room.  There was an actual nightlight in the bathroom, so enjoyed that over leaving the entire bathroom lighting on.  The bathroom itself was very up to date, and had a walk in shower, so prefer this to a bathtub. Also being 6 foot tall, hotel bathrooms never have tall enough shower heads, not this one.  It was over 7 feet tall and so luxurous to have the waterfall effect.   The hours for the pool and hot tub are excellent for the morning, would have liked to have made it later in evening, closed at 10 pm. I wasn't able to make it back to enjoy in the evening, but since it opened at 6 am, was still able to enjoy these ammenities.  Continental breakfast was better than any place I have ever had with multiple flavors of coffee to cut fresh fruit and fresh fruit in the skin.  There were so many extra perks, add ins for oatmeal and waffles.  

The bedding was luxurious and furniture including usb ports put the place very high on the list.  The only down side was the fact that the toilet was probably the shortest toilet I have even used in my life, it was approximately the size of a child's toilet.

Staff was super friendly, giving suggestions for entertainment and food.

Text: We have stayed here several times and the rooms are wonderful. Front desk staff are very professional and helpful. Both rooms were available early. Would not recommend having the breakfast.

Text: The room was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable and the room temperature was easy to control. We thought we had booked our room for two nights, but mistakenly only booked for one. When we went to the front desk to ask if we could extend our stay, the manager originally quoted us a fairly high rate, but eventually got it down to something more reasonable. That was incredibly appreciated.
