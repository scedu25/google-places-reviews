Text: Expectations met at the Illinois Bloomington West Hampton Inn.

We stayed at a pricey hotel in the middle of Minneapolis this week, and at this Hampton Inn on the way back home. The Hampton Inn was so much better for our needs. Yes, the Hampton staff did not wear ties and pant-suits, offer to valet parking our car,  and reserve a spot at the bar, but that's not what our family needs when we travel.

The staff were great. The room clean and ready when we arrived, the breakfast was decent and part of the cost of the room, and the WiFi was easy to sign on to.

We choose Hampton because we know what we will get when we arrive, and we're not making a hotel our destination. We book a hotel to allow us to sleep, shower, and breakfast before we do what we traveled to do.
