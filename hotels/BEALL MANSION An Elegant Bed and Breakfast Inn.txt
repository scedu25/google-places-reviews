BEALL MANSION An Elegant Bed and Breakfast Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We had our daughter's wedding here.  It is a wonderful elegant place for a small indoor wedding.  We had 60 guests, and it felt just right in the space. The staff was attentive, even changing some of the decor to match her colors.  The cake is included in the package, and is provided by Duke's bakery.  It was delicious.  We opted to have the string quartet play for a few hours, and Jim contracted with them for us.  We were able to plug in my daughters ipad and play through their sound system for the rest of the evening. We stayed in the rooms upstairs the night before and the night after.  It was so nice to be right on site and be able to prepare and recover right there.  I just felt like we were in this beautiful bubble for the weekend.  They made sure every detail was attended to.  I can't say enough good things about Jim and Sandy and their excellent staff.  I can't wait to go back for a visit.  We will always have lovely memories associated with this place.

Text: The Mansion is like coming into your own home, albeit the decor may be very different. I liked that there wasn't a welcoming staff when we arrived, although I imagine there normal is. Jim had called to welcome us and to say he and Sandy were shopping.  My friend and I appreciated the quiet and ease of our arrival.  We were able to take a look around, unpack and get acclimated at our on pace. There were instructions on how to reach the managers should we need them, but it felt more like coming home than arriving at a hotel. 
 The home is beautifully kept filled with exquisite antiques.  Jim will give a very informative tour and history of the mansion upon request. It is spotlessly clean and welcoming - with lights on in the public rooms at all times of day or night. The butler's pantry was open for snacks or coffee at all times as well.  And the bar with assorted chocolates available 24 hours a day was an added surprise.  The continental breakfast was great as was the jacuzzi bathtub with bath salts to maximize relaxation. 
They provided a list of local restaurants, their addresses and phone numbers to gel us get around with ease.  Jim and Sandy are excellent hosts - friendly, unassuming and always ready to make your stay more enjoyable.  I will definitely come back -  It is a peaceful haven I will never forget.

Text: Beautiful place. Owners are very friendly.  Wasn't even expecting the complementary bath robes to wear.  The whirlpool tub for two was very relaxing, very strong jets too! Loved the complementary bath salts to use with it.  Oh, and did I mention the free CHOCOLATE BAR!?

Text: My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights to celebrate our anniversary.  It was a ton of fun.  Breakfast in bed was extraordinary - food was delicious and they even fluffed our pillows - it was like something out of a movie.  The house is gorgeous and we loved the little touches like the chocolate buffet and evening brandy, but especially our souvenir champagne flutes.  The staff is wonderfully attentive yet unobtrusive, far more professional than most B&Bs.  A great place to stay and plenty of sightseeing nearby along the Mississippi.  Highly recommended!

Text: My wife surprised me with a birthday present to spend the night at Beall Mansion. Excellent time! I love the feeling of going back in time. I also loved the furniture, statues and other items that was used in the early 1900s. Coffees and 24 hour chocolates were great. I very much appreciate Jim and Sandy tending to the details. They knew the history of the place and you can tell they take great pride in keeping the place alive. I will definitely be coming back!
