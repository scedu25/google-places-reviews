Text: The owners were super nice and sat with us at our campsite for a fun beautiful evening!  The lake here is clean as it was an old rock quarry!

Text: WOW where do I start?!  The website is 80% lies and inaccurate.  The free wood is covered in dirt and rocks, The laundry room smells horrible like B.O. and the shower is either 150 degrees or 50 with no middle ground.  Someone could easily get hurt and sue the pants off him in that shower!  There was NO free wireless internet.  Doug also charged me the winter rate of $25 per night when it was July which is supposed to be $20.  Overall major lack of maintainence. The lake is nice but it isn't very close at all to the campground.  Basically DO NOT go here for vacation!                                          VERY DISAPPOINTED DOUG
