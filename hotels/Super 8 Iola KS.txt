Text: I had a great experience at this hotel.  The rooms are clean, the housekeeping was more than helpful and gave me plenty of whatever I needed. The front desk was exceptional. I only had a credit card needed some cash for soda and the lady at the front desk not only gave me the money he told me do not worry about paying her back. I had no issues, pool and hot tub were clean and great. Everyone was helpful and happy. Shower had low pressure and that was great, the water was soft. I would definitely stay again.

Text: A very nice place with a pool and hot tub. Clean and near a 24 hour truck stop.  The reason I am only giving 3 stars is the lack of WiFi.  Yes I know they advertise they have it but it is absolutely unreliable.  I stay in Iola several times a year for family events and hunting.  The last 2 times I've been there the WiFi was useless. It connects and breaks off.  This was true with my laptop and my iPad.  I reported these issues to the staff both in the evening and during the day with no effect.  Hopefully they will read this and get their WiFi problems resolved.
