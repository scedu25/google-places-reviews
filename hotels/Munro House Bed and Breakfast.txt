Text: The Munro House is a gorgeous B&B. Each room a separate theme of incredible beauty. Such a great piece of history! The welcoming received is indescribable.

Text: Had a fantastic time with Mike and Lori at the Munro B&B. Opted to have massages (they also have spa services) and it was a  fantastic experience. All around very professional, personable and welcoming. Breakfast was great, had the french toast from an old family recipe, you can't go wrong. Fresh fruit and juice, as much coffee or tea as your little heart desires and the rooms were cozy and clean. Stayed in George's Room, the Jacuzzi tub was great! I would recommend this B&B to anyone who is planning on visiting the Coldwater or Jackson area, it is 30 minutes in either direction, but you won't get the same experience at a hotel and it only costs a few dollars more!

Text: Great history in the house, amazing food right down the road.  We were there for murder mystery dinner- could have been more time to learn our own characters before we learned about everyone else but I think that was more our group jumping in too quick. Over all wonderful... I was concerned about how comfortable the beds would be, we stayed in Sara's room and our bed and sheets were incredible. Breakfast was the best part of every day. Be advised, the gift card to dinner that is "included" is an added cost on top of everything else.

Text: Staying at the Munro House was a wonderful experience. The hosts Mike and Lori are very nice people who take a warm interest in all their guests...they really like what they do and it shows! They go beyond to make a guest feel right at home in their house from engaging in conversation about the history of the house (Mike) to showing personal artwork and current projects of publishing a book (Lori)....not to mention their very well behaved Scotty dog, Ozzie (?spelling). I look forward to going back with some of my friends. Breakfast was also very good. A great experience!
