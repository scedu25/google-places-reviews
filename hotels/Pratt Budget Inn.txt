Text: This is a nice hotel. The price is amazing for Pilot Cars. Quiet, clean, and the beds are very comfortable, there is no funky smell and no bugs. They do not participate in Wyndham Rewards!! But for the  pilot discount I wasn't worried about the reward program. JB Pilot Car. OKC OK I'll definitely stay here if I come back through.

Text: Pretty decent for the price. Room itself is obviously out dated but appliances and some furniture are upgraded. Beds are comfortable.
