Comfort Inn & Suites

Text: The room was very clean, very nice and up to date.  Checking in was super fast and easy.  Free WiFi with no password.  The night I was there they had free dinner and beer (yes complimentary beer).  I don't know what was for dinner or what kind of beer they were serving, I had too much work to get done ?.  Room had a nice desk and chair.  For those folks that have to do a lot of work on their laptops, you'll appreciate that.  Comfy bed and very clean bathroom.  Hope this helps.

Text: Location is a little ways out of the way. Door stuck when opening, usually had to try twice, microwave had one button stuck so it would beep constantly if plugged in. That being said, the beds were fine, the rooms were clean and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They even had cookies the night I was there. In all, nothing outstanding but I was there for work and it worked well enough for my needs without reason for serious complaint. For the money I felt it was a reasonable deal.

Text: Very clean rooms. Amazing and caring staff, to the point that I was blown away by how friendly and accommodating they were to us and other guests. I haven't had such a nice experience in a "2 star" hotel in my life. I really can't complain about anything. If you're looking for a hotel, and manage to nab a room for $88 like we did, you will be impressed. My only regret was not having enough spare cash to tip the cleaning staff more.

Text: Stopped here on our way to Canada. The front desk gal (I wish I'd have caught her name) was, literally, the nicest person I have ever met that works in a hotel! Seriously! Rooms were spotless, beds were comfy and the pool was perfect.
