Ranch Motel of Salem
Rating: 3
Text: Clean room. Cheaper than the other place in town. Quiet, until the police came at 12:30 to remove the guest next door who was causing what may have been a drug related disturbance. Quiet again by 1:30. Bed mattress ok, somewhat firm, but a little softer than plywood. Would stay here again, if ever in Salem, MO, which I will try to avoid.
