Whippoorwill Lake Campground
Rating: 5
Text: I love it here. We camped in July for Three days and we are going back tomorrow for Labor day. We have a cabin this time because I thought they were adorable the last time we were here. The lake is clean and doesn't have the smell that most lakes do. There are lots of things to do here such as paddle boat and golf cart rentals, a horseshoe pit, volleyball, play ground for little ones as well as wooded area all around for enjoying nature .

Text: The camp ground needs to keep better care of the access roads.  The main access going down to the camp sites are washed out.  The people are nice and very helpful.

Text: I've been going to Whippoorwill for years and I love it!  Me and my family come from different directions and meet there for a day of swimming at least 5-7 times per summer.  We've also stayed in a cabin twice.  It's such a relaxing place!
