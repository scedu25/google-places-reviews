Text: You don't want to live here unless you absolutely have no where else. Not only do they fraudulently charge for $10.00 for grass cuttings that they never do on your residence, but they also do not come spray for ants. Ants in these trailer's are so bad that you cant have any food, even food you just cooked on the counter without ants swarming it.  The decks outside trailers, wobble and shake where you feel you are going to fall through. They have mold and paint chipping all over the wood also. They allow no one to park on the grass even one tire in case you have company (and it not destroy the grass) yet all their companies hired by them drive right through your grass leaving tire marks which you get charged for. The owners of this park are very rude when you talk to them on the phone, their only concern is money but yet they don't want to hold up their end of your lease agreement. WATCH OUT GUYS!!!!
