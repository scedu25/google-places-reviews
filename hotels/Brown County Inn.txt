Brown County Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Visited with family to have drinks and enjoy some music. The bar area was nice and drinks and service came quickly. Comfortable seating and table areas. It seems odd that they have placed the performance are in the corner of a cramped L-shaped bar area when there's a huge rooms right behind it. Seems like a wasted opportunity for a truly great music venue. Would also recommend better signage for the restrooms, they're kind of hard to find.

Text: Great place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Great location, within walking distance from downtown Nashville, IN and close enough to go hiking and enjoy nature at Brown County state park. The staff is very friendly. The walls are a bit thin, and bathroom a bit cramped. The amenities like the pool and mini golf are included with the rate. I would stay there again.

Text: Great food, great atmosphere, great location, and great for kids.  We live locally, so I've never stayed in the rooms, but I know the owners have done a lot of work the last few years to update and improve all aspects of the Inn and Restaurant.  Even if you're not staying there, you can still eat in the restaurant.  If the weather cooperates, they have an awesome deck for outdoor eating.  Free simple putt putt course right off the deck.  This is fun for all ages, but a special sanity saver if you have kids and can send them to play while you sit, watch them, and enjoy your drink until food comes!  Parking is free, but you can also easily walk there from town, especially if you use the Salt Creek Trail (entrance by the CVS).

Text: I stayed here for a friend's wedding, and I've eaten here a couple other times while visiting the area. It was a great venue for the wedding and reception. Rooms are nice, good playground, swimming pool, shuffleboard, volleyball, and creekside trail. Walking distance to everything in Nashville. Small, but good bar with live music on the weekends. Delicious food at the restaurant, amazing breakfast buffet.

Text: 5 stars not because it's fancy or opulent, but it is a fantastic place to take kids. Pool is really nice and is a hybrid indoor/outdoor setup with overhead doors. Restaurant has high quality menu (the salad bar sucks, but the menu items are fantastic!) Try the pork chops! Super friendly staff. Free mini golf! (Don't expect a super complicated setup), overall a beautiful property, very clean rooms and unbeatable amenities for the cost.
