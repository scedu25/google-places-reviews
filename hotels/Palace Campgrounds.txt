Palace Campgrounds
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice place to camp.  Took the pop up and had a good long weekend.  Pool was nice and clean as was the shower room.  Needed a couple of things and was able to run to Walmart nearby.  Galena is always a nice afternoon so your not trying to pass time at the fire all day.

Text: Staff very nice.  Clean bathrooms. Tight sites. You are really close to next camper. Close to town of Galena. Many sites to go to. Chestnut MT. , Iowa where Mississippi River view is amazing.

Text: Overall, our Palace campground was a positive experience.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The pool and restrooms were very clean.  The entire campground was well kept.   A lot of things to do (ie. miniature golf, movies, playground, etc.), and very convenient to get to downtown Galena and shopping. The downside was the lack of wifi accessibility, and the VERY SMALL campsites.  We were nearly touching units on both sides of us.

Text: Campground is nice and clean.  Hay rides are fun and free but mini golf seemed a little pricey for campers.  Heated pool was not very warm and kids pool not heated at all.  Too cold to use during our stay.

Text: This campground was clean, the staff is friendly, pool is nice. Rates are reasonable.

The scene is quite wooded, charming and very relaxing.

Proximity to downtown Galena is great --- A wonderful town.
