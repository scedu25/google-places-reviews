Best Western of Whitmore Lake

Text: Very good location.  Quite away from it all, but next to everything.  Yes  Perfect for a UofM game stay .  It is close and right next to a very good sports bar/restaurant.  Easy on and off of the highway.

Text: Nice comfortable bed. But as I was checking in about 1:00am, my card had a problem... Desk clerk did not want to take my cash. I was very tired and was getting frustrated. He said I needed to leave another extra $100 deposit which I could not cover. There were no other rooms available from here to Flint as the Renaissance festival was going on to which I was not aware of before my trip. Otherwise, I would have stayed in the Fenton area. Finally, the clerk let me pay just the amount of one night stay which I did have on me. Turns out there was a breech at my bank and they were ONLY allowing debit charges with pin number. Had he let me try my pin there would have been no problem. Also, they need someone to monitor the breakfast room as the covers on the eggs, sausage, etc were left open so my breakfast was cold. :-(
