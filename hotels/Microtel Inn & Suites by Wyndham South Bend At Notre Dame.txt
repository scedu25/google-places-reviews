Text: There were issues with my reservations, which was not the hotel's fault, I was very upset so I probably wasn't the most pleasant person.  The lady at the front desk, Shannon, she went above and beyond to fix everything.  She did an amazing job helping and making my visit great.  The housekeeping was good, and they lady that does breakfast kept everything stocked and clean.  Thank you ladies for an amazing stay!

Thank You so much Miss Shannon for fixing my boyfriends mistake since he booked the wrong day, your an amazing worker!  Breakfast was great and a big variety to chose from. i believe the lady that ran the kitchens name is Kay. She was so sweet!

Text: Rooms are shockingly small but that's why it's a microtel! The staff were all very nice. We could clearly hear conversation through the walls and a baby screaming at 4am
