Little Coal River Campground

Text: Nice campground,  public access, and yes 4 lane Highway on one side,  then campground is on the river and on the other side of the river is Train Tracks, also a Water Park across the road from the campground!  And as for cell phones their is a tower down below the campground - can talk on your phone all day if your not having fun camping, fishing, floating the river, riding ATV'S,  going to the Water Park! Lots to do!

Text: Great no frills park that has primitive and full hook up. I love this place because it is in the middle of bfe but still close to town (25min). There are also RV and river trails on site.

Text: We had a good time, however be ready for the noise.  A 4 lane road in the front, and train Trax in the back.  When you can get someone on the phone  (not an easy task) make all your arrangements on first contact. 
 They do have trail access by going under the bridge. OK good luck
