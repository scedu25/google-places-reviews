Comfort Suites Hotel and Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms are huge, plenty of space for an extended stay. Couch, microwave, fridge, and sink are in the room so you can get your cheese and trail bologna and store them in the room. TV was a fair size. Pool is open pretty late, 11 pm, which is nice because most places close around 6 so you can grab dinner and then come back and relax in the hot tub or swim with the kids in the pool. Breakfast in the morning is a great selection, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal (hot and cold), waffles, ect. It gets pretty crowded in the morning and there is only one table that holds more than 4 people, so if you need that be prepared to split up. Coffee is served all day which is awesome. Front desk people were very very nice the whole stay. I recommend staying here.

Text: The hotel was in the prefect location and near many restaurants and shops that were in walking distance. The service was excellent as well as the breakfast in the morning. Parking was limited due to the construction at the hotel. The pool and jacuzzi was very nice but there seemed to be too much chlorine because my eyes were burning after 2 minutes of walking into the pool area. I would definitely stay here again for future visits.
