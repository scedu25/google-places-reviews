Super 8 Wichita East
Rating: 5
Text: Location was excellent. We were in town for a doctors visit. Room was very clean and quiet. Breakfast was just average, waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt, etc. But for $67 it was awesome.

Text: The room was nothing extraordinary, but clean and comfortable beyond the fact that the AC hadn't been turned on prior to arrival. The room was easily 80+ degrees at 11 pm and took nearly all night to cool off. Staff was friendly. Rate was exceptional, especially for a room with 3 queen beds. A ton of construction made finding this hotel a mess in the dark.

Text: It's a Super 8, don't expect to be blown away. I had the displeasure of being put in a smoking room. Why hotels still even offer them is beyond me. All it does is lower the quality of your establishment. You can tell someone was hacking up a lung at the desk because there was green goo on the wall. Although, the DVD selection was pretty good with in room players. Shower and bed were decent, that's mostly what matters to me.

Text: The staff was very nice,  always greeted and served with a smile.  Stayed first night,  room was nice,  clean.  Older motel, but clean.  Had to stay a second night unexpectedly.  The gal at the desk was able to get me a great rate.  Again,  found the room clean,  but blanket on bed was thin and old with holes in it.   A little disappointed.   Breakfast was basic fare; cereal,  coffee, juice,  bagels, packaged cinnamon rolls, and make your own waffles.  Eating area very small for so many guests.   All in all,  I might stay somewhere else, but would not have a problem staying here either. 
Very close to a good size mall,  and eating places, food court.
