Nauvoo Vacation Villas
Rating: 5
Text: Amazing place to stay. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa, which includes 4 beds (2 queen beds, a pull-out bed, and 1 twin bed), 2 bathrooms, a washer and dryer, a FULLY EQUIPPED kitchen including silverware, dishes, a dishwasher, a fridge, a microwave, an oven, and a stove. We were in the Nauvoo and British Pageants and it was very convenient since it is less than half a mile to the place we rehearsed a lot and 4 miles from the pageant stage and the other sites to see in Nauvoo. I would definitely recommend staying here!

Text: I love the Nauvoo villas and condos! I've stayed here multiple times and have always had a good experience. Clean, comfortable, air conditioned (a must in sweaty Nauvoo), and with the most beautiful sunsets and nightly lightning bug displays.

Text: Really nice little place, tons of privacy, you have to clean up after yourself (not a hotel, no daily housekeeping), and the blinds don't filter a ton of light so you might have trouble day napping

Text: Just out of town, the Villas are clean, comfortable and great for groups. Surrounded by corn fields it is quiet and peaceful.
