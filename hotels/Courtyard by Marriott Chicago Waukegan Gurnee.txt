Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Waukegan/Gurnee
Rating: 5
Text: Love the courtyard by Marriott. It's cozy and relaxing with a lot of things to do near by. The pool is nice but a little small and cold but wasn't over loaded with chlorine so my eyes didn't burn which is a huge plus.

Text: Good clean hotel with a comfortable staff. We went to see my nephew graduate from Navy boot camp. I asked about taking the shuttle bus, but they said it was sold out, which kind of sucks and no one mentioned this could happen before it's ,8 pm the night before and Bam " Sorry bus is sold out" When a larger part of your business is family of the Navy boots that are graduating, running out of room on the bus and a " Sorry about your luck" attitude isn't an option. I would like to see them make more trips with the van or buy another van or arrange for another van on boot graduation days.

Text: Really enjoyed the cleanliness of the hotel. Nice amenities, but as a smoker I felt discriminated against. I followed their policies and ended up receiving a notice they found a strong smell of smoke, cigarette butts, and ashes when cleaning my room and they threatened a $250 fine. Called the front desk to clarify only to find out they just gave the notice to everybody. I get harsh smoking rules, but don't threaten me if I haven't done anything against their policy.

Text: Was in Waukegan for a wedding, and the hotel was so nice! Having the bar in the lobby was an added bonus. Everyone was very accommodating to us!
