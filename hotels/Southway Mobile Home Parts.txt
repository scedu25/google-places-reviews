Text: I have lived here for almost 2 years now and in that time it has gone thru 2 park managers and I have seen people come and go in the park. In all my time renting over the past 20 years I have never had a landlord that was more understanding or willing to work with people as I have here. That being said there may be a few complaints of the actual people around but nothing that has made me want to move as of yet.
