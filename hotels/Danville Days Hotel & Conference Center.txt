Danville Days Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 3
Text: It is a older establishment. We were there for a wedding. The room upon entering (which was smoking room) had ashes on the A/C unit. Having been in the hospitality industry before, we went with the flow. Beds were very comfortable and breakfast was adequate. It was graduation week at Illinois state so selection in the area was very limited.  I do believe a remodel is necessary to update.

Text: Room was clean but dated and the front door staff were friendly, professional and informative. Every available outlet was taken by lamps, alarm clock, television and cable, I think you get the picture. For us to be able to plug in our electronics for the evening we found ourselves having to decide which light or other device in the room we could do without. This hotel served it's purpose in a pinch, we just needed a place to sleep for one night while attending our son's graduation from U of I. The room was 2 stars, customer service and staff was a 4 star. That's how I came up with a 3 star rating.
