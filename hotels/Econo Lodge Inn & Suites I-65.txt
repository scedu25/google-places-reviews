Econo Lodge Inn & Suites I-65

Text: If you are looking for a quick, overnight stop at a clean place with no frills, this is the spot for you.  The hotel is definitely outdated -- no elevator, outdoor metal staircases, weird decor in the lobby and a tiny eating area for breakfast --- but clean.  Internet access is spotty and the  TV quality is terrible with limited channels.  Bring a good book!  The ice machine worked well, which was a big plus, as the refrigerator was quite small and we had to keep some food in our cooler.  The staff graciously allowed us to take plates and plasticware from the breakfast area to have a supper meal when we finally got settled.  NO POOL --- it has been filled in with cement.

Text: Our room was clean. The people at the desk were nice.  I would've gave more stars but the beds have firm mattresses.  Other than that our experience was a good one.

Text: Good prices. Desk service good. Rooms were surprisingly large, but lots of dust and some of the furniture was straight up busted. Like how do you not notice that 2/3 of the dresser drawers are collapsed?

Text: Clean king size bed but pillows can use some fluff. Also, clean room but there carpet looks like it's seen better days. Do not walk barefoot if you value your feet. I would recommend to anyone who is not looking for anything fancy yet affordable overnight stay.
