Text: I was here for 3 weeks and it is fair on price but the woman who runs it is very rude and her man ain't much better..... Went to pay for my 3rd week and she was questioning me about paying for a month rather than a week as we had agreed when I paid the first week and I said oh no I'll be leaving as soon as possible .
