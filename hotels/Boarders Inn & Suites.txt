Boarders Inn & Suites

Text: Very nice hotel. Rates were reasonable. Clean, updated.  We will stop there again on our next trip to Nebraska.  Restaurant close  to it had a good breakfast.  You get 20% off of breakfast  if you are a guest of the hotel. And check out the Bison bar and grill. Really good steaks.

Text: Delightful place to stay. Everything was new and very clean. It felt like it had never been used. Large rooms with lots of pillows and very comfy beds. We were so pleasantly surprised at the great cost for a restful sleep after a long day of travel.

Text: Nice hotel. Nearly brand new. Good room and very clean. However the neighbor's TV kept me awake.

Text: Clean room, over crowded feel due to very large, dark furniture.  Frosted glass bathroom door is a bad choice, room gets a lot of light from it when anyone goes to the bathroom while others are trying to sleep.

Text: Beautiful hotel right in the middle of Syracuse, Kansas. Really neat modern room with a cool marble shower. Who would've expected it here considering it is only one of two in the whole town and the other one only has a one star rating.
