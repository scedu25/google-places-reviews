Text: I've camped at nearly every State Park in Indiana. This County Park has them all beat. The camp host are amazingly friendly and helpful. Best keep secret in Indiana. All camp sites have water hook up and electric. They have a dump station and a nice clean shower house. Very close to the Wabash River and the amenities in town but far enough out be have a good time. Give it a try and see what you think, I think you'll be hooked on this campground as I am.

Text: This is probably a decent campground if you have a trailer or TV, but for tent camping, it's ok at best. The tent spots are just open areas next to the paved road. We set up hammocks on the way home very few trees that were not surrounded by brush.
