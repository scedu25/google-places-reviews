Holiday Inn Express & Suites Festus - South St. Louis
Rating: 5
Text: Was in town overnight with family for a wedding.  Rooms were nice and clean and roomy.  Staff was very courteous and professional.  We got to enjoy the pool as well.  Only minor complaint is the elevator, which is in a little alcove in the hallway.  People with a lot of luggage coming and going at the same time might have an issue with that.  Breakfast was decent and the seating area and lobby are nice. Overall I am very impressed with your location and the quality of service we received.

Text: Very nice hotel!  The furniture in the room, lobby & breakfast/leisure area was nice and comfy.  We had a whirlpool suite which we enjoyed.  Definitely room in the whirlpool for 2 people, even if you're not skinny!  :)  the breakfast was good, had a good selection and we were even able to get a tray and take it back to our room.  We will definitely stay her again.  A quick 30 minute drive to downtown St. Louis, didn't even seem like it took that long.

Text: Fine establishment with pleasant and helpful workers.  I would not hesitate to stay here again. I have a marvelous view over the valley from my 4th floor room!  I have grown accustomed to Marriott properties and this property almost meets those standards.

Text: We stayed here the night before a Cardinals game in St. Louis. This was a short drive away feom the stadium, while not being crowded in city traffic. There were plenty of local places to eat nearby. The room was clean and had plenty of room. Excellent AC unit in the room. Standard hotel breakfast in the morning.
