Hilton Garden Inn West Lafayette Wabash Landing
Rating: 5
Text: Really nice hotel downtown West Lafayette right on the Wabash River. It's right next to Purdue University and walking distance to downtown Lafayette as well. There are restaurants right outside the hotel within walking distance. The staff was super helpful, got us checked in and helped us get parked in the garage. The rooms themselves were new, comfortable, and we had plenty of space. There is a restaurant in the lobby that has breakfast but they also have complementary coffee and water. This is a nice hotel close to everything in the area and ideal for business travelers. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Comfortable beds, nice amenities in rooms (microwave, fridge, coffee maker) with lots of space. Pool was nice for the kids, but we miss the hot tub and the pool towels are tiny. The lobby area is great for meeting and eating with several families. The only real complaint was housekeeping didn't visit our room (we removed the do not disturb sign about 11), but we weren't out of anything so that was minor. We enjoy staying here each time we visit West Lafayette.

Text: Comedian Nick Dittmeier recently stayed here while performing nearby and had a great stay! The room was perfect and the floor was very quiet. The staff was awesome and very friendly considering the really late check-in, and even provided a late check-out so our client could take full advantage of the, laundry room, and fitness center in the morning before hitting the road!

Text: Jullian at the front desk was more than accommodating when I came in with my uncle who recently had a hip replacement.
He he anticipated our needs by asking if we needed a wheelchair soon as he noticed my uncle had a crutch this is the kind of Service employee that really exemplifies the brand name of Hilton Hotels.
This impressed my uncle so much that he says this is the only place he will stay in Lafayette from now on.
Kudos guys!!!

Text: We stayed one night at the Hilton Garden Inn. It's located right in the heart of West Lafayette, right near the John Myers Pedestrian Bridge, and just minutes from I-65. The room we stayed in was great! Super clean, newer appliances, and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were spotless. They have a delicious breakfast in the morning until 10am, and a great indoor pool just around the corner from the lobby! Gated parking in their personal parking garage just behind the hotel. The staff was friendly and very helpful, would highly recommend to anyone staying in the Lafayette/West Lafayette area!
