Text: Knights Inn Seymour is just off the highway and near numerous major stores and restaurants. It made the perfect stop on a very long drive. Both rooms were quite clean (one was a pet-friendly room) and smelled fresh. The beds were comfortable and again clean. The front desk help was very polite and helpful. I know they offer a continental breakfast, but we had to get on the road too early to be able to have breakfast there. There is also wifi, but we didn't have cause to use it.

Text: We were driving thru with the family to our vacation destination. Got tired so stopped here to check rates. The rate was cheap. The lady at the desk was very nice and let us check the room out before we paid. The room was clean and the beds were very comfy. So we stayed. We had no issues. It was the perfect size for my family of 6. And there was room for my son's pack n play. I'd definitely stay again if we grew tired on the road again. Oh and the reviews didn't load for me while I was paying. So reading them in our room gave me the creepy crawlies however I never seen a roach or suspected bed bugs as some reviews said they did. So no worries there.

Text: Booked 4 nights on line & upon check in very nice clerk verified me for 4 nights & charged my card for 4 nights.  Please when you pay keep your reciept!!  She wrote on bottom of my slip 31st check in check out on 4th.  Had been enjoying my stay up til 4th night when she sends a man & woman to my door to say I hadnt paid for tonight.  Stated owner says only written down for 3 nights.  Took my reciept to office 2 talk w/owner told her I booked online for 4 & showed reciept I paid for 4.  Up top on slip woman wrote 3rd as checkout when bottom indicated 4th.  I told her that was her clerks error NOT my error & I'm not paying again for something I already paid for.  She needed to fix it.  I could see her doing math in her head & she changed it to 4th.  Not sure if clerk purposely did this to try & charge us more or if was accident.  Either way owner fixed it. This is a clean & quiet place 2 stay by no means is it fancy,  but it is a safe, clean, affordable place to sleep for 4 nights & was convient to interstate.   Bring your own pillows b/c the one's provided are sufficent for 1 not 2 guests.    I'd stay here again.
