Text: We had a wonderful weekend stay at Stone Haus B&B. Linda and Larry are experienced hosts and are very accommodating. The historic house is homey and decorated with many cute trinkets. Milli the dog is adorable and loves belly rubs. The home made breakfast was amazing and well balanced with fresh fruit. We used the hot tub both nights and drank out complimentary wine, which was an added bonus. I would highly recommended staying here.

Text: We made our second trip to Herman and this time, to ring in the New Year w some friends.  We had the most amazing experience at the Stone Haus B&B.  Clean, cozy, excellent breakfast and the nicest caretakers we could have asked for.  We will never stay anywhere else.  They really know their business.  Thanks Linda and Larry!
