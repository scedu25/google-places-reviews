Hampton Inn Elkhart

Text: Rooms ok but not worth 145.00. Across street is Country Inn for 100. What they dont tell you is they add another 30 bucks on your card without you knowing it just in case you steal anything. WHAT??? Yes they do and they do not tell you. I consider that an insult. Never again will I stay at this place.

Text: Nice location right off the interstate. Needs more late night food delivery options, but that's not really their fault. Decent breakfast, good coffee. Front desk staff is friendly and helpful.

Text: Very nice hotel. Bed was top notch and I have a finicky back. Breakfast was thoughtful, something for everyone. All in all I would recommend.

Text: Staff was very friendly and efficient. Hotel looks nice. The water pressure in the shower could have been better, and the box springs on my bed were noisy, but the bed was comfortable. The large tiled area by the room door was kind of odd, but the room was larger than the average Hampton Inn. Breakfast was hot and tasted good.
