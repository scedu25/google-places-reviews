Blue Goose Saloon & Inn

Text: Don't get fooled.  We reserved a room at the blue goose inn.  When we arrived a local that lived above where we stayed said that we were not actually at the blue goose inn ( which was obvious). We were down right next to the railroad tracks on the opposite side of town.  The local man said that this is where they put people when there is an overflow.   I feel like we should have been told.  We did not have  satellite tv as advertised instead it was what appeared to be basic cable on a tube tv from the 80s or early 90s.  Daily maid service was also non existent.  ( was advertised) The door latch to the room didn't latch properly and the  luxury bedding was old  mediocre bedding at best.  Also there was minimal parking for us and the other guests.  You can get much much nicer places for similar prices and I would do so next time.  We have come down to the area several times and always received what was advertised.    Not anywhere close this time.  It's possible that the blue goose inn is actually nice.  Your just apparently not gaurenteed to get a room there when you reserve a room there.   We ended up paying several hundred dollars for services we didn't get.  I just had the expectations set by what their website says.  Never again.

Text: Had another great experience here with the owner and the locals.  The owner went above and beyond to accomodate us.  He has always had our best interest in mind when making suggestions.  Can't say enough about the hospitality and the reasonably priced accomodations.  We WILL be staying here again in the future when we ride the local trail system.
