Text: Amazing spa, amazing location for events, and fun place to go for a day with the girls! Very romantic for an evening or weekend as well. Good food and lots to drive to.

Text: I booked a 2 night/3 round trip from the Michigan Golf Show in 2016.  The trip went great.  The room was very nice, had a view of the 9th green from the balcony, and the course was in great shape.  The back 9 is a lot of fun.  We had so much fun that we booked another 2 night/3 round stay for this summer too.  The restaurant/bar also had great food.  Make sure to do the night golf if it is offered! That was the most fun.

Text: Absolutely horrible customer service! They can not get in the same page with booking information and will bump parties! I was told by a MANAGER, basically tough luck and "we obviously can't make you happy!" All I wanted was a returned call and correct information. We I expressed my dissatisfaction, there was NO apology, in fact they placed the blame on myself and my party! How am I supposed to know their reservation procedures!?! I was only going off the information their "trained" staff was telling me! This place is a total joke and a MAJOR headache!!!
