Text: Price is reasonable for villas along the lake. Good for couples getting married along with their out of town families! Romers catering next to villas is a great catering and wedding facility as well, with many locations!

They have regular rooms, but the villas are where its at!. They have one and 2 bedroom villas with a living and kitchen in them; basically you're staying in an apartment for the weekend/week/night. In the 2 bedroom villa one room has a queen bed, and the other has 2 twins. There is also a pull out couch, and room for an air mattress if not 2 if you're looking to fill it.

The location is aways from anything other than a really nice Italian restaurant next door. But it sits next to a state park on the other side, and is right there on the lake. If you're looking to boat or fish, then you can park you're boat right in front all week if that's what you want to do. As long as there's not a party going on at their rental hall across the parking lot, it's pretty quiet too.
