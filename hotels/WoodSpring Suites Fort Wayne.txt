WoodSpring Suites Fort Wayne
Rating: 4
Text: It's a great place to stay.. Very clean!!  No bed bugs!!  That's the first thing I look for on hotel reviews due to a bad past experience.  Wood springs isn't a fancy place but it's clean comfortable safe place to stay. It has a laundry room and a few vending machines.  All in all it's a good place.

Text: Service is terrible, elevator is slow and glitchy, people here were friendly which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Outside door doesn't work for easy access to smoking area. Save your money and go elsewhere. I prefer my extended stays to have kitchen utensils and cookware. All around relatively sketchy place.

Text: This is by far the BEST Wal Mart I've been to in the US. From the parking lot to the sparkling clean floors to everything being straight on the shelves to all the smiling, busy caring employees to the busy caring management! I am so impressed by my visit I called a friend that was in total agreement that this is hands down the best Wal Mart!

Text: I would have given 5 stars if the bed and showerhead were great....but as it is... its just fair. The price, cleanliness, full kitchen, nice size t.v, hospitality, ok size space, attentiveness of staff, quiet relaxing environment and location being close to everything, even a exercise park, is GREAT!
