Text: I stayed here this past weekend and breakfast was amazing! Check in was easy & I loved that this place was pet friendly.  Rooms were clean, staff were friendly.  WiFi is super slow but everything else was good.  Defiantly recommend this hotel.

Text: Location is in a prime spot near suburb areas of Chicago. The ambiance of the lobby is super nice & clean. Rooms are also clean & comfortable. Decent sized beds, room space, & bathroom. Loved the experience! Will definitely come back here again. Service was great with courteous engagements.

Text: Nice!  Moved here from another hotel because of the noise, distance, street traffic, and pellet gun hole in bathroom window. It is hard to choose a place to stay based upon ratings. This hotel is clean, quiet, great staff, and we are happy.
