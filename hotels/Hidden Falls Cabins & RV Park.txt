Hidden Falls Cabins & RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We found this camp ground on the web and called and talked to  Tabatha . She was great at answer all my questions, so decided to give it a try. Beautiful , new,  amazingly maintained camp ground and the site for our camper was great. Large pads, full hookups, picnic table ,fire pit and they even supplied the wood. Also pet friendly and that is important to us. Hated we couldn't spend more time there but we will be back. We travel this way and was great accommodation for 1 night or long stays. Didn't use the cabins but they looked great from the outside.  I would recommend this place to everyone! Thank you to the owners.

Text: We love this place!  The cabins are beautiful and smelled wonderful!  Thoughtful amenities such as the firewood  is supplied for the fire pit and bottled water in the fridge. The bed is very comfortable.  Highly recommend it for a girls trip or family trip.  The owners are very friendly and accommodating.  Will stay again!

Text: Where to begin... let's start with the name, the falls at the back of the property are amazing and such a nice spot to relax and cool off on a hot day. The sites are big, nice big new cement pads and the grass is green and always maintained nicely!! It's peaceful, until it gets rowdy then you just have to make sure to invite the owner & family lol ;) But seriously, the people that own and operate this park are among some of the most helpful, accommodating, kind and generous souls we've met on the road, going to miss them the most

Text: This place is awesome. Clean, peaceful. Tabatha was so kind and helpful. Firewood is free, the cabin looks brand new. The falls are within walking distance and there is a Walmart a few minutes away. 
The only thing I would say is that I wish we had more time here. 
It was our first visit, and it will not be our last.

Text: First the positive. It's new, & close to town. Very clean and the operators are nice. Feels very safe and everyone is friendly. What it didn't say online is that it is next to Cargil meat packing plant. Lots of lights, constant machinery sound, periodic announcements over a loud speaker, if the wind is right a chemical odor, and trains... If you're a light sleeper, bring your ear plugs. No idea where that scenic river is that's shown online.
