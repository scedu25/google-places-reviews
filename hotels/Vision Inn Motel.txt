Vision Inn Motel
Rating: 5
Text: For a small town hotel, its very nice. Beds are all queens , but comfy. Parking right in front of rooms and semi truck parking also. Coffee in room and the gals up front put out coffee for us during day,  when they usually don't. They went above the normal, just cause we asked. (Just one thing- fan is real loud in room) but clean.
