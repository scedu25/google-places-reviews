Text: Three nights; two adults, three kids; one-bedroom suite. All the amenities we expected were there. Staff was attentive, friendly. Rooms were a little tight for five people. Location had easy access to 88, 59, and downtown Naperville. Breakfast was great. If the pool had been warm we would have swam twice; baby was too cold in there.

Text: The hospitality will keep you coming back.  Like other Residence Inns I've stayed at in other states they have the friendly and most accommodating staff. Updated rooms and common areas. Lobby is a open and welcoming space with wall mounted televisions and fireplaces. Also a cozy patio outside the pool for shaded lounging. This location is a site to see and enjoy all your own.

Text: My family stayed in the hotel for entire 3 months. It was very positive experience. I love the hotel for several reasons: 1) nice hot nutritious breakfast; 2) very friendly and helpful staff; 3) social hours 3 nights a week where kids can play with each other and you meet interesting people to talk to (it's important when you stay so long as  we did); 4) good location

Text: My coworkers and I have had a few issues with the rooms being dirty. We checked into our rooms to dirty toilets, dirty sheets and hair in the shower and on the curtains. The bedis too hard for my liking and I asked the front desk about a mattress topper but was advised they didn't have any. Unfortunately I haven't been able to sleep well because of how hard the mattress is.
