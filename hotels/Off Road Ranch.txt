Text: Do not go here!!!!   Wasted time and fuel driving here.    They DO NOT allow public use of the track.   Website is wrong.   No day passes.   No annual passes.   Just a wasted day.

Text: The track has definitely been improved and the facility is great.  Unfortunately, the family that runs it also has family that drives so that apparently makes it ok for them to take out 3 cars in only 5 nights of racing.  I'm just curious as to how many more he has to take out before they do something.  Seriously injure a fellow driver or fan maybe?  Sad, because it could be a really fun place to race a sport mods.

Text: We only go to the dort track racing, but we all love it. They have recently put new dort down and they are continually trying to make it better for the fans and drivers. Sometimes the dirt flies, but what do you expect?
