Text: We spent a wonderful weekend -- the penthouse suite has a beautiful view of the Mississippi.  Inez and her husband are gracious hosts, and breakfasts were wonderful!  We will definitely plan on staying with them again next time we are in Burlington.

Text: Just got back to Miami from an 8 day stay at this wonderful B&B. I was in Burlington for the location shooting of a film and both the director and the main actress stayed there too. The owners, Inez and David are more than gracious hosts and they will engage you in interesting conversations. Every morning waking up after long working hours I felt I was home. The lovingly prepared breakfasts will keep you smiling until dinner. A walk in the neighborhood will bring you the sight of beautifully restored Victorian houses. Great view of the river. This is a place to relax.  If you have to be connected to your phone, e-mails and texting 25 hours a day this is not the place for you.
