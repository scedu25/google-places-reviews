Text: This is a wonderful place. Clean in all aspects, extremely nice/helpful staff, delicious full breakfast. The indoor pool and whirlpool were great as well. Beds were very comfortable. Security is a priority for them.

Text: I only saw one room. Was there visiting a friend. Room had a small kitchen area. Nice layout. Seemed clean. Has a pool and fitness center. Entrance into the parking lot could use better lighting.

Text: Best service and friendliest staff I've ever dealt with. Housekeeping was very accommodating to our varying nightshift schedules. Only thing I didn't like was as this is an upscale chain hotel, really thought they could've thought through coffee maker placement. The desk would've been a nicer approach than seeing them on the bathroom counters.
