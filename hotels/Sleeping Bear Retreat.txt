Text: An extremely beautiful place to relax and enjoy nature. I will be returning and i highly recommend this place to families, couples, anyone who wishes to "just kick back and relax". Very polite people and very clean environment. Thank everyone at Sleeping Bear!!! P.S. the zombie hunt and other attractions are out of this world! Im a steady nerve kinda guy and they actually made me jump on more than one occasion!!!!
