Super 8 Creston
Rating: 2
Text: Rooms somewhat stained and worn. Two separate buildings not sure which is the better I'm in the lower. Thin walls and windows lots of outside noise. Tv has auto sound control not very loud and remote is a pain. Staff is accommodating and friendly. Looks like they may renovating somewhat. 2.5 stard.

Text: The employees were quite friendly and helpful. We were able to get an early check in for a wedding which was great! The only downfall so far that I've had is the fact that I am a previous smoker and you can smell the lingering smoke in the hallways.

Text: Its a motel. There are rooms and you sleep in them. The beds are hard but all hotel beds are. 4/5 stars, nothing bad about this place but it's still just a super 8.

Text: Was clean and serves its purpose. TV didn't work in our room. Had breakfast, but very basic.
