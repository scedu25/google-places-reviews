Budget Inn Washington
Rating: 5
Text: Price was a little high, but in comparison well worth it. Service was friendly and caring, Hotel has been newly remodeled and resembles that a new quality inn or choice hotel brand. Great stopping point on our journey to Holiday World so don't be put off by the fact that it says budget inn. Its as good as a quality inn.
