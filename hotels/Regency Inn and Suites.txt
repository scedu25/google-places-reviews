Regency Inn and Suites
Rating: 4
Text: The place was sufficient for getting a good night's rest as we were passing through Dodge City. However,there was no cup for the coffee maker and the coffee maker looked dirty. The mattress on one side was worn out more than the other side. There were around 5 mattresses leaning against the wall to the right of the office so I am sure they were going to replace old mattresses? It was a non-smoking room and it didn't smell like smoke. However,  the shower and toilet room smelled musty. We were not expecting a high end hotel so Regency Inn was sufficient.

Text: A great place to stay, but the beds use to be so comfortable now they're hard as a rock. Bring back soft mattresses

Text: When I went into the bathroom, used towels were in their from previous customers. The ice bucket still had water left in it. The coffee pot had mold growing in old grounds in the machine. No discounts or money back or even a new room was offered. I kindly told the people to shove it.
