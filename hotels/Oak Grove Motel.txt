Oak Grove Motel
Rating: 4
Text: For the low price, all it's good for is sleeping and quite place to read; nothing else. Nothing wrong with that if that's all you are looking for. However, they could put better efforts into their housekeeping. I opened a mirror one time to find a little bit of trash left behind by the previous tenant. The table also wasn't left wiped up. Better housekeeping and I'm sure it will be a wonderful environment to sleep.

Text: This is a cozy and quiet motel on US Highway 136. I stayed for a handful of weeks thanks to their low weekly rates. Owner and staff were very friendly...they went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed from towels to a fridge/microwave combo. 

Also, the sign out front is the original from when the motel was built. Super cool! I recommend if you want a wallet and staff friendly place to stay.

Text: Filthy. There were bugs in the rooms, a bloody tampon in the trash and blood on the bed and sheets. The bed was hardly made. The TV gets about 4 channels. It's a gamble on what you'll get: a microwave, a mini fridge, or a coffee maker (with 0 coffee supplies.) Don't ever stay here. $10 more there's a motel 15 minutes into danville called the glo. They are clean and cozy and decent.

Text: This motel is out in the country, which is great for me. It's an old motel, and needs an upgrade, but It's quiet, friendly staff, low weekly rates. Love the retro look! Doesn't except animals. Overall, our stay was good. Will stay again.

Text: For some reason, this motel was the best I've stayed at in a long time. Real keys, friendly staff, quaint rooms. It's what all motels should be. Cheap, basic, and perfect in my eyes.
