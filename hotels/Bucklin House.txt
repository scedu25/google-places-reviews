Bucklin House

Text: We stayed here almost 2 years ago and have not found a more comfortable, hospitable, and well kept place since.  The owners went out of their way to make sure this accommodation was "just as relaxing as home".  Only a few blocks from the businesses.  Thrift stores were abundant and the townspeople were very nice,  Great place for family reunion, or even if you want that 2nd honeymoon. We had a very nice stay .
