Five Seasons
Rating: 5
Text: Jay is the best barber I've come in contact with. Anyone you pay to put a straight razor to your neck better be trustworthy and have steady hands, he most definitely does. Crisp lines and I always come out looking my best. Clean and relaxed location with the nicest barber chairs I've ever seen. Great prices for everyone. Always a pleasure.

Text: I have been here since 1994 and seen many managers come and go. The current office staff has made more progess in a 18 months then i have seen in years.

Text: The management of this community employs Jon's Towing & Recovery to straight up steal your vehicles in the middle of the night, who then holds your vehicle for an insane ransom while being incredibly rude & threatening. Under no circumstance should anyone want to live here if management is willing to do that to their tenants.

 I looked into  the recent reviews for 5 seasons and I'm thinking that any of the review on hear over 1 star, that they must have been speaking of a different park or that they were paid for leaving the review  NONE in there right mind wouldn't give this park a good review, well ever since Julia left us. I have had the BEST years out here but after they lost Julia years ago this park went down hill and the way the parks been being ran by Lindsay and Bree and who ever allowed them to think they can run a mobile home park is out there mind and actually leaving because of them and there service.

Text: I have lived here since June 2016.  The community is great and very diverse. Some people like to talk bad about Management but truth be told those people are the ones who have problems following rules and not caring about their surroundings. Since I have lived in this community I have seen such a effort in cleaning up and Management taking pride of our community. I would recommend anyone to live at Five Seasons and continue to refer people.
