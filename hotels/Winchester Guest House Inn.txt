Text: Last Christmas our extended family -- 12 adults plus 10 children ages 4 to16 -- stayed at the Winchester Guest House for four nights and had a wonderful time.  It was the perfect solution to spending Christmas together now that the family has grown too big for any one house to host.  Everyone enjoyed the comfortable and homey atmosphere, with plenty of public spaces for group activities and private spaces for rest.  We felt very much at home there.  The kitchen was well outfitted to allow us to cook our favorite holiday meals, and the kids especially loved the swimming pool and the game room.  The hot tub got some use, too, and Ted provided enough extra tables that we could have jigsaw puzzles and board games.  It's a lovely location, and there's last-minute shopping just minutes away.  Our hosts could not have been more helpful and hospitable, and we had all the pleasures of a holiday at home in a pleasant home-like place.  Highly recommended!

Text: 7400 square foot home  on 6 acres of landland. Includes private bathrooms, an indoor swimming pool, pool table, and a home theater system. However I knocked a star off because I was stuck in possibly the worst room in the house. A small room with a really creaky plyboard thin mattress. I recommend staying at this house but not in the room I mentioned above.
