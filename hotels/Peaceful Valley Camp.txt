Text: I have been going there for 5 years now and every year is amazing! I luv the sights and all of the animals that you can see if your lucky! Me and my church teachers, my other fellow pears and pastor luv it and the price is great! I am so thankful to have the opportunity to go there each and every year! I was saved there this year on 6-14-17 and I am so great full! Can't wait until next year!

Text: Terrific camp run by the Cape Baptist Association. Sometimes there are a few things needing repair, and it is a bit rustic but they're always working on improving something. I help out as a counselor for one of their boys camps, and it's great. I look forward to it every year.
