Text: So I arrive, it's 5pm I enter the main office to find its quite dimly lit, a wall of glass separates me and whomever runs the desk, it's smells vaguely of mildew, I ring the buzzer,  from the shadows approaches a heavy set Indian "gentleman." My co-worker and I are looking for lodging for about two months, we intended to price check for the best rates around, we told him we had the super 8 down to 250 a week, we did. The man the becomes frustrated and yells "So what?" While we try to talk him down in prices, I immediately left, I'm not one for clowns, my co-worker still tried to negotiate and I can hear the gentleman screaming "So what?" I started the work truck up, turned around and left, we found a better price at the Baymont Inn and Suites in Springfield.
