Holdrege City Campground

Text: What a treat!  Best $10 we've spent in a long time.  Self check-in was very easy to do.  We only stayed the night and were back on the road by 10 am, so we weren't looking for lots of extras. This was perfect for our needs, with cement pads, nice picnic table and nice, covered garbage cans at each site.  Water and dump station very handy to all sites.  By taking site #1, we even got to sit outside and watch the sun set over the city.  Close to train tracks, but we kind of like that sound.  Only heard 2 during the night.  Clean. Thank you to the city of Holdrege!

Text: Not bad for in town. The outside area is well kept. Bathroom needs a serious cleaning.  Good spot for the price.

Text: Not bothered at all. Clean and reasonable. Electric only , there is a dump station and water for yopur fresh water tank as well as water for the sewer clean out.There are trains. We were talking to the volunteers at The Prairie Museum and they said the land next to the museum was going to made in to the new Holdrege city rv park moving it 1 1/2 from the tracks it will be MUCH quieter.
