Text: The building has a "swamp" around it. It basically stands on the water, greenish yucky water (not sure if its rain water or something leaks non stop). Bathrooms are clean, but have awful smell of mold and mildew from the pipes system. NO place for the children to play or walk, no back yard, no play area. Loop of roads, tiny parking lot. Inside the building is unsafe for little kids either. Some of the apartment's windows have holes in them. Holidays and weekends are noisy because of the bar on the ground floor. Neighborhood is unsafe even during the morning and afternoon hours. Rent if overpriced.
