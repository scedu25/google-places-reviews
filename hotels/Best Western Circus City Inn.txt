Text: Nice and quiet hotel. The lobby is very nice. They have a really nice pool and a small gym. The room wasn't the most up to date but it was not bad.

Text: Very nice, clean place with extremely nice staff!!   My sole complaint is that the breakfast did not offer baked goods from the local Bakery on Broadway!  (Their breakfast would have been perfect!)

Text: Got tired en route and decided at the last minute to stay here. Having stayed at many BW's, this was much nicer than I expected for the price. Looks standard from the outside, but inside the décor is very nice, the front desk clerk was very helpful, and the room was very modern and comfortable and better appointed than others (example, the showerhead was a rainfall type). The fitness room had more equipment than many other BW's I've seen. Can't ask for easier access to one of Indiana's main highways. The only quibble was the breakfast--pretty standard for a BW albeit in a large room, and the taste and choice of offerings wasn't quite as nice as in some other BW's that are more 'budget' in every other way.
