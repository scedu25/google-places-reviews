Rose's Place Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Rose's Place Bed & Breakfast is a very nice place to stay in the Amana Colonies. The rooms are large, clean and unique. They are somewhat updated, but still have the character that the old building has. The beds are very comfortable. There are kitchens that can be used for cooking during longer stays. The breakfast was fantastic and can be made Gluten Free. I highly recommend this B&B and will be returning myself.

Text: Lovely place filled with antiques and the spirit of an earlier time. Monys, the owner, shared local history and her love of living in Amana. My room was comfy & clean. I loved sleeping in a bed and a room filled with so many memories of long ago. The hospitality & breakfast exceeded my expectations.
