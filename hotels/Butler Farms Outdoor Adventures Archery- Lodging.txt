Butler Farms Outdoor Adventures Archery- Lodging
Rating: 5
Text: We have stayed a couple of times at Butler Farms Outdoor Adventures and I must say each time has been a wonderful experience. It's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the hectic city life and it's AMAZING to see the stars at night. It truly makes you reconnect with the outdoors and makes you feel relaxed and at peace almost immediately. The lodge is VERY clean and comfortable. The decor has a comforting country flavor. The lodge offers a fully equipped kitchen, great room with a large screen tv and laundry room with washer/dryer - it has everything that you need!  There is lots to do at Butler Farms- fishing, basketball and volleyball just to name a few.  If you are looking for a great getaway - keep Butler Farms in mind. Lastly, Mr. and Mrs. Butler that own the lodge are friendly, caring and make you feel welcome.
 
A very memorable getaway location…

Not to mention the Trophy Bucks available for your hunt of a lifetime!  We highly recommend you take a hunting trip, family retreat, Church Group Retreat or just a wonderful vacation in their Lodging facilities soon!  It will be a memory to last a lifetime!
