Text: 510.oo a month and 400.00 dollars in electric bill ?...my camper does not ever go over 80.00 dollars a month through alliant,until I came here does anyone know how that happens? ???? There's definitely something fishy about a camper all of a sudden using 320.00 dollars worth of electric for no good reason! I can produce my bills from last year to prove this. Who can u complain to???? Beware!!!!!!

Text: We took a chance and stayed here. We even asked them about their bad reviews. Turns out those are just ex employees trying to smear a nice business. Their rent was a tiny bit higher than others, but then again they are the closest to the plant where I had to work. Id rather pay the 10 bucks more and be 5 minutes from work than have to drive 30+ minutes each way.
Anyhow, just posting this to help these nice people out. They were very helpful getting me set up and I am still staying here.

Text: I just moved here last month. Seems nice, me and my kids are happy here. Its pretty quiet. They have a nice maintenance guy that helped me when my door got stuck and even helped me with a plumbing issue and they didnt charge me anything.
I looked at the bad reviews and was kinda scared to come here at first, but I'm glad I did. The manager told me that all the people writing them are just grumpy people that used to work there and it seems like shes telling the truth. Everyone I've talked to here says the same thing. The place is nice and clean and theres lots and lots of room.
Oh well, if y'all give it a shot we can be neighbors haha.

Text: Nice place, its just outside of town. Great area, quiet and peaceful. 3 minutes from walmart and all the chain restaurants. Big lots with tons of room. I've been to many rv parks and there is normally garbage everywhere and they cram everyone together, here you could fit 5 trailers on one lot if you wanted to and they keep it nice and clean. They certainly cater to people working on the Alliant energy plant, there are at least 30 other trailers of just those guys alone. Probably because its only a five minute drive to the plant.

Text: I didn't even stay!! I drove 18 hours because my husband and I are having to stay in marshalltown for a job (he has to travel now --pipe fitter/welder) we pulled in & I immediately started searching on the Internet for other places! Let's just say this place is pure TRASHHHHHHH! If you want to stay somewhere that's ragged, busted up, low life, trashy, nasty people then go! However I have standards of living and that Is NOT it! The owners wife didn't know anything my husband was asking, we drove off and never looked back! I was literally so upset at the fact they tried to make it seem so presentable! And a nice area! I called edge town Rv park--the owner CAME TO US--we followed him back to his location he helped set us up and went the extra mile for us! And rent is cheaper! I also asked what a NORMAL light bill should run and he said no more than 75-80$ a month and he pays it! However the trash dump of a place was charging 509 a month and saying people use 200$ a month lights! I OWN A modular home 4 bed and 2 bath and I don't even use 200!!! RIP OFF LOW LIFE TRASH!!
