Text: My fiancé took me here for a relaxing weekend getaway. He hit the jackpot! The home itself it's beautiful! It is very inviting and clean, well decorated, and the beds/pillows are fantastic! The town itself is very quiet and quaint, and everything is within walking distance of the B&B. Paula made a wonderful blueberry pancake breakfast and Larry was great conversation. There is a movie/game room for fun things to do during your stay and beverages provided round the clock.  We will definitely be staying here again!!
