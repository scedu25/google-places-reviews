Bayley House Suite
Rating: 5
Text: We loved the Bayley House.  Robin was so nice!  It was EXTREMELY clean-and I am a clean freak.  The hot tub was awesome and the decor was gorgeous.  I would recommend to anyone.  We hope to go back soon.

Text: We felt like we were in a ritzy hotel. The suite was gorgeous, very clean and beautifully decorated. It was close to a few great small cities and Starved Rock and Mathiessen state parks. The house was in a country setting which was quiet and the suite was very private.

Text: My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary the weekend of the wine fest! It was excellent! Robin was wonderful too.  She went out of her way to accommodate us and answered all our questions.  It was very clean too.
