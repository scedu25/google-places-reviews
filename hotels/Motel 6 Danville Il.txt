Motel 6 Danville Il

Text: I've been on a road trip and have stayed at a few motels already. I really don't expect much going in, it's just a place to sleep and get ready in the morning. This wasn't a good experience. The conditions here are not good. First, the lamp by the bed wouldn't turn on. Then the water in the sink wouldn't drain! There was a cricket and a spider in the bathroom. The toilet wouldn't stop making random noises throughout the night. Pretty sure there was a blood stain on one of the pillowcases. The whole (wood) floor was sticky and tacky, so I kept my shoes on the whole time. There were loose electrical cords hanging from  the walls, so I was reluctant to charge my phone. When I was changing in the morning, a bug crawled on my foot! 
Now here is me being picky, so up to you to take these things into consideration. The window and door is not sealed tight from the outside, so you can easily hear someone walking by or talking. Same for the walls, they are thin so you can hear the other guests next to you talking or checking their voicemail. The shower wasn't the easiest to figure out. They don't have a mini safe or a mini fridge or a microwave or a coffee maker or complimentary breakfast or any nice things to make up for the awful experience. 
Also, the building next to the motel was very burned down. Looks like it was a nice place with the statues in front and such, but the burned building next to this place was the cherry on top! 
Hopefully for future guests sake, they fix all these issues. Or bulldoze and sell the place.

Text: I often stay at Motel 6 because I have always received excellent value for my money. This time was different from the check in all the way through to check out. At check in the clerk was complaining about people parking in the lot all the time doing drugs and fighting. Made me nervous as my room was just off the parking lot. My room was so humid when I walked in that the couch was wet and the bedding damp. I heard dripping in the bathroom and the tub faucet was running slightly and couldn't be shut off. This had been going on for awhile as the tub was stained brown from the rust in the dripping water. When I finally got the room cooled down so it wasn't so humid and I turned down the sheets I found black marks on the sheets that appeared to be something like tar. I don't know if it was picked up in the laundry or if it was from the last person that stayed there. And I can't figure out how the person making the bed missed it as it was visible on both sides of the sheet. I do have pictures of all of these problems if you would like to see them. (I will include them in this survey if possible later on.)  The floor was sticky to walk on. I'm not sure what was being used to clean it but it didn't feel like it was clean. I don't always expect there to be a coffee pot in my room but there has been with my other stays at Motel 6. There was none this time and there was no coffee to be had in the lobby area as there was no one there when I checked out in the morning. I was told to just leave my keys in the room, turn off the lights and the air conditioner and open the drapes. That must be the signal that the room is available for cleaning. I can guarantee you that I will never, ever stop at this Motel 6 again. I was very disappointed and disgusted by the entire experience.

Text: The room was very basic compared to other Motel 6 venues I stayed at. Asked for a No Smoking room but had two ashtrays in room. The floor was new. The only positive. Looks like the place is still under renovation. Not comparable to the last three Motel 6 establishments I've stayed at. Not a good advert for the Motel 6 brand.

Text: This was the worst hotel experience in my life. There was only one towel and two wash cloths but that's not the worse part. There was dead bugs on the wall that looked like someone used their shoe to kill. The blood was still on the walls. The floor were disgusting. It was sticky all over and there was something spilled under the sink and never cleaned up. There was black stuff in the tub that I never did identify. Oh and the paint job looked like someone did it with their fingers. There was very little water pressure, I mean very little. I could go on but the picture should be there for you. I will never stay at a Motel 6 again.

Text: Keep driving! The only thing nice about this places, well two things, the towel holder that holds the used to be white towels, no shower for this girl, and the other nice thing was the girl working the front counter! VERY friendly, smiling, just very welcoming. Then we got to our room. You know how their slogan was, we'll leave the light on for ya, well, half the lights didn't work in our room. They put some laminated wood flooring in I think to try & make it look nice, but it was putting lipstick on a pig! The ceilings were falling, the walls were cracked & had a hole. The shower was rusty & parts missing. If it wasn't 2am & I hadn't been up since 5am & the girl working the counter wasn't so nice, I would have gone someplace else. NOT WORTH SAVING A FEW BUCKS! Trust me, keep driving! Reminds me of a slasher movie motel! Lol??????  Safe travels ya all!
