Rating: 1
Text: Disgusting room terrible customer service. Found a sex toy package in a made bed. Cleaning rags on the t.v. and desk. The bathroom stunk. told the guy and he acted like I should be thankful he gave me another room. Never said sorry and wouldn't comp anything. Completely rude and disrespectful. Got my money back and will NEVER stay at a red roof slum inn again.1 star only because I can't leave a zero.

Text: A room was $25 cheaper than the comfort inn across the street. Staff was wonderful. My room on 3rd floor was very nice, Bed was super comfortable. The sheets were a little worn with a small stain and hole. The elevator had a funky smell. I would definately here stay again.

Text: I gave 1 star only because of the helpful staff. Otherwise there would be no stars. Just like there was no coffee maker, practically no towels (2 for a family of 4) and no sleep sagging mattresses. What there was in abundance was chemicals in the tiny smelly swimming pool. We couldn't see below the surface! If it hadn't been for promising my 3 yr old grandson NO WAY would I have stepped foot in that water. At least we hope it was chemical that gave the pool it's unearthly cosmic blue hue. All in all just a place to sleep when visiting Holiday World. I had hoped for better.

Text: Decent price for a decent room.  Staff was not rude but not friendly either.  Breakfast was OK.
