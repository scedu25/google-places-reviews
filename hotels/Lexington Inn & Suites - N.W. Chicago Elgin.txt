Lexington Inn & Suites - N.W. Chicago/Elgin

Text: 0/10 STARS. DO NOT RECOMMEND. The room was 85 degrees on the hottest day of September but they insisted the A/C was working. 3 people were booked but they provided only 2 towels. So we had to use pool towels the next day. Not cute. They had no more towels when we asked for more. The advertised hot tub was shut down. There was bread and water for breakfast so you're kind of in prison. If all you need is sleeping then you're good to go

Text: Negatives: TV in our room didn't work. Beds were very loud. The pool room has a very slippery tile floor which is a terrible idea. 

Positives: It looks nice, and has a nice feel to it. Free Wi-Fi. The breakfast provided isn't anything crazy but hey, free breakfast.

Text: People at front desk were rude, Covers and sheets were dirty with stains on them. A/C was not working, refrigerator was broken, room had odor and on top of that, I requested a late check out the night BEFORE and at 11 in the morning I get a loud banging on my door and it was the guy at the front desk THAT I TOLD I was having a late check out before. He said I didn't say anything like that and rushed me and my guest to leave within 5 mins or we will be charged extra. I slammed the door in his face and packed my bags and got the hell out of there. Worst hotel/motel experience I ever had. I see why the price was SO cheap. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE. The Super 8 would've been better than this probably!

Text: Room was adequate. Staff was friendly. Halls smelt strongly like marijuana. Free breakfast was a nice touch but not great quality and coffee was cold. 3/5

Text: I've been to my fair share of hotels and this was by far the absolute worst. There was a bad smell as soon as we walked in that just lingered throughout the whole building and eventually into the room. My boyfriend walked in and took a seat on the bed and right away said it smelled like cigarettes as the whole room did. We then decided to check the bed sheets and found hair despite the fact we had JUST walked in. The website says they have an indoor pool and hot tub but there is no hot tub. We went to the pool twice and the first time we had asked for more towels because there were only 2 in the room and we used them for the pool, we were given 1 and told more would be sent to our room-they weren't. We went back to our room to take a break and found a spider in the bathroom so we decided to go back to the pool which was supposed to close at 10 (we went at 9) and they told us to wait 20 minutes because they were putting chemicals which is extremely inconsiderate to guests given they decided to do this during the last hour the pool was open instead of waiting. We left the pool and went back to the room to see if any towels were brought and when I tried to call the front desk the phone in the room did not even work and we didn't get any towels for the rest of the night. Extremely ridiculous I have received better service in a motel. Would not stay here again if it was my last option.
