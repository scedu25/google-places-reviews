Text: My family and I have been coming here for years. Its overall a really nice campground. The nearest bathroom is always filled with bugs but who cares... You camping right? The shower is walkable from any camper which is perfect for a quick shower and exercise. The owners are really nice when you show up with any questions at any point of time in the day. We are coming back in 3 days and eish we would never have to leave.

Text: Very nice grounds, clean restrooms and showers.  24/7 laundry.  Wifi. Clean pool. Kid and pet friendly.  Beautiful view of the cedar river and awesome sunsets. Close to the interstate, so noisy and difficult for sleep.

Text: Pros: Affordable and people were friendly

Cons: 
-24/7 road traffic noises to the point of hard to hear someone talking to you while outside.
 -  Terrible internet
 - Got there and then they told us the mini golf is CLOSED indefinitely. A big let down to little kids. 
- Playground area just a big sandbox with old swings, a few tractor tires, one metal jungle gym and a rickety old slide that had a split in the middle. 
- Ended up having to go to Davenport for kids fun.
Defiantly will NOT be back.
