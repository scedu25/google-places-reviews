Super 8 Marysville

Text: Very nice. The room I got (I didn't ask for this) was actually an efficiency. The room was very nice. It had a 4 burner stove with oven and broiler, sink and fridge, microwave and coffee/teapot, iron and a fullsize ironing board. Oh, and a nice TV too. You could have an extended stay and be very comfortable. There is an outdoor pool but was closed for the season the week before we got there. I wouldn't have minded staying there another day but I only had a one night stay because I was only there 4 a wedding in that town.
