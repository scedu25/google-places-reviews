Robert Newlon Airpark
Rating: 4
Text: A nice little park that met our needs perfectly!  We had a pull thru, sites are gravel. Park is simple but ok. Full hookup, fair price. On an airstrip where they do skydiving on weekends and there's a small restaurant that is open Thurs-Sun.  There is a train that came by too.

Text: This campground has excellent WIFI. Bathroomd and showers are real nice and very clean. I have stayed here on 3 diffreny occasions.  All sites are grass and pull though.  Owners are extremely nice and remembered me
 The reason I'm giving a 4 star instead of a 6 id because no picnic tables or fire pits.

Text: Nice campground for a quick or extended stay on the river. It's very close to the railroad tracks which trains come through in the near future night. Good Sam's is accepted.

Text: Eclectic is the word here. Reminiscent of the old family owned marinas on the Chesapeake Bay. Its a little community that's more than willing to invite newcomers. Nice little restaurant thst has the same atmosphere. No pool no Wi-Fi but comfortable none the less. Restrooms were clean. People were nice.

Text: Great place to stay and fairly easy to get to from I64. The entry road is narrow, but the on-coming traffic was RV friendly and pulled over to let us pass. Good, high speed WIFI, strong Verizon LTE cell phone signal, open sattelite TV, decent restaurant/bar and friendly staff.
