Text: This is a wonderful place to stay. Friendly service and large clean beautiful rooms. My wife and I have stayed here twice. The first stay we did not get the breakfast (not big breakfast eaters). The second stay we chose to give the breakfast a try and it was wonderful! Our next stay will include the delicious food again! Thanks!

The rooms are large and very nicely appointed.   Can't go wrong staying here.

Text: The location was right near some restaurants making it very easy to grab some lunch or dinner. The owner brought (delicious!) breakfast to the room at whatever time you chose making it a very relaxing stay. I thoroughly enjoyed the open floor plan of the room, the historic feel and furniture, while still maintaining modern amenities such as the large bed and personal jacuzzi in the bathroom.

Text: The owners are so friendly and will recommend places for whatever you'd like to do. The building has been beautifully renovated and is well kept, and the rooms are incredible! The breakfast delivered to your room in the morning is also delicious.

Text: This was my elementary school. The owners have done a marvelous job making this old building a bed and breakfast.
