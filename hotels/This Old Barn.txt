Text: This Old Barn sits on several acres of property that include a tree farm, a maple grove, wide lawns and a large pond. The house is a skillfully converted barn offering several beautifully decorated upstairs rooms and one downstairs room. Owners Mike and Ivisa Huber will proudly show you pictures of the work, much of it that they did themselves. Beds vary anywhere from king size, to queen sized, to two singles, to a suite with additional bunk beds for children. All rooms have private baths. The country landscape views are spectacular! The breakfasts are wonderful, too, and private dinners can often be arranged. We enjoyed the German Honeymoon Suite for our anniversary stay. It is hard to say which we enjoyed more: the jacuzzi, the incredible meals including a steak dinner (it beat Texas Roadhouse! Whaaat?!), or our conversations with Ivisa. Make sure to try Mike's home made maple syrup, too.
