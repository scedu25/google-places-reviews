Text: Very nice!!! Full 2 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, full kitchen, and living room. Balcony overlooking the beautiful golf course. Best value for your money in Brown County!!! Food at the 19th Hole is also great and convenient!!

Text: One of the best golf trips I've ever been on! Villas were very spacious and comfortable. The staff was very personable and friendly. Golf Course was in great shape for all the rain they had earlier that month. 126 holes in 3-1/2 days did take it's toll on this old guy, but I'll most certainly return again!!

Text: The Salt Creek Golf Retreat is a wonderful golf course with many scenic views. Our group really enjoyed our long weekend there...and the staff is even better than the course. We couldn't have enjoyed our stay any more thanks to them. We highly recommend Salt Creek and are already looking forward to coming back next year.
