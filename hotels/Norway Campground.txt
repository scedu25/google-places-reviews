Norway Campground
Rating: 5
Text: I have been to many campgrounds and as soon as I stepped foot in this one I knew it would be a great place. Staff and owners are very friendly and helpful. Other campers are also friendly. Bath house is always clean and stocked. Very relaxing to sit by the fire and hear the small waterfall in the creek. A few miles from Indiana Beach. So much to do around here if you just go do it. I love this place!!!!

Text: Love going to Norway, everyone is so friendly with one another and it's so relaxing to sit by the creek and the fire. The camp store is great when you don't feel like going to town for a couple items. Fun weekends here especially when they have events going on usually over holiday weekends.
