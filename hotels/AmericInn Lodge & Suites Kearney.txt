Text: Pet friendly, rooms felt clean. Pillows were odd, they were square. I didn't find the beds particularly comfortable. Complimentary breakfast included, but was a bit lacking. Coffee was good.

Text: The motel was great. The room was a great size. The bathroom was great. It did have a fridge but no microwave. The beds were comfortable. The swimming pool was a nice feature that my son loved and I loved the hot tub.

Text: No complaints. Although a little dated the hotel had everything we needed to spend the night and move on. Only recommendation would be to add plugs to next to the beds to charge phones. Great breakfast and coffee!

Text: Excellent hotel!  Clean and plenty of parking.  We were greeted by De'Janae when we arrived late at night and took a late night swim.  We love that the pool was unlocked and that the bathrooms were clean and single unisex bathrooms. The continental breakfast was great though I would have appreciated yogurts and jelly that didn't have sucralose. :). The hotel accommodates dogs and though there was one next door to us we couldn't really hear it other than a couple of barks.  High praise.  Extra points for shampoo that is made in America to reduce carbon footprint.

Text: Rooms were great for the price. Pool and hot tub was clean. Only reason i gave it 4 stars was because the free breakfast was pretty basic and was hoping for a littke more.
