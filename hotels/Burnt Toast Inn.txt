Text: Warm, welcoming, beautiful place. Think loving Aunt's house whom has traveled all over and wants you to enjoy your stay. Gorgeous rooms, amazing bathrooms!  Sarah is the perfect hostess, and has a lovely singing voice(we heard you on our way out!) :D Thanks so much, Sarah!

Text: While in Ann Arbor, I stayed at the house on Washington Street, and had a meal at the house on William Street.  I found both locations warm and inviting, full of tasteful decorations and bold, distinctive colors. My own room, the North Suite, was clean and very comfortable, with a king-size bed and lots of space to spread out (including a large bathroom with a tub).  Sarah and Allison were prompt, friendly, and always eager to help; that said, I never felt intruded upon. The food was very good too. I will stay at the Burnt Toast Inn again.

Text: Clean and cozy place, great and healthy breakfast and interesting, pleasant furniture (and utensils and art) from around the world.
Nice conversations with the host as well.
I would choose it again for another stay in the area.
