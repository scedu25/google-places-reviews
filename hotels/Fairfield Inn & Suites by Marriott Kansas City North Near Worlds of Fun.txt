Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Kansas City North Near Worlds of Fun
Rating: 3
Text: Decent hotel. The amenities listed were available. I would recommend new carpet desperately and even new furniture. Chair in room badly stained. Friendly workers everywhere! Decent breakfast for sure. Mrs. Keisha is very pleasant!

Text: I can't rave enough about the staff! They were so accommodating and friendly. 10/10 would recommend based on that alone. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. The shower had a really intense incline though. Almost slipped and fell a few times haha

Text: Life long Marriott customer but have to be honest not all that impressed with the hotel. The staff was... something special... but the rooms lived up to my expectations. Plus side breakfast was good! Probably won't stay here again in future visits.

Text: The staff is very friendly but the hotel is disgustingly dirty and very outdated.  The bathroom was horrible. The room was just dirty in general and there was lots of stains.  We played cards down in the breakfast area on Saturday night. We noticed that there was a container of shredded cheese out on the counter still.  I dumped it our for fear they would attempt to serve that with breakfast again the next morning.  Breakfast was horrible none of us even ate there.  We had to buy breakfast somewhere else even though we should have been able to have free breakfast.  The beds were comfortable though.  Hopefully they were safe to sleep in based on the other conditions.  ?

Text: The hotel has been converted from a Country Inn to a Fairfield. Don't expect Marriott quality. Garbage piled up at the side entrance of the hotel. Red lipstick on my pillow. Beds are uncomfortable. In don't know what caused my child's asthma to flare up as soon as we stepped in the room and eased after we left. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. I am really disappointed. No more Fairfield
