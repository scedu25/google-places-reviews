Text: Very modern and we'll laid out. Nice bathrooms, and good Continental breakfast. They have a little bar and an area to buy convenience food and microwave meals, which was nice for when I spent the whole day in my room. Super friendly staff! I'd stay there again!

Text: Super staff, exceptional service. Nice room with a fridge and microwave. The fridge was quiet and the bed pretty comfy. The room had nice up to date amenities for computers etc. I would recommend that they use some fabric softener on the sheets. Pillowcases were pretty scratchy. Also the toilet paper was some of the cheapest I've ever seen. These little touches can make a big difference. Also,
This is a brand new hotel and a little hard to find, needs a sign at the end of the road.
