Text: Best stay I have had in a hotel. Room was clean. We stayed in the king bedroom with a Whirlpool tub. Which was clean and easy to use (turn nob on the wall to turn on the electric.) They had complimentary Hershey's kisses and a microwave popcorn packet in the room. The pool was open untill 11pm which was nice. There was a whirlpool hot tub in the pool area which was so nice. The complementary breakfast was the best I've ever had. There was another guest that complained for the lack of gluten free things but they did have fresh cut fruit available. Very nice place to stay.
