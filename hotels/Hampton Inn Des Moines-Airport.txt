Hampton Inn Des Moines-Airport
Rating: 4
Text: We had a nice largish mini fridge in the room so that is a plus along with standard microwave. Beds were lower to the floor than average and the room size was smaller. Not a whole lot of counter space in the bathroom. Also beware this hotel is really close to the airport so planes are loud in the morning. They usually stop around 11pm in the evening but start again early. But otherwise I like the area the hotel is in, the staff has been nice, and our stay comfortable.

Text: Comfy bed. Old hotel. Super loud airplane traffic. I typically love Hampton inn but will look at another one than this. Better to drive away from the airport.

Text: Pretty nice room. Small, but comfortable. One complaint I had was the hall ways smelled like they had mold or some kind of moisture in them. Building was being updated as we were there. Breakfast and everything was good.

Text: This hotel was located in an easy to access area by the airport, parking was free and open, and the rooms and lobby we're very clean. The continental breakfast provided a lot of options including hot foods. The only negatives here were the room provided very little noise insulation and the pillows are not that cozy. Nice place to stay and would stay again.. bringing our own pillows next time!

Text: One of the staff members wasn't very friendly upon checkin. Room was ok. Bathroom is small. You can hear plans taking off (which should be expected, since it's near the airport), but it wasn't too disruptive.
