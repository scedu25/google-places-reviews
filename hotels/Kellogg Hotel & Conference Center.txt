Kellogg Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 4
Text: I was here for a conference, and did not stay overnight, so I can't comment on the rooms. The facilities were very nice on the first floor, but the garden level could use some updating. The bathrooms and conference rooms were outdated. The food that was served was delicious, and there was a wide variety available. It was also a plus that playing was attached to the conference center, and parking was validated for my specific conference. It did take almost a half hour to get out of the parking garage when everyone was trying to leave due to having only one exit. Overall, I would recommend using this conference center for a professional event.

Text: My experience was very enjoyable the staff were courteous and helpful. Cost is $3 how to park inside there parking ramp which would be fine for people that are not staying at the conference center what I feel with your room key that fee should be waived. The food portions for meals are a bit small but the food is very good, meals from room service are very prompt and even the maintenance staff responds quickly to your issues if any.

Text: Attended a professional conference at the Kellogg's Center. The room was spacious and immaculately clean. The bathroom was a bit odd, eschewing the standard tub for a single shower, with no stall. This led to an issue where the floor would be perpetually damp unless you took steps to soak up the moisture. It was still a wonderful experience.

Text: Guest room was small but well equiped. In room entertainment is limited to whatever channels you can pick up on the TV. This is my only negative. Meeting facilities are very nice as the hotel is a part of the Michigan State University Hospitality School of Business. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. There is an on-site restaurant call the State. Plenty of amenities nearby like golf, bowling, or swimming.
