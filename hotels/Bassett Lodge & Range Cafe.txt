Bassett Lodge & Range Cafe

Text: Had lunch at the range. Good burgers. Better than average fries. Nice small town friendly service. Downtown is quite a long way off Hwy 20, but it's well worth the detour.

Text: Five Star Hangout!

We always hit this place when up in KeyaPaha for the hunting.  It's a classic, consistent small town restaurant with consistently excellent hot beef sandwiches.  Décor is ranch country/cowboy, in a truly authentic historic society location.  

When staying in Bassett Nebraska while deer hunting, what better way to unwind than at the historic Bassett Lodge, which was recently remodeled in 1949.  Put on the Billie Holiday Pandora channel, hang your .45 on the chair and kick back with a hot bath.  I think I’m doing this yearly from now on...

Text: Quaint historic place to stay. The staff was pleasant. The rooms could use a little work as there was wallpaper peeling in the rooms. Everything else was clean. The only down side was that there is no in-room temperature control.

Text: Awesome hotel. We hiked the cowboy trail and stayed here the first night. If you're biking this is the place for you. The hotel decor is really cool all restored from the original version. The restaurant attached is great! I have no complaints. The shower was hot and the bed was good. The owners are doing a great job with this place!  And the restaurant has lattes and espresso and all sorts of coffees, I was not expecting to find that here.

Text: Food is good, but portions and quality are inconsistent. Limited hours, but awesome environment. Staff is very attentive! The first time we went, out burgers were top notch. The next time, not so good. I'll update my review next time I visit. :)
