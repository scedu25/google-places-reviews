Holiday Inn Club Vacations Timber Creek Resort
Rating: 3
Text: We had a great week-long stay. The facilities were clean and maintained, the rooms were very nice, the kitchen had a great selection of pots, pans, and utensils (not always the case in places like this), the lake was beautiful, and the staff were all really nice. Plus, with free putt putt, great games in the activity center, fun special events for kids, and horseback riding, all in all a very good experience. The only reason I can't give it four stars is the road noise. It is SO loud! This is especially true if you are on the road side rooms. Thin windows don't help, and more than  once we were awakened I'm the night by the rhythmic thunder of breaking semi trucks. I feel bad because I really don't know what, if anything, they can do about this.

Text: Really pretty area. Lots of empty buildings could be utilized in new ways. Decor is dated. Enjoyed the pedal boats but they should cost less than $6 per hour. Staff is friendly. Rooms seemed clean. Lake needs attention. Some areas really seemed abandoned. Ghost town. Gate entry was allowed at night without showing parking pass or anything.

Text: We love to get away here. It is not far from the city, but it is a relaxing setting with lakes, fishing, tennis, a pool, paddle boats, miniature golf, and other activities. Holiday Inn is going to be doing a lot of renovations there soon. Highly recommended!

Text: The quality of resort has rapidly declined. They make you pay to wash your own towels (which to me is unheard of) and their rooms are outdated and poorly kept. 10 years ago the quality and pride they had about their product was clearly shown. Now I feel like I might as well stay at 3-star hotel.
