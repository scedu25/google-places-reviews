Text: The employees here are very kind and are of much help. Everything was neat. The reason I'm giving three stars, is I wish this hotel was a bit more lively and up to date. For a 2 star hotel it's alright. However, I've been to better 2 star hotels. This one undoubtedly gets the job done

Text: This hotel was very clean, had amazing staff! I enjoyed the indoor pool and the jacuzzi tub that we had in our room. Will definitely stay there again the next time we are around Ottumwa.

Text: Nice Hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms and a good looking hotel all around. My only problem was that I like to sleep with the windows open and it sounded like there was a train track pretty close to the hotel. However, once I closed the window the room was nice and quiet.

Text: With weather coming in, i needed a room for the night. First hotel, no rooms. Next stop was AmericInn. No rooms. I start to drive to the next stop and the gentleman at the desk rushes out and tells me he just had a cancellation. So i got a room! He was awesome to come find me so i could get some rest. I will definitely check here first next time. Thank you so much for all your efforts!
