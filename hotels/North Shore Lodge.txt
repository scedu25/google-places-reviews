Text: I think they are fantastic place to bring my family and I will most definitely be back. I don't know if there's much to complain about other than probably other people there that are vacationing from time to time and even that isn't very bad overall I really can't complain I'm just hesitant to give a 5-star rating to pretty much anything I would have to say they would have to go way above and beyond. But as far as the the lodge I would say they do a very good job and yes I will be back again with my family!

Text: Absolutely wonderful stay, staff was extremely friendly. Rooms were clean. The only thing that could use some attention is that our room really didn't have any usuable outlets and it stated there was a fish cleaning station when infact it has been closed for a couple years now according to one of the staff members. Other than that is was a wonderful stay and we will be coming back next year.

Text: Location was nice. The amenities were as advertised, except the baseboard in the bathroom wasn't attached to the wall, causing a buildup of gross fluid.
