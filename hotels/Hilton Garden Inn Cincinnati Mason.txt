Text: I've staying here.  My third stay here over the last year and the hotel staff and service is excellent.  The rooms are impeccably clean. The in hotel restaurant has a fantastic breakfast and good selection of food for dinner/lunch.  Highly suggest the sirloin steak,  it's great !

Text: I found  most of the front desk people pleasant. My only complaint was the cleanliness of our room.  It appeared that neither dusting, vacuuming or cleaning mirrors were part of the system. I traded in our towels only to be told they had none to replace. Bathrooms received an all too quick swipe of surfaces. One of the beds had a large coffee stain spill which I discovered when "I" made up the bed. A tad shoddy.

Text: There was no bathtub in the suite where we stayed, and the a/c needed a filter change, which caused the room to be so sweltering hot that I couldn't sleep before going to a big event that I had been anticipating for months. The employee who delivered our room service was taciturn and unfriendly, even though we tipped her on top of the mandatory tip we were not aware of. The only saving grace was the helpful front desk employees and the wonderful maintenance man.
