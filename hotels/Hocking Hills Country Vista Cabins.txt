Dishes to cook, firewood for fires, and an awesome hot tub. The owners are a little,older but very friendly and everything was really clean and neat. Thank you for a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back!

Text: The cabins are quaint. The atmosphere is just what you would expect of a cabin. My fiancee and I had guest over for dinner, and that was a problem with management. Only those that were on the contract were allowed to be upon the property. Mana2arrived with the sheriff in tow, and my friends were told to leave immediately. We were in the process of making dinner, and they were not allowed to stay for even that.

Text: My husband and I stayed in the Dove cabin for Thanksgiving and loved it!  The cabin is very clean and cozy, even the cabinets had everything arranged as though it was a model home.  The hot tub was squeaky clean and very comfortable.  We had cell service and digital TV which helped us stayed connected to the outside world.  The owners were very helpful and gave us lots of information for hiking, restaurants and local area attractions.  We will definitely stay here again!
