Text: Chief Logan Lodge is excellent in every way. I've stayed here twice in 2017 with my husband and 3 children to visit family and for a funeral. The staff is very friendly, really just amazing, especially the chef and kitchen staff. We arrived late one evening just 10 minutes before the hotel restaurant was going to close and our family party of 7 was able to get a full dinner to go with no problem. The chef herself came out to get our order and treated us like royalty. She even included a few extra items free of charge. It's good to know if you stay for a funeral they give you a special rate. The service is very similar to that at Disney World, top notch. Beautiful facilities, pool, fireplace, workout room, fire pits, playground. Love it!
