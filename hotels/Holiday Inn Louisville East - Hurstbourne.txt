Holiday Inn Louisville East - Hurstbourne

Text: I attended a conference here but did not stay overnight so I can't comment on the guest rooms. 

You can tell that the renovations were really well done! But there aren't enough public restrooms for a conference center of this size. It was so bizarre. The large ballroom also doesn't have electrical outlets for easy laptop charging. An all-day conference requires that! Otherwise, a very nice facility!

Text: Super nice place! The hotel is newly remodeled and looks nice. The aesthetic is modern with a touch of horse. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and the breakfast buffet was good. Most importantly - the rooms have powerful enough AC that you can make the room super cold, something that I've found to be a rarity in hotels.

Text: Very clean and spacious. There was an annoying vacuum or something running all night in the room next door though. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean with plenty of towels. The room was reasonably priced as well.
