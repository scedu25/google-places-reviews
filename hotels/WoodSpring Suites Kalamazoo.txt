Text: It is nice to be able to get a miniature apartment for so cheap, but unfortunately the limited housekeeping and potential to get a smoking room makes this less than ideal for certain folks. As someone who assumes nearly all rooms will be non-smoking, I was very taken aback to discover my room was a smoking room. This was very unpleasant in the beginning, but either I bece noseblind or the smell actually faded away the longer I was there. Overall, the room was fine, even if nothing special. It was quite nice to have a full kitchen though, even if my stay was only a single night.

Text: I would never stay here again. New GM! They have had employees quit or he would fire you. Services are not good. No Maintenance Tech on duty 24/7 when you have problem. Building isn't secure. Camera's only inside NOT outside to. Your vehicle could get damage or stolen. GM knocks on your door at 8 am wanting payment or out by 11 am. Over all, I don't recommend this place.
