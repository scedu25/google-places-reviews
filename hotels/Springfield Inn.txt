Text: Somewhat difficult to find via Google maps. It kept wanting to take us to Lincoln Park drive instead of Lincoln drive. Nice standard accommodations, quiet, clean, and surprisingly soft towels compared to other budget hotels. Fresh Continental breakfast. Overall a nice stay for a great price.

Text: Friendly staff. Reasonable rates. Rooms had cable tv but were not flat screens. Pool was nice and the juice machine in lobby was a real treat all day.

Text: Nice and friendly staff., however, this site would be much more appealing if the owners would update, clean, and sanitize  the rooms. Many rooms need repairs.

Text: My son stayed here after attending the wedding of one of his fraternity brothers. Several other of his fraternity brothers also stayed here. Upon checking in, he was told that they must charge him a $50 security deposit in addition to the cost of his room. After checking in and meeting up with his friends, he asked them if they were  charged a security deposit. None of them were asked to pay a deposit, however none of his other fraternity brothers were African American......enough said.
