Last Resort Campground
Rating: 4
Text: I found the place quaint.  It offers  most of the amenities without the feeling of being at a Holiday Inn for RV' s.  Well kept and staff were available and friendly.

Text: This camp is very basic, but pretty full.  Has a nice fishing pond as well as pool.  TV is only what you can pick up with your antenna.  I haven't tried the WiFi, I use my Hot Spot.

Text: Worst camp ground I have ever stayed in. At 8:30 at night they have a nightly drunken golfcart praid. Loud sirens and flashing lights. Thought the police were in the park. Loud and not nice. The office thinks this is how you run a park.
