Text: Great location right off the freeway and that's the ONLY good thing!  Disgusting room condition.  Upon getting into the room at 1 am traveling across the country, we found pee and toilet paper in the toilet, hair all over the sink and tub and at least one of the beds was made without changing the sheets which had fresh blood stains.  
Stay if your shots are up to date!

Text: For  a 1 night stay on our trip to Florida this place is great. Clean rooms, easy check in, and very helpful front desk staff. For older hotel the quality is good.

Text: The room was like any other hotel room. It had a really neat soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower. My bog issue with it is they added $16 to our card forrediculous "taxes" and never told us anything about it.
