Stockton Mobile Home & RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We needed a decent place to camp for a few days while I fished Stockton Lake and most of the parks I looked at around the lake didn't have full hookups and the lots were too small for our Motorhome, then I found this park.  This park has large, well maintained lots with 50 amp service and full hookups.  The units that appear to be permanent here are well maintained and neat.  They also have some of the best WiFi I have had in an RV park.  It is quiet and peaceful and the owner is friendly and helpful.  I will happily stay here any time I am in Stockton.
