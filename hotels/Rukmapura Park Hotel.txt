Text: They are a good 15 minutes from Fairfield, so not a great location if you will be doing a lot of back and forth to town. But overall the rooms were quiet and comfortable. Would stay again.

Text: This is a perfect place to get out in nature, breathe some fresh air and get away from the city. It is quaint with a friendly staff that essentially leave you alone unless you need something. Run by a family, I enjoyed my time here.
