Text: This hotel is by far the dirtiest place I've ever stayed at. To start,  I was supposed to have 2 rooms with 2 queen beds in each but was given 1 king in each room. I asked for cots and they said they didn't have any.  Luckily we had an RV in the parking lot for people to sleep in.  There were no locks on the bathroom doors and the "hot tubs" in the rooms were boarded over. We also noticed a few rooms with the door handle were broken off. Just a complete dump. 
The only good thing about this hotel is that it is less than a mile from Memorial Stadium.

Text: The whole top floor smelled like cigarettes including my room. There were pubic and head hair in the bathtub. Toilet had urine on the back. I went to ask for another room and none were unavailable. So housekeeping came and cleaned the toilet with toilet paper and water NO DISINFECTANT! So I had some disinfectant wipes and did it myself. I wonder what hidden treasures the bed has?

Text: The owners wife is a very rude woman. My husband and I have had to stay there a few time and have gotten nothing but problems out of her. 
Plus they discriminated against us, always trying to put us downstairs in the rooms that they put the people they think are how should I say "lower class".

Text: Worst place to stay. This hotel should be shut down ASAP. As soon as you go in you get this sketchy feel of the place. The room is so so so outdated and smelled bad. Roaches in the room. The walls look like they are molding. The bed and sheets stink. The bed was a king but under the box springs are two twins holding up a king sized mattress. We left and sketchy people were basically partying and being very loud.

Text: Very very outdated, old furniture, the tv was 15 years old no flat screen. In room bathroom was dirty. Water pressure in shower was low it took 15 minutes to rinse shampoo out of my hair. No alarm clock and no hair dryer. Just the worst.
Absolutely miserable experience. No lockes on outside doors. Didn't feel safe at all. Never again.
