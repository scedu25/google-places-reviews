Text: Good basic no-frills RV park. Fine for an overnight stay or two. Some shaded sites, some partial/open. No-frills restroom and showers. Near freeway but need to drive 1/3 to 1/2 mile on dusty access road. Wifi but it's okay to slow. We stayed here 2 nites.

Text: Nice campground, convenient location, just needs an opaque curtain on the dressing area in the ladies shower house - you can see everything through the one that's there.
