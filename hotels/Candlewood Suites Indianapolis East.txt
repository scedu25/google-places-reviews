Candlewood Suites Indianapolis East
Rating: 4
Text: I stayed at the Candlewood Suites Indianapolis East for two nights while in town for a conference. The price was great and the hotel is relatively new with well-appointed suites. Our room had a queen-sized bed and a full kitchen. The hotel is targeted towards extended stays, so while there aren't things like a free breakfast and daily housekeeping service, there are other convenient services like a laundry area, games and movies to borrow, and a small convenience markets in case you want to grab food to prepare in your room. All the staff we interacted with we're incredibly friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the hotel has a very small parking lot; we got back fairly late and couldn't find a parking spot in the hotel lot or their overflow lot (which is unlit, which is a bit odd). Ultimately we talked to the front desk attendant said we could park in the lot of the Quality Inn next door so all was fine in the end, but it was a bit of an annoyance. All in all, the Candlewood Suites was a nice place to stay and is a hotel I will keep in mind if I find myself in the area in the future.

Text: Not bad. Unlike some people I don't complain about every little thing. I've been in worse hotels, the rooms are spacious and clean. That's good enough for me.

Text: Great place, very friendly people, kitchens are nice and the rooms are spacious. Just a side note-ps4 and internet here won't work.

Text: I love the fact we have a kitchen. They also allow you to borrow appliances. They also allow pets. Next time might bring my cat
