Text: We are in the newer section that got rebuilt after the fire, the rooms are big and very quiet. The staff is pleasant and friendly. The bar had great music. We have been here before and will be back again.

Text: I love the way the rooms are set up. While the view isn't supurb, it's still beautiful off of the balcony. Nothing like McDonald's going about its business to wake you up in the morning. Enjoyed the stay completely.

Text: Good food with live piano music. Fried biscuits and the local apple butter obviate the need for dessert.

Text: Overall the stay was good. I only had a few complaints. The first complaint was there is no refrigerator and microwave in the room. My second complaint was housekeeping was in my room without my knowledge.

Text: Went on the off season so the room was very affordable. Older style hotel but very clean and comfortable. Great restaurant too.
