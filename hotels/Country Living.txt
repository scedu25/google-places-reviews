Text: Country Living is located just east of Tipton, Indiana on County Road 25 West. We have 99 sites and a playground for the children. We have paved streets and individual paved off-street parking. Our average sites are 35 feet by 95 feet and can hold homes up to 16 feet x 80 foot with room to spare. Tipton schools are ranked one of the highest in the state of Indiana, with great teachers, superb sports programs, and college prep courses. We also have a "Boys and Girls Club" that offer after school activities for all ages. Our current manager has been with us since 1991 and lives on site in the community. All of our residents enjoy the down home atmosphere we have at Country Living. We are a diversified community with residents of all ages and ethnic background. Each year we have several community activities which includes; pitch-ins, a Halloween party, Santa and Mrs. Claus come to visit and bring goodies, and the Easter Bunny comes with lots of eggs for all to enjoy. Our community is more like an extended family that watches after each other and extends a "helping hand" when needed.
