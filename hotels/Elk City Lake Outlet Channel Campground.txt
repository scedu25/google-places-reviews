Elk City Lake Outlet Channel Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Nice place to camp with R.V. hookups. Well maintained and the hosts are very friendly approachable people. It's a great place to fish and catch plenty of blues, channels, white bass, crappie, gar, drum, and sometimes flathead when they are releasing water from the lake.

Text: Very quiet, spacious, and well maintained campground with a friendly, helpful camp host. No streetlights so it's a perfect place for star watching. Spotty cell phone reception and no TV reception, if that matters to you. The campground is also surrounded by the best stand of 6 to 8 foot high prairie grasses I've seen. The campground is run by the Corp of Engineers so there is no day use fee.
