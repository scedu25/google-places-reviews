Cottonwood Lakes

Text: I have been camping there since I was old enough to walk. It is a nice small family run campground. They have a park with various playground equipment including a smaller slide for the younger kids and a larger one for the bigger kids. There is a beach to play on and a designated swimming area with a dock to jump in the water. Other thing to enjoy include fishing, basketball, shuffle board, volley ball, and tether ball.They also have special activities on holiday weekends and an open air dance once a year. The rest of the experience is up to you (cards, campfires, walking around the lakes, family, and bring your friends or making new ones)!
