Motel 6 Wichita Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Room was very clean. I was in the back and it was very quiet. New floors, no carpet (big plus). The lady who checked me in was very pleasant. Great value. I love that Motel 6 is pet friendly. Fluffy the cat gives it 4 paws up, he liked the garden view from the window the best.

Text: Average place.  Was not expecting 5 star, but it was clean enough, everything worked like it should and it was quiet enough.

Text: I was traveling through Wichita and just needed a clean and simple room for the night. This room was perfect. Check in was quick and easy, the beds were comfortable, and the shower was hot.

Text: Stayed there last October. I found two bed bugs crawling on the floor of my room. Out door court yard areas had trash on the grass that wasn't picked up during the four days I was there and the side walks were dirty. I had stayed there about 10 times over the past several years. This motel has definitely gone down hill.
