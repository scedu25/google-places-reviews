Text: My family & I have been coming here for years for our yearly family reunion.  Every year we say the same thing.  Nice people, nice looking rooms, decent breakfast (if filled) but the beds... the beds are as hard as rocks!!! My mother had to sleep in the chair, I had to sleep on top of multiple pillows.  Our backs are hating us.  Was told that they are building a new location across the street.  Hopefully it will have comfortable beds!

Text: The accommodation's were comfortable, even extra pillows! The bathroom could have been a little cleaner; there was trash under the bathroom sink and hair on the wall of the shower. Other than that, the breakfast was quite good! People here were very nice!

Text: Always a good choice to stop while passing through on I-70. The prices are usually good. The rooms are always clean. Most of the staff has been there for a long time. They remember their repeat customers.

Text: Location is good but the sign needs to be by the road. Would have been nice to have the ac running when we got to our room. Took hours to cool down

Text: Great stay right off Interstate 70! Make sure to hit the Eisenhower Presidential Library, which is only 5-10 minutes away. The pool was pleasant, free Wi-Fi was fast, and breakfast made it all worth the money.
