Hyatt Rosemont
Rating: 5
Text: Exactly what you expect from Hyatt. Comfortable room, bed, pillows. Clean and neatly decorated. Friendly, helpful staff. Being allergic to feathers, I am especially grateful that the alternative bedding is just as luxurious as the regular. No surprises.

Text: The hotel is in decent condition and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The check in staff was nice and courteous. The Networks restaurant staff service needs improvement. The walls in between the rooms are pretty thin so you can hear your neighbor coughing and their loud conversations.

Text: Excellent customer service.  Clean and quiet.  Close to a casino and walking distance from the famous L.  Wonderful location without downtown prices.

Text: Convenient hotel for business. Airport shuttle every half hour. 20 mins walk to Rosemont subway station is nice although the end is quite challenging (need to cross big roads).

Text: The food is amazing and so are the rooms. Very impressed. I'm hard to please. But Hyatt Rosemont pleased me. From the staff to the room and bar amazing. Turned a bad day into a good!
