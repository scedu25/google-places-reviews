Text: It was much more comfortable than I expected. The water made my hair really limp, so it must have been soft water. The staff was nice. Didn't bother eating breakfast there because there was NO gluten free options.

Text: I visited this hotel for a business meeting. I was only there a couple of hours, and did not see any of the sleeping rooms. What I did see of the hotel was clean, and staff were very courteous. I attended a lifeguard meeting in the pool room overlooking the pool, which worked well for our meeting, restrooms were nearby. We met with about 8 people, and there was room at the tables for 12. The only other meeting area was in the lobby / breakfast area, but we decided against that due to traffic.
