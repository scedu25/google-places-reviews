Robin Hood Woods Campground & Resort

Text: The stay was overall pretty nice. The problem was that someone on staff named Dave, harassed us the entire time. He threatened to send one of my family members to jail, he called out another family member at the pool, came by the day we left and made sure to inform that we had to leave in one hour, and when we were ready to go he made sure to tell us it was time to leave. I must say that the pool was nice and so was karaoke. There were dogs that barked all night which kept people up. To add on the wifi was terrible but that's not as bad as the service there.

Text: First real camping trip with our new pull behind.  The staff at the campground could not have been nicer.  Bathrooms and showers were clean.  We rented a golf cart for a day and it made everything a lot easier.  I would definitely recommend this campground if you are in the area.

Text: The camp site supervisor made sure we knew we were not welcome there.  It started by my friends 15 yr old son using a hatchet to cut sticks for marshmallows.  He did cut down a sapling and yes I agree that wasn't the best idea.  However I don't think it warranted being threatened with police action.  Then the next day while going to the pool with his 4 yr old my friend was stopped and quizzed about his purple duffle bag because coolers aren't allowed in the pool area.  Funny how no one else seemed to need to have their bags checked hmmm.  It is not made clear in the rules what time check out is.  The way we read it you had until 9pm the last day of your stay to check out.  According to our not so friendly camp nazi you only had until 11.  Don't worry though he'd give us an extra half hour and wouldn't shoot us.  Gee thanks guy!  If your planning a camping trip do yourself a favor and go to wolf creek state park.  They don't make you feel threatened the entire time your there and it's nicer.

Text: We tent camped at Robin Hood Woods two summers ago and really enjoyed it. This year we purchased our first camper and paid for a seasonal lot this spring. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Our kids live all week to go back and play with their new friends. We love the park and are excited for the pool to open.
