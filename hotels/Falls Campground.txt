Falls Campground

Text: We have stayed here several times, and we love it! Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. If you plan a trip to Falls Campground DO NOT follow Google Maps directions! From US23 take Hwy3, across from the tourist info place. It's a much better road.

Text: What a beautiful CG. I'd of given 5 stars but you better bring an extra long power cord and water hose. No sewer hookup but they have a honey wagon to pump you you out.
Did I say it was a beautiful setting?

Text: The bath house is super clean and nice. We tent camp and were placed out of sight of the falls as was the only other tent though there were plenty of pretty shaded spots in view of the falls when we arrived and left. We were not told about the bathrooms in a trailer and hiked to the bath house until we happened to be on the side of the trailer to see the signs. The grounds are very nicely kept. The grounds keepers and staff were very nice - though they did decide they needed to grate gravel by our tent at 7:45 one morning. Water above the falls is below the ankle and decent temperature. Below the falls is icy cold. We would recommend with the explanation  of being sure you ASK for a falls view. If we had been given that this would have been a 5 star plus.
