Text: Perfect stop for an over night when traveling. Called ahead, checked in after hours and the paper work and directions were where they said they would be. Friendly, clean easy to find even in the dark.  Will mark this as a place to stop again!

Text: Best RV park in the area! Lots of space for our dogs to play, beautiful campsites with soft grass and a large playground with high quality equipment. It's close to all of the best restaurants and shopping centers in town, and it is also a great place to stay for Old Threshers. Definitely a 5-star RV park!
