Cook’s on Brewery Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Cook's on Brewery is a treasure!  It's a perfect location in New Harmony, on a beautiful tree-lined, quiet street, and a truly charming and comfortable place to lay ones head at night. David and Jonathon could not have been more gracious and our breakfast of home made biscuits and gravy has set a new bar standard for one of our favorite guilty pleasures!  The house is simply gorgeous with a perfect blend of beauty, character and comfort. The upstairs guestrooms were beautifully appointed and the common sitting area created a perfect place to relax and spend time with the other couple who traveled with us.  All in all, it was an outstanding place to stay and I'm quite certain we will be returning guests!

Text: An absolutely delightful experience to be at Cook’s on Brewery.  The hosts are such gracious, accommodating, and interesting people.  The place is beautiful and historic (and in New Harmony, everything is “conveniently located.”).  The rooms are well-appointed, with an elegant and restful feel (there was a small bottle of Tylenol in one of the drawers, showing the hosts are also quite thoughtful).  The breakfast – oh my!  I try never to have expectations when a place says it has a “truly gourmet breakfast,” but these talented hosts would have exceeded any expectations.  They even loaned us their golf cart that evening so we could ride over to a beautiful wooded area behind the Roofless Church to see an spectacular display by thousands of fireflies.  Overall, a unique and very lovely place, and an unforgettable visit that turned into one of the highlights of the whole trip.  Thank you, Johnathon and David.
