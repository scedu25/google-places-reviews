Whitesburg Motel

Text: They offer smoking and non smoking rooms. Decent priced rooms, good if you just need a place to rest your head. No fridges or microwaved in the room but you can rent one for only 5 bucks. Nothing too fancy!

Text: It's mediocre and recently flooded from a pipe burst. Some rooms on the first floor smell like mildew. They also increase prices for the Heritage car show weekend.

Text: My sister and I recently spent 2 nights at the Whitesburg Motel while visiting family, and enjoyed ourselves very much.  It is located in a convenient, well lighted neighborhood, and  is close to grocery stores and restaurants. The price was reasonable and included a simple breakfast. The housekeeping staff does a very good job, both our room and the lobby area were very clean. The young man at the front desk was friendly and helpful. My only complaint would be small pillows on otherwise comfortable beds.  I would recommend the Whitesburg Motel.
