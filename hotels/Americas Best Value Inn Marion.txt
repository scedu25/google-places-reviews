Americas Best Value Inn Marion

Text: I missed the breakfast, but it didn't seem like much anyway. There is a grocery store right next door that we were able to use. The rooms were fine. They seemed clean enough, but it's a pretty old building. There a/c worked well. The motel did what we needed it to do.

Text: Good value. Spacey, clean rooms. Located close to highway making it easily accessible but not very quiet. Coffee and sweet rolls offered in office in the morning.

Text: This place has bedbugs!! I was on my way to bed at 12:30am and noticed a bedbug on my pillow. I called the front desk and the guy moved me right across the hall!! I drive 3 hours from Cincinnati and I have to be up at 7am......I am still awake and it's 1:50am!! I can't sleep and it's too late for to look for another hotel. I will never come here again. I'm thinking about sleeping in my car but I really need my rest for this trip

Text: Very good budget accommodations. The room was clean and nicer than I expected based on the price. It looks like that they have done some recent updates and renovations. Despite the updates the bathroom still showed the age of the hotel. The staff was friendly. There was an issue with my booking (not the hotel's fault it was a screw up with Hotwire) and the man at the desk was very friendly and understanding and helped me get things all straightened out. I was in town on business and if I ever end up in the area again I would stay here.

Text: I was desperate for an inexpensive place to stay at the last minute.  The place was under construction for renovations, so the smell was not pleasant.  The room was clean enough, but it was tough to sleep due to the highway noise.  I wouldn't stay here again.
