Text: Really nice campground! Friendly and helpful staff! They let you swim as long as you want!
Clean restrooms. Lovely landscaping on all the sights. The best part is they let you choose your own spot! Close to Turkey run state park  so if you want to do trails you have about a 30 min drive! Would recommend  this place to others! Thank you Jamie!!!

Text: Park was really clean and beautiful trees and shade all around. Staff was great and extremely helpful. Rates were good. Sites were a bit cramped but not too bad. The only negative was it took 3 days for them to dump the trash at the dog walk. Otherwise we would come here again.

Text: Nice campground been here several times. But they could use some updates..for example sewer hook up is at the back of the site.and you might need to get a hose extension.

Text: The grounds are beautiful! Jamie is awesome and keeps the place very clean. It's under a canopy of mature trees and so quiet here. Definitely recommend,  wish I wasn't just passing through.
