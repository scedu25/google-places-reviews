Morris Park
Rating: 5
Text: This park is big enough for camping with or without a camper, open fires, power hook up for campers 110v & 220v, working bathroom & showers. Hiking trails, fishing & an amazing history tour of old fashion farm equipment & houses. There's a small play ground for the kids.

Text: Many childhood memories. Love the old school buliding. Happy to see it still stands and visitors are allowed to step in and experience the past. My children loved it!

Text: This is a county park.  It is a bit on the rustic side, if you are into fancy, you won't like it.  If you like the idea of camping in a Hickory Grove with no traffic noise and the rustle of a breeze in the tree tops and owls hooting at the moon, this is it.  It has simple but clean showers, electrical hookups.  As I recall, water is available but not at individual camp sites. It is flat ground with white gravel pads.  No grass, just leaves from all the trees.  Pad access is easy, but no pull through.  A 35' camper would be OK but the driver better be practiced.  There are a number of farm buildings on the premises with examples of pre electricity farming stuff and the staff is happy to have folks look around.  In my opinion it is a best buy and one of the most overlooked neat places around.  It ain't fancy, but it is exactly what camping used to be about.  Quiet, natural surroundings.  Navigation is a bit of a challenge, come in from the highway to the west, there are signs, but you best print a map off Google Earth or some such.

Text: Great place if you like the country and nature. I miss going there with my mom when she was alive. Lot of good memories when I think of Morris park.
