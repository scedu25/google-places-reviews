Text: Room was ok. I found that 2 of the towels in our room were either not cleaned or stained. They had what looked like foundation makeup on them. Hallways and stairwells were almost too hot to even walk through. Breakfast wasn't stocked well.

Text: Came in late and left as soon as we woke up, but things were fairly standard for a hotel. I know they washed the comforter as it was still very slightly damp. Bed was, nevertheless, very comfortable. Breakfast was basic, but acceptable.
