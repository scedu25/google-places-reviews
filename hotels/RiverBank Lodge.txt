RiverBank Lodge
Rating: 4
Text: Friendly and very helpful staff except for the bartender. Our bed was extremely comfortable and the lodge is beautiful. We will definitely go back. The only downsides are you can't control the temperature of your room or open the windows and there was a railroad track about 20 feet from our window. We got excited thinking the air had come on. Nope, just a train.

Text: I will come back to this lodge. The staff was very nice and helpful with our needs. They updated our rooms, let us pick the ones we wanted. The pizza in the lounge was very good with a  thin crust.  Couldn't ask for more

Text: Hot water runs out quickly in the morning, no irons in the room, numbering system for the rooms is quirky at best, continental breakfast is lacking, poor WI-FI in rooms, TVs are from the year 2000, good pizza in the bar though.
