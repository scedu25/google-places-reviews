Text: We thank Ms Ramona Vincent and her helpful staff for one of the best vacations we've ever had. The accommodations at this resort are 5 star. Everything is clean and beautiful. The views are extremely impressive too. Our dog, Say-D Sue  was also accommodated with pleasure. We will return to this quite and prestine Resort again soon. I highly recommend coming here if you have plans for a wedding or family reunion.

Text: Lovely little place!  Nice and secluded while still close to Main Street. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Already thinking about our next visit.

Text: Wonderful inn! Ramona, the owner, was so warm & hospitable! We stayed for our 30th anniversary and she had a small bottle of champagne & chocolate waiting for us in the room! That was special! The room was comfy; the views were breathtaking and the service here was great! We'll definitely be back! ?

Text: Nice pool and pond on site. Gazebo with raised platform goes out into the water. Awesome for evening sunsets and out in the country but close to town.
