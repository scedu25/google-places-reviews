Presidential Inn West Branch
Rating: 2
Text: My room was cooled to 79 degrees.  Pilot Car partner had a room that was really warm.  At 79 degrees outside, this should have been simple.  Booked 2 rooms, two rooms not cooled. Most lamps burnt out.  Demand cooling (or heating in winter) of the Presidential before you pay.  Also, $20 cash deposit was not returned.  Drive a few miles and get better.

Text: Don't write down your credit card number if she asks you to. She tried the same thing last year.  I hope you like the smell of Curry and funny that only one lamp in the room works.   Pilots also-two rooms; 2 rooms curried and almost no lights.  Bar downstairs full of several interesting and very friendly locals.

Text: I don't understand what the negative reviews are about.  My single bed room had more than adequate space, accommodations and amenities.  The whole place was under construction as well so it looks like further improvements were underway as of 2/1/2015.  For the price I could not think of a single negative thing to say about this motel.  If you want a bell hop, continental breakfast w/ waffle maker, elevators, wi-fi, hundreds of cable channels and a waterfall in the lobby, then you are too snooty for this place.
