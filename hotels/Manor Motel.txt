Text: Nothing special about this hotel 
/motel way out of date the bed are not that comfortable and if you need to Wi-Fi to do computer work I would suggest going somewhere to stay. I stayed in a room really close to the front desk on the main floor and the Wi-Fi I could not connect to at all. Spendy for nothing that doesn't work well. And the only reason I have it 2 stars is because it was a 5 minute drive from where I had to work. I would suggest another hotel or motel to stay at!!!

Text: This place resembles a horror movie!!!  Its filthy, old,  and the queen bed is actually a full size bed with a lumpy mattress pad.  The sheets were so old they wouldn't stay on the bed, pillows so flat I rolled my jeans for a pillow.    Spider webs with live spiders.  Plastic cups in the filthy bathroom window. No soap to wash our hands with.  Bucket of chemicals outside our door with weeks worth of dead bugs floating.   Didn't even bother to complain because its obvious they wouldn't understand the concept of my issues.  GO TO THE NEXT EXIT!!!! ITS A MATTER OF SLEEP OR NOT. RM 127

Text: Musty Jacuzzi room; sickening moldy smell that makes you cough all night. Pretty decor though.

Text: I read other reviews and I must say I disagree with some of them.  The room I stayed in was 113. It was clean..new mattresses..new flooring...the entire room was redone.  The staff are extremely helpful and kind.  I'm very pleased with my experience.
