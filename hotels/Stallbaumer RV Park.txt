Stallbaumer RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We are interested in history of Pony Express, so when traveling across country try to get in a few sites. While heading towards Rock Creek Station, we discovered Stallbaumer RV Park and Campground. What a lovely place! Don't let the smaller size deter you from getting here. RV sites are exceptional: level concrete enough to form a patio, pea gravel, a bit of well maintained turf and a young shade tree. Bathhouse very clean. Pergola by large pond charming. We and our pups had a very confortable, quiet stop. I concur wroth prior posts regarding location in general.

Text: On my way home from 2 week on the road staying in campgrounds I spent my last night at Stallbauner RV Park.  This is a great little spot along Rt. 36 to stay.  The entire area is spotless and the bathrooms were the cleanest that I saw all across the country.  Not a huge place, but I would gladly stay again.

Text: Really nice and clean. Pull through full huck-ups, concrete slabs. Great views and ready quite. Town has quite a bit to offer as well, more then expected. Really nice city park very short distance away. Highly recommend this place, off the beaten trail but worth the small detour.

Text: Clean, well-maintained RV park with the sites overlooking a large pond.  Good Wi-Fi and cable; did not use the laundry or restrooms.  The charges for services are al la carte  . . . you pay for only what you will be using: electric - water - sewer - cable - internet.  Payment is self-service by cash or check into an on-site locked drop box, but the owner is readily available by phone if you have any questions.  We stayed here during a HEAT ADVISORY, and had GOOD 30 amp electrical power (which was a RELIEF to us since we had just stayed in an Oklahoma City RV park where using either our microwave or our electric water heater at the same time that our A/C was running would blow the breaker!!).  We camped at Stallbaumer RV Park and Campground in a Motorhome (with a towed vehicle) and would definitely stay here again if we were in the area.
