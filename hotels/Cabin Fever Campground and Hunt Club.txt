Text: This is a great getaway from home. The people are so friendly makes you feel very welcome. Our family goes there every year. Only complaint is I wish they had better bathrooms throughout the camp but I guess when you're camping that Porta-Potty is to be expected

Text: A nice place. Fish aren't huge, but it was fun. The house is huge with a lot of beds.
