Super 8 Shelbyville

Text: It is dirty, with cigarette burns on The bathtub. Dirtiest room I've been in year's.  Smelled cigarette smoke in the hallway's. Hasn't been updated since the 70's. Super 8 should have quality control.  Because this place gives it a horrible name.

Text: Clean, nice room. Nice staff. Breakfast was very plain. Not much effort made there.

Text: Stay away if you're hot-natured. Sheets are like polyester and starchy; duvet is rayon and HOT! A/C blows behind heavy curtains cutting airflow. Room has not been dusted and reeks of smoke.

Text: Very rude lady at the front desk. Should be fired immediately !!! Walked in and got two rooms, one of which was supposed to have 3 beds...only had 2 and then she says we have to pay for another room.  Splitting up parents.  Lady has lost her marbles.  Then pointed her finger in my face more then 3 times, while yelling and said that I needed to stop raising my voice.   Idiot!!! I stay in a lot of hotels and I've never encountered a fool like this.  Completely floored and appalled by her actions at 2am towards a family with small children.  And she continued running her mouth as I walked away.  

Super 8 should be ashamed.  And to top it all off, we found a crazy amount of hairs on our pillows and bed sheets.  DISGUSTING!!!!

Text: The bed was very comfortable and room was clean.  The hotel was clean on the outside but we were concerned walking thru the hallway as it wasn't as nice or updated as our room
  It was quiet and reasonably cost friendly.
