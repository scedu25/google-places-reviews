The Saint George Hotel
Rating: 3
Text: Great location. Hotel served its purpose. Rooms are small and old. Definitely needs some up keeping. Wasn't the greatest please I've stayed but wasn't the worst.

Text: Pretty with original detail. Rooms were plain but clean and nice. Restaurant attached to building with all three meals offered.

Text: Over priced and old furnishings. The soap is in little plastic bags like a motel 6.  The people are nice and you get 2 free beers with your stay!

Text: Really neat historic hotel with clean rooms. Local microbrew in the room at check-in is a nice touch.

Text: Worst service I have ever had waited over an hour for food. We would have had gone some where else but it was already late. We didn't receive any refills on our drinks and the waitress was rude. If she would have explained to us that there was going to be a delay. We would have at least understood but no communication has had. So we ate and left .We will not return.
