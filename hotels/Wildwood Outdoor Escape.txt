Text: The driveway in is a bit narrow so take it slow. This is a large campground with over 100 sites. There is lots to do, a fishing pond, swimming pond, putt-putt golf, playground, horseshoes and more. Roads are gravel and they grated them while we were there. We were in site 79, all grass and not very level, but wider than normal with a picnic table. Plenty long enough for our 37 foot RV with tow-dolly. We had water and 50 amp electric, no sewer. Camp is well kept and quiet. We stayed the night of June 20, 2017. WiFi was spotty our Verizon signal was strong. We paid $19.26 with our Passport America discount

Text: We have been going here for years. Great campground. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the roads are worn down really bad and the putt-putt is not worth playing at all. Other than that the place is fantastic. It's quiet, lots to do...and Linda is great!
