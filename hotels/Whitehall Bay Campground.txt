Whitehall Bay Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Great recreational lake and state park a little over an hour from Wichita. Over 8 miles of technical singletrack mountain bike trails (badger creek) bring me here every month or so. They wind through the forest and over rocks and roots. It's great to then cool off at the beach at Whitehall Bay Campground, where there is no fee. Always great Kansas sunsets to boot.
