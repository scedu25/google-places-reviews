Text: Nice place. Front desk staff was great. They called the room to make sure everything was to my liking. Only drawback, one ice machine in a two building inn. Was very surprised by hoe comfortable the bed was. Give tje Marriott a run for their money.

Text: Amat the gentlemen who checked me in was very nice & friendly..This hotel is easy to see off the expressway,very very impressed on how clean & comfortable the room was plus it had up-to-date fixtures especially the sink,I would have given them a 5 if they had a breakfast for the price I paid for an upgraded king non smoking room.But over all sheer beautiful inside this room so I will give them 5 because Amat was most gracious when checking me and my family in.
