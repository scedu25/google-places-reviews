BLUFF VIEW(CLEARWATER LAKE) (recgovnpsdata)
Rating: 2
Text: Great  camping, and boating. But the new bathrooms are EXTREMELY dangerous, the floors are always wet and slippery.  They are painted concrete floors with nothing down to keep you from slipping. My kids fell several times and I almost fell myself but I naturally have great balance. We were there summer of 2016,  I edited this in 2017 to explain my rating, when and if we go back I will update, or edit this then.

Text: Loved camping here even though Clearwater lake flood stage was really high. Kids still had a blast

Text: Plenty of wildlife for sure, watch out for snakes especially. Bring bug repellant during spring and summer. Plenty of deer, rabbits, turtles, snakes, fish, bears and mountain lions on occasion. Keep eyes open for animals here.
