Text: The staff was very nice, but the rooms were not worth the $90 per night rate.  We stayed in 2-2 double bed studio rooms.  One of the rooms was unclean with dog hair on the sheets and dirty paw prints on the bed spreads.  We had to ask for clean bedding which we had to replace ourselves.  The towels had mold and mildew stains and what looked like bugs.  Lice?  We were in a pinch because we needed a pet friendly place, but we definitely would not stay here again.  The breakfast is not really a breakfast.  It was packaged muffins, coffee and granola bars.  Please be aware of this hotel.  If you are expecting a Holiday Inn Express quality or even a Choice Hotel quality, it isn't.  It was a 1 star quality at best.  This hotel should compare to Motel 6 or Super 8 and the rate should be closer to $65.
