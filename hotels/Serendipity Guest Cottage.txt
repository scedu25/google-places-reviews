Serendipity Guest Cottage
Rating: 5
Text: Cosy. Clean. Cute. Would stay again.  A small bnb in a small town. Decorated beautifully but not too much that I was worried about ruining anything. A pint size kitchen (I don't think there was a stove) with a sink, microwave, and a frig with breakfast and snacks stocked. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. The living room is part of a big room that the master bedroom is in.
