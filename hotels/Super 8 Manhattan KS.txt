Text: I haul construction materials stayed on Sunday night the young lady that was working the front desk was so nice. Then needed to stay Monday night because of my job parked my truck only no trailer on the outside row under a light. The entire parking lot is striped for small cars. At 2 ockock pm the parking lot had only 5 cars in it I counted 30 something empty spots. The lady was very ugly about me moving  to the back corner of the lot because her regular contruction workers need to park under the lights and I wasn't allowed to park there. Extremely ugly about the whole thing so I told he no problem I would go somewhere else. She said have a good day. So I came around the corner to motel 6 nice new renovated rooms and 20 bucks cheaper.

Text: Bugs in the room, killed one in the bathroom, another on the wall. Zero customer service at check in, not even at the desk and had to call a phone sitting on the counter so it could ring for a solid minute before someone picked up, just to get hung up on. Breakfast was dismal, hardly any food. Someone came in to clean up and didn't even ask if we were finished with breakfast. Not even a hello. She could have cussed at us but at least she would have acknowledged there were guests in the room. Stay somewhere else, and pay the extra for the better food and service. I will never stay here again.

Text: This place was fine for what it is. It was pretty clean and quiet, a place to rest your head and they give you breakfast.
