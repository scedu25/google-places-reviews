Text: I have lived here with my family for over a year, and we aren't moving soon. I love Lakewood because of the decent people and the lake behind our mobile home. I've seen a lot by the lake. There's been an otter, giant goldfish, and thousands of frogs. Nice place for both adults and kids

Text: Management changes frequently, don't stay up on background checks for new applicants. Are very willing to accommodate any paperwork requests if originals are lost. Problems with staff members being in office around time of paying lot rent...similar to a game of "cat and mouse", usually 3rd attempt someone is finally there to collect the rent.
