Hilton Garden Inn Naperville/Warrenville
Rating: 3
Text: My first room had ants (second floor) and my 9yr old, and myself got bitten by laying on the bed (they were everywhere). The second room (3rd floor) almost killed me with the heater. It smelled like it was burning every time it kicked on. I get the initial first use burn smell, but this was EVERY time. The hotel was extra full with 3 weddings, so switching again wasn't an option. 
Breakfast was really yummy though, and the tiny little pool was just enough to keep my daughter entertained. The gym was adequate, and the staff was friendly even though they didn't know how to turn on the outdoor heaters so I could use the patio.
