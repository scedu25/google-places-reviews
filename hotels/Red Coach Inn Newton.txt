Text: I've known the owner of here for some years now, he's a great guy, easy to work with. The rooms are well above what you sound expect from the price and location. The staff is always really nice and eager to help out any way they can. They do a free breakfast in the morning, simple stuff, but the danishes are always fresh and tasty. They even have a pretty nifty honeymoon suite if you're looking for a night away and feel fancy. I would definitely stay here if you're passing through town.

Text: Rooms were great.  Hot tub broke. Main reason booked here.  Breakfast not much. Forgot to put the waffle mix out. About all that was worth eating. Juice cold and good flavor.  Stayed here many times. But very disappointed on this trip.  They should tell people on the site that something doesn't work when it is listed as a item on the amenities

Text: Very well kept. Pool is clean. Right amount of chlorine in the pool. Breakfast was as good as you can expect a continental breakfast to be. Functioning arcade. Pool and ping pong tables. A lot of widows. Flat screen TV in your room. Only complaint I have is that the bed sheets are not enough for two people, who are not spooning, to share.
