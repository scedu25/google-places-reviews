Text: Stayed six night at this location. Year or so ago, I stayed in the winter and they had boiler issue, that seems to have been resolved. Friendly staff, rooms are packed with everything you need for longer stays. Only negative points were there is a cooler from the market was non-operational for the entire week I was there... I only wanted bottled water and they did not have. Secondly, carpet appearance is just dirty... crumbs in the elevators, tennis shoe?, and mud in the stairwell that I was near and used because its faster than the elevator and better for emergency. Otherwise, close and convenient to eats and the Jordan creek mall is about 15 minutes away. Best were comfortable, no issues this trip. One downside is that they disabled the TV input, I used the HDMI for movies on the TV but could not do that here. Even so, would stay again and recommend. Thanks for reading and if this review helps give a thumbs up. Video on the YouTube Channel.

Text: The hotel is clean and offers what you need for an extended stay. Even the basic room has a kitchenette. While I have not used them, the hotel also has a pool and workout room. It's pretty centrally located in a nice part of the Des Moines area, right off the interstate. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly. Overall, a great stay for a business traveler!

Text: We arrived into town earlier then expected and decided to see if early check-in was possible...and it was! They were super friendly and accommodating. The hot breakfast was amazing with a lot of choices; we really loved the fruit infused water each morning! We highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

Text: This is such a cool establishment. The interior and exterior are kept in pristine, well-maintained, updated conditions. My suite had a kitchen area, a sitting area and an expansive closet. You start to wonder how they were able to fit so much functionality into one stylish, relaxing space. 
There really was a lot to like about this hotel but if I had to choose, I would say that what I probably liked the most were my very comfortable bed and the high quality linens. Everything is made in the US and you can feel the love in every fabric. From the curtains to the towels to the bedding, all designed for my luxurious comfort and felt fabulous to the touch. I would happily stay here again.
