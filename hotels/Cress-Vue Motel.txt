Text: Pretty clean hotel overall.  One of the better motels I've stayed at for $50. Some call it old or dated,  i say it's a well preserved time capsule.  These rooms don't see much action is why they're so well preserved.  Maybe they're just that good screening out the riff raff. Either way this is the premier choice in Hoxie kansas to stay at.

Text: The room was surprisingly comfortable and very clean! Older appliances, but very well kept and lots of space. Nice gentleman let us get a room very late at night!
