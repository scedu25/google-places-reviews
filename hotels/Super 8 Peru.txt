Text: Clean, decent rooms, nice continental breakfast,  the gentleman  who worked the night was  very nice.  The company did not honor pricing i received from an employee when I called to reserve with a military discount.  I even had a confirmation number.  I had to ask for more towels as i only two towels, one hand towel and one wash cloth for a double queen room.  They wouldn't  allow a 1pm check in so expectations  of the room I feel should have been met higher.

Text: Our stay here has been adequate to say the least. Basic accommodations are present. Perfect for a quick stop in-between hours of driving by not for a prolonged stay. The wait staff has been very pleasant and the rooms we clean and maintained. If you're looking for a no frills hotel this is it.

Text: We were given a double room when we had booked a king. Coffee maker in the room didn't work and breakfast was laughable. Towels were thin and yellowed with use and the sink leaked. Rooms were decently clean and comfortable for a budget hotel.

Text: We paid $87 for a very dirty hotel!  Carpets in halls and room were obviously dirty, maybe they don't have a vacuum.  There was what looked like black mold on the tub seal with the wall.  They advertise a HOT BREAKFAST.  No way.  No hot eggs, meat.  Very skimpy.  Not even creamers.    Coffee was not hot, had to use the microwave in the room to heat it up.  Skip this one.  Another foreign owned hotel getting the life sucked out of it.  Pathetic.
