Days Inn & Suites Benton Harbor MI
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms are exceptionally clean. Beds are very comfortable. (The beds do sit high. If this is a problem, call the front desk for a step stool.) Staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast has hot food choices along with the standard "continental breakfast" fare.

Text: This dated hotel lacked amenities like a pool or even an elevator, but the bed was? comfortable and the premises were fairly clean. The employees were nice and did their best to suit our needs. I feel like we overpaid for our experience after visiting friends in the Comfort Inn just down the road, who paid the same amount for their clean and modem hotel with a pool and hot tub. However, they booked their room a few weeks before us. Their hotel was full by the time we booked ours, and no decent hotels in the area were priced very well.

Text: I really enjoy staying here, but their weekend summer prices are a little over the top for Benton Harbor. Even with my membership and discounts it was over$140 for a night. During the week it's around $80 a night. The lady who checked us in was very nice and super helpful. The room was very clean and contemporary?. The bed very comfortable with just the right amount of pillows.

Text: This place , on the surface appeared clean, but there was a pervading icky smell.  Not sure what it was, but I was glad to get out of there the next day.  On a positive note, the free breakfast was pretty good.
