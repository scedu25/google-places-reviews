Cedar Lake Campground
Rating: 5
Text: If you enjoy horseback riding and camping, this is the place to go. You don't even have to own a horse, just come by, park your rig and enjoy. Cedar Lake Campground has new owners and you can tell. It's clean and inviting. They have regularly schedule events like rodeos, speed shows and Mutton busting and kids movie night! They even have Cowboy Church. Great weekend getaway or you can lease a campsite for a full year. Call early, it fills up fast!

Text: Not great for tent campers. The office lost our reservation, stopped returning calls, and moved our camp site 3 times when we got there. The electrician how ever was very nice and helpful.
