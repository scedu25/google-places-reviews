Cincinnati Marriott Northeast
Rating: 4
Text: Good: Attractive hotel, courteous staff, recently renovated as of 11/2017, comfortable lobby for work or relaxing, lots of power outlets and USB charging ports in the rooms

Bad: Only ONE drawer in the entire room. One single drawer. None in the night stands, none in the desk. If you like to unpack, this is lousy.

Minor annoyance: The person tending the bar at the event I attended could not tell me about the beers. "They are craft beers," was all he knew. Yes, I can tell they are craft beers. Even just knowing what is popular would be nice. This is just a pet peeve and does not impact my star rating.

Overall: I would stay here again is the price was right, but having not enough space to unpack means I would consider another hotel at the same price point before deciding.

Text: Cincinnati Marriott Northeast is in a great location. It was easy to get to off of Route 71 and had a decent amount of parking. The conference space had more than enough room and the staff attending to everyone was very attentive and polite. The food provided for our event was excellent and the staff provided a unique experience for each person attending our meeting. The newly renovated lobby was beautiful and felt very inviting. I would be excited to attend another conference here.

Text: I really enjoyed my stay and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for my brother's wedding and they did what they could to keep the family rooms together. It's in a good area where you can walk and get food and pick up some last minute items. Would for sure stay there again.

Text: This was a nice hotel with recently renovated rooms. Not sure if all rooms are renovated though. Not sure if it was because of the restaurant.. but all parking slots in the front of the building were completely taken... Had spots open in the back though...

Text: Very nice hotel. Most wonderful staff. Me, my wife and our 5 month old son arrived late in the evening on September 9th. Olivia and "Paulie" were working the front desk. Olivia checked us in. Both were Extremely upbeat and friendly. Olivia walked us to our room. We also met a manager who was very friendly. While we were out for dinner, Olivia had a baby playpen/crib brought to our room. Upon returning from dinner, we were met by Olivia and "Paulie" again.  Both girls fussed over our son, holding him and passing him back and forth. It was wonderful to see such a friendly staff. They all made us feel like family. The next morning we had a great breakfast provided by very friendly staff. We promise to return
