Text: The grounds are beautiful and a great place to have your event or sports camp. Only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it needs some upgrading.

Text: This is about as quiet as the Vegas strip. Apparently they have no interest in keeping things to a dull roar so all of the guests can actually sleep. They prefer loud obnoxious drunks who blare music until all hours of the early morning.
