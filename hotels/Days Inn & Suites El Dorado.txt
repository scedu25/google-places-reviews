Text: We arrived early, 12:00pm, and asked if we could check in early.  We were told no, without hesitation.  When we asked if we could leave our bags, again the answer was no.  Not, I'm sorry, we can't do that, nothing but NO.   There were no cars in the parking lot.  She didn't even check to see if our room was ready.  The clerk behind the counter, I didn't get her name, was rude and unhelpful.  We asked about the cancellation policy and were told it was 24 hours.  I checked the email confirmation and it clearly stated that they cancellation policy was 4pm by the day of reservation.  So I called and cancelled immediately.  There is a Holiday Inn Express just across the parking lot and they had a room available and let us check in early.  Much friendlier and a very clean and nice hotel.  Will stay there next   time we are in the area.  The Days Inn in El Dorado will NOT get any of my money.

Text: I wouldn't even give this place one star but I had to, just to leave my opinion. Emmanuel was the only decent worker there. I checked in on a Wednesday and stayed til the following Tuesday. Everyday a woman named Claudia either called my room, knocked on my door, or even helped herself to coming into my room telling me to check out...BEFORE the 11am check out. Not to mention that I was scheduled for a late check out everyday I was there. I was locked out of my room MULTUPLE times a day... Claudia was so irritated with her job that she was cursing behind the counters at me. Using actual foul natured language. One evening I needed toilet paper. So I called the front desk. The man told me he wasn't ALLOWED to leave the desk. A few minutes later I walked up to the desk to get said tissues and guess what... The man wasn't even at the desk. Thought he wasn't ALLOWED to leave the desk??? My room at one point had been over booked...AFTER I had already paid for it....then on Monday I asked for a manager, and to be compensated for being treated so poorly. The manager...Ray... Told me that we were troublesome and loud. That our phone calls were "disturbing" everyone. That he would be glad to see us go. AFTER I SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AT THIS PISS POOR ESTABLISHMENT!!! I wish I could post pictures on here... I would post the one worker who didn't change his clothes for at least 3 days. DO NOT COME HERE!!!

Text: Booked room based on reviews of children/family friendly, clean, new, and exceptional customer service...big mistake!  The room has a stove, and fridge without child safe precautions.  The pool is not "room key" locked, and anyone can just walk into it, the lights were off during the hours of usage time, which proposed problems.  The level of chlorine began burning our skin/eyes/lungs only after 15 minutes, we were unable to receive assistance from "Ray", and he refused towels after we rinsed.  Then the General Manager Ray, complained to our family saying, "it is unfair for your family to have used the pool because it is for guests only", as we had taken our 3 grandchildren swimming, (which 2 of the children were staying the night, by using the facilities, because it was only to be used by guests", which upon check in, his wife and another employee knew we would be swimming in the pool.  After explaining to Ray that the pool was overly chlorinated, and burning, we had to rinse and needed towels, instead of assisting us, or even allowing us to have a towel, he continued to verbally abuse/yell about it being unfair to the point he scared my 3 year old granddaughter. While trying to talk to Ray, after he yelled at my family, he turned to his wife, and spoke in another language about us, which is extremely rude!  During the night, the halls were very loud, and Ray began banging on wall connected to our room at 7:30 a.m. which woke the baby, and family up. I contacted the corporate office, and only received a computer generated letter apologizing, and expecting us back for another stay.  After being intimidated, yelled at, called liar, refusing to assist with chlorine poisoning, literally very painful for days after, I believe this place to be a danger, NOT family friendly, and the greedy General Manager cares more about the money, and not the well being of children or family, he was going to actually charge us extra for using the pool for 15 minutes, even after we suffered severe chemical burns, confrontational to the point of yelling all the way down the hall at us, so take your chances.  Sometimes a newly looking package isn't all that its made out to be, and make sure you save all receipts, because the General Manager, "Ray", will try to charge you for anything he can, I am surprised he didn't want to charge us for the air we were breathing while staying.  NEVER will I use this place, nor any of the affiliates to Wyndham chains, because when you have a problem, they only care about the money, not helping!

Text: This was my family and I fourth stay at this hotel, but after finding dirty underwear and clothing in the drawers of a cleaned room and having 2 mildewed pillows on our bed and being called a liar by the hotel manager we will not be staying there again. I have 3 children and I know the difference between makeup and mildew. Mildew is black and green and often happens when something wet has been left lying in a certain spot for a long time. I also know that mildew eventually turns to mold. Either way it goes there should not have been makeup or mildew in a cleaned room. Instead of apologizing for the incidents the manager just said I am a liar and its not mildew its makeup!
