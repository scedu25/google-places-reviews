Text: While it isn't a huge 5 star hotel, it is nice. Our room was very homey and very comfortable. The hotel had everything you would get in a 5 star hotel besides breakfast, but there is a restaurant right next door to The left and a store to The right.  The hotel owner is a very nice guy and works with you in every possible way he can. He does laundry on sight and it is really just a nice place to stay. The building area is really quiet . The rooms themselves are very retro but I personally like that. I would recommend this hotel for comfort, for sanitation, and definently for the hospitality.
