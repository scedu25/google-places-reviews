Text: Stayed for the weekend for SYC2017 with 250/300 middle school and high school.  Hotel staff were awesome.  Valet was wonderful and were always early with our BUS! Breakfast was really good.  The Hotel is older but maintained.  Pullman Center is across street a few shops.movies and food. Small park in the center as well. Great water pressure!!!

Text: It was a wonderful place for a sleep study. Since I was only there one night, I am not sure how good the cleaning staff is. But the room was comfortable and reasonably clean. The dining room staff was friendly, and the clerk at the front desk was helpful. Plus, free valet parking.

Text: Attended a professional function at the hotel. It has seen better days. The air conditioning was not functioning in the meeting room. The coffee tasted burnt. There was not a garbage can near the coffee. No small snacks were available at breaks. There were holes in the ceiling panels. It was simply a shell of its former self. I know Huntington has hit hard times, but this was just sad.

Text: Amazing
extraordinary staff from front desk to housekeeping to shuttle. Hotel is dated but clean. It's apparently scheduled for Reno's. Complimentary Breakfast is eggs sausage and waffles you make yourself. Take a few dollars with you for gratuity.  There is minimal parking. The location is right downtown across pullman square. Lots of shopping. If it was not dated this would have been a 5 star rating. My family and I enjoyed our stay.

Text: This place is definitely run down. The staff was extremely nice and they have complimentary valet parking. But everything about the hotel is old like the wallpaper everywhere and the elevator with what appears to be water stains. The place smells a little like smoke. The breakfast was nothing fancy just scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, and waffles you make yourself. This hotel definetly needs a makeover
