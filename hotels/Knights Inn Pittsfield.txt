Text: This is a very nice clean motel. The rooms are newly remodeled and clean  no smoke smell. The manager is very friendly and makes sure you have what you need. Breakfast is just sweet rolls and coffee but for the price it is well worth. I got a suite since we were traveling with out 5 grandkids.

Text: It was a perfectly nice room for the price. There was some work done on the room though that was of poor quality. I would stay again as the room was clean, and a good value.

Text: What a dump that is ran by an unfriendly person. Didn't even make our beds after our first night of a two night visit. If the price was less I would be more forgiving - but for the quality of the rooms it is totally over priced.
