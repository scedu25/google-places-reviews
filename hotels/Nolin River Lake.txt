Text: Just "OK" and didn't WOW me. Rangers made us move to the gravel parking lots our second night because they were trying to rejuvenate the grass. I understand that, and that's not the reason for the 3 stars, it was just a big pain (quite literally) to move everything after we slept there 1 night already. Amenities were filthy and the shower house...or should I say horror house...was a joke. No one cleans it and it's absurdly hot in there due to NO ventilation.
