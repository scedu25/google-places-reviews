Days Inn Jefferson City
Rating: 4
Text: The smell was a bit off. Not bad just smelled like nana's house. The water was hot and the bed was surprisingly comfortable. The rooms could use a bit of maintenance but nothing that would keep me from returning again.  The staff was friendly and efficient.

Text: The room was clean and the staff was fantastic. The only negative was the "continental breakfast". There was cereal, bagels, mini muffins, and fresh fruit. It was lacking juice, eggs, basically anything hot. I would recommend to someone else but warn them about breakfast.

Text: The hotel itself is very small and simple, and the staff is friendly. It's not very fancy or extravagant. Our bathroom door is a little big for a small bathroom. Our bed is HUGE, there is so much room to sprawl out. I sleep on a couch at home so I find this to be wonderful. The mattress isn't super soft or firm. And they give you a lot of pillows to use. I love a lot of pillows. I haven't had much experience with the service. When we were checking in they were nice to my fiance and I. The Days Inn is located right off of the highway, I don't remember the name of the highway. We're in a convenient location to go to the bustle of the city. Overall a good experience.
