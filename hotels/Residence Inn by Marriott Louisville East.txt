Text: This is a gem of a location with all the comforts of home and then some.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Brenda, the person in charge of breakfast, was particularly nice and gave us cookies for the road after a fantastic hot breakfast.

Text: The kitchen and bathroom were nice but the bed was very hard.  I typically love the beds in Marriott hotels, but that is was NOT what they have at this particular Residence Inn.  Stay at the Springhill Suites down the road if you want a good night's sleep
