Spruce Hill Inn & Cottages

Text: We had the most beautiful and relaxing weekend here. Secluded property makes you feel like you are miles away from everything, but it's less than 2 miles from a Walmart and restaurants! Very little road noise even though it's so close to those amenities. We were blessed with morning visits from various wildlife and had a great stay. Thank you Elizabeth for taking care of your beautiful property. We had a great stay!

Text: The cottage we stayed in was absolutely adorable. It was peaceful and quiet and the owners were very sweet. We brought my little yorkie and he loved it. Jetted tub was a nice bonus. Definitely coming back.

Text: Small cabins to stay in, big enough for 4, but best for 2 adults. They have Jacuzzi tubs and a shower in the bathroom, wet bar, microwave and small fridge.

Text: Stayed here a few years ago. Watched the turtles sun bathe in the pond and hiked in the woods. Very peaceful. Looking to stay again!
