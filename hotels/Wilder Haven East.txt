Text: Quiet enough, but there are some old  racist neighbors around. The management also sucks, and nothing ever gets fixed. I also suspect that they racially profile people before accepting them into the community. It's disgusting. Everything in our place had to be replaced, because the appliances were so outdated and broken. Toilet, fridge, sink, dishwasher, stove. We had to redo the entire kitchen because a leak wouldn't go away. Everything is old and in need of repair, but maintenance man won't do anything and neither will management.
