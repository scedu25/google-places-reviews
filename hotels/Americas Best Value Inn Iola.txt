Text: The service was great but our first room the ac was broke. They quickly moved us to another room which got very cold. During the night we seen two roaches but the room was comfortable. Went to Super 8 first the front desk clerk put us in a room at very end of hall went back to tell her my mom which is disabled cant walk that far then stated she should use the back door instead of moving us closer to the front door. Very rude so we left
