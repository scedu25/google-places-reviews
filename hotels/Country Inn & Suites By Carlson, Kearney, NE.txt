Text: Me and my wife enjoyed our stay here everything seemed clean and breakfast was as expected. Had rooms available late at night while driving cross country. Desk personnel were friendly and expedient.

Text: Other than the fact that they gave me a room with a king-size bed and no couch for my kids to sleep (they expected us to just all sleep on thw King??) it was a very nice hotel. Very yummy breakfast, comfy bed. Clean.

Text: Our room had spots on the carpet that had been there awhile. There was a long black hair in bathtub & on unused washcloth. Gross! The room was pretty clean otherwise. Bed mattress had alot to be desired. Omelet was best part of breakfast. There was a nice variety of food/drinks.

Text: Room was nice and clean.  Breakfast included made to order omelet which was made to perfection.  A word of warning however, this hotel uses goose and down pillows and comforters.  Tough on those with allergies.  When askrd, the staff was able to replace immediately.

Text: The service was very friendly when checking in. The room we had was a queen size bed and quite spacious. We didn't use them, but there was a microwave and a fridge. By far the best part about the place is the free breakfast. The made to order omelette bar was fanatic. Would definitely recommend staying here.
