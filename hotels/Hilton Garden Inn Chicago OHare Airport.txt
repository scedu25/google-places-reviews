Hilton Garden Inn Chicago OHare Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Check in at front deck was a little bumpy but after that it was all good. It’s a super clean hotel with a wonderful staff and a awesome pool for the kiddos. It’s in a great location and if your flying out of ORD they have shuttle. The breakfast package is well worth it and make sure you download the app. Not only do you get points but there digital key is great. Definitely will be back.

Text: Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. We chose the hotel based on convenient location and the kid friendly pool, and we weren't disappointed. Our young children had a ball in both the wading pool and the big pool. The fact that they had balls and foam noodles was an added bonus. Thanks for a great stay!
