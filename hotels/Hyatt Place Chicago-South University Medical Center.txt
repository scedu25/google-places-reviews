Text: Very clean and comfortable. The staff is awesome. I was here for four days. The shuttle driver, John was more than accommodating. He was very friendly and very knowledgeable. This was probably my best experience visiting Chicago.

Text: Stayed in a 2 bed room with a couch that had a pull out bed. Slept 4 comfortably. Had a mini fridge and I liked the rolling chair. Plenty of space. It was clean without the smell that sometimes plagues hotels. Friendly staff. I can't think of any negatives to provide and I'm sure I am forgetting some of the good things but I would stay again and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay. The curtains let you make the room very dark and no random noises through the night. The A.C. in the room worked good too without blowing directly on the beds. Plenty of places near by to eat and a great ice cream fudge and candy place right across the street.

Text: Beautiful hotel with very professional workers. It is in walking distance of most everything you would need. The lobby is large and welcoming. Breakfast was exceptional. If you stay, prepare to spend some money. If you get a deal off of Priceline or similar websites, it will not include parking (I think it was $20 a night). But it's Chicago... So you will probably pay for parking whenever you go. However, if you arrive in your carprepare to be completely lost and have no where to go. They are on a busy intersection with maybe two places to park on the side while you sprint to get all your stuff out of the car. It is not a good start to your stay to have to circle the block several times before squeezing in.

Text: Very nice, modern hotel close to the university area. Ideal if you're coming for a conference to this part of town for example. The place is clean and staff was friendly. The neighboring streets have a few good restaurant options. Breakfast was simple but had all you need on offer (cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, toast etc). They seem to have a shuttle service for the neighboring area, but I did not make use of it.
