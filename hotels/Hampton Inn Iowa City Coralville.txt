Hampton Inn Iowa City/Coralville
Rating: 5
Text: Good location right at 1st Street and I80. Was able to check in early, front desk person was very pleasant and helpful. Room was clean and smelled fresh. Didn't ever have to wait very long for the elevator. Renovations going on, but didn't impact the stay at all. The restaurant connected to the hotel has a very good selection of Iowa craft beers. Make sure to hit the happy hour from 4-6 for half price tap beers. Breakfast included all the regulars for a buffet breakfast. Waffles, eggs, potatoes, good coffee.

Text: Old and outdated. Some of the staff would prefer to not be friendly and not talk. Pool too cold, bathrooms and rooms in general need a complete overhaul.

Text: Erika checked us in and she was super friendly, welcoming, professional, and informative! Loved that! The room was pretty good. It would have been great if there was a small fridge or cooler and if place to hang a towels in the bathroom (above the toilet) was a shelf/bar style arrangement. The hooks were just small. Breakfast was also great! There would suggest leaving your omelet option meat free to include all diet types. I watched a guy go up thinking it was a veggie omelet (supported by the fact that there was bacon available as a meat option right next to it) and have to walk away because it was ham and veggies and he couldn't eat pork. I loved my breakfast though. Super yummy and the mustaches/mouths on the cups were a fun, playful surprise.

Text: Hotel is dated as far as carpeting and walls in hallways to the rooms. But room was clean and mattress was good. Had very good complimentary breakfast.
