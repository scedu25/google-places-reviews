Lazy Day Campground

Text: This campground has set a new standard by which I'll now judge others in the future... Too bad for them! Where do I begin? First, they answer their phone - a rarity! Their rates are reasonable. We were escorted to our site and "Mr. Owner"  stuck around to ensure we were happy with the site! How's that for starters? The campground is lovely.. nicely landscaped w/ tons of trees, pampas grass, & plantings. Sites are level, landscaped and terraced, with all utilities in perfect shape and working well. All buildings are nicely maintained and attractive, and the camp store is adorable with fun and useful items. But the best part about Lazy Day is the wonderful, creative, whimsical way the owners have Incorporated art into the campground. All around the campground are authentic wood carvings. And in the immaculately clean restrooms/shower rooms is the biggest surprise: fabulous, fun, smart art (not the usual kitsch from Michael's clearance rack!) The ladies room features humorous  artisan-created murals and original tile mosaics with a "Day at the Beach" theme.  The men's room motif is autos/Route 66 - complete with an old Dodge grill installed to look like it's crashing through into the showers. What fun! plus the facilities are clean, well stocked, and comfortable to use (baskets in the very ample-sized showers, and lots of hooks!) The laundry room, too, is clean, cheery, and decorated with antiques. A small "help yourself library" has actual best sellers and interesting periodicals.... Not the usual tattered romance novels and religious tracts you find in campgrounds. The dog run area is HUGE, and there's even a trail to a quarry lake you can hike around. I don't usually get excited about a campground, but Lazy Day is an exception. It's truly unique, fun (in a classy way), and guaranteed to make you smile. Even the Campground Rules are written in a humorous and tongue-in-cheek manner, so you know what's expected, but you don't feel chided and preached to. In a final endearing touch, the laundry/shower building exterior has a "proud to a American" theme: campers get to add a patriotic message to the wall with a Sharpie that's provided. I love this place!

Text: Perfect little campground! Beautiful, quite and CLEAN!! We only stayed one night while passing through Missouri so we didn't get to look around at the activities that could be done around the campground but we were pleasantly surprise that it has a pool on the grounds! Definitely a place to stop at!

Text: This was a great campground! Easily accomodated big rigs/towing. The bath houses were artsy & clean. Nice gravel sites, a few club houses, dog park, & nice pond. Whole site was nicely decorated with antiques & flowers. Very talented couple! Great site for a party of friends.
