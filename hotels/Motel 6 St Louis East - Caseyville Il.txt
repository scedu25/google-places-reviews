Motel 6 St Louis East - Caseyville Il
Rating: 5
Text: Nice hotel. Newly renovated so the rooms are really nice, laminate floors, had an actual thermostat (super appreciative of that) clean, smelt nice, and fit our budget. We were staying the weekend in St.Louis for a Cardinals game and this hotel was only 10-15 minutes away. The pool was nice and the staff and housekeepers were really friendly. I will stay again and probably every time I visit St. Louis. My only compliant was that the walls are really thin. The first night we stayed, I listened to a lady have a melt down for a good 30 minutes. Other than that, everything was great.

Text: My stay was pleasant.  Room was barebones but bed and linens very comfortable.  Room could use a clock and coffee pot.  It was a Friday night and hallway was quiet and we never heard a sound, even though hotel was full.  I will definitely stay here again.  Also the desk clerks at check-in and check-out were super nice!

Text: Family.  Everything was so clean and the beds were perfectly washed and tucked very neatly.  Front Desk was awesome.  Gave me extra blankets.  There is not enough kind words for everyone I encountered including the manager.  Kudos!!  By the way I will be back!

Text: Located conveniently right off the freeway. Gas station and fast food restaurants close by. Clean rooms, not too noisy. 15 minute drive to downtown St. Louis. Exceeded expectations for the price.

Text: The desk ladies are always very nice and helpful.  The only thing I was sad about was that the microwave has been taken out of the lobby.  They said that corporate made them take it out.  I LOVED having that micro wave. Sad to see it go.  Oh, and there was a huge centipede bug like thing with huge harry legs.  I wasn't too happy about that. ha!
