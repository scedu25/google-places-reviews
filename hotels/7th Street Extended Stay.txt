Text: Place is run down and crawling with bugs since this Simon guy bought it. Stray cats will jump in ur windows and use ur room and hallways as a litter box. The owner just leaves the yuck where ever they go. Bed bugs galore and his remedy is to take the bed to the basement and bring up another bug infested bed. The place doesn't even have a dumpster for u to put ur garbage in. Poorly run and just driving by it looks like a scene straight out of a backwoods trailer trash ghetto running well below poverty. Don't go there. U would be better off sleeping along the railroad tracks in a cardboard box.
