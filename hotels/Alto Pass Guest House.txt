Text: **UPDATE** We called the owner in May 2014 to take him up on his offer to give us a complimentary weekend.  He told us: "He just could not keep his word because we told the TRUTH about our bad experience on several web sites"!  Well, I'm sorry - I feel HONEST reviews are good - even when the owner's do not appreciate a bad review.  How about standing by your "word"???
