Text: This place did not allow my registered service dog in the restroom. They and another long term resident that stays on site treated me with prejudices  as I am transgender. The resident made gay slurs and when I left much earlier than my planed stay they kept my money that was owed to me. The only complaint they had against me was with the issue of my service dog accompanying me to the shower. I would not this recommend this place. EVER!!

Text: Love this easy in/out RV Park. It is quiet. Sites were level with full hookups. $30/night. I couldn't get the wifi to work but everything else was great. The spots were gravel but the electric & water hookups looked very new. Wish there were more no nonsense places like this.

Text: We really enjoyed our stay at RV Express. The spot is safe and convenient, it is near restaurants, WalMart and other shopping places. It is 20 minutes to Columbia.
The wifi is good and RV Express has a shower house/ bathroom.
Greg, the owner, keeps his customers happy.
