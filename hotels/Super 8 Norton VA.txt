Check in was great with Hillary, and the room was so clean and comfortable! Breakfast was awesome and the entire experience was "super" from start to finish! Nicest super 8 I've ever stayed in! Thanks!!!

Text: My husband & I stayed here on Friday the 13th, after our motorcycle ride from Nashville, TN. Our room was clean & quiet which made for a restful sleep. Hilary at the front desk is an absolute gem! Friendly, helpful, & a hard worker. Safe area. I will definitely stay here again if in the area.

Text: Awesome little place! Pet friendly without an outrageous pet fee!! AND the pride themselves in having mattress and pillow protectors, the kind that zip up! A++ in my book! No bed bugs here!! YAY!! Rooms are clean, and it always smells fresh!  I have had the pleasure of staying here a few times over this summer between traveling from SC to OH, to tend to my Fathers Grave in Mayking, Ky, I would rather drive a few more miles than to stay anywhere else near Mayking. Following a bad experience in Whitesburg Ky.  This place is  great place to stop and sleep, Its a 2 story place with no elevator so if you have any type of physical disability be sure to ask for a ground level room. Breakfast is just enough, always hot coffee in the lobby and hot water for Tea, or hot cocoa packets with sugar, and creamer set out for guests.The staff here are the absolute best. In my experience, they are all eager to help and do whatever they can to make your stay as comfortable as possible, let it be extra pillows, towels or shampoo. Hillary, Anthony and Merlin (sp) are all amazing people here, and that's just naming a few. I do plan to stay here again when I travel, and I would recommend calling them directly to get the best rates and discounts that aren't offered on any of the online booking sites. Tell 'em Angela sent you :)
