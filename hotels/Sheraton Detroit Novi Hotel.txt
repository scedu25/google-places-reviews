Sheraton Detroit Novi Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel it self was clean and staff were nice as they always are. But the security latch on my door was broken and the screws were stripped. It looked like someone tried to break in the room at one time and it was not repaired. Also, the room was behind the elevator. If you were in bedroom you couldn't hear it, but once in the bathroom, all the mechanical noise was easily heard. I didn't complain because, as mentioned the bedroom itself was quiet. I have stayed their a few times before and I will stay their again, but next time will do a once over the room before it gets too late.

Text: Beautiful hotel, right off the highway. Very easy to get to. Incredibly nice staff, and well kept venue. Room was spacious and beautifully furnished. Bed was comfortable, linens crisp and clean. Lots of places to eat within walking distance , and shopping about 5 min drive away.

Text: My wife and I stayed here for a football weekend at the University of Michigan. We were pleasingly surprised. The hotel had a great location, great rooms, great service… We were really really happy when we left. We used @35,000 points to pay for the room.

Text: Good sized rooms, especially if you're a gold or platinum spg member and can stay on the 7th floor (club level). Smallish gym, but it has all the requisite equipment (free weights, treadmill, bike, etc.). Located right near decent sized mall (has a best buy and Dick's sporting goods store) and a number of fast food options (taco bell, etc.). The service is what stands out! Everyone who works here is courteous and greets everyone with a smile and a friendly hello. It's about 20 miles north east of Ann Arbor, so a good option if the hotels in Ann Arbor are sold out.

Text: The staff was courteous and pleasant. We had a late check-in so the next day we asked to delay the checkout time by 30 mins and we were granted an extra hour. The room was spacious and comfortable. When packing before check-out, we double checked for our items all around the room including under the bed and found a card from the housekeeping staff that stated that they even cleaned under there. I would highly recommend this hotel.
