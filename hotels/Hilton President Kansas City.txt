Hilton President Kansas City
Rating: 5
Text: The hospitality of the Hotel President Kansas City is always top-notch. I stay frequently, and the level of service is consistent. The rooms have been recently updated, and are very comfortable and stately. The Drum Room is excellent, and a part of Kansas City's great history. The hotel itself is a historic landmark. Make it a part of your Kansas City trip, you won't regret it!

Text: I was initially allured by the premise of a historic hotel and the location in Downtown KC and I now consider these to be the Hotel President's few redeeming qualities. For the rate paid, I expected basic amenities such as a mini fridge, microwave, and a TV remote - all which were absent from our room. Ice and vending machines are only on certain floors, causing some inconvenience. A fire alarm, which turned out to be a false call, served as a blaring 7:30AM wake up call. These things happen, but the directions given were poor and the situation could have been handled better. Staying at the President was not a bad experience, however it was overpriced and basic. I would not stay again.

Text: Parking was a bit of a hassle, but that is to be expected in that area. To use the hotel garage, you must check in first. Otherwise, we enjoyed the stay. Room service was fast. Great location. Good views. Quiet room.

Text: The hotel itself is gorgeous and full of history and is within walking distance of many different places to visit. The staff were wonderfully helpful and very courteous. We will definitely consider staying again when we are next in the area.
