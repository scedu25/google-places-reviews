Hampton Inn Winfield/Teays Valley
Rating: 5
Text: Hamptons rarely disappoint, but we really enjoyed our stay here! We stopped in last minute, mid road trip, due to 2 babies who did not want to be in the car for a minute longer. The front desk was extremely helpful and was able to make a room available that would accommodate us. Did I mention there were cookies in the oven that were later offered to us for free?! That's the home-away-from-home feel a hotel is supposed to have! Walking distance to lots of restaurants and very well kept - not a single complaint.
