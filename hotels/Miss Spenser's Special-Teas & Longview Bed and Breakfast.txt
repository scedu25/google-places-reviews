Text: We celebrated an early 20th wedding anniversary here, and what a gift it was!  Donna (and Spenser, too!) is all about service - we felt comfortable with her right away.  She pays attention to the little details of hospitality, and we feel rejuvenated and refreshed!  Thank you, Donna - we look forward to coming back!!

Text: Free time is a precious and ever dwindling commodity, and when we seek to tender this token we pray our time was worth the exchange.  To say that Miss Spenser's Special-Teas was worth the trip would only begin to portray these exquisite amenities.  

Upon our arrival we were welcomed at the door as old friends by Donna and put at our ease.  After being seated we were served both tea and gentle conversation.  A panoply of hors d'oeuvres were prepared to coincide with the central theme of the tea.  Knowing that all aspects of the service were given such great care only served to underscore how special the experience was.  

Seldom have we felt so warm and contented when outside our own home.  I can't wait to return and be welcomed as old friends once more.
