Morning Star Bed & Breakfast

Text: I dislike giving so-so reviews but we tried 3 times to contact this B&B for a reservation; no response at all. If it was full I understand, but I don't get being ignored. We went to The Inn on Crescent Lake in Excelsior Springs instead and were very satisfied.

Text: After staying here repeatedly for the last few years I cannot say how much I have appreciated the cleanliness and hospitality of the Morning Star. My business takes me to another state now so I wanted let everyone know they can't go wrong with a stay here. I have stayed in all the rooms and found them all great in their own way. The bathrooms are wonderful along with the rooms and beds. (and I found the mattresses exceptional) Laurie's breakfasts were fresh and different every time and she always accommodated me as far as what time I needed to eat. I can only hope to find a place to stay in my new territory that remotely compares. This may sound silly but I wish them the best and hope to return sometime!
