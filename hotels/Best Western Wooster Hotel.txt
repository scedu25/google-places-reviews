Text: A wonderful hotel.  Clean comfortable updated rooms.  We appreciated the refrigerator and microwave in the room. The location of this hotel is in the downtown area of Wooster and is within 2 blocks of fantastic restaurants.  Very good dining.  The staff was great.  We will be going back there next year.

Text: Fantastic location in Wooster, fantastic staff. Hotel is nice enough, though the rooms feel close to dated. Bathroom felt a bit cramped. Parking is nice, access to downtown Wooster is great - literally walk out the door. The staff were helpful above and beyond expectations for me.
