Text: Sorry for the poor rating but we not happy with our stay here. On our arrival the receptionist was rude saying she did not have my name on the list. I dug out my paper with the confirmation number. Then when she ran my card she said it was no good. I said it was. She entered the info manually and it worked.

Later after we got our room we found that we needed an extra pillow. We went to the front desk waited about 10 minutes for someone to show up then she told us they don't give out extra pillows.

It's nice when people party at the wedding party or reception hall but when they bring the party back to the hotel it's not fair to those who are traveling and need to leave early. Very noisy place and the management seemed to let it go on.

At breakfast things were dirty, not cleaned well. No one around to tell.

Also no one around to check out. We put our keys on the counter along with several others. As we drove off we noticed the lady out back in the garden picking up some veggies or something. Not a very good way to run a business.

It's been a long time since I've been in a hotel like this one but I would never recommend anyone to say here...

Text: Rooms are nice . Lobby and 1st floor hallway smell like a Indian restaurant. Hold your breath if you don't like it.
