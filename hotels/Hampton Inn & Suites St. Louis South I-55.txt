Text: Very good hotel! Lets you get further from the chaos of downtown, but is easily within a 20 minute drive of most of the city attractions. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and sincere! The room was spacious and clean. The pool and hot tub were both very good and well-kept. They have free cookies (fresh baked) and cold milk every night, which we enjoyed. Who wouldn't? The breakfasts have good variety, and constantly have stock of everything so nothing runs out. Will definitely return to this location in the future.

Text: Right next to the Center for Advanced Medicine, handy if you need to come in the night before an out patient procedure. Nice, well kept hotel with clean rooms and bathrooms. Staff very friendly, no highway noise. Could be a little quieter inside, kids in a adjoining room or running in hallway are heard clearly. Usual waffle breakfast but presented in a neat, clean environment. Could upgrade coffee quality, but it's free so hard to complain.

Text: I love this hotel. We have been back to this hotel every year since it opened. The rooms are very clean, beautifully decorated with all white bedding. And the beds are so comfortable. Every night they are have freshly baked cookies and nice cold milk to dunk them in. Yummy. Breakfast is offered free each morning, fresh fruit, waffles, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, sausage, pastry, cereal and beverages. The pool is indoors and nice. There is also a small gym. I think they have won the Connie award (named for Conrad Hilton) each year they have been open. Located right off 55 it is a great location.

Text: Stayed here for our daughters 4th birthday visit to Grants Farm. The location is great & easy access from the interstate. This is by far the best hospitality hotel we have been to. The entire staff was very happy to help out with whatever we needed. Room was clean & quiet,the swimming pool was clean and stocked with pool toys for the kids. Milk and cookies at evening was a nice touch.
