Kansas City Marriott Downtown

Text: I stayed here for 3 nights while I attended an event at the conference center. Great location. Easy access to lots of food options, the Power & Light District and practically across the street from the conference center. Don't feel attendance were friendly and helpful. Super great service even with hundreds of people checking in at the same time. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. I loved the bed and the shower had amazing water pressure and heat. Housekeeping was awesome as well. The only down side were the elevators. Weird system where you had to select the floor before you got on the elevator. Supposedly it was efficient, but several times we waited 5+ minutes for the elevator.

Text: There are 2 buildings connected by a sky bridge. One is nice and modern,the other a bit dated. Unfortunately we were in the old building. As a Gold member we got complementary breakfast which was great. Ig variety including smoked salmon. Nice bar area in main building as well as a coffee shop and sundry shop. Convenient to the convention center.

Text: Get there early for breakfast. Otherwise staff room front to housekeeping are great. We stayed in an older section of hotel that was attached to main tower by walkway, so it felt really far. away Rooms were still comfortable but finding electric others s challenging. Wifi writhed fine

Text: This is a very nice, clean downtown hotel. The staff is super friendly--always saying hello. I enjoyed a great cocktail and sandwich in the bar. If you like barbecue and potatoes, try the tasty tater tots and burnt ends. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant  was also enjoyable and at a reasonable price. The hotel is walking distance to the Power and Light entertainment district. Water and coffee was also available in the skywalk, which was a plus. They should add a towel rack for hand towels in the bathroom and lamps with outlets by the bed.

Text: The only thing wrong with my stay at this hotel was that there were no black out curtains in my room. That's one of my favorite things about staying in hotels, waking up and not knowing what time it is because I can't see the light from outside! Other than that, I enjoyed my stay. I enjoyed the food and the drinks.
