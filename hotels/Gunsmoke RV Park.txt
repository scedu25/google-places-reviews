Gunsmoke RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We had a GREAT time here. It was insanely hot, so I was VERY thankful for the pool. Everything was neat and clean, the new owners were extremely friendly and helpful, and the kids loved the game room. The laundry services were nice and affordable, the bathrooms were some of the cleanest we've encountered in our travels, and the sites were level (and most of them pull thru). I also appreciated that as long as it didn't get too busy they tried to book every other campsite so trailers weren't so close together. We had no complaints. 
Side note: I would also highly recommend the Long Branch Lagoon water park in Dodge City if you have kids. We really enjoyed it, especially in the extreme heat.

Text: Friendly hosts, clean and neat.  A bit of ambiance with there decor.  Just a little noisy because of highways and trains.  But overall a very nice RV Park.

Text: Great place. Clever amenities all going with the wild west theme. We stayed on Miss Kitty lane. A very clean rv campground. Would definitely stay here again if we pass this way again.

Text: This was our last night to spend in our glamper.  The park and restrooms are clean.  Laundry was affordable.  They gave us a great rate as all we needed was electric.  The new owners are very friendly and are doing a great job with the park.
