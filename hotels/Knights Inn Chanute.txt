Knights Inn Chanute

Text: Andy, the owner, is a gruff Lou Grant type who can tell you anything you need to know. Very quiet and clean motel. I preferred it to my options in Independence and it offered a better price as well as amenities. The bathtub had scalloped shelves (great for non klutzes), literally the only complaint I had was the old fridge in my room. It was clean, spacious and so quiet!
