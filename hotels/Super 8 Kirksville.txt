Super 8 Kirksville
Rating: 4
Text: Very standard accommodations. Cleaning staff very thorough, came to my room shortly after cleaning could actually smell cleaning products! A lot of hotels empty the trash and give new towels and call it a day. Front desk staff also very helpful and friendly. Service definitely top notch but building itself could use a little work. Overall a very good stay

Text: The bed was comfortable.  The key wouldn’t work.  The whole apparatus for the key and door lock was extremely loose.  There are no elevators in the building.  It was extremely difficult to pull my suitcase up the steep stairs. The stairs to get to the breakfast area were even steeper.  The television didn’t work.  I know it is an older Super8; however, it certainly was not handicap accessible!

Text: Nice place for a night or 2. Price is very reasonable, it is clean and manager is friendly and helpful. The bathtub could have used a little more scrubbing in the bottom but definitely not anything to complain about. Beds are comfortable,  the rooms are cool but the hallways are warm. Not a lot of amenities but I would not expect many at the low price we paid per night. There is a simple continental breakfast put out in the morning with coffee and juice. I would recommend the Super 8 in Kirksville

Text: Not our preferred hotel in Kirksville, MO. We stay here only if it's the only hotel where we can get a room at a reasonable price.

Text: Rooms were clean. Breakfast options are limited. But the price is ok for that.
