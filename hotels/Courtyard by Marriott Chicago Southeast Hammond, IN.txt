Text: I had a wonderful stay for nine nights. This place is a great secret. Great people. I have been to a lot of hotels and I have to say this is my favorite. They are there to help 24 hours.

Text: Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.

Text: Great location and friendly staff. Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.

Text: This is a beautiful hotel. Beautiful water views, patio, sofa sleeper in the suite, comfortable beds, and on top of that a friendly staff that meet you with the smile, and even bring you up at toothpaste and toothbrush when you need one. An indoor swimming pool, bistro, and Starbucks are a few amenities in this beautiful modern decorated hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area.
