Text: Room was clean, nice amenities. Breakfast was a bit lackluster, but if you like fresh waffles, no need to worry! Hot tub in pool area was just warm. Overall for what I needed, nice stay.

Text: The rooms are decent sized and the pool and hot tub are nice. Only complaint was I wish it was a little cleaner but it wasn't bad. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: NOT FANCY, BUT CLEAN & NICE.  HAS NICE POOL.  VERY INEXPENSIVE SO IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO Bloomington to work & just need a room to sleep I highly recommend it.

Text: The room was acceptable, but had a slightly funny smell. There was not enough parking. Breakfast was OK, but waffles were about the only warm option. The mini refrigerator in the room was NOT clean. The oddest thing to me was that the room lights were on a motion sensor that was by the door. If you were on the bed the sensor could not "see" you, so the lights would turn off. The same issue for the bathroom light.
