Text: Great hotel! Staff was wonderful when we had contact. Room was great and a lot bigger than expected (We had the Jacuzzi suite). Breakfast was really good. Location was close to everything as well. I would stay here again in the future.

Text: Great hotel and superb management.  We had out of town guests stay at this location and they were very pleased with the cleanliness and had a great nights' sleep.  The pillows were heavenly!

Text: Staff was very friendly. My room was comfy. The temperature in the room was perfect. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the hallways and side entrances smell musty, and breakfast was gross. But the friendliness of the staff and comfortable rooms make up for those minor disappointments.

Text: We stayed overnight just to go to Six Flags. The room was fine. Got the typical king bed, microwave, and mini fridge. Had to ask for an additional blanket so I could make a bed up on the floor for the kids and they accommodated. Two minutes the shower curtain did not contain the water in the shower and the tile floor was very slippery inside and outside of the bathroom. Second, the blackout curtains did not go across the whole windows so let in a lot of light.

Text: The room was large and very clean. The heated pool was amazing. The location was a little confusing to get to, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. Also the breakfast was the best of any hotel I have been to yet! I would definitely recommend this location to a friend looking for somewhere to stay in the area.
