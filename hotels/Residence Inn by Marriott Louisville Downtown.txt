Text: Friendly staff, clean rooms and safe area. Brought our dog and he was welcomed too. Needed a cab staff called one for me.
Rating: 3
Text: Not the best service when it comes to area recommendations, I was told to use GPS to find anything. Room smelled heavily of smoke, not sure why if property is non- smoking. Breakfast was good, food always fresh and tasty

Text: I travel a lot and this was my worst experience with a hotel.  I cancelled my reservation and was charged anyway.  I spent hours trying to get this corrected but the general manager was rude and condescending.  Customer service at Marriott can only defer to the General Manager of that hotel.  Very disappointed after being a loyal Marriott customer for years.  Will change over to Hilton for my rewards.
