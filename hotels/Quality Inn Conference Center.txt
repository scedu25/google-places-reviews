Text: (Note- the pics of the room are post-stay) We paid $115 with tax for a double Queen Bed room. The Positives: acess to a large, deep pool, a fresh and large breakfast, close proximity to Walmart. The Negatives, the room smelled a bit odd, and the external sliding door to the pool area got jammed. Overall, the stay was average, and if i was ever in this town again, i would stay here for the price.
