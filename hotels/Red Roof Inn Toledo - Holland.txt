Text: I wouldn't even give it one star. This is by far the worst motel I have ever stayed in. The room we got smelled of smoke, even though we had a non smoking room. Only one light worked & the bathroom light. So when I had to turn the lights off, I had to feel around in the dark to get back to bed. Seriously needs a paint job. The bathroom door had half of the paint ripped off. The room was beyond dusty. The bed spread had holes in it. And to top it off the house keeper didn't even leave any toothe brushes & no soap. I most definitely will NOT return to the rat hole! Could spend the same amount of money at a much better place.

Text: Good enough, for the cheap. OK bed. OK shower. Good staff. Stayed there a lot. Had good experiences, and one or two not-so-good. Generally, good enough.

Text: Very small room, very out dated everything from the drapery to the carpet, bedspread, fixtures, lighting, all looked like 1990's decore..Front office was the only semi modern looking area...,
