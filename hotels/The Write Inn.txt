The Write Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Our experience was good. It's an old building and the rooms are small, but it seems pretty well taken care of. It's location is great. The neighborhood is nice and they're quite close to the green line so getting into the city is very easy. The hotel will also pay for your parking in one of the city's parking garages (only a few blocks away, by the green line). There wasn't anything mind blowing about the experience, but it was nice and I would go back.

Text: This is a lovely place to stay right in the heart of Oak Park and 2 blocks from the Green line. The staff is friendly and helpful. Free parking is 2 blocks away but there is pick up and drop off room for luggage. I would come back.

Text: Though I only visited the quaint lobby, the Inn has a lot of retro character. It's also across from the Hemmingway Museum.

Text: Iconic hotel. Rooms are comfortable but could use better cleaning service as well as updating, which I believe is currently happening. Location is awesome. Restaurant is top notch. Best coffee!

Text: Great location. We stayed there because it was close to a green line station and offered free parking, so we didn't have to drive into the city. Close to a lot of nice/cute shops
