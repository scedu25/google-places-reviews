Text: BEWARE - BED BUGS!  We checked in to Americas Best Value Inn in St. Joseph, Mo about 2 a.m. on 8/19/17 after traveling all day.  Since it was actually 3:00 a.m. (our time), we were exhausted and went to bed quickly as we had to be up and out by 7:30 a.m.  When I got up the next morning, I saw a dead bed bug in the bed.  I then started checking the whole bed and saw a live one crawling on a pillow.  I immediately took it to the front desk and confronted the manager/owner.  I then brought him back to the room, pulled back the sheets to expose the mattress pad and there were 3 more live bugs.  He apologized and didn't charge us for the room; however, I still am upset about our stay and worried that the eggs (or bugs) will have gotten in our suitcases and I will have an infestation in my bedroom at home.

Text: It's a nice hotel with friendly staff. The beds are too soft in my opinion. Right next to pretty much every food option you could want.
