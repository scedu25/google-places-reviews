Text: Really nice couple took over ownership in December. They are remodeling the clubhouse.  Showers and laundry are available.  The office is not always open but a message plays to let you know about availability each day.  The park is all gravel and level.  The pull through worked great for our 30 foot motor home and tow car.

Text: New owners are doing a fixing up and cleaning up the park. Jim & Lori are great to work with and all the family is very accomodating. We got to chose our site and it was level. Wifi is good. Clean showers/restrooms and laundry room. A large kitchen and a community room that is also used by locals for various occasions. We would definitely come back if any where near the area.

Text: When we arrived, we were put in a spot that was full of holes and mud.  We saw a spot further down that looked level, so we asked if we could use it.  The man at the desk said yes.  We backed in and were setting up when we noticed an awful smell.  The people in the RV next door obviously let their large dog out to poop on the pad next door - I'm not talking about once, but appeared for a long time.  We went to the office to complain, and was told he would try and call the dog owner.  However he, himself showed up a few mins later to clean up SOME of it.  We then left to visit family and arrived home late.  This morning we were greeted with a fresh new pile.
  Impression the owners don't care or they would do something about it.  Rough park and won't stay there again unless it is fixed up.
