Text: Great location! Tasty breakfast! Friendly receptionists (special thanks to Anna who went above and beyond to make the stay pleasant)! Room service imperfections won't let me mark the hotel with 5 stars, only 4.

Text: Rooms are great. Living room is very nice and spacious. Stayed in 2 queen room. Bedroom television was too small for the size of the room. Bathroom area was nice and had plenty of space for toiletries.

Breakfast was not very good. Food was okay but each morning there were scrambled eggs (powder) and two types of breakfast meat. They had cereal and milk and bread and such but it seemed a bit below a Residence Inn quality.
