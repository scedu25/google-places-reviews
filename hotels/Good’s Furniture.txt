Text: We found four leather dining chairs and Rob Peters, the salesman, came over to give us information on them. They were comfortable and stylish.  We have been looking for dining chairs for a long time and these were perfect. Rob told us they had to be ordered and they could take 8 to 12 weeks and we had no problem with that.  He was a great salesman and made the process easy. The chairs arrived after less than four weeks and we are thrilled with their look and how comfortable they are to sit on. We had a very nice shopping experience at Good's! In fact, we might order two more in the near future.

Text: I have purchased from Goods 4 different times and I have always had great service.  I have loved all of the items I bought and they have held up well over the years.  My most recent purchase was a sofa table, and I love it and I'm sure it will be enjoyed for years to come.  
Salesperson Dave O has helped me on the past 2 purchases and he was great!  Offered great ideas and advice with color choices, but was in no way a "pushy" salesperson.  Thank you, Dave!
Your guys in the warehouse where I picked up my items were so nice and so careful in getting items into my vehicle.  They went above and beyond to help in trying to get things into the car without damaging not only the purchased item but also my car!  Thank you to all of them!

Text: Our salesman, Johnny, was a true professional.  We made our first visit in September and told him we were "just looking".  He showed us many choices in the giant store without hurrying or pushing us.  He carefully wrote down all items we were interested in.  When we were ready to make a decision a month later we called Johnny and made an appointment.  He had a list of the items we had liked before and quickly took us to their location.  He made excellent, informed recommendations about wood type and fabric.  We had a most pleasant shopping experience at a store that could have been overwhelming.

Text: This is a superb furniture store. They have an extremely wide variety, both in terms of style and price point. It is very large and, therefore, a great place to wander. The employees are very knowledgeable, helpful and enthusiastic. We were assisted by Johnny- a great guy.The business has a long, rich history; it is family-owned and operated and the pride is evident throughout. I strongly recommend Good's. If you are not in the vicinity of Kewanee, it is worth the trip. They have a very large delivery radius (we live in a Chicago suburb) and the delivery charge is extremely reasonable.

We followed up with Johnny in late October and purchased an amazing bedroom set. We had a number of issues with measurements and dimensions, but Johnny was endlessly patient and helpful, even sending photos of angles and spaces with the measuring tape next to the piece so there was no confusion. He's a real pro.

Text: Our salesperson couldn't have been more helpful.  He showed us around all the buildings and each floor of furniture but gave us space when my husband and I were deciding on what pieces to consider.  He was very patient when we went back and forth to the rooms trying to decide.  The furniture is high quality unlike the "big box" furniture stores.  We felt the pricing was reasonable for the quality.  Lastly the delivery people showed up on time and were very pleasant.  We will be back to shop at Good's.
