Text: Coming from Wisconsin, it was this beautiful Oasis in the midst of a sea of cornfields. We didn't know what to expect, having called ahead to reserve just a few hours before, and I was very happy with what I found. The rooms were very clean, the sound proofing was great, the beds were very comfortable, the showers modern. Breakfast was yummy, if not heavy on the carbs, and all the staff I met were friendly, even though it was very busy because of the eclipse. It was a very nice, clean place to stay. I have absolutely no complaints. Visitors should note there are no elevators.

Text: Stayed there about a couple of weeks ago and it is over priced for the area as a hotel 15 minutes away is much cheaper and is just as clean. 

I realized I left a kindle there and called them to go into the room and check and they would call back shortly. After an hour of waiting we called and they still have not gone into the room to check and said they would call back. After another hour of waiting and no response I called back and requested sternly to go into the room and check and they finally did and they stated it was not in the room. I called the next two days to locate this device and each time there was no concern or help from the staff on helping me locate this. 

I will not be staying there again if a companies policy is to not return items that may have been left in the hotel rooms and the price is steep for the area.

Text: The hotel was clean, the staff friendly. We needed a place to stay on short notice and the manager helped us by closing put a room that had a cancellation. The o ly thing is they do not have an elevator.
