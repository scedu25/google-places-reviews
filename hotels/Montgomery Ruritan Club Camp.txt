Montgomery Ruritan Club Camp
Rating: 5
Text: Big clean campgrounds with a nice playground area for the kids and a nice lake the owners are very nice and make you feel welcome with 160 spots and 10 all season this place is always full. Hard to get into but well worth it if you do. I camp all year long for my work so I hope that they add more year round spots.

Text: If you do not mind being crowded then you would end up giving more stars.  Staff is friendly and they have a playground and boat dock. One lane one way in and out.
