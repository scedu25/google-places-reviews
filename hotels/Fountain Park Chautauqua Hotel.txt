Fountain Park Chautauqua Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Great location with a nice pavilion. Good playgrounds for the kids. There are plenty of water and electric hookups with a dump station. Clean restrooms with several showers and stalls in them. Nice trail around the cottages to ride bikes. The Chautauqua is only open for a couple weeks in July or August but the park itself is able to be reserved for groups.

Text: My family has enjoyed Fountain Park for five generations. A wonderful experience for anyone to spend a relaxing day or stay the entire two weeks. 
The last two weeks in July each year is the favorite time of summer for the whole family. 
Over the years many lifelong friendships have developed. Friends and families from most every state in the USA.

Text: Vintage historical landmark with its basic white walls and porches snaking round to overlook the park, gazebo, and other neighboring vacation homes, the Fountain Park Hotel is from another age. It's a quiet spot for those two weeks a year when Chautauqua comes to life and we all try to forget the busy messes left behind.
