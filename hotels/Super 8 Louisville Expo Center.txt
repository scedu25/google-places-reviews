Super 8 Louisville/Expo Center
Rating: 3
Text: Nice place, nothing fancy. It's close to Kentucky kingdom, Kentucky fair, and exposition center and I have a view of all three from my room. The front desk clerk's have all been nice and helpful. Motel is decently clean and a decent budget hotel. Smell of weed in the hallway and elevator will knock you down at night (just a tip if you have children as I did.) Overall a nice experience.

Text: Very nice remodel being done.  Very clean, comfortable rooms.  Staff was very nice and very helpful when we arrived and when we left.  I will return there when we return to Louisville.

Text: If I had the choice I wouldn't of gave it one star. Not a family environment. Once I reported to management of all the pot smoking going on on my floor they would no longer let me stay. 
Potheads great place for you guys. Family and construction workers stay away. 
Plus the employees are such assholes. Breakfast sucks. Miles well eat a sugar cube.

Text: Friendly staff, I had a nice room with a view of Kentucky Kingdom. Comfortable bed. Nice breakfast, waffles but very good. I went back for seconds. Walking distance or a short drive to nice restaurants and a bar that any sailor would love! I'll stay again.

Text: This Super 8 does a good job of providing a safe, clean, restful sleeping environment for the night.  The breakfast is basic for today's standard and they did a good job of making sure it is always stocked.
