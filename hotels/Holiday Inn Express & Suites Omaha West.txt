Holiday Inn Express & Suites Omaha West
Rating: 4
Text: This hotel was quite near where I was working for the week. Wifi is speedy. The rooms are nice and the staff is friendly. The evening reception is a nice way to pass some time. There are a number of restaurants nearby, though it is a couple of miles to the expressway.

Text: The room was very clean and updated in detail. The bathroom was extremely clean and detailed. It was fully stocked with plenty of towels and rags. Unfortunately, the heater or air didn't work very good leaving the room rather warm during the sleeping stage.

Text: The location is great the rates are reasonable. The rooms are showing some age. Finish on bathroom doors is wearing off. Shower curtain needs repair and also the plaster wall needs a vetter repair. The facial tissue is terrible, very rough and low,quality. Not what i would expect from Holiday Inn. The staff is fantastic and the breakfast was great. The place is very clean. The tv does not have a sleep timer. Limited choice of tv channels unless you like sports. They must have 10 or 15 sports channels.
