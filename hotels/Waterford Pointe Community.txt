Text: They told me they would finish updating this mobile home after I moved from Colorado. I now have an 18 month lease with 6 missing windows and no insulation on the floors... I have a $550.00 electric bill. They (The office) laugh when talking about it but with thermostat at 74, beyond the hall where the thermostat is the rest of this place stayed at 62. they knew I went to hospital 3 times for cold/flu but they chuckle and tell me the windows are on order and its not their problem, I signed the lease on a promise and not on paper. they got me good.
