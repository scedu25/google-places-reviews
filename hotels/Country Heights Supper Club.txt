Text: Prime rib was so so... not much flavor... salad bar was ok too... I will probably not order the prime rib again... I will give it another chance down the road...

Text: This was the worst meal I've ever eaten. Can't usually ruin twice baked potatoes but they certainly weren't fresh and tasted awful, even using sour cream didn't help. Chicken must have been cooked in used cooking oil. Couldn't even eat it. Will never eat there again.
