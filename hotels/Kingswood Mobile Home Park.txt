Text: The owners are under handed and causes tenants trouble. They raise the lot rent every 3 to 6 months. I know they have someone towing off cars without warning and charge outrageous charges. Cruel and mean the way people are treated. They exploit the ones they discriminate against. They need to learn compassion and empathy. Thieves.
