Text: We stopped on our way out they town. Our arrival time was close to 10:30 pm. Rose was the front desk clerk and I asked her for a discounted rate since we arrived so late and she was very accommodating and wonderful. The room was beautiful and very clean. The breakfast buffet was extremely satisfying, and a lot to choose from. The only disappointing part is the hot tub was not working and after driving 5 hours straight this would have been nice to use even for a bit. The pool was a bit cool. But I would give this a solid 4.5!
