Motel 6 Maryland Heights Mo

Text: We came in off of driving 20 straight hours from Arizona, and I had messed up on our bookings. Staff handled it very professionally, and had a lot of humor with it too. I would stay here again, the next time I come to St. Louis. Absolutely loved the place. Friendly staff, great room conditions, comfortable beds. Two things that would've made my stay better are, updates to the fitness room, and better floor conditions, they were fairly sticky.

Text: My fiance and I enjoyed the stay overall, we loved the area, very peaceful and quiet, however, we did not think the front desk clerks were very professional...   when we tried to check in on Thursday night / Friday morning, it was around 2 am, the girl acted like we woke her up, and she was not happy and courteous to us at all...  then when we tried to check out on Saturday morning, we encountered another girl who was trying to "tend" to the coffee stock, she told us to "JUST leave your key cards on the counter", I told her I would like to have our receipt please, she went to the counter and printed it for us...but not too happy again...  I just wanted to let you know so maybe you can train the staff in that context that when you are a front desk clerk, you need to be cheerful and courteous at all time, because that is not a very good impression to the guests... that's all I got...  Thanks again for a nice stay!!

Text: Our stay was excellent. It feels much more like a hotel than a motel, so it made the stay such a great value for the price. We were welcomed from the moment we walked through the door. Our only complaint is that the cable TV is fuzzy for most channels, and we wanted to keep up with the local news considering the things that were happening in the area during our stay. It was an excellent visit, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in the area!

Text: The room was clean and comfortable although the location was difficult to locate when we first arrived.  There was no sign that identified the driveway entrance to the motel, so we passed it twice.  The service at the front desk was courteous and helpful at all times.  We had a problem with the lock on our door.  The attendant came to our room to assist us right away.

Text: The rooms were minimal compared to what I'm used to. There was no microwave or mini- fridge, no breakfast (continental or otherwise), the snack machine was out of order and the water pressure was ridiculously low. That being said the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the whole place was very clean the whole time I was there even though there were no vacancies due to the eclipse. The price was right and because of the awesome staff I'd definitely stay here again.
