Text: Visited on the Knox Scenic Drive weekend.  Especially liked the fresh produce, pumpkins, and Indian corn sold outside. Grandchildren enjoyed the carriage ride, petting zoo, and hot apple cider.

Text: We stayed here through AirBNB.  The house was pleasant and cute, except the basement.  The basement flooded during the rain.  The claim of a second bathroom was only a shower faucet out of the ceiling and a wood pallet surrounded by an old curtain.  The WiFi speed was non-existent.  The host kept changing her mind about checkout.  The food was good, but beware the host.

Text: Beautiful rustic barn venue if that's all you need.  The wedding party made it work quite well.  For a wedding of over 100 people there was 1 outhouse with 2 holes cut into a piece of wood to sit on...seriously(well seasoned wood from years of over-spray I'm sure).  Very difficult for food preparation when the wedding party had to bring a half a dozen roasting pans for the food.  The parking area was mowed to the floor boards of our car, so anyone with open toed shoes had wet feet covered with grass and bugs.  Tips:  Cut the grass in the parking area, get some permanent bathrooms and prep area for food.
