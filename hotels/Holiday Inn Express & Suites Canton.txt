Text: The staff is very friendly and gave us plenty of recommendations for restaurants in the area. The rooms are clean and maintained very well. It's close to the airport so that is nice if you need that as well.

Text: Great Hotel, breakfast has many options. Staff was very nice and helped us with anything we needed. My son was teething and fussy most of the time and staff was very understanding and helpful.

Text: The hotel was clean. Staff was professional and helpful. The room was nice but the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. May be personal preference but my wife and I both were uncomfortable.

Breakfast was great.
The water was hot!

The hotel is very run down for an HIE.
Won't stay here again.
