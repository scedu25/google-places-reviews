The Inn at Versailles
Rating: 5
Text: I wish I could give 10 stars!! We have been here 3 times (anniversaries!) over the last 5 years and it has never disappointed! The rooms are fantastic and they all have their own charm! The staff is very friendly and goes out of there way to make sure you have everything you need! Only a few minutes from Bear's Mill-a working mill! And a few minutes from Greenville which has great antique shops and other gems!!

Text: Great food, great service, nice craft beer/wine selection. Went when there was live music (pianist), portion size was enough for me to ask for a box, which is abnormal for me. On the pricier side but worth it if that's what you're looking for.

Text: I've stayed at this Inn 4 or 5 times over the years and every stay has been great. The rooms are really nice but you still get the old hotel vibe. They're constantly making upgrades, trying to make smooth out processes, and make the guests experience overall, easier. It's a bit off the beaten path but if you are in the area I recommend staying here.

Text: A nice, quiet, comfortable environment. Generous food and drink selection. Attentive staff. I recommend the woodfire grilled ribeye Delmonico. If you're in the area, The Inn at Versailles is definitely a place to stop.
