Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago-Lincolnshire
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is absolutely amazing. We stayed here on the weekend of my son's Navy graduation. It's a little further than the others close to the base but completely worth it. The extra space in the rooms as well as the dining and outside areas made it perfect to spend the day with my son. A little bit of home away from home. The staff was very attentive and accommodated any need we had. If you are searching for a great place to stay for graduation consider them.

Text: Homewood Suites are always very nice hotels and this one is no exception. The service was very friendly around the clock. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was even very delicious! I also enjoyed the outdoor patio area. Thanks for a great experience! I'll definitely be returning to this location.

Text: Reservation for three rooms for a group of friends. I was able to add another name to the reservation making check in easier for the group who arrived first. Nice outdoor area for relaxing. Complimentary breakfast was good. Employees were helpful. The AC could be turned down a bit.
