Super 8 Moberly MO
Rating: 4
Text: This Super 8 is the best one I have been to considering its recent updates!

My room was the King, and all towels were clean and free of stains, same for the bed sheets. The sink and shower were all new and stain and soap scum free!

Breakfast is still mediocre bit hey, it is not the Hilton, right. Would I recommend and personality stay again, without a doubt!

Text: Very impressed!!!
New management has done a great job with updates. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with comfortable beds, a friendly staff and a pretty good breakfast then look no more.  Go ahead and book a room, you won't be sorry.  At least we weren't!!

Text: Very nice CLEAN place!   Lots of parking and nearby restaurants.  The staff is super friendly.  My room was a treat!  King size bed.  Huge movie theater power recliner.  Desk, fridge and microwave, not to mention a BIG BEAUTIFUL 55" LED TV in the room.  AC Has remote in case you get too cold our hot at night!  Nice touch!  Spotlessly clean!  Hats off to housekeeping staff, room was immaculate!  Rates were more than reasonable!  Would highly recommend this place to anyone.  This is how every hotel should be!

Text: Great place for the rate. Clean, quiet, and easy to get to. I would definitely stay here again if it continues to be maintained well. I've stayed in this town several times, and for the price, I think this is the best spot in town. The competitor down the street could be forty bucks higher, and I can't understand what they could offer that this place doesn't.

Text: Using a scale from 1-10, take your typical super8's rating and give it a +4. I try to avoid this chain because you never seem to get the same experience twice. A co-worker referred this spot, and I'm definitely not disappointed. I would stay here again. Clean, updated, and quiet...
