Drury Inn & Suites Middletown Franklin
Rating: 5
Text: Arrived here in Middletown with a reservation at a different hotel. After finding out my reservation was incorrect, it left me with no place to stay. The Drury had rooms available. I'm so glad my original hotel didn't have a room available. This place is gorgeous! I was nicely surprised when I walked in. It's clean, the rooms are very nice to say the least, staff is extremely friendly, and hotel is conveniently located. There's a restaurant and bar within a few steps outside, a grocery store just across the street. They have free breakfast, happy hour in the evenings and free pop and popcorn every night. Needless to say, this would be my first choice for a hotel in the area.

Text: Located in Middletown, the hotel is about half as big as a normal Drury. The perks are really nice, including popcorn, complimentary drinks and snacks available during certain hours. Staff was pleasant and responsive to requests.

Text: Nice hotel. Clean and inexpensive. The included dinner isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread but it is still a nice perk. Fresh waffles in the morning were yummy! Can't go wrong with free Fri is at the mini bar either.

Text: We had such a wonderful time at this hotel. The staff was excellent. Very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean and well managed. Based on our experience we will be looking for Drury hotels in all our travels. For future hotel builds we would just suggest putting a bathroom closer to the pool. Thanks to everyone who made our stay a great one.
