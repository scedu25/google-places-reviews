Mellon Acres

Text: I still cannot believe how lucky we were to find Mellon Acres to view the 2017 Solar Eclipse!  I had hoped to find a location where the 10 of us (children and grandchildren) would be able to spread out comfortably and safely watch the event.  Mellon Acres is so much more!   The spectacular barns, lake, waterfall, and lovely acres of lawn are just incredible.  Paul and Susan went way above and beyond to accommodate our last minute group from Oklahoma and we’ll never be able to thank them enough!  
We cheered each time the beautiful clouds parted as we watched the moon slowly eclipse the sun.  But then the blue sky appeared and we were stunned while experiencing totality, feeling the air cool, hearing crickets chirping, and seeing sunsets in every direction!
We can’t imagine a better place than Mellon Acres for any kind of gathering!   And, like the 2017 Solar Eclipse, words and pictures can’t do it justice, you have to see it to believe it!

Text: Owner turned off the music an hour before the place closed because one of the members of the party who designated the DJ left. She refused to allow someone else to take over, and this was a wedding....
