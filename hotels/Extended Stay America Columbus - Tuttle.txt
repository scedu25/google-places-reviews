Extended Stay America Columbus - Tuttle

Text: Had I not been there for a funeral (my dad's) I might have asked for some extra housekeeping-- which I do in five star resorts or modest places. Kacy the manager, couldn't have been more professional and accommodating. Every other desk person was great as well. The coffee was REALLY good-- and I'm picky. Our deluxe king suite was spacious. They have both foam and FEATHER pillows! Dogs are welcome.

Text: About standard Extended Stay. The beds are pretty good and the kitchen is usable and clean. The furniture is in good repair and the TV works good. All that being said the room I reserved was not available when we arrived so we ended up taking a suite for a little more so the room is larger and the price is fair for it but there is no recliner in the room and my wife needs one to get her feet up and the garden tub is nice unless you have mobility issues so the room is not as good for us as the one we ordered. We made our reservation weeks in advance and even came in early by a day and stayed in another motel for a night to verify the room availability and were told all was well in till we came to check in and then our room was unavailable. Not good.

Text: It's the nicest one I've stayed at yet. The room was very big and had a nice, partially seperate living room area. The breakfast is kinda garbage. Cereal bars and coffee, so don't bank on this place if you're hoping for a real breakfast.
