Text: The first room we went to had stains on the floor that looked like blood, the sheets on the bed were suppose to be white and they were actually yellow,  and there was a stinch to the room...the second room they tried moving us to was practically the same...there were holes in the blanket on the bed that looked like ciggerette burn holes, the security on that place sucks, anyone could break into your room... the whole place is disgusting..  I would not recommend it...and we were only there for a half hour at most and the management threw a fit when we asked for our money back....and they kept $10 for housekeeping fees as they called it and we weren't there long enough to even need the room repreped!!!!
