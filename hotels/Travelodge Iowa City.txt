Text: Very friendly checkin/checkout. Better than average breakfast. Rooms were clean. Beds were comfortable but pillows were quite small. You might want to bring your own. Nice courtyard and gazebo. Quiet.

Text: Easy on easy off the interstate. Breakfast options were nice and shower was hot. There ws no one at the front desk, but there was a sign saying they would be back. After 15 minutes I looked the # up and called and they came shortly there after to sign me in. Bed wasn't that comfortable. Affordable - sleep, shower, eat and head on your way hotel.

Text: The halls smelled like mildew. The breakfast was horrible. My door always stuck and wouldn't open. Inside my room the carpet was wet coming out of the bathroom and it was like that the whole 4 days we were there. my fridge barely kept anything cold even with the water put inside the freezer! And the shower barely got warm! I'll never stay there again.....

Text: Staff was nice. The room was clean and the bed was good. The breakfast wasn’t great, wasn’t very warm but you had different options to choose from so it was ok. Would stay here again.

Text: Great accommodations for the price. Comfy beds and seats, so if you're not going to spend a ton of the time in the room, it's a good choice.
