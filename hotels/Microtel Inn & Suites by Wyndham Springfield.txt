Text: Beautiful hotel with a great aesthetic. The queen bedroom we had was small but I actually liked the size, it's good for a couple looking for a nice weekend. The mirror right next to the bed is a plus too. Great staff. The breakfast was average, but if you don't want that there's an IHOP right next to the hotel.

Text: Great hotel staff was very kind. They look like they are currently updating the whole hotel. The only draw back is the pool was very small.

Text: The location was perfect. It was right off the highway and located near many attractions in Springfield. When we arrived they did have some renovations under way but that was no big deal. They were keeping it very clean. The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and the needs were clean and very comfortable. We had an issue with the in room hair dryer and it was taken care of very quickly! Thank you! The breakfast was included and tasty. If I had one thing to say that was not entirely favorable, he chlorine was very strong in the pool. We did not swim and I honestly wouldn't have here. We walked in the area and it bothered my eyes. Other than that it was great! We plan to stay again when we overnight in Springfield!
