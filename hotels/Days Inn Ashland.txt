Text: We were flooded out of our house. They were great to work with us.  We had no change of clothes or anything else we needed.  They were great.  When the tv went out they brought us a new one.  Great night staff.

Text: traveling from maryland. got here very early. luckily we reserved a room a head of time because they sold out last night. the room we reserved wasn't ready yet. but check in wasn't until 3. but because we arrived so early the clerk at the desk  immediately  found us a room that would be ready. and was able to get our room within an hour due to it being cleaned. the customer service is wonderful. room was very very clean! beds are stiff but comfortable and clean. was very very pleased and would definitely stay here again.

Text: VERY Good 2 star hotel. Place was clean and tv channel's are more then normal. The gentlemen at the morning front desk starts breakfast earlier to accommodate those who start very early.  Coffee was always fresh and  breakfast was good enough to start your long day off.  Wish I had more of these stays on my journeys!

Text: My dad and I stayed here during a month long trip riding dirt bikes and discovering the awesome trails in the surrounding area. This Days Inn allowed us to have an incredible bed and a great home base after our rides. The woman at the front desk works so so hard to give great service, and the surrounding trails were superb.
