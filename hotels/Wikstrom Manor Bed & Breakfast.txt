Text: Our experience with our family was euphoric at Wikstom Manor B & B. The setting and the area was excellent for our reasons to be there. It is a beautiful home built in 1892,  We loved eveything about it including the huge doors with transom's.  Greg was extremely helpful with our luggage & questions.  Like any 1892, home, it will always need a little TLC but that is to be expected. The 3 bedroom's was perfect for our family.  We had the whole house to ourselves.  My wife actually played a tune on the piano as we visited in the gorgeous living room.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and please don't expect it to be a high flutin' Holiday Inn.
