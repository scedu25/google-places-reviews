Text: Bathroom was OK, the room itself was dirty and faceplates on electrical outlets were missing. It's a cheaper place so I could live with that, but they gave us a room that smelled like a chimney even though they admitted that we booked a non-smoking room - "we steam cleaned the carpets, it shouldn't smell anymore!". Booking also included breakfast, but there is no breakfast.

Text: Contrary to our reservation was placed in a smoking room. The comforter had holes in it (cigarette burns?). The staff was rude at check-in and forced us to pay a $3 cash fee for use of a credit card (even though we had already paid?? hoping we don't get charged again). The room was only marginally clean and looked about 3 steps rattier than most of the pictures so far (sorry I don't have my own...) A trip to Walmart and half a can of febreeze later the room was bearable for the night.

Was later able to get a 20% refund through Priceline because the hotel acknowledged they hadn't given us the room we had reserved.

Text: OK experience, got there pretty late so pretty much just slept. The rooms looks like the furniture is handbuilt. Did not try the wifi but it exists. No complimentary shampoo, just two bar soaps. Otherwise the room has everything else you could expect.

Text: Please do not stay here if your looking for nice AND cheap. Bed has a top sheet an a plain dirty sheet. Pillows in dirty pillowcases and werent even put up. Hand towels werent folded. Over charged us said it would be 58$ an took 25$ more! Not even a fridge. Waste of money
