American Motor Inn

Text: Rooms were clean, area was quiet. Hotel staff, not the friendliest. We didn't have heat in our room. They offered a portable heater. We insisted on a new room so they gave us a new room with heat. They called me the next morning to tell me that the heat worked. They could have just checked that night instead of offering a portable. Once we were moved to a new room, we were content.

Text: For the price, it's pretty good. About a fifteen minute drive from Davenport, it's not too far out of the way. The rooms seemed pretty clean although there were no frills. Staff was friendly although not keen on providing an appropriate number of towels.
