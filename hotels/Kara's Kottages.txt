Kara's Kottages
Rating: 5
Text: When I hear the word "cottage," I think of someplace quaint and cozy. Kara's Kottage on Main Street definitely fit the bill! The small space was so well designed and well stocked (high-end toiletries and breakfast supplies available for use), it exceeded my expectations. To top it all off, Kara was very kind and accommodating. It was a perfect stay -- except for the trains going by in the wee hours. I'll bring earplugs next time :-)

Text: Kara's is s beautiful and cozy place. It was very clean. It was nice to stay and relax for the evening. It is close to downtown if you want to go out for the night. You can so stay in and cook or grill out on the patio. I will be staying again for sure.

Text: Get place. Very clean and breakfast provided many options. Visited in the winter so could not make use of the nice patio area.
