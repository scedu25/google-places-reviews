Text: 2 Strikes and your out!  I had a room booked and confirmed on the 9th.  On the 27th I get an email that the confirmation would not be honored so I called to find out what happened.  The first call I get a "hello" and then silence, leaving me wondering if I dialed the correct number, which I had.  When I asked about the cancellation, I get a click and I'm back to ground zero.  I call back, different person, but at least he answers appropriately.  He now advises they decided to remodel during the time of my reservation.  I ask about the rooms they still show as open and I get the same" we're remodeling".  This is the second time I've had reservation issues here.  There won't be a third.  Poorly managed!

Text: Our stay in the Sion Bass room was great. Management worked around our unusual timing and we enjoyed our visit. Everything was very clean and well kept.

Text: Loved it!!! The owners waited on us hand and foot. Very friendly and homelike atmosphere. Our room was clean and cozy. They had a live jazz singer while we there. Unfortunately we had to be up early the next day so we couldn't stay up and listen. I was worried it would keep us from sleeping but we didn't hear a thing and it wasn't a problem. It is within walking distance of everything downtown Fort Wayne has to offer. We will be back!!!

Text: Loved staying here, the staff is so friendly. The rooms are ex-one bedroom apartments, so they are fairly big. Our room had two queen-size beds, so if you have a bigger family they can fit easier.
