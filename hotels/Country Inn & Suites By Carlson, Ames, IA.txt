Text: The breakfast items never ran out and the hours were good. The beds weren't hard and neither was the pull out bed. This place was very nice and I would visit again.

Text: I would not stay here again. It was during a game weekend but it was crazy mental with parents hanging around outside the lobby, until at least 1:30am while kids ran loose around the hotel. Lack of supervision of that many kids in the pool is so dangerous also. Trying to take younger kids in the pool with teens running rampent around and diving into the pool was an accident waiting to happen. The floors were soaking in the lobby constantly and there were no extra staff to clean up the mess and stay on top of it so the member of staff in the lobby shut the elevator down. Not great when you have a disabled husband with very bad legs. Our room was also filthy, and the carpets looked like they hadn't been washed since the place opened. $234 for a room with 2 queen beds, and 1 tv with small bathroom was not worth it either. Thanks for the experience but it will be our last time there.

Text: Room was clean and nice. Fresh paint was going on the walls as it seems they were repainting the hallways near the stairs. The elevator was closed so we had to use the stairs. Luckily we were only staying for one night so luggage was light. Complimentary cookies in the lobby was empty every tune I walked passed it. Free breakfast was good and fresh.
