Text: This place is my version of camping. A basic cabin with a bed, running water and electricity. I love coming here every year to float down the river and the Saturday night roast! My kids love being here every year!

Text: My family and I have been going to Black River Lodge for many, many years now.  The first time I experienced this place was when my mother was pregnant with me.  I was born in 1995 and ever since July of 1996-2015 I have gone to BRL every year.  I missed year 2016 due to moving and having my own family, but this year, 2017, I plan on going again.  This is my favorite place to spend time with family and friends.  I love the atmosphere and everyone around it.  The river is fun and fresh and the pool, at times, is nice and warm and not too cold.  Very nice to take young children too who are sensitive to cold water.  I have recommend this place to many people and hope that they try it out.  I give this 5 stars!!!

Text: Black River Lodge is located on the most picturesque part of the Black River. Emerald green pools are great for swimming with a crystal clear water you can see down and watch the fish. This is the best location on the Black River for family to relax and enjoy a sunny summer day.

Text: My family has been visiting Black River Lodge for many years. The food is great and they provide you with ample portions. The rooms are cabin style, not huge but spacious enough for a family. The location is a bit off the beaten path but that just adds to the charm.
