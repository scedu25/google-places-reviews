Text: A fantastic experience and an awesome hotel. One of the best in Wichita. Their restaurant has a great selection of food that is prepared from local produce. The indoor pool is great and we will come back to stay here again. Since my wife and I celebrated our anniversary here, they did surprise us  with some sweet treats that were delivered straight to our room as a complimentary.

Text: Everything was great. Service was fantastic. Meeting rooms were well furnished and staff was friendly. The bedrooms were very nice but beds and pillows were a little hard. I'd come back any time.

Text: My family and I stay here every June for my company summit. Staff is always super friendly. Security team is amazing! The indoor salt water pool is usually where I live between company obligations. The pizza from their kitchen is delicious, I highly recommend trying it out, totally worth every penny. Drinks are strong, the patio has a beautiful view of the river. One of my favorite places to stay and I look forward to it every year! :)

Text: Nice and clean, definitely upscale. Don't know that the price was worth 6 hours of sleep. Had a great view of the river and downtown Wichita. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

Text: Loved my stay here! It's a beautiful hotel. A great bar downstairs that is open late. The restaurant downstairs is delicious and offers a great breakfast menu or breakfast buffet (open for all meals too). The rooms are clean and spacious with extremely comfortable beds. I forgot some toiletries and the front desk sent up complimentary replacements to my room. Wonderful room service as well. Even spent a day ordering a meal and a bottle of wine from room service and it was easily one of the best experiences I had here. Would I stay here again? Absolutely and I plan to.
