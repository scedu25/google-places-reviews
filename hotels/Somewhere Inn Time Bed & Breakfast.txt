Text: As our 1st B&B... we were not sure what to expect when visiting Somewhere Inn Time. We were pleasantly surprised and so happy we did!!! Mary & Gary were so welcoming from the moment we arrived. We stayed in Arthur's Cottage and loved it...the room was comfortable and quiet. The pool was beautiful and the hot tub was great! We actually met another couple that lived close by back home!!  We took notice that the owners take pride in their home and it shows in the details. We will definitely recommend to our friends and look forward to returning for another stay soon.
