Text: They had a problem with the plumbing in the hotel so they upgraded us to one of their cabins. BEAUTIFUL! ! Will definitely come back when we have more time and can bring family!

Text: Came here for a conference. The set up was good - lots of seating, screen for presentations, microphone. However it was really noisy with hammering and vacuuming and less the ranch's fault, but really loud people walking back and forth in front of the doors. They also were always out of coffee and lunch was scarce and nothing special. I heard dinner was good, but didn't stay. These things might be dependent on what my organization provided for.

Text: The staff was very helpful and kind. The room was very comfortable and clean. I especially enjoyed the animals all over. I saw three dogs while I was there! And we got to pet their horses which was super neat!
