Holiday Inn Express & Suites Richmond
Rating: 4
Text: The room was really nice for an overnight stay, the bathroom was super clean and there was coffee in the room, it was exactly the reprive we needed after a ten hour drive. Breakfast in the morning was standard but very decent and filling for the morning ride. Would definitely recommend and stay here again when passing this way.

Text: Pulled into Richmond after a long day of driving, and was happy there was space at the Holiday Inn Express. The manager AJ was kind and generous allowing us to park our car under an awning out front too keep it dry in the rain. He also recommended a great local pizza place that delivered (Apollo's). If we are every in Richmond again we would surely stay again!

Text: Staff was very professional, attentive and went the extra mile, even during a super busy 4th of July weekend. I've stayed at more than 20 holiday inns across the country and they're the only ones that called to confirm, asked me how my room was when I went to the lobby to get my things, and seemed to remember each if the guests needs. The room was nice. Clean but dated carpet but their customer service more than made up for that.
