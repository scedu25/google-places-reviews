Text: Never again will i take my wife and kids  to a place where a man is dressed like a prostitue monetering the mens room 
 thats out offering my children and others candy. It isnt even halloween.
I most certainly agree with what the previous man said, i guarantee the landering money, but id rather had a peaceful time, but camping seasons over as is everything else. All i can say is thanks buffalo bill, i hope they reconsider a new grounds kepper. Will go to springmill next time.

Text: I wouldnt even give a one star. The service is so poor. The matinince man was lazy always outside smoking dope.and what looked like laundering money  I could never get a answer on the phone to make a resevation.. He came out in make up one day and was trying to flirt like some queer. The bathrooms was always disgusting, i caught someon spying thro a peep hole. My wife said the womans was probably just as worse. We wanted to play goulf and couldnt cause he hadnt maintained the goulf course. 
It literally looked like the place was ran down. As for the matinence man, i dont understand how he landed the job looking like buffalo bill.

Text: Not well maintained at all. Grass around playground and sites was not mowed (6-8 inches tall esp around playground). Seem to only be interested in low maintenance monthly renters.
