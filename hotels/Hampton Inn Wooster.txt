Hampton Inn Wooster
Rating: 3
Text: Hotel is situated nicely in Wooster for traveling with easy access to main roads. Rooms are very clean, and spacious. The hotel is newer or has been renavated. The staff is very nice. No firm pillows only fluffy ones. Advertise they provide complimentary items forgotten to pack like raver or shaving cream. But do not, instead they will sell you items at a high rate. Parking lot is designed for compact cars, not sure how many people travel using them, but Luckily for me. I had a work vehicle and didn't mind door dings. If you have a nice vehicle you might want to park in a different parking lot other than at the hotel.

Text: We've stayed here a couple times. The rooms are always super clean and the third floor rooms are brand new and recently redone.  The staff was super friendly as well. Loved the breakfast, nothing fancy, but enough to satisfy. Also liked the free snacks in the lobby and the pool area for the kids.  Not a huge pool, but nice enough to keep the kids entertained. Good location near shopping and tons of restaurants. Definitely our go-to place in Wooster!

Text: Kid friendly, rooms are so clean (big deal to me) check in was a breeze and staff are helpful and friendly. A great entertainment place down the road with water bumper cars, lazer tag, go Karts, batting cages......kids had a blast. Then coming back and swim in the great indoor pool here at this hotel.
