Best Western Plus Carousel Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: We ended up with an extra person on our trip. The desk clerk was fantastic and upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge. The hotel is immaculate, the beds comfortable and the pool / hot tub so relaxing after a long drive. The staff has all been very friendly and helpful.  Wish I were coming back on the same route as I would stay here again.
Highly recommend this hotel!!!

Text: Super Hotel! The counter attendant (Patty) was fantastic! Loved the fresh cooked omelette for breakfast. Clean hotel, great bed and great access to the highway. For those traveling in the area, this is your only stop. Great price that includes breakfast. 
This stop was not planned for us, arrangements were handled over the phone, by Patty as we were traveling southward the same day.

Text: We found this to be a quiet location, far enough off the highway to not hear road noise and trucks coming in to truck stop.  Beds were comfortable, room was clean, TV offers good channel selection and internet was decent.  Would definitely opt to stay here again if we going this way.

Text: New hotel in Burlington, CO that is impressively clean and comfortable; friendly staff. Free breakfast was terrific! There's a great restaurant down the street called The Dish Room that also is highly recommended for lunch and/or dinner. We stayed one night on our way to Denver. Helps to get acclimated to the high altitude, by staying one night in Burlington.

Text: I HIGHLY recommend Best Western! I've stayed in 3 (so far). Would have been a higher number but not all BW's are pet friendly..... :'( 

Other than that, each hotel has it's OWN look, but it is top notch in all they have to offer. One had an indoor pool with a spiral slide and my son had a BLAST! Another one had an indoor pool, with a spa and the VIEWS were spectacular! The bathrooms are always elegant, beds are huge and comfy. Dog area's are just enough, internet has been great. I can't say enough good things about Best Western!!! 

Fixing to get on the road again and googling for a Best Western, in the area we're headed!!!
