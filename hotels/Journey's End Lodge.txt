Text: This is truly an amazing place to stay. My husband and I were married here September 6th 2015. The owners keep this place just so very comfortable, would do anything for you at any time. They are really hands on. We had a beautiful wedding with about 100 guests. Several of our guests/family stayed at the lodge as well and they couldn't stop talking about it. We will be make this our anniversary spot for many years to come, Thanks Patty and Paul for all your hard work and for making us all feel like family!

Text: Several different family members and I stayed at Journeys End. We all had a great time. We enjoyed family time in the pool, the other guest, and petting the horses that live on the neighboring property. I was able to visit the Lodge just a few weeks after our departure and I cannot believe the improvements that were made in such a short time. We look forward to Patty's genuine hospitality. It is apparent that the new owners of the lodge are dedicated to the upkeep of this beautiful place.  We all look forward to seeing you soon.                                              Date of last visit July, 2015

Text: Was there last week with wife and  daughter as we were looking into Morehead State for daughter. Very nice!  Clean, updated, and larger then your normal hotel room. Scenery beautiful! Owners Patti and Paul ( think I got that right? ) very nice. If daughter ends up at Morehead State, we're staying there again for sure. If you like to hike, golf, fish, swim etc...it's all right there. Nice outdoor pool during warmer months. Game room upstairs. Had a bed and breakfast feel. No breakfast but microwave and fridge in room and coffee in lobby. Off the beaten path but that's what I loved about it. Great restaurant just the next town over. Cornbread Cafe I think?

Text: Our entire clan visits Journey's End Lodge twice a year on Memorial and Labor Day weekends. We fill up from 1/4 to 1/2 of the lodge at each visit and have been going for several years. While the lodge is not a 5 star hotel in the big city, it is a wonderful, relaxing retreat set in a knob surrounded by nature. This place is extremely tranquil. The staff is not full time at the lodge due to its seasonal flow and off season slow down. Considering the fact that the manager runs the lodge in its entirety and works a full time job outside the lodge, it is well kept. The hospitality is wonderful, the ambiance is comforting. The pool is generally kept clean. We will continue to visit Journey's End and encourage anyone seeking quiet relaxation to make a visit.

Text: I have no idea where the scathing reviews came from as my experience was excellent. It is a great getaway for my family. We had a camp fire outside with my family and the caretakers provided the wood, sticks for roasting marshmallows, and then shut off all the lights for us to have a glow in the dark Easter egg hunt last night! I am very pleased with this lodge and will make future trips after my upcoming tour to Afghanistan.
