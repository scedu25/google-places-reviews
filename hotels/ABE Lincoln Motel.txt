ABE Lincoln Motel
Rating: 4
Text: The Lincoln Motel is a nice establishment that is very accessible from the road. Even though I had not stayed overnight, I had a great experience of dinner with my family. Other than that, the place looks clean and pristine

Text: Good (owner) staff, straight up,  35 years exp. at location. Clean, great WiFi, TV,  plumbing, heating  and bed-  no 6 or 4 legged critters (unlike reviews of pretty much all the others in town. And all this  for the cheepest price in town.  A wee bit dated- just think retro......all in all,  good stuff
