Chaparral Motor Inn

Text: My boyfriend and our dog are traveling cross country and needed a room last minute when we couldn’t drive anymore. The owner is friendly and works so hard to keep this inn running smoothly and well. It’s extremely inexpensive, the rooms are very clean and the breakfast was great. Name brand cereals and a waffle maker with actually good coffee? Yes please. Will definitely stay again and recommend to anyone crossing through.

Text: Great motel for the price we paid. Spacious and clean rooms. Ours had two tables in the room - good for dining in or working. The AC was really quiet. Friendly staff and decent breakfast compared to other motels in the area. Close to the highway. Highly recommend this place.

Text: My husband and I stayed here back in July. We stopped here first but they didn't have any more smoking rooms, so we decided to check out a couple other places in town:( 10 minutes later we were back and booked the last room.  The owner was so friendly and super nice... he let us see the room before we paid. The rooms are very clean!! We had one that just got new carpet. The owner really cares about his place and his guests!! And it gets 5 stars from me!!! We also met a lot of nice people as we went outside to have a cigarette:) If ever in Burlington Co. again this is the place to stay?

Text: Look no further! Danny and staff are brilliant and the place is spotless (grounds are swept clean and litter free). Danny has installed cool carpet and some pretty sweet lamps. Even the remote control was fab. Yeah the breakfast was bland, but who cares! He showed us four rooms when we arrived PLUS the super clean laundry room! Just do it!!!! Thanks, Danny!

Text: This place is great! I only put four starts because I have two dogs with me and had to pay an additional $20 for them. My room ended up being around $90 for a motel, typically I pay around$50. Regardless of that though, I was happy to find the room was very clean. The beds are comfortable, have lots of pillows. There was some rust at the bottom of my tub around the drain, and I took a white towel to whipe at it. Nothing came back onto the towel which shows me they keep the place very clean!! There is a fridge, TV and desk in my room. Great place to bring pups as there is plenty of grass around - do bring your own baggies though. Overall great stay! Just wish it was more affordable for me.
