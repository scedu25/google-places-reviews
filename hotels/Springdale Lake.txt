Text: Moved out 3 months ago, still paying lot rent for a trailer we can't live in. The management changes, when we first moved in in May 2016 everything was great. But it started going downhill, the manager we had when we left was an absolute ass. Very rude. Our trailer was broken into, vehicles broken into, but they just said to file a police report. Junkies hanging around randomly at night, a man was peeping into windows and scared my toddler one night, lot rent raised 3 times in the year we were there. All that being said, the staff in the office was pretty helpful if you went inside and talked to them. My kids had toys stolen that they had outside like a $600 child size fourwheeler. We couldn't afford the kit rent plus the trailer rent. Not too shabby of a place if you live up towards the main road from what I understand, but the farther from that you live, the more weirdos you have to encounter.

Text: Do not move here. It is an absolute joke. They let druggies run rampant and harass the residents who always pay on time and never cause issues. Good luck ever getting maintenance to do ANYTHING. The new management is even worse than the old, they are extremely unprofessional!
