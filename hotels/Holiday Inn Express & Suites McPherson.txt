Text: This is a good place for business travel. Near the Interstate, easy to get to and from places in town, and easy to find. The rooms are nice, clean, and quiet. The staff is very professional. There was construction going on during my recent visit, and they made sure it didn't interfere with breakfast (though the pool was closed so they had a place to set up the buffet)!

Text: Being renovated, and my room was updated and clean. Beds are really comfy. Had the bathroom sink clog up from somewhere else in the hotel, that was the only downside.
