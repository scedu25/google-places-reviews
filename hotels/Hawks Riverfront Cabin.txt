Hawks Riverfront Cabin
Rating: 5
Text: Have been down to Hawks a few times now and every experience is first class. The cabins are clean, comfortable and well stocked with all the utensils etc you will need for your trip. 

Immediate access to the trails can't be beat. 5 mins after getting on your bike or ATV and you are on the trails. 

Also close by is a recreational center where you can get easy access to a pool and hot tub. Great location for a Hatfield off-road vacation.

Text: Every year for the last 5 years, Team Rally Connex and our guests have been staying at the Hawks Riverfront Cabins. We are always treated with respect and honesty with our stay.  The Cabins are always clean and fully stocked with toiletries, Cooking utensils and cleaning supplies. Owners  visit us or contact us everyday to make sure we have everything we need. Even from time to time owner Mike gets a chance to ride with us on the trails. The Hatfield & McCoy Trail passes are always laid out in our cabins on arrival time so we can hit the trails immediately. 50 yards away from the Rock House Trail entrance is very convenient. Simply a great choice for our company. :) Look forward to every year with Hawks Riverfront Cabins

Text: Great place to stay while riding the trails. Mike and his family have been absolutely fantastic to rent from. When we arrive, always on a Thursday,  Mike has permits setting on the table waiting on us and the cabins cleaned nicely. He always says he'll catch up to us later to pay him for everything.   Been staying there for 10 years and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. Very clean, affordable and extremely friendly to deal with.

Text: The cottages here are really great. Lots of supplies and cookware, BBQ's, Comfy Beds. Quiet and peaceful. Handy power washer. Having a camp fire right on the river is wonderful. Very affordable and the owners are the kindest folk around.
