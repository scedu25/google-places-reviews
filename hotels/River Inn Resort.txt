River Inn Resort
Rating: 5
Text: We really liked this resort.  The room, while small, was comfortable and well appointed.  We sat on the deck in Adirondack chairs Friday night and watched the Missouri River rush by.  The view of the opposite bank was very reminiscent of the Charles Fritz  paintings made at the locations mentioned in the Lewis and Clark journals. The included breakfast was excellent, and the host was very welcoming.   Ask for a room on the riverside.

Text: My Wife and I had our First Anniversary here. Although it was probably because we were the only ones in Nov to visit. They catered to our every need. Yet they left us peace and quiet. We stayed in the Honeymoon sweet. They made a table in front of the riverside doors for our dinner. Randall the owner was very courteous! Would recommend a visit for any age. Lots of history! Don't forget to take a picture on the Big Nebraska N, its from Memorial Stadium before it was reconstructed. Back in Tom Osborne days. They also have a riverboat with rides if you have a big enough party. Just one suggestion...Dont drink too many beers. I drank three and felt like I had drank a whole case! ?

Text: Stayed in April of 2017.  We had a great time and are coming back in a couple of months.  Riverside rooms are definitely the way to go, but there are plenty of areas to look out over the river on the second and third levels.  Our goal was to sit, read, and relax for a night and we accomplished that.  The room was nice, and breakfast was great.  During warm weather, a great combination is hitting the winery for a little while and then walking back and chilling for the evening.
