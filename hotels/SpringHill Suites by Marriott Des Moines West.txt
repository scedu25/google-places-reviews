Text: The rooms were very clean and comfortable. I loved the hot tub and pool room especially, which was quite spacious and accommodating. The staff was also very accommodating and friendly. I would recommend staying here

Text: We've stayed here twice in the last year and each visit had been pleasant. Small, bright,  clean suites with modern decor, guest laundry available, snacks in the evening, and smallish breakfast buffet (breads, scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, cereals, oatmeal, fresh fruit, juices, coffee). Besides these things, what sets Springhill Suites apart is the staff. They are attentive and helpful, as well as efficient. I've not had a single negative experience with them. With easy access to l-35, this hotel is a winner. We'll be back!

Text: I stayed here for two nights and I enjoyed my stay. The room itself wasn't bad, although I thought the layout of the room was strange. It was nothing too fancy but it did its job well.
