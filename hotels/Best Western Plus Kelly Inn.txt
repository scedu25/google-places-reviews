Text: We stayed at the Best Western Plus Kelly Inn and WILL NOT be going back  in less than 24 hour period I witnessed a guy stuck in the elevator for over an hour on a Thursday morning with nobody showing up to help for 45 minutes after the hotel staff was notified of an individual stuck in the elevator, another hotel guest that got a window smashed out with a laptop bag and digital camera stolen from vehicle in the parking lot and I ended up with $1000 worth of vandalism done to my vehicle in the parking lot with items stolen and the Hotel did NOTHING to assist me in the matter.  I called the Omaha Police department filed a report like I was asked by the hotel.  Then to have their insurance company call me 3 days later to assume NO Responsibility!  So not only did it cost me to stay at this hotel which was never compensated for I got $1000 worth of damage done to my vehicle in the process of staying at this hotel.  I would try to find a safer place to stay when picking your hotel.  I spoke with the general manager and was told they aren’t willing to do anything about the matter so they don’t admit fault. I’m not looking for anyone to admit anything just would appreciate if you would try to make it right as a guest at your hotel!  I then asked if they have considered trying to get some assistance from a security type company to assist with safety on the property and that would be an expense and don’t really want to do at this time.  So, for me and my future trips to Omaha what is protecting me and my family while staying at the Best Western Kelly Inn……Nothing…they aren’t responsible when parked in the parking lot and don’t plan on hiring anyone from a security standpoint to secure the property so guests can truly enjoy their stay!  So not only did I have to pay for my hotel stay I also got $1000 bill that must come out of my own pocket due to the Best Western Kelly Inn’s unwillingness to assist me for my troubles when I was a guest at the hotel.    Do yourself a favor and stay at a different hotel because they aren’t responsible for anything.  I’m extremely disappointed they were unwilling to compensate me for my troubles and damage to my personal property while staying here.
