Tomahawk Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This campground is the best! The layout is very spacious and calming. You can fish without your license, take a boat in the lakes, cruise around on golf carts or mini-bikes and they have pull-throughs that can fit ANY camper or RV. They have a laundry room, Rec-Hall, Bathrooms and Showers. The horseshoe pits are always available and it is very quiet. The Owner and new helper is VERY inviting and helpful. He will assist you to hook up your water, electric and draining as well as get you situated quickly and professionally. Pulling in, there is plenty of turn around space and a large layer out grounds. It's an active campground during the season and it is also open year round with water and electric hookups. If you like nature, this is a fantastic place to be. The lake is stocked with Large Mouth Bass, Crappies and also VERY large catfish! Pets are allowed on a leash. The sunrises are fantastic and the country feeling you get when your here is priceless. Prices are extremely competitive and easy on the wallet! GREAT place to be!

Text: Updating my review because the guy who was really sexist and rude retired and everyone else is super nice and helpful. I used to come here to swim all the time when I was a kid and I'd never had a problem before. I have a lot of fun memories of this place and I'm glad I'm able to make more as an adult. It's really quiet too.
