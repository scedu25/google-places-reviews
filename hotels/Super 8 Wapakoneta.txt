Text: Very rude owner. Watched you eat at breakfast. Wanted us to move downstairs because of our dog said he didn’t allow dogs on second floor but they are pet friendly. We had 5 rooms and we left

Text: Easy access from I75.  Check in was a bit incordial...I think the cleck said five words to me.   For the mony, the room was OK.  Old looking room but (relatively) clean.   Splatter of something on the wall - hope it was hot sauce and not blood.  Bed looked clean, slept comfortably.  Quiet interior second floor room.  If you're happy with a basic room and a good price, I'd stay here.
