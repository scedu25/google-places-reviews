Greenbo Lake State Resort Park
Rating: 5
Text: This campground is a hard place to get into. Like a good restaurant, everyone wants to go to it. Very popular place to camp. Located in the country but close enough to get gas, food or camping supplies. Just a couple miles up the road is the Greenbo Marina and Lodge. Food in the lodge is very delicious but a bit pricey. Staff is very friendly and accommodating.

Text: Nice, quiet place to relax. The buffet could be better. You can rent boats for the day for relaxing or fishing. 2 swimming pools. The lodge rooms are really nice. Customer service can be slow at times, but they are really friendly. Nice driving places to look at the scene.

Text: Location is fantastic and beautiful forests with hiking trails. The Jesse Stuart lodge restaurant has been wonderfully remodeled after smoke damage from a kitchen fire. The food was great.

Text: Restaurant food is super good. Lodge rooms bathroom need an upgrade.  Bath linens had stain on it and the hair dryer was not working.
