Text: Amazing sporting clays course. Great trap and skeet fields. Very nice facility overall. Can't wait to go back! Very remote location and the road going in is a little sketchy. Well worth the trip.

Text: Oak Creek is top notch.  Great target presentations.  Incredible setting in the Nebraska hills.  Friendly and accommodating owners.  All the shotgun games in one place. Trap, Skeet, 5 stand and sporting clays.  Looking forward to my next visit.
