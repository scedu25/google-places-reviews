Text: It was ok until our curtains broke in our room and they couldn't fix it until the next day. They offered us a room that smelt like meth had been smoked it in. We refuses that room. I have 2 very small children. They offered us a smoking room again, I have small children that don't need to breath that in plus I have asthma. They would not give us the room with a king bed. They didn't offer is anything for the fact my husband had to Jimmy Rig the curtains or a decent room. Don't stay there.

Text: I stay here pretty often since it is the best hotel in olney.   It's cheap and the people are friendly but the rooms are not very good.  The beds are decent but the pillows are very cheap.
