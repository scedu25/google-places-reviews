White Mule Winery and Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I visited several wineries traveling to Lake of the Ozarks Missouri.  Typically I'm more of a sweet wine fan but these semi dry wines and vignolles were very good! Delicious! They were friendly, knowledgeable and even offered some chocolate with their dessert wine!  Easy to get to, which wasn't always the case with other wineries.

Text: I very much enjoyed the White Mule Winery. The accommodations were very nice and clean, the pavilion had a nice setting and atmosphere, very nice for taking pictures. The food was fabulous, everyone complimented the chicken and the wine was very good also.
Very satisfied all the way around.
