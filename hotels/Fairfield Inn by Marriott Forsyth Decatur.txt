Fairfield Inn by Marriott Forsyth Decatur
Rating: 4
Text: As nice as expected given the price. My group all arrived late and only spent one night. The room was clean, but slightly cramped. Avoid the veggie sausage at breakfast, instead go for the waffles.

Text: We were in town for a family reunion, so we didn't spend much time at the Fairfield, but the time we were there was great. They have a nice pool and the breakfast, which included scrambled eggs and sausage, was a very nice treat before getting back on the road in the morning. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were comfortable and clean. I would recommend this hotel.

Text: I had previously booked and checked into the Quality in across the street and it was so nasty and full of bugs, went back and got my money back. Now we were without a hotel room. We checked this hotel out hoping that we could get a room and the lady at the front desk named Heather was very understanding and accommodating, she even gave us a discount for our inconvenience and for coming across the street to her hotel. She went above and beyond for her customer. I would definitely come back to this hotel again.  Thank you Heather you are the best.
