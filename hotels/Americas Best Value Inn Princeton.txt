Americas Best Value Inn Princeton
Rating: 3
Text: The place was clean, small, inexpensive, with minimal amenities. Internet was basically unusable; I ended up just using my phone's own internet connection. There was a small continental breakfast, but various food places were within easy distance.

Text: Would give zero  stars the night  manager  is with out a doubt  the most rudest person and she needs to be FIRED, better off sleeping in your vehicle. She told me $47 over the phone,  then when I got here it was $59.99+tax. I guess that it was lost in translation as she was not American.

Text: The people that run this hotel are inconsiderate and rude they fight publicly and in front of their guests. The owner plus his rude, lazy, and good for nothing son are rude to employees and customers alike. I would not recommend staying in any of their BEDBUG INFESTED hotels. Beware and be safe but most of all DO NOT give them your money.

Text: When Stratton Inn charged $280 for a crappy room during the 2017 eclipse, my husband and I decided to checkout, get a room here and the room price was very reasonable. The room was also very clean and the staff was nice. We will stay here again.
