Baymont Inn & Suites Fulton

Text: On our road trip from NC to CA, this was our nicest hotel. It was more than we aimed to spend each day, but well worth it. Very comfortable beds, had a swimming pool, and very dog friendly. The area to walk my dog in around the hotel wasn't amazing, but it was decent at least. This hotel was a little off the highway, but I slept so well and then enjoyed their breakfast, and was glad we went. Also, the staff was very welcoming and professional.

Text: Stayed here for 3 weeks waiting for our apartment to be finished and they are awesome! Had breakfast every morning, no problem with our pet, friendly staff, nice pool and fitness area. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: They put my mother in a dirty room, then in another occupied room, and finally into a clean room. This is typical for hotels every now and then, but the front desk staff did not take ownership of the issue and she was told it would be days until the manager would get back to her and that she would get a small discount at best. There was no attempt to make it right that night, at all. 

 Breakfast was fine. You should also know they no longer have a hot tub, but the indoor pool was clean and warm.

Text: My grandmother flies in from Michigan to visit occasionally, and likes to stay here. We'd get a 2 bed room and I'd stay with her so we could visit more. I always loved their beds and pillows. And the hot tub and pool of course. I could alternatingly soak and swim all night if the hours would let me.
