Text: The breakfast is great for being free. The women who keeps it stalked and clean is amazing and super friendly to my kids. The pool was perfect for my family, not too deep. The front desk clerk was insanely helpful when we wanted to order food. Got us a menu and grabbed us extra plates. He gave us extra towels and pillows happily. We got a king size deluxe room. With the king bed and pull put couch there is plenty of space. Our room is next door to the pool, so my kids are in love. Will definitely come back the next time we are in the area.

Text: Great staff. Go out of their way to be of service. We weren't thrilled with our first run but they quickly moved us to another room that was great. Pool was nice. Perfect 10 pm stop after a day of driving.

Text: The hotel room I stayed in was nice and clean. It was very well kept together and provided is with a microwave and fridge. I would recommend anyone stay here who is looking for both affordable and good.

Text: We wanted a hotel with a pool to help us relax after a day at adventureland. By some stroke of luck, we got the room directly next to the pool entrance. It was a decent 2-room suite, with a sliding door to offer some privacy between the rooms - perfect for changing clothes. The continental breakfast has a decent amount of choices, the room worked out pretty well, and pretty much everything made us happy with our choice for a relaxed day
