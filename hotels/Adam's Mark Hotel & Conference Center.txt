Text: Broken glass on the back parking lot never got cleaned up. Front desk Clerks were all nice.  Indoor pool cold. Hot tub gross then broken. Housekeeping gave us towels but commented that they were scarce so we were lucky.  Our room was nice,  clean,  smelled nice.  Comfy beds and arm chair.  Wish the full length mirror had better lighting.

Text: This is a great, inexpensive getaway if you have younger kids. The hotel and water park are old and a bit run down. Our room had dirty sheets on one of the bed, but the staff changed it within 10 minutes. The carpet was dirty, things were dusty, the bathroom was dark. There is a  arcade, but the games are lame and several were broken. The hot tub in the pool area was out of service. The staff was super friendly and helpful. 

You simply need to know, you get what you pay for. This is a cheap hotel, so it's a bit rough, but we had a good time with it and got a great deal.

Text: It was easy to find, right off the highway. We were there for a church event, and the room was large enough for everyone to fit comfortably. It stayed fairly cool even though it hit 90 outside. The staff provided ice water to drink and kept it stocked. It didn't taste like chlorine, either, which was nice, since we've had experiences at other hotels where it tasted like pool water. Thanks Adam's Mark, for taking such good care of LCG!

Text: A group of us were in for a girl's weekend.  The front desk kept us together on one floor. They were so helpful.  Rooms were very nice, not the newest but overall clean and comfy. Bar was busy with a game going at the stadium. We played a round of pool which was I haven't played in years. We had a blast! We took a short Uber ride downtown to Power and Light. What a great weekend. Thank you!

Text: Stayed there with our grandson for his birthday. The pros: The water park was great entertainment for all. The room was nice and beds were comfortable. Staff was very nice. Cons: The elevators were very slow. Room carpet was dirty but the worst was no hot water to take a shower. For $240 per night, I would expect more.
