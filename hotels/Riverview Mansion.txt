The food is absolutely amazing and The ambiance of The whole house is amazing it has great history behind it. I would highly recommend the murder mystery dinner that they put on.

Text: We had my daughters 13th birthday party here.  She wanted an Alice in Wonderland Murder Mystery Dinner and the Riverview Mansion made it happen.  The food was delicious and the game was so much fun.  We all want to have our own parties here now!

Text: I had my wedding ceremony at this beautiful b&b over the weekend and I don't think I could have picked a better place! The owner Lori and her husband went above and beyond to make sure I never had to lift a finger. The rooms and chapel themselves were beautiful and felt just like home (maybe better!) And the breakfast they cooked for us the next morning was mouthwatering.

Text: The proprietors have provided an outstanding, luxurious stay at one of the most beautiful homes I've ever seen. The furnishings are meant to be used no matter how old they are. The Jacuzzi in our Grand Suite was a blessing to my sore muscles (walking all day in Paducah) takes a toll!). The breakfasts were delicious, cooked to order no matter the special request. We stayed two nights, and I wish it could have been more. A superb experience!
