Text: Definitely would recommend this place to other families who’s there for Army graduation. Place was clean, comfortable beds, friendly & helpful staff, felt safe. Didn’t try the continental breakfast though. Was worth the price!

Text: Nice place. Very clean. Has been recently renovated. Kind of off the beaten track but close to town. 
Left room today to view solar eclispe. When we returned to our room I went into the refrigerator to feed my dog her steak we got her last night at the restruant we ate at. The steak was gone and the two bags of fudge and chocolates were mixed together into one. Also I do believe the went through our suitcase as well. Not to happy right now with this place.

Text: This is just a clean hotel to place your head down for the night. The bed was comfortable, small bathroom but clean, and the room didn't smell. The room was smaller than the size portrayed in the sites images. They offer a hot breakfast but the eggs were watery and the biscuits were hard ?. They do offer cereal and fruit.  We slept well and that was the main purpose.
