Travelers Inn Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Very cute little motel.  Simple...a bed a TV couch and bathroom.  Nothing upscale or fancy but it's so inexpensive.  Clean rooms as well. And the man at the desk is so sweet.  I recommend this place for a quick overnight when traveling through

Text: Great little place. Old but super clean. Mom and pop bought it 2years ago to live the American dream. There are a few late night smokers out but never felt unsafe.

Text: Overall my experience was ok. The thing I got a concerned about was that the beds were plastic wrap so when you sat on it it would crunch rather loudly. Plus the rooms were humid and it took forever for the air to cool it down.

Text: Nice owner operators that keep rooms clean. Cheap pricing and close to Dollar General and IGA
