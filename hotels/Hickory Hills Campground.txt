Text: We went to stay here a night and arrived at 1 PM with our rig.  We were told by Randy I think at the counter that check in wasn't until 3 pm so we could come back then??? Really with all the spaces empty and pulling a rig there was really nothing to do for 2 hours in the 90 deg heat and with our dog.  So we moved on. Very disappointing as we like this place.  Not very accommodating if you arrive earlier than 3 pm.

Text: Very nice sites. Family and animal friendly. They have their own little general store with anything you would need on your trip.  The staff in my experience has been exceptionally kind. As well they have a cafe for those who don't like taking the time to grill over an open fire. They also have a pool area with shower rooms.  As well they offer a primitive camping area and cabins.

Text: Great place to relax and enjoy nature with friendly campground patrons and staff. Plenty of trails to walk/hike/golfcart around and it's very secure. Fully stocked fishing lakes, canoe and kayak rentals, along with a camp store in case you forgot anything on your way.

Text: A great place for family camping just one block from Bass Lake. I'm very impressed with what a fantastic job the new owners have done . It's in the middle of a beautiful forest with chirping birds beautiful sunsets lots of shade and peaceful relaxation. It has a really nice playground for the kids , A game  room and pavilion for activities .  If you're looking for a forest hideout  this is the place.  Most of the campers here have been camping here for many years
