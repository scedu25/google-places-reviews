Travelodge Of Battle Creek
Rating: 4
Text: We had a great stay at the Travelodge. The hotel was much nicer than we expected. Their were a few minor cosmetic issues like the title were coming up in the bathroom. However for $60 per night, it was much better than expected. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was good. Most importantly, the room was clean.

Text: Great place for the money! The owner is very nice and helpful. Breakfast is decent, good coffee and orange juice as well. Only thing missing is a pool and hot tub but over all great place to stay with great staff.

Text: It is your basic hotel room.  Ask for special rates if you're staying more than one night.  Generally quiet and clean with mostly friendly staff.  Hot breakfast limited to toast/bagel or waffles.  Ok for kids but I wouldn't let young ones walk around with no supervision.  Great choice if you're new to town and need a week or two to find a rental.

Text: Don't come here for the breakfast. It is nothing to talk about but the room is clean and the WiFi is good. And they are located in a good location for restaurants.

Text: Good location, good price, reasonably clean, close to shopping and food. A good option for overnight stay on a road trip. Everything is very basic, do not expect all the amenities are working in top order. But all the essentials are there, get a shower, watch some TV , microwave some food and hit a decent bed.
