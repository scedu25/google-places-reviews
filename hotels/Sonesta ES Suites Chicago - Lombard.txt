Sonesta ES Suites Chicago - Lombard
Rating: 5
Text: The front desk had some really great and knowledge staff and the rooms are larger than expected for the price. Beautiful rooms and area for the hotel as well. Very clean very responsive room service and the complimentary breakfast is pretty good. A great place to stay for just a night or an extended trip. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Now the sonesta es suites, nice rooms and amenities. Terrible "fitness" room. Decent breakfast and happy hour evening gathering thing, but not incredibly substantial. All in all it won't amaze you, or disappoint.

Text: Love the rooms and service. This is a great hotel for an extended stay unless you want to be asleep at 3 or 4am. Booked for a 2 week stay and 3 of the nights the first week people were yelling and gathering outside my door for hours (apartment type setup) lasting past 3am. If this continues, I wont be back.

Text: This was my first wedding  anniversary, It Wasn't Good. There small insects flying around in the room, my husband had to ask for sheets to be change on our third day there. They ask if you want smoking or non smoking room. This is a non smoking hotel!! It was a young loud group of people by our  door at 4 am.Don't waste your money or time.

Text: Top Notch service from all staff. The real question is there isn't anything they don't do for guests. Clean rooms , great food at breakfast and complimentary food thruout the week. Great extended stay place. Thanks Residence Inn. Been here five weeks.
