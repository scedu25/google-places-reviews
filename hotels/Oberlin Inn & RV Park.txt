Oberlin Inn & RV Park

Text: Good Value and Friendly Folks!  We stayed in Room 1, which is the King Suite and closest to the office.  We were very pleasantly surprised at how large it actually was, with a nice sized bedroom, very comfortable separate sitting room with sofa, table, chairs, TV, as well as central area with sink and mini fridge, and also a quite spacious bathroom (possibly handicapped accessible).  The whole suite was very clean and modern.  We were anticipating being a late arrival, and the staff was very accommodating of that both at time of reservation and upon arrival (which was shortly before the office closed for the night).  Had a pleasant conversation with the owner and another guest in the morning over breakfast.  The website advertises breakfast as being just a “toast bar”, but it was more than we were expecting and similar to that of the chain hotels, except without the hot food options chain hotels normally have.  The Oberlin Inn staff were all friendly to interact with and we felt our stay was a good value.  There are also at least 2-3 gas stations/convenience stores on the street corners opposite the hotel, which were very handy.

Text: I travel a lot for work all over the US. I spend probably around 150 nights a year in motels. This motel is amazing. I wish they were all like this. The place itself is older but the rooms are completely remodled and are very clean and nice. You can park right by your door which means no carrying your luggage and things a long way to your room. 

The gentleman that runs the place is amazing as well. He was very courteous and helpful and courteous during the check in process and gave us good advice on where to go eat and things in town. The second night we were there it snowed. We leave for work about 30 minutes before sunrise and the gentleman that runs the place had cleared the snow off the sidewalks and the windows of our trucks in the dark before we had to go to work. 

If I am ever anywhere near Oberlin working in the future I will be sure to stay here.
