Holiday Inn Terre Haute
Rating: 5
Text: I had a block of 15 rooms for my son's wedding guests (my family) and the staff was very helpful checking everyone into their rooms.  They were very accommodating for our entire weekend stay.  We used the conference room for our rehearsal dinner and continued to be able to use it the rest of the weekend.  The pool area is very spacious and a great place for kids.  The entire hotel seems brand new to me...nothing outdated.  We were very happy with our stay and I am grateful to the GM, Zach, for all of his assistance and hospitality.

Text: The room was small but very clean. We liked the Keurig in the room with different K cups available. The breakfast buffet was good. If you're traveling with really young ones, it's only a shower, not a tub. That was also in a room with a single King so I'm sure if it would be different in other rooms. We would stay here again and will probably look for more Holiday Inns in the the future.

Text: The rooms were nice, well kept. Staff was helpful; was able to provide a HDMI cable for our laptop to connect to the projector in the meeting room.
