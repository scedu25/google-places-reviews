Hampton Inn Columbus/Dublin
Rating: 4
Text: The front desk staff were exceptionally nice and gave me free water, a delicious cookie, and some yummy coffee. The holiday inn express I stayed at made me pay for water and did not have as many options for coffee and creamer! The room was nice and neat. There were two bottles of water in there for me as well. There was an odd mark on my sheet, but the staff was professional and took care of it immediately. I liked using the gym and I wish I had time to use the pool. I would stay here again.

Text: Great location in Dublin. Easy access to everything. King suite was roomy and comfy. Bathroom seems dated. Everything is clean. Hallways are ice cold. Front desk staff are very personable.
