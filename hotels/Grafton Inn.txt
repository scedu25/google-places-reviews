Grafton Inn
Rating: 4
Text:  The Grafton Inn is located right in the middle of Grafton Illinois. It's well within walking distance of lots of craft stores and restaurants.
  They only have two rooms so it's  not resl busy.
  the suit is amazing, there's lots of space and it feels very welcoming. There is a spa tub big enough for two people. The bed is comfortable.

Text: It is a nice romantic getaway. Perfect for a couple of days away from everything. The only down is no WiFi.
