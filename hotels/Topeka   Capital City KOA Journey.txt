Topeka / Capital City KOA Journey
Rating: 4
Text: This was a nice stop over. We had a very nice site with a fire pit, cobbled patio, table and chair set, and even a swing for our daughter. Of course we paid for it. It was not something that just came with the site. The bathrooms are nice enough but it looks like a cleaning crew has not been in them since the spring time and it's late summer. 
The pool was amazing! We really enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the play area for the children. This is a very good stop over for children.

Text: I never leave reviews but this place was fantastic. Stayed in the tent area right by the fishing ponds and the kids had a blast. Good grass area for tents and well maintained. Definitely would stay here again!!

Text: Just stayed for one night. But the place is beautiful it has three different pond for fishing, fire pit with swings, a dog area and many more amenities. I would recommend this to anyone for long stays or even overnight stays.

Text: Good KOA.  Meets standards.  Only stayed one night.  Not the easiest to get to but staff gave good directions.  Camp well maintained.  Our site was not very level but ok. Nice lake & pool area

Text: Nice sites. Trails to walk. Dog park. Next to highway so you hear the traffic but it's not too bad
