Motel 6 Berea Ky
Rating: 5
Text: We loved the contemporary and clean furnishings in the Motel 6 room in Berea, KY, Exit 77. Check in was easy and fast and the woman who helped us was very courteous. Check out was also fast and easy. There is a local restaurant just a block away where we had a snack in the evening and a delicious breakfast in the morning. We would stay here again.

Text: Room was rather minimalist, though clean (like the no-carpet floor).  Bed spread was stained - turn off.  The ADA room was not wheel chair accessable (shower) as told it would be.  For the price (lowest) it was still a good deal.  When checking in, they refused to honor the price sent in a confirmation (and even had the reservation wrong) - but upon check-out it was corrected to my satisfaction - but I had to try a second time to get it honored.  We canceled 2 out of 3 nights because of the ADA issue - wife in wheelchair.

Text: Even though the Berea Craft Festival is close enough to home to have commuted, as vendors for the 3 day event, we opted to stay in Berea at an affordable hotel. We were pleased with Motel 6. Accommodations were simple, but very clean. Check-in and Check-out were made with ease. The motel was quiet and we felt quite safe. We were very happy with our stay.

Text: The room was clean, it had a new mattress, and the rate was extremely affordable. They were doing repairs on the exterior of the motel, so it's only going to get better. There was an issue with the toilet flow valve refilling randomly during the night (a common issue even in homes) but I reported it and it should be fixed by now.

Text: The handicap room was equipped with a shower seat, but there was no handheld shower nozzle to shower with. This was the only problem I encountered during my stay. The staff was great in their attentiveness and politeness.
