Text: Very clean, we'll maintained cabins. Pool is clean and well kept. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. They went out of their way to provide an early check in and even offered to upgrade us to a larger cabin at no additional cost due to a late cancellation. A few minutes to boat ramp and marina. They also provide boat trailer parking.
Great place to stay.
