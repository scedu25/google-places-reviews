Text: This campground is well maintained and clean. Great playground for kids and lots of other activities for teens and adults. Also has a nice pool and putt putt golf .
The owners are very friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back and take my grandchildren. They would love this place.

Text: Nice stop. It had a nice pool we cooled off in. It was quiet when we were there. However. They were parking people every other site. If they had parked people in every site, you wouldn't have been able to breathe. So, if you go at a busy time, like a holiday, beware. It was full hook-ups which is nice, but we wouldn't have wanted to stay very long. It was just a stop over for one night. They take AAA and give military discount in case you have either. It was $40 a night without.

Text: The grounds are well kept and owners/staff were friendly and helpful. Close to town but still quiet and peaceful. Would come back in a heartbeat.

Text: Very helpful owners. 

I called when I was about two hours  away too see how late check in was, I was cutting it close and they offered to stay until I arrived. 

The camp ground is clean and wooded, if you are a very light sleeper and in a tent you can hear the highway but it wasn't close enough to bother me. 

Facilities are older but clean, I was just there for the night to sleep but they have a playground, small store, and a common area/game room by the main office. 

I noticed a sign for laundry but didn't check it out as I was just crashing for the night.

I would stay here again.
