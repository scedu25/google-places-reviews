Candlewood Suites Indianapolis Dwtn Medical Dist

Text: Suites are very nice! On bedroom with a king bed, a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, all you can come in a one bedroom apartment. It is very nice. You can feel home. The room service is being done weekly. But you have free Internet and tv cable. It is a nice place to stay

Text: 2-bedroom suite was spacious and pretty clean.  No breakfast for the price, though.  Plus, the pool isn't technically theirs - it's the hotel's next door. Just beware of the non-refundable rate.  Management was not only unwilling to offer me a refund (said there was NO WAY to reverse a credit card charge.. right) despite my family (which consists of 3 kids under 7) having to change plans due to unforeseen circumstances, but then wrote a complete LIE to my credit card company when I tried to cancel the payment, stating that I was rude and hung on on a staff member.  Most other hotels would bend over backwards (they only let me change the date - once - at their location only) to keep a good reputation and understand things happen when dealing with small children.

Text: The room I stayed in was incredible and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely choose this location next time I am in town.

Text: Right off the river. But very close to the rail road if that bothers you. Close to the zoo. The rooms were great, pull out bed was not the greatest I've ever slept on, but very clean. Full kitchen up to date flat screens on in living room one in bed room. Great costumer service. No breakfast provided.

Text: Very nice, easy stay at Candlewood. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Prime location, close to downtown with ample parking. Room was very nice, clean, and had many accommodations. Very good deal for the price, would recommend.
