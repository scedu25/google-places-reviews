Text: It smelled really bad in the room and I just didn't feel comfortable there. The man in the office was super sweet and kind, but I would definitely not come back. I guess you get what you pay for. And there is nowhere to plug in your electronics or phone so be sure to bring an extension cord.

Text: Dirty and expensive. Staff is incompetent, unfriendly and rude. Would never recommend this place to even people I don't like. Beware of bedbugs!
