Text: Love it! We are back again because we had such a great time last year! We have stayed in two different cabins and both of them are beautifully finished, well equipped, clean, and very private! We brought our fur  baby both times. if you are looking for a relaxing get away this is where you want to be! The extra touches show that the owners care for their property , they have made an effort to offer even better amenities than our last visit and we loved it last year! Highly recommend you visit with At Boulders Edge!

Text: This was our first time “At Boulders Edge” and my husband and I were so impressed.  We stayed in Glacier’s Edge Lodge with two other couples.  It was so spacious with three bedrooms, two full baths, beautiful kitchen, and living room with big screen TV and so much more.  We were also able to see all the other cabins on the grounds since our other friends were guests.  They were beautiful, very clean and decorated in rustic cabin decor.  Can’t say enough good about “At Boulders Edge”. They have so much to offer.  Can’t wait to go back!!!  Ranee and Frank were excellent with making us feel very comfortable with our stay!!!

Text: This was our third time at the Dot Calm cabin & was awesome as usual! Love the area, quiet, ability to do nothing & of course the jello! Thanks again Rene & Frank for another anniversary trip gone well & the recommendation of the winery down the road. We will be back many times!
