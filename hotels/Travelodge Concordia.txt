Text: Was a bit worried when we stopped but needed a cheap sleep on an unexpected late night drive and was not disappointed. Comfortable beds and clean room! The OJ at breakfast was so much better than national chain we had been staying at, wished I'd thought to fill my travel mug with it. Very nice staff. Thank you!
