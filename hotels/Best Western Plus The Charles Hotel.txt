Best Western Plus The Charles Hotel

Text: Not bad if you can live with a few things. Rooms were updated.  My room always felt humid and had no way of airing it out. This bothered me The most. The blow dryer was super weak. I love the shuttle. Breakfast was good. Seemed like only one elevator was working and it would take forever to wait for it. Service was good too.

Text: Very comfortable room.  We had 3 people traveling and this was perfect for us.  We had 2 Queen beds and a sofa bed that was also very comfortable.  A lot of room to move around as well.  We would definitely stay here again.  So many choices for restaurants close by and visiting St Charles Main Street was a great time.  Very close also.

Text: Great location and good price for the rooms. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Good hot breakfast with a variety of options with lots of seating. They have coffee and fruit available all day and a snack bar to purchase from with many different choices. The hotel needs updating. They probably painted recently but it needs more updating than that. The couch is very uncomfortable. The bed is so firm it feels like sleeping on a yoga mat on the floor. There was blood on one of our towels. I wouldn't recommend this hotel when there is better options within a block of this hotel.

Text: Clean, comfortable, economical but hotel is aging as is the Denny's restaurant attached.  Staff was all helpful and friendly.  Lobby fruit, ice water, coffee is all very good.  Breakfast buffet was well supplied and quality products.
