Fulton County Camping & Rec
Rating: 4
Text: I have been camping off and on at this beautiful campground for over 15 years, the last 2 years as a seasonal camper.  The new management team is awesome, they really care about the park and the people.  Shower house is kept clean and the grounds.  This is a wildlife haven, and the manager helps protect the environment.  
We will definitely continue camping and visiting!!

Text: Laid back fishing and camping, nice bath houses when they aren't closed due to vandalization. 

I hardly ever catch fish, but I see other people catch a bunch so I know they are out there.

Gate fee is $5.

Text: They need more restrooms for the public to use. The shower house is usually very dirty.  There were campers playing loud music and yelling way past 1 AM. I like the large campsites and the ease of getting to the sites.
