Text: It is not as new as other Holiday Inn Express hotels. One thing to note is the toilets are VERY LOW, so if you have physical limitations bring your own risers or stay somewhere else.

Text: Very clean and expensive. The breakfast was ok but they have a pancake maker, not a waffle maker! The room was well appointed, with everything you would expect from Holiday Inn.

Text: Best hotel in Plymouth by far. The staff is professional and friendly.  Dawn at the front desk is awesome. She takes care of any issues that arise and is always nice and friendly. Beds are comfortable and rooms are a good size.
