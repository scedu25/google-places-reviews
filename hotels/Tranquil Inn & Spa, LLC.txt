Text: Everything about this visit was perfect. From the beautiful home to the lovely and endearing hosts. The rooms are newly restored to beautiful and tasteful perfection. You must indulge in a massage as well! They are divine. You feel like you are getting personal attention in every aspect of your stay at this b&b. You are a stones throw away from French Lick, West Baden, Blue Spring Caverns, Jug Rock and so many other fun places. Best of all it is affordable. Loved it and we will be back! Can't wait to get some friends together for a girl day too!!!

Text: We stayed at the Tranquil Inn & Spa during a long-distance walk across America, and enjoyed it so much that we changed our plans and stayed an extra night.  It does what good B&Bs aspire to do - to make you feel as welcome and as comfortable as you do in your own home.  The rooms are immaculately decorated and the bathrooms are designed with long, luxuriating soaks in the bath in mind; the rest of the house is a beautifully restored Victorian classic, and the icing on the cake was a magnificent massage in Deanna's spa.  Put simply, it was an oasis for us for three happy days and nights, and our time there was among the happiest on our trip.
