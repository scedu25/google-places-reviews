Text: I had booked a room here because my original plans fell through and everything around was booked. I pulled in and my whole crew said " I'm not staying here" refused to get out of the car. I (we) never made it inside. They pool was filled with rocks! No cars, i mean literally no cars in parking lot. Not to mention your view is a cemetery! I was lucky enough to get the one last room across the street! I would never stay here even if my life depended on it. I called and cancelled the room. The pictures on the website make this place look amazing compared to the truth.

Text: I give this place half a star only because of price.  Price is good but I woke up this morning with bites litteraly all over me I'm so mad.  Now I have to go swimming and look like I have chicken pocks.  There was no one else here (prob BC they new). Rooms were dirty everywhere. Smelled soooo bad.  Mix of cat pee and smoke.  I can't wait to check out.  So gross. I need to go to another hotel and take a shower.

Text: It's honestly not too bad. Paid 59 dollars for a room which is a good price. The pool is filled with rocks and not a great view but the rooms are just like your average hotel room. Wouldn't recommend it though.

Text: Affordable price but the employee ( man) at the front desk is horrible and rude he works at night. My MRDD client and my mom ask for a pillow and he got real rude and nasty with them.He told them he u been in your room all day u should have a pillow and he didn't give no pillow to my mom or my client. Also he is the manager that makes it worser. There are only 1housekeeper and they have no linen mold all in bathroom and in shower. Also dirty shower curtain.And the manager that is rude sleeps all night so there is no breakfast on time in the morning he locks both doors so u can't even come up to the front lobby because he be sleep the whole night horrible service horribleplease don't come here.

Text: Horrible. The prices are great, affordable but that's about where it ends. First off the outdoor pool that's advertised, yea that's filled in with rock. Before we could even walk in to register the front desk host, who was outside (no problems, everyone needs fresh air sometimes) asked to borrow one of our chargers for half an hour because she forgot hers at home and she didn't even know who we were. So we get checked in and what not, and go to get settled into our room. First thing we notice is there's a door leading into a hall with no lock on said door, not on the handle nor a dead bolt, nothing, just a door that could be opened from either side at will. We kind of brush it continue our way in and in our direct line of view is the ac/heater, all along the sides are cobwebs galore, along with the cobwebs was mold. None of the furniture looked like it had been dusted in minimally a month (literally nothing but the beds. Tv, stands, chairs, lamps, you name it it wasn't dusted). Lifted up the blankets and both of the sheet sets were horribly stained, not one or two small, but multiple big stains. As we turned on the lamps while venturing further into the room one of them came apart (the bulb and light socket came apart from the rest of the lamp resulting in me touching the wires). The tub and toilet were dirty, the light had mold and was coming out of the ceiling (no lightcover just the square with the light sticking out hanging further than it safely should have been), and water all over under the sink and around the toilet. The ceiling had water stains, again not one or two small but multiple big-huge sized stains, and a few holes in the ceiling as well. One of the tiles had a tissue tucked specifically around one of the larger holes. At that point we took our bag and went to ask for a  new room or a refund... needless to say we are currently waiting for our money to be back in our accounts.
