Text: Somewhat quiet except for Semi-trucks all through the night roaring on highway. Which caused a loud thunderous sound in our room at end of building. Clean except for some questionable spots on dingy bed linen and duvet. Way to far off the beaten path of major expressway. Bonus though was finding a whole little Metropolis just a ways East down the road from hotel. Thanks for the good breakfast at the "Broadway Cafe" on "WASHINGTON AVE" not Washington Street? Also Great Wardrobe find for myself at the local GOODWILL Store!! I'm a Background Actress in Chicago . I found 2 Ballroom Gowns for dirt cheap. Ecstatic as all to vacation and add to my wardrobe collection for parts. Visit was a success and the George Clinton Parliament Funkadrelics Concert at the "Lafayette Theatre" was a rip roaring stamky freakin time. Funk and Drinks were Awesome. The "Black SPARROW" restaurant in downtown tantalized our Midwest palate. Their variety of micro brew libations & cocktails warranted no introduction but an ibuprofen at night's end. Thank you Madison County The Jackson's WILL BE BACK!!

Text: The mattress badly needs to be replaced. The TV was set to one channel. Hair in the tube.  The staff was very nice though a bit overwhelmed at being 100% booked.
