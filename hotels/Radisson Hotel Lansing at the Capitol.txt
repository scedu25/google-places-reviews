Radisson Hotel Lansing at the Capitol
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed at this hotel for business purposes. This was my 3rd time staying here. The front desk staff were very professional and courteous. The valet staff were amazing as well as the housekeeping staff and the bar staff. The cleanliness of this hotel alone is why I give them 5 stars. Each and every time I have to go to Lansing, this is  where I will be staying.

Text: The Radisson is conveniently located in downtown Lansing. It is within walking distance of the convention center and the majority of State government meeting spaces. Within the last two years the lobby has had all it's furniture replaced and a Starbucks added. 

Note about Starbucks.
While bearing the name and brewing the coffee, this is not a corporate owned Starbucks. The drinks are alright, but not on par with a typical location. The milk and baked good selection is inferior. The Starbucks app and gift cards do not work in this location.

Text: It's good. It's pretty good. You guys should stay here. I guess what I'm saying is you guys should stay here. There's a bar in the hotel. I don't know what else you need to know. Valet like a boss and drink beer.

Text: The Radisson Hotel in Lansing, Michigan (on the South end of Lansing) is an extremely nice and elegant place. When I was there it was because it holding an event. The conference room was big and spacious. The rooms are very nice from prior experience. The service is amazing. And the location is great.

Text: The service from check-in to check out, was exceptional. I used valet and had to check my bags at the end of my stay due to an extended day of meetings. About 12 of us asked for our cars and luggage at the same time, everyone jumped in to assist and had us all loaded up and ready to go in a matter of 10 minutes.
