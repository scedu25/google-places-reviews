Lewellen Lodge and Living
Rating: 5
Text: Our family stayed here one night before the '17 eclipse and we had quite a few rooms.  It was a great place and I'd recommend it for anyone needing to stay in the area.  Yes, you can tell it used to be an "old folks home" but the rooms were modern, spacious, and clean.  It worked out well to have a large common room with tables so the family could visit and assemble picnic lunches for the next day.  

The owner was super friendly and very accommodating.  We needed to get up the next morning and hit the road by 5:30 a.m. and she got up at 5 to make sure we had a big pot of coffee.  We also enjoyed having Rou, the lodge cat, hanging around with us.
