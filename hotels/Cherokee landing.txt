Text: My husband, 8 year old daugher and I floated the 4 mile in a canoe today and had a wonderful time. Even with the current drought condition we only drug a few times. There were still plenty of deep areas to swim. The owners are great people and very organized, it was a nice easy put in and take out!

Text: Slow, muddy river that was pretty shallow at the time of our float. Price was decent, equipment was in good order. Staff were a little eccentric, but no major problems.

Text: The Big River here is slow and low.  There was very little to challenge which was perfect for us.  The water isn't as clear as some of the rivers and creeks farther south but it was still very relaxing and fun.
