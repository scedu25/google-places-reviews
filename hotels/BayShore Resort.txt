Text: Check in and out was a breeze, rooms were lovely and had a great view of the lake from our private balcony. The restaurant out back was great as well! I've eaten at a lot of hotel restaurants, and this one was pleasantly surprising in quality of food. All in all, a great place for respite on PIB

Text: Well is it not the goal of a good hotel to provide you with a good night's sleep?? The bed and pillows were the hardest, worst I have ever experienced. We checked in and  paid for 2 nights. After 1st night of not sleeping I asked for my money back for the 2nd night and was told no refunds. Forcing me to stay the second night. ??! I understand the cancellation policy for the first night but not for the second night. I slept on a roll away the second night.!! I wanted to cry I was so tired. So although the staff was pleasant and the restaurant good , the hotel clean I would NEVER go back.  The management needs to replace beds and pillows. I don't mine paying but I expect to be able to sleep- they failed to provide the basic item for a good hotel. SLEEP

Text: Much nicer experience and stay than the conference center. Beautiful views of Lake Erie and very pleasant staff. (Bring your bicycle to avoid cart charges) Loved the stay!

Text: The location, screened in patios, views, tiki bar and restaurant are wonderful.  The bathrooms had black mold in the grout of both the shower and on the bathroom floors.  The bedding is very low quality, and most definitely needs replacement.  I hope the owner reads this, as the place really needs a DEEP CLEANING, and new comforters as the current are not acceptable for a resort of this level.

Text: A Beautiful place to relax and enjoy the sun and snset. 2 pools and a hot tub over looking the water. Friendly people and a tiki bar for when you need a cool drink. Would love to go back again.
