Text: Had a lovely evening here with my family.  Very nice accommodations in a peaceful town.  We couldn't find the hosts to checkout in the morning but not a big deal.

Text: Excellent choice to stay!  Comfort and coziness of a B&B, privacy and autonomy of a hotel.  The upper suite is fantastic and great for a longer stay!  I would highly recommend it to anyone!
