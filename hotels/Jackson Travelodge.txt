Text: Drove up from South Carolina to visit family. We stayed 4 nights. It was very clean, staff was friendly. Ashley checked us in and checked us out and was extremely nice. Great customer service. Great stay for the price. Will definitely re-visit when we are in town.

Text: Decent rates for an event weekend!!!  Room was mostly clean with the exception of dirty cups still left in room mixed in with clean ones.  Bed were neat and fresh.  Pool was pretty nice and clean.  Only major issue is that the security lock on my door was completely broken and door was mildly bent, should be replaced.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Overall experience was very good.  Would return again.

Text: I'm in room 155. Room is great. The WiFi single is great. The restaurant is great. Huge servings. They accommodated me for early check inn. The only complaint I would have. Is bed was not comfy at all. Price was great. Another complaint would be. Lots of weird people stay here. But but a 2 star hotel it's worth it.

Text: Rooms were relatively clean and staff at the front desk were very nice. Beds were not comfortable at all and shower looked like it had seen better days. Location is nice right off the highway but there are other hotels that would be better.

Text: In my opinion this is the best hotel for the price in Jackson. I would recommend getting a balcony room if you are a smoker and they have one available. The staff is good and friendly. Front desk is open 24/7 and sells odds and ends as well as snacks and drinks. The pool is also nice, only thing is in my opinion they aren't very pet friendly and if you do complain the owner always thinks it's because you want a refund or discount. I have stayed here many times and rarely had to complain about anything. So that's why I would give this hotel 4/5 stars.
