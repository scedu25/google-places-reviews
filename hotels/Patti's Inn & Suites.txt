Text: Nice clean place with a good shower, which is important when traveling. The rooms with the single queen beds are very small though. Friendly staff and the breakfast this morning was also good.

Text: This is a nice place. Associated with Patties 1800 settlement. Price was great when we booked it and got a deal that we got a $50 gift card to Patties restaurant/gift shop. Breakfast is served here.

Text: A little run down.  Very 80's.  But Clean!!  And staff is SUPER friendly!  Came for the Eclipse... so there weren't many options.  In the end they were fairly priced for a clean room.
