AmericInn Lodge & Suites Monroe

Text: Very well managed hotel.  Everyone we dealt with was super friendly. This is our second visit but won't be our last as my family and I love it here.  The room was clean and comfortable,  everything worked, and the shower was amazing.  We especially liked the included breakfast that had a waffle iron that made perfectly cooked waffles.  My dad loved the fresh coffee and hot eggs and sausage.   We had a little problem with the pool table but someone came right out and fixed it!  My dad says this place is a great value ( typical dad thing to say).  Thanks to all the friendly people that work there!!

Text: This hotel is super clean, comfortable and the staff is friendly and efficient. The breakfast was an omelet, bacon, potatoes, pastries, bagels, toast and other items. The lobby has a large fireplace and comfortable furniture. Much better than your typical AmericInn.

Text: And its price range it's a very nice accommodation. The rooms were comfortable clean and well-kept the staff was friendly. The breakfast they put out in the morning is one of the best I've seen included with lodging in motels. I would highly recommend this place for a reasonably priced place to stay and a great breakfast in the morning.

Text: Dated hotel. Each person in our grour p for work had to sign the receipt. Never had that before in all hotels I've stayed at over the years, and that's a lot. The checkin process was long to begin with, all I wanted to do is relax and shower.

Text: We stayed in the room with the whirlpool. It had a pullout bed along with the standard king size bed. It was very spacious. The staff was really nice at checkin and checkout. The price was very fair considering the size of the room. The breakfast was eggs, biscuits and gravy, cereal, waffles and more.
