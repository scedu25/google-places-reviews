Text: The team here is very nice. Got checked in quickly. Also was using the meeting room. Randy was very helpful in getting this together and helping us through a couple issues with contract. Would definitely use this place again in the future. Enjoyed the suite we stayed in. The pool and hot tub are very relaxing as well.

Text: I have stayed at this hotel about 40 nights over the past 18 months. If there is a hotel with a nicer staff, i haven't found it.  Great people!

Text: Rooms were good. Staff not so much. I reserved a king bed but because I was a IHG member they upgraded me to a 2 queen suite without asking me. I told her I wanted a king. She changed me to a king then have me my room number. I found out I was not with the rest of my group asked if I could get a room by the group and she said they were all sold out. She was rude not only to me but to several people in our group. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: Stayed one night and had a good overall experience. I think it is pet friendly. It was a quick stay but the price for a clean room, good service, quiet stay, and friendly staff was good value. I'd recommend it to friends.

Text: Room was clean. Breakfast was underwhelming because staff couldn't keep up and there was barely any hot food. I requested late check-out but was still disturbed by housekeeping far before my checkout was supposed to be.
