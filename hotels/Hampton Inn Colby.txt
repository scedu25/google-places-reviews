Hampton Inn Colby
Rating: 5
Text: Nice, new, clean hotel. Great rooms and staff. Perfect hotel. It couldn't be better, and I'm picky. Also, they use fragrance-free laundry detergent, and the room was oderless. Breakfast was good. I judge a hotel breakfast by whether they have real half&half for the coffee or just powder and creamer, and they had half&half. Good coffee, too.

Text: Comfy beds, good breakfast, all day treats and coffee. Hot tub was open but not operational. Quite a few roaches in pool area, but they seemed to be quite prevalent in Colby, KS in general. Didn't really deter me much from enjoying my pool experience.

Text: This place is amazing . They have a hot tub that is well taken care of and a gym with real dumb bells. Very clean and quaint.

Text: Is a nice hotel for the most part. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean but the room itself was rather cramped. Price was extremely fair.

Text: Very clean and well kept. The hotel seems to have been recently built so it is very modern. The hotel staff was very nice, and the breakfast was pretty good. Definitely worth the stay.
