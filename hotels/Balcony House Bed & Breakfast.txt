Text: Wonderful!  I grew up in Imperial when this was just a rooming house.  I was amazed at what a wonderful job Linda and Jim have done not only in restoring this old house but also in the decorating.  The hospitality was so warm and friendly.  You would have thought they grew up in the small town.  It felt like you were at home and so quiet and relaxing.  Only place to stay.

Text: Wonderful place to stay for work or play. Very relaxing , feel right at home atmosphere.  Loved the breakfast and rooms were very nicely done. Wrap around porch to relax, no tv's in rooms, but there was a tv room if you needed it. Food was very well thought about, not just a plain breakfast.

Text: On our wedding night my husband wouldn't tell me where we were going.  All he said was "Jim's house."   I didn't know who Jim was but I was positive I didn't want to stay at his house on our wedding night.  Boy was I wrong (and relieved)!  I didn't know Jim owned the Balcony House. What a romantic, wonderful place.  They were such great hosts and the breakfast was SO delicious.  4 years later we went back again and were every bit as satisfied.  Highly recommend.
