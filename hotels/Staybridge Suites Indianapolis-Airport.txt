Staybridge Suites Indianapolis-Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Everything is always clean and comfortable.  It looks like they have upgraded the carpet since I was last here and it looks even more inviting.  The breakfast is better than some I've had at newer and more expensive hotels.  I would rather enjoy the atmosphere at the Staybridge than some hotels in the vicinity unless there were no vacancies which has been known to happen.  My family and I look forward to our stay here every year.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: Very nice establishment. I believe all room have kitchenettes. Laundry room free to use. Located near I70 and the Indianapolis airport . You can hear planes flying over during night,  but it's not often or terribly loud. Free breakfast every morning,  and dinners Monday through Wednesday. Room are clean with nice tv's. HBO included!
