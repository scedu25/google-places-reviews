Text: A swing and a miss.
I think this is typically a decent place; however I ran into a snag. Shortly after check in, I happened to take a knee to re-tie my shoe, and felt the carpet was wet against my knee. Started looking closer, and it had been wet long enough to wick up into the wood of the TV cabinet.
They gave me another room, no problem. But how long does it take for water to travel through carpet up into the edges of furniture?
