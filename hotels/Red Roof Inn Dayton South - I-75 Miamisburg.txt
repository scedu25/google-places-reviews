Text: The front desk staff were fantastic and accommodated my room change request without any hassle. The beds are fantastically comfortable and the rooms clean for the most part. The only changes I would like to see are better pillows, and more Linens available. I will definitely stay here again.

Text: I've stayed at several of this chain dating back to 6 plus years ago, this is by far one of the best locations I've laid my head.  Rooms are usually on par, although 2nd floor building A is typically the cleanest.  All the staff are very personable, helpful, and nice.  The hotel is 100% smoke free and pet friendly.  Beds are newer and very comfortable.  Shower pressure could use a boost,  and some of the air conditioners are older but all in all for the money it's well worth it.

Text: Worst hotel ever! 

Room smelled awful, sheets dirty blood stains and marks, stains on comforter, bed bugs, stains on walls in bathroom, toliet had dried blood on it, room smelled of smoke and etc. Very rude customer service when checking in hotels.  Worst hotel ever please don't waste your money.

Text: Room was nicely decorated and very clean Staff was friendly However, at the time I booked my room it was not made clear that unless you booked a KING size room you DID NOT have a microwave nor frig. I feel this is deceptive. I am diabetic and need juice incase my sugar drops so we had to keep going and getting ice for our cooler to keep the juice cool. No breakfast and no pool . You are also charge daily for a small safe in your room rather you use it or not. Just heads up because we did not need it and was charged anyway. We had paid two nights but with the noise we gave up and checked out and drove home.
