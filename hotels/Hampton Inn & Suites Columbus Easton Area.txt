Hampton Inn & Suites Columbus Easton Area

Text: Seriously amazing! Our room was clean, spacious and practical. Every person we encountered was SO polite. They have coffee out all day and they even had complimentary fruit infused water and cookies.  Breakfast was awesome. We enjoyed the American girl package with special goodies for our doll and access to watch AG movies. I think we may have just become Hampton Inn people. :)

Text: Predictable breakfasts get tiring for long-term travelers, but it's clean and reliable. Very nice exercise facility, good location, and generally affordable prices. Staff can be a mixed bag, but overall positive experience.

Text: The hotel is very functional. The check-in and check-out processes are efficient. The rooms are mid sized and have what you need. All have been clean. The breakfast is basic yet works. Stay away from the room that backs up to the elevators as it is noisy at night.
