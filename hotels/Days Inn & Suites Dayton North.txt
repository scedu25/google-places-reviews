Days Inn & Suites Dayton North
Rating: 1
Text: Nasty Nasty Nasty.  Don't touch anything.  Room was non-smoking but smelled like smoke.  Pubic hair all over the bathroom.  AC didn't work.  Sheets were torn and full of holes.  At least there's a strong police presence.

Text: I don’t know where to start. From the get go I was lied  to from gentlemen at front desk , that the room was recently updated, if I wasn’t so tired I would have left. Room was dirty, stained , had to wear a rubber glove to use tv remote , wood mouldings were screwed on with drywall screws cut with a axe . Furniture was disgusting ac/ heater air quality was intensely noisy and smelled like cigarettes. The in bathroom looked like a 1st year apprentice installed it . Half a roll of toilet paper with non existent toilet paper holder. Sorry, couldn’t  tell you about continental breakfast, as I couldn’t chance food poisoning. For a Days Inn,  it has seen its last day and my last dollar.

Text: I was going to give this a 2, for general shabbiness and because i had to flick the vanity light on/off several times to get it to work and also because the tv remote didn't work right. But I can't do that after this morning. I went barefoot in the room in the evening and morning, which caused me to leave a black (completely) footprint when I stepped into the shower. There was a large spider spinning its web down from the ceiling over the bed this morning. The sign on the door asked to shut off the lights and the AC when leaving but I didn't want to touch the AC controls.

Text: This was the dirtiest Days Inn I have ever stayed in.  We had reserved a handicapped accessible room for my elderly grandmother and when we got there, it was not available. Because of the lateness, and distance we had traveled, we accepted another room.  The room was filthy, refrigerator barely cool, light bulbs out, heat lamp only light source in bathroom, which made it too hot to be in the bathroom with the door closed.  Oversized furniture made it hard to maneuver in the room.  We have stayed at many many nice Days Inns in the past, but this location was extremely disappointing.  One star given for the polite woman behind the reservation desk.

Text: The room seemed clean. The beds were definitely full not queen sized. The door looked like it had been kicked in before. There were cops at the next hotel at least twice in the 2 days we stayed. The location is good because there were many food places on the same road and it was right off the main interstate.
