Text: Great golfing on three 9 hole courses. Rooms in hotel were clean and comfortable. Only problem was being rushed before even getting off the tee box on hole #1!

Text: Visited Perry Park for the first time July 23-25. Had a great time! Beautiful course, friendly staff and the very nice accommodations. I can't speak to the hotel experience (they have hotel rooms on site), because our group rented the on-site house they have. These houses were great.  My only feedback is not having wifi in the houses, they did have it at the clubhouse. Cell phone reception was almost non-existent for AT&T phones, so having wifi would have been nice. But in the end, it was a good thing because it forced me to totally disconnect.

Text: Just came back from a weekend trip there. Wasn't impressed!   Food was ok.  My issues was the 30 rangers always saying things to our group.  I have been playing golf for over 20yrs.  Never have I felt harassed by rangers like I felt last weekend.  The were very unfriendly and some what rude.  My suggestion is to take 1/2 those wanna be mall cops and put them in the hotels.  Where they play golf in hallways till 3am Friday and Saturday night.  I will not ever go back to this place.  Course was in decent shape. Very boring lay out. Travel back and forth to Holes across the street.  Nothing special about this place other then the wildlife.
