Hampton Inn Ann Arbor South

Text: The service in general was great. The rooms were clean and up kept well. We were given complimentary water bottles upon arrival and departure. The hot tub is currently out of service due to remodeling and there was construction noise in the pool as of 11-09-2017. If the pool is important you may want to find another hotel until remodeling is done. The only other issue we encountered was I requested a late check-out of 2pm which they said was no problem over the phone but apparently they forgot to notate it and it caused some stress. Not the end of the world but kept it from being 5 star.

Text: This hotel is in a great location for football games, as it's only a ten minute Uber ride from the Big House. The room was clean and well kept, but most impressive was the staff. We arrived at close to midnight on our first night, but the staff was still happy to bring extra towels and pillows to our room. The free breakfast is decent, with the usual options of eggs, breakfast meats, various pastries, and fruit. The coffee is some of the better coffee I've had from a hotel.
