Cobblestone Inn & Suites Ord, NE

Text: We went for the eclipse, and also because we have family history in the area. This is a newer hotel just at the edge of Ord. The rooms were nice, well apportioned, and clean. Didn't stay there much - there is no restaurant, although they serve breakfast and have a small bar. There is no elevator, although it's only two floors. But, if you got bum legs, ask for main floor. Also, the bathroom fan is loud and is tied to the light, so you are in a wind tunnel no matter what you're in there. Kim at the desk was very nice, especially, but that was the order of the day, very friendly, ready to help. Look, it's not the Ritz, but I would be happy to recommend it. Good place to stay, good price.

Text: Very helpful and friendly.The accommodations were clean and quiet. The breakfast was nice and they had a quaint little bar area. There was an area to relax outside of the dining area which was nice.

Text: We stayed here for Scratchtoberfest. The hotel was clean. The staff was friendly and on call 24hrs (I woke up at 3 a.m. and needed another blanket, which they happily provided to me). It is definitely a 5 star hotel, which I did not expect in a small town.

Text: The rooms are pretty clean and the staff is friendly. There's a nice lounge area with a bar. The fitness center has dumbbells but they only go up to 50 lbs.
