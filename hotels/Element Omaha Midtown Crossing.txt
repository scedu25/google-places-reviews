Text: From the minute the shuttle picked us up at the airport to the late checkout when leaving, these guys have the service part of this job nailed. A big shout out to Greg and Samantha for making our stay absolutely fantastic. Comfy beds, kitchenettes, showers are awesome. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Text: Worst experience! Never going back to this hotel. We went over for the holiday and decided to stay at this hotel because they said it was $101 for two nights which sounded to good to be true and not one but several employees told us it would be this amount for two nights. The next day they charged $259 plus $50 for a deposit which I'm fine with the deposit but we went over to the lobby and asked why and they came up with this lie saying that the $158 over was for taxes which I have been to better hotels and none of them have charged over $100 for taxes & now in the receipt it says it was 101 for each night plus taxes. If your going to lie and steal money at least stick with a lie .This company just steals money from you , people save yourselfs the hassle and money and don't ever go to this hotel.

Text: Very comfy beds. The rooms are nicely laid out to offer some privacy & separation in the rooms. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. This was my first stay at an element, and I would be happy to try the again based on this experience.

Text: Awesome stay! Love the location and the vibe of midtown-crossing. Close to the downtown old market and the zoo. Breakfast was one of the best... and the rooms are modern and clean. Front desk was very helpful. The one downside is the hotel does not have a swimming pool.
