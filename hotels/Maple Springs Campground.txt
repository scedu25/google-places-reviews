Maple Springs Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We camped in the group camp site 5. The area had loads of space. There were two fire pits, 5 picnic tables, and plenty of dead wood. The water pump is a bit a away from the camp about 100 feet. Restroom is about 10 feet away from front of camp. That is a good/bad thing. The camp is over the cave so no water on ground. All waste water needs to go into the Bolo restroom. If the lid is left up you get a pronounced smell in the camp. I f you can enforce lid closure it  does not smell.  One of the tables is in disrepair. You are about 6 miles from Visitor Center for tours. take about 15 minutes to get to the visitor center.
