Text: We stayed during the week of Oct 19 thru 23 2017. The front desk and housekeepers went over and above to make our stay wonderful. Rooms and very clean and inviting and had no trouble sleeping. It was a quiet hotel no slamming doors etc. I will only stay at Red Roof  Hotels from now on. My stay was perfect .

Text: Very pleased with this Red Roof. The rooms are very clean, and the entire hotel has been updated. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water for all of us to shower. The staff has been very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this location.

Text: Room was very large and comfortable. Everything was very clean except some sort/dust built up in one corner of the bathroom. Loved the indoor access to all the rooms. Staff was very friendly.

Text: The hotel was very accommodating as we needed the room on a whim. The hotel could have been cleaner and the bed and pillows could have been more comfortable. Not bad but definitely not somewhere I would stay if I didn't have to. Affordable price put us here.
