Text: Not the Ritz but decent rooms with reasonable prices.   They are remodeling at this time but still nice place to stay.

Text: This is a nice but older hotel. It is no longer a Days Inn. The staff were friendly and the room was adequate. If you want the typical chain style hotel then you will be disappointed. This is more of a local country style. The room has been very used but clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in at a hotel. It came with a microwave and a refrigerator. Parking was conveniently located right outside the room. For $44/night it was a good deal. The breakfast was not something we ate as they are many good restaurants nearby.

Text: They were the only place with a room left. I'm used to 2 star motels but there was a sticky spot on the floor and the bed felt like it could fall apart of you set down to hard.

Text: The rooms are not that clean. It's dark the beds were noisy. The door didn't want to latch half the time and they didn't really even lock. I will never stay there again.
