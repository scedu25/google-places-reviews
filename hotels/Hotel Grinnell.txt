Text: I stayed in the Warhol Room, 313. A large window dominates the far wall, while Andy Warhol and soup cans keep the sleek furniture company. Each room has different art and is unique. My room was SO quiet! I particularly loved the very high end bedding and towels! The Periodic Table bar/lounge was fun, funky and most unexpected in a farm town, even one with Grinnell College. This is a place to see, be seen and enjoy a sophisticated stay. (PRO TIP:There is a wine bar AND a brewery tasting room within a one minute walk!)

Text: Great first experience at our newest, coolest spot in town! It's all about the food, check, the ambiance, check, and the staff, check! I specifically recommend the BBQ wings appetizer, the Japanese noodles and...OMG...the strawberry cobbler Ala mode!
