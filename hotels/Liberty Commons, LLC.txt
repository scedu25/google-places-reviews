Text: A waste of anybody time that's trying to do right when wrong follow you in that park !! For a 3bm and 1 bath 1/2 I pay $834.78 a MONTH !! if I have company for the weekend my rent spikes up $900$ because of the water usage.. Every month you get charged for water,$40 so they say because they have they own water tanks for the park,which I've never seen..Then you pays every month for sewers which is like $32..I honestly know that these peoples are crooks that's beating peoples out of  they money!Every morning when I leaves for work a neighbor done moved but I can understand why now !! Every Month your Rent goes up and down but 85% of the time it's always higher..So if you are looking for some nice Mobile Homes I suggest you not to stop at Liberty Commons because they are crooks that's waiting to Rob you out of your earnings..??
