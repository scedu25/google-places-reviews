Red Barn & Motel

Text: I was at the adjacent convenience store rather than the morel itself. Spacious with clean bathrooms, friendly staff, and a nice variety for a small town. Gas prices were 20% higher than down the road a few miles but this was a convenient stop near Elwood and Johnson Lakes.

Text: Convenience store was well decorated and stocked including carry out liquor and fresh bait for near by fishing. Conveniently located near Elwood reservoir. Clean restrooms. Gas prices weren't competitive and no prepared food was available at the time. Otherwise 5 stars.
