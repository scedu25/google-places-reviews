Text: Last resort option**
We had a vehicle emergency traveling through and had the unfortunate experience of staying at this miserable establishment .. First thing we noticed when walking through the door was a roach ? we put all of our belongings in the fridge to avoid bringing extra "travelers" with us. We had to strip and search the bed for roaches before sleeping fully clothed with all the lights on and had the bed pulled away from the wall. I am so appalled that someone can knowingly operate a business this way.. ?

Text: Dirty,  bed bugs,  and a prostitute next door wanted to tell my 8 year old that she us a "worker" and then went to preach about Jesus and the prostitute.  Carpet from the 50 with stains still from the 50.. Then refused to come to the door when I wanted my money back.  It wasn't worth it.  I let them have it but told them I was reporting it the next day.  Don't stop here.  Oak grove is down the road and much better.

Text: Easy to get in, our room was spotless and there was no odors. They accommodated our slightly late checkout. And let us go back in to check for a lost money holder.
