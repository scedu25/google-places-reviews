Rating: 5
Text: Had the opportunity to spend three nights at Days Inn. The rooms were clean,beds were comfortable.  There's a pool, hot tub and workout room on site. The desk help and staff (Francis, Taylor, Shelby and Sarah) are a great bunch of young ladies that make you stay very pleasant. They offer was great breakfast bar also.....pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage and do it yourself waffles. Also offer dry cereal, coffee and fresh fruit....Great place to stay....will do it again

Text: Room was clean and the staff was nice. The pull out bed didn't work but we made due. They did offer to move us to another room. Would stay there again.

Text: Been on the road for several days and was hoping for a room. Wasn't to surprised that when asked they were booked due to a school party, but when asked just for a shower attendant informed me it would be a hundred dollars. That's one expensive shower.
