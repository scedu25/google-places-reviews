Text: Not too bad...
This was a good place to stop for the night, just passing through KS. The bed is hard... but to my husband & I it was comfy. No roaches or bugs as in other reviews...it was clean, quite & better than expected...
4 stars only because of the smoky smell... not overwhelming...but it is there.

Text: It was clean and nice. The people working there were friendly. The only complaint I have is that the cable was frozen and we couldn't unfreeze it.

Text: Rooms weren't very clean. Looks like they vacuum once a month. Parking isn't very truck friendly and that's what %90 of the guest are driving. Only decent thing was that the price wasn't too high but I've had cheaper rooms that were much cleaner.
