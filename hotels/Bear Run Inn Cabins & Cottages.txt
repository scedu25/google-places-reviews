Text:  The cabin and setting are beautiful, we stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the hot tub each evening. The trails were nice and peaceful and the kids liked that the owners allow visits to the farm to see goats, horses, alpaca and barn cats.

Text: My husband and I first visited the Inn.in 1993, right after they opened. The owners became fast friends and we visited regularly the several first years we were married. "Life happened" and we hadn't been back for many years. We stayed this weekend in the Sugar Maple cabin for our 25th anniversary. Though Bud and Marcia closed the bed & breakfast portion at the end of 2016, the family still offers cabins for rent. What a beautiful place and nicely equipped for an extended stay. Highly recommend!

Text: The Goldilocks Cottage was perfect for 6 adults & 3 kids under 5yo! And it had everything! It was definitely home away from home for us. The location is perfect as well, it's close to everything. The owners are so nice and they made sure that we enjoyed our stay. If we come back next year, definitely we will stay there again.
