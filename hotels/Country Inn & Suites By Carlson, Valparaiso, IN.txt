Text: My family and I stayed in a studio king suite. The hotel also provided a crib for us. My only complaint about the room was that it faced the front parking lot, which had lots of lights on at night, and the curtains could not be closed all the way. Otherwise, free breakfast, wifi, swimming, cookies were all enjoyed. Great location and price. Friendly staff.

Text: Convenient location but hotel needs some updating. Door to room had to be slammed to close securely and I couldn't even get the deadbolt to work. The days of quality breakfast included with your stay just doesn't seem to exist; powdered eggs and limited pastry selection. Bed was comfortable and staff seemed accommodating, which is why I gave it so many stars.

Text: Wonderful experience.  There was a minor hiccup, however, the manager, Vinnie, went beyond what I expected of him.  If he lived in my state, I would try to convince him to work for my company. He represents customer service at its best. If I am back in the area, I would return because of him.  Thanks Vinny!
