Text: I've been going to the Missouri State Fair grounds for more than 5 different events, and it is awesome!  We just did the Tough Mudder there a few days ago.  Very well put together!

Text: Always fun to see all the crafts, artwork and critters.  Especially liked the "beefalos" cross between a beef cow and bison.  4-H is always impressive and the pie contest delicious!   Such an enjoyable day!   Delectable pie samples after the contest.

Text: Nice camp sites. They were spaced a fair amount apart. It’s on grass so we had a rough time leveling out but finally got it close enough.  Full hook up which was nice. They only except check or cash which we were prepared. Very Affordable. They do not take reservation as it is a First Come, First Service basis.
