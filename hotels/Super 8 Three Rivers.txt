Text: We have always stayed at this motel and feel just like family here. We have been treated wonderfully from the time we check in to the time we leave. Staff is always very kind and willing to help us any way they can. We would never stay anywhere else while we're visiting family in this area or if we just come down for some R&R and shopping! Rooms are very nice and in size as well. Everything is clean . We have not one complaint!

Text: Short notice travel caused me to arrive @ the hotel without a reservation.  Because they offered veterans discount i thought i would honor them.  When i arrived the price they charged me was different than the price on their web site.  I addressed the issue and clerk stated there was nothing she could do.  I asked for the veterans dicount and she stated all she could do is take off 5 dollars.  Very disappointed with this hotel.
Room was good for a 2 star hotel. But drain in tub was clogged.

Text: We enjoyed every second of our stay! The staff was very sweet. I was mildly disappointed when I had to pay $10 more than the price previously quoted and that the lady I reserved the room with and gave my credit card information to apparently lost it. They had no record of me even reserving the room. Thank goodness they still had one available for us though. My kids are already begging to go back! This was our only chance for a family vacation and I'm pleased it went so well! I wish we could afford to do this more often!

Text: Good place for a quit stay in the middle of miles of commercial land. Bathroom small but comes with fridge and microwave.
Decent place for a low star hotel.
