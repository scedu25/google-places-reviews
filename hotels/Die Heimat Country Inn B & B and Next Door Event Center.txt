Text: We loved our stay at Die Heimat.  Donna was a fantastic host and Janice provided some great history of the area during our breakfast.  The bed & breakfast was quiet and clean.  Breakfast in the morning was always good and gave us the opportunity to visit with other guests staying.  We will be back for sure!

Text: What a quiet place to rest. Slept like a baby which is not my experience when skeeping in a new place. Marc & June were very hospitable. Breakfast was very good... And to think this place was built in the 1860s. Will carry good memories of my stay.  A very good choice indeed.

Text: I just finished DJ'ing a wedding here. Outdoor ceremony and dinner, inside reception party. Had a great time. Got to speak with the owners. Super nice folks.
And as a ten plus year professional DJ with over 500 hundred weddings under my belt I am happy to say I really enjoyed this location and would gladly recommend it.
