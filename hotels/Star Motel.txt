Text: Fantastic place to stay! Myself and a friend stayed 4 nights here while hunting outside of Macomb. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and appeared to have been recently remodeled. We stayed on the ground level in room 110. The room came with a mini-fridge and microwave. It also had Directv. There was plenty of room for 2 people and all of our gear. The owner made sure we had fresh towels everyday and was over-the-top nice every time we saw him. The motel is in a great location with plenty of eating options nearby. I have no complaints and would stay here again in a heartbeat. 100%

Text: Stayed several weeks at the Star Motel while traveling for work. This motel is the best value I've found in a long time...especially after paying out the nose for a week at one of the other supposedly "nicer" hotels across town. While amenities are a little old, the rooms are CLEAN & QUIET. No black mold or bed bugs here! Manager is the most polite and helpful hotel manager I've ever met. TV is nice and DirectTV service. For the $, this motel is a great place to stay.
