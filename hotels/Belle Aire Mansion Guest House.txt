Belle Aire Mansion Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: Jan & Lorraine are wonderful hosts.  We stayed in the canopy suite and we didn't want to leave to come home!  We will be back for sure!  I highly recommend staying at the Belle Aire if you are coming to Galena.  Never stayed in a B&B before?  Don't worry!  Jan and Lorraine will make you feel like you are at home.  Amazing breakfast.  Can't wait til we can visit again!

Text: Jan and Lorraine are a charming couple, and very hospitable inn keepers. They enjoy getting to know their guests and do a great job of taking care of each one! We were very comfortable staying there and looked forward to the homemade chocolate chip cookies in our room each evening. Very relaxing!

Text: This is the 2nd time I've been the Belle Aire Mansion Guest House. Jan and Loraine are the nicest people you could ever meet. They are always conscious about allergies and people's habit, and they do their best to accommodate for them.
