Pony Express & RV Park
Rating: 3
Text: This doesn't seem like much of an RV park, if you want to use a bathroom you have to walk to the Pony Express Rest Area along Rt 76.  The rest area is super nice but the campground is rather odd.  Everything is CASH and hand written in a tiny slip of paper.  They were doing a little price gouging for eclipse, charged us $30 to pitch a tent in the grass next to a spooky house for one night.  All amenities are across the road at the rest area.  Beautiful sunsets from there.  Campsites are loud, right next to Interstate.  Camp host recommended the rest area for free coffee in the morning.

Text: We were driving through and needed a break from the road. Called and found available spots. Not very big place but quiet. Full hook-ups in very good condition. The visitor center is across the street and great view of the sun set.

Text: This place was kinda a mixed bag. We got there too late to shop at the store, and didn't even see Kay (the manager) until morning. The grounds are very rundown with lots of broken stuff, including glass, in the outbuildings. However, she was very nice and helpful with getting our trip in order. Only $10 for a spot for a tent right off the interstate. Use the bathrooms across the street in the welcome center.
