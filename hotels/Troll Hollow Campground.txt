Text: Myself and my husband camped here this past weekend. It was a great place. It is more of a permanent summer trailer park, but they do have an area for campers. It is large enough for two or three small groups and provides electricity and water. It is a very woodsy location. The second night we had several friends come up and camp also. We had a great time. The bathrooms were very clean, the people were extremely friendly and accomodating. We would definitely go back!

Text: I tried for 3 days to get an answer on availability was told that person was not in they would call me back. Finally on the 3rd day I was told they were full. If they treat their campers anything like they do their potential campers I'm glad we didn't stay there.
