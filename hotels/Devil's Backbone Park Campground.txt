Devil's Backbone Park Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Campground was more than satisfactory. I made a reservation for the eclipse, and the owners were more than accomodating, one of them was available even at 1:30am to check us in. The price was more than fair at $20 a night for tent camping, but did not include water or electric. The lots are not assigned, and even at eclipse peak occupancy, there was still ample space for many tents. The lots are accessible by car. The sandy ground allows for fires to be had virtually anywhere, and the fact that it is away from the city makes it a prime spot for stargazing. Overall a great campground, and we even had a perfect view of the eclipse!

Text: Kayaking down the Mississippi and this place was a great find. Good beach to land and secure the boats, electric, HOT clean showers and super friendly camp manager. Convenience store about a mile away. Perhaps you can get a ride to the store like we were able to.
