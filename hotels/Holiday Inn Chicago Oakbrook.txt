Holiday Inn Chicago Oakbrook
Rating: 4
Text: The front desk was being remodeled so it was a bit confusing to get there, no biggie. The hotel room was tidy and clean. We stayed one night and we enjoyed the experience. My son and I used the pool for a bit, which had a few hairs in it, but overall the stay was nice. Breakfast was included and it was really good, they had a nice selection of options, my son ate for free. The staff was very friendly and helpful, one of the front desk girls went far and beyond her duties to make sure our stay was pleasant. Also, even though rooms are non smoking, part of the hall smelled a bit like it, but our room did not.

Text: It was a nice hotel, above average for a holiday inn. The pool was tiny, and parking a little inconvenient. The pub on the first level was fantastic. The beds were comfy and the water was hot. It's stay again.

Text: The staff provided excellent service, the room was good, no complaints. The 4 star is due to the remodeling on the restaurants and it looks kind of dusty.  The Bar Louie next door is decent, with decent music and amazing service.

Text: The customer service here is great from the front desk and continues throughout your stay. Excellent service, the general manager  greets guest at the door. I've had such great experiences until I make it my place to stay every time I come to Illinois.
