Lazy Cloud Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 2
Text: Service was great. However the our room didn't meet my expections, based on the photos that are on the website. I wouldn't have paid over $550 just for two nights, had I known what we were actually staying in. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't up to the expectation they gave me with the photos they have on the website. I don't plan on coming back and would not recommend. We also order the Picnic dinner, with ribs, which wasn't great either. There were also dead bees in our room when we arrived, and bees always flying by our door, in between the screen door and big door, and some even got into our room. The complimentary breakfast was decent.

Text: My wife and I spent our first anniversary in the hayloft suite and loved the decor! The buffet breakfast was large and filling, with many different choices. We would love to make a visit to the bed and breakfast an anniversary tradition.

Text: We've stayed at Lazy Cloud for our anniversary every year since 2006. Prior to that we've stayed at least a couple other times. It's a great place to get away and reconnect. The suites are all amazing. The grounds are well kept. The sticky buns are to die for. I highly recommend this for a great getaway.

Text: Cozy, quiet location. The website didn't share many pictures of our room: each was different. The jacuzzi was great. Stone fireplace, very romantic. Would likely pick another room next time.
