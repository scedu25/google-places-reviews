Residence Inn by Marriott Springfield
Rating: 4
Text: Has good amenities. Decent kitchenette in room. Clean. They have a board that lists upcoming activities.  The night I was there they had a complementary sweet bar in the evening. The only negative is that it was a little bit pricey for me. One night was close to $200.

Text: I really like this place. Good location, great rooms, complementary breakfast and evening snacks (sometimes enough for dinner), 
Would have given a 5 star if the plates, and silverwares were little more clean at the breakfast lounge.
