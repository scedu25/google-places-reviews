Onion Creek Farm
Rating: 5
Text: The attention to detail of being organic has been a tradition for decades at this farm.  Explanations are given for all decisions on how to grow great food without chemicals.  Explanations on how the farm was built are also excellent for all of the detailed efficiencies for low impact living.  Even the music and dancing is explained and most enjoyable.
