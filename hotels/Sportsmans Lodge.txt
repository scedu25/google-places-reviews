Sportsmans Lodge

Text: Cabin was top notch! Sat. TV and full kitchen. W/D. Screened in porch. Very clean and neat. Food from lodge was decent. Shooting range nearby so not the quietest setting and not a scenic area.

Text: Amazing food, wonderful service. Everything about this place is making me ready to make the trip again. Zero negatives at all. Very refreshing to be made to feel at home.

Text: Very unique place. The lodge building with the bar and restaurant is an old school house. Cabins surround the main building. Very well run and near a national wildlife refuge with some of the best duck & goose hunting in the country.
