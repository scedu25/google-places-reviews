Blue Lake Campground

Text: Decided to give this place a try over labor day weekend. My husband made the reservation over the phone telling her that we would have a 24' camper, a tent, and possibly 6 adults and 2 kids. No problem. We paid $128 I believe for the lot. When we got there the people next to us had some of their stuff where we were supposed to stay so we went to tell the lady and she said "set up anyway". When my husband brought it to her attention what we had planned to put there (because it was such a small area to camp) she said we should probably buy another site. We decided we werent going to deal with that and had planned to leave, no refund. We walked around and decided to see If we could just stay in the primal area as there were only 3 other camps set up. The man working said that was fine. That's the only reason we stayed. My mom came up one day and had to pay a 15 dollar visitor fee even though we paid for 6 adults and up to this point it was just is 2. Me and my mom took my younger siblings to the lake in hopes that it would be worth it. Walked in the water and right back out. Very dirty and seaweed everywhere (even right on the shore line). Awful. When my husband and I were leaving labor day the office wasn't open even though the sign said it would be. We had to wait an hour for her to open it. We only waited because we wanted the 20 dollars back for the magnetic cards to get in and out. I would never recommend this place unless you enjoy wasting your money and being put on a site that's barely wide enough for a camper.

Text: We went for an overnight stay and had a rustic cabin. No running water but we brought plenty of supplies and showered once we got back home. We had a blast.

Text: I don't know where to begin. We'd never stayed at this campground before, but I booked a 3-night stay over the phone. I'd taken a vacation day from work and was looking forward to a relaxing, peaceful time surrounded by nature. We paid $93 for some tranquility. What we got instead was a soggy piece of grass that reeked of raw sewage, surrounded by piles of junk. No wooded lot...instead, other campers tightly packed in like sardines. We asked for a different site, but were not accommodated. We stayed one night because we were too exhausted to go back home, but left our site by 7 the following morning (total time spent there was 11 hours). We requested a refund for the two unused days. The owner didn't even ask why we were leaving, he just said "no refunds". This place will haunt my nightmares. Trust me...don't do it.

Text: Washing machine broke and I was not refunded my $2.25. Bathrooms are dirty. There are leaches in the lake, my kids were unable to swim. Owner's fiancé is rude and lacks customer service skills. Owner is hands off and does not take care of his business.

Text: I reluctantly booked two sites based on the reviews I read, one for my wife and me and one for my son and his family. One was a pull through and one a back-in. The back-in was odd in that the hook-up's were on the wrong side, so I pulled in. This actually worked well as it put our motorhome facing our son's pull-behind front door. I found the office to be reasonable, the restrooms clean, and the park quiet. The secure entrance was appreciated. They were finishing building the playground and a gentleman was spreading crush and run on the roads to smooth them out. I was disappointing to see the condition of the the lake front with broken down lounge chairs and pee gravel instead of sand. It would be a good idea to set rules for those with permanent sites to keep them clean and maintained, but most were in good shape. We've staying in much better parks and probably will not return, but I don't think it warranted a one-star review as others have posted. Churubusco is a nice little town with services we needed. Enjoyed the food and beer at Laotto Brewery just 9 miles away.
