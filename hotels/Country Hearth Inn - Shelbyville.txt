Text: My husband and I were looking for a hotel to stay in after traveling for hours and picked up a coupon book like we always do and found this hotel for a great price. Although, when I called the owner said he had already taken the amount of the coupons that he was going to take because he only has 3 rooms left. He said he could offer me another coupon which was over $10 more so being tired we just decided to go ahead and do it even though I wasn't too happy about that. When we got there after speaking on the phone there was only 5 cars there so he had lied about only having 3 rooms left and not being able to take the coupon. I explained to him that the coupon does not say you can only take so many in and I thought it was ridiculous but that we were tired and we would stay. The rooms were clean although outdated. Nothing special... beds were pretty hard. Definitely wouldn't stay more than one night of were still in the area. When we woke up that morning I woke up to a maid on FaceTime really loud in the hallway with music blaring going through the Halls and when we were packing our car back up she was outside by the door doing the same thing being Extremely Loud on the phone. I thought to myself that's kind of a turn-off.

Text: There was NO DEPOSIT. It cost us around $80 (including tax) for the night. Very friendly gentleman at the front desk, EXTREMELY quiet, VERY CLEAN ROOMS, the beds were AMAZINGLY comfortable, the rooms smell clean, nice continental breakfast, and the pillows were nice and fluffy! We drove about 13 hours and after trying to find a hotel in Louisville around midnight for almost an hour (they were all booked up) we decided to continue heading East on 64 and came across this hotel. Never heard of this hotel before but we will DEFINITELY stay again!

Text: Really expensive--I was just passing through town and needed a place to stay, had been driving for 12 hours and spent the previous night in the truck at a rest stop. Hotel was clean and smelled nice, and the staff was really friendly, but I got woken up at 7am on Saturday morning by loud neighbors and two dogs in cars in the parking lot. Parking was tight. Bathtub did not plug, tub drained continuously on me. They also charge a $100 deposit in addition to making you pay for the room up front. Not a bad place at all, just definitely not worth the money.
