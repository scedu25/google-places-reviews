Rustic Barn Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This is. great place to camp.  The owners are wonderful, the grounds are nice, and the bath house is awesome.  Other than the sound of the highway...we use a sound machine at night most of the time anyway, this is an outstanding place.  Close to many things to see and do in the area.  Only planned to stay one night but ended up booking three!

Text: Camped for two nights. It's a little crowded but we had great Neighbours. Facility was clean, showers and bathrooms spotless. Had fun playing with outdoor games with the grandkids. Meditated in the beautiful Chapel Sunday morning. A great place to stay.

Text: Well maintained, comfortable camping for motorhomes, RVs, and Tents. The view to the West is gorgeous pastoral scenery with fabulous sunsets. The view to the east is small subdivision. They have strange arrangement for many of the RV pull through sites: they double them up (one enters from West, the other from East). Makes a tight squeeze when both have pullouts.

Text: We had a wonderful experience at the Rustic Barn Campground.  The grounds, bathrooms, the barn itself and the little chapel are all lovingly kept in immaculate condition.  The owners are welcoming and accommodating.  The views are beautiful.  And there are many interesting towns and sites to explore within a short drive's distance.

We highly recommend the Rustic Barn and look forward to returning again!

Text: We had the best time at this campground!  Everything is very well maintained, full hookups at each site, lots of green space, family games scattered throughout, a sweet little chapel and the most amazing view of the sunset.  Met the owner and she was absolutely lovely.  A lot of pride in ownership here...already looking forward to our return.
