Text: I didn't stay there . My Sister-in-law did. I thought it was very nice. It was clean and quiet which is good for her. The staff is friendly and professional. They were always ready to help. One of the staff even walked with us when my Sister-in-law needed to walk her dog.

Text: I love the fact that the service here is so friendly. For the moment it's a home away from home and it feels that way

Text: It's clean. The staff is great. It's not the Ritz but it's exactly what it claims to be. These days that's rare. My chief complaint is it doesn't offer any breakfast at all. For the same price and quality the holiday inn (shared parking lot) offers a decent hot breakfast free everyday but it was full so I'm staying here. But that's it.
