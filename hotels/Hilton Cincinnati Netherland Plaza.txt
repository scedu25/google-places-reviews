Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza
Rating: 5
Text: We went to the Hilton Netherland Plaza because we are considering booking our wedding block of hotel rooms with them. The whole place was fantastic. The hotel has so much history and beautiful architecture. The lobby and bar areas are ornate, dramatic, and very well-kept. The rooms we toured were spacious and bright and we would be happy to have our out of town wedding guests stay there. The location is excellent. Just a block from Fountain Square and a few short blocks down to the riverfront.

Text: I recently stayed at the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza. My room was very nice. The hotel staff were all very professional and friendly. The dining and beverage service in the Orchid was fabulous. The hotel design is Art Deco and very nicely decorated throughout the hotel property. I used the health club and pool and enjoyed those amenities as well.

Text: Didn't stay here, was only in for a wedding. The staff was helpful and polite. The venue was nice and the food was very good and the service top notch. Only gripe is that the building is a little old (I believe it is a historic hotel), which means the decor is a little dated. Also the bathrooms were on the small side. None of that is be all end all. If the system allowed for it, I'd have given 4.9 stars.

Text: This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel that maintains a strong 1920s/30s aesthetic. Rooms can either be gigantic or a little smaller than expected, which I suppose isn't uncommon in an old downtown hotel, but is something to look out for. Service is fantastic and staff has always been very friendly in my visits. Air conditioner in the room can be loud.

Text: Beautiful and historic hotel in a convenient location downtown.   We had a very nice stay.  Not the best place for accessibility - lots of steps.  You can take elevators but have to go out of your way to get to them.
