Text: Undergoing a remodel to become a La Quinta. So few amenities. Will be a very nice hotel when done.

Text: Although the place needs a little updating, it was very clean. The gentleman in the front was nice. The room itself was very clean and everything that we needed was in there. There were 3 bars of soap and 2 packets of shampoo/conditioner, along with other simple necessities. Located close to many restaurants. Quite as well.

Text: Stayed for a single night, used their lowest priced room. Nothing remarkable, but for an older hotel it was very clean and well maintained. The few staff that we interacted with were professional and helpful.

Text: The original brewery in Wichita and maybe the best! Having sampled many local breweries I still like River City brews the best. Fun club upstairs often featuring excellent bands. I have co hosted several parties here with great success. Above average bar and comfort food downstairs. Try it out. Great for groups.
