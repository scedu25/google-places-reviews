Comfort Inn Splash Harbor
Rating: 3
Text: The rooms were clean, and the breakfast was good. We booked our room about 2 months in advance, but when we got there the Splash Harbour was closed for maintenance and the receptionist wasn't very pleasant about it. She said it was on their website, but it was just put up two weeks ago. I thought we should've been compensated for the inconvenience, but to no avail. Other than that, pretty central location and alright rooms. Will book again in the future.

Text: This is a great place to spend the night and unwind in their fantastic pool. Rooms were very nice and very clean. The front desk staff had great recommendations for local restaurants and the hot breakfast was a nice treat to get the day going.

Text: Rooms were nice and clean. Staff was friendly. I didn't use the water park, it appeared smaller than I was expecting and was fairly busy. The breakfast was not very good, it was the same basic options that you usually get with the free hotel breakfast, just a lot smaller.
