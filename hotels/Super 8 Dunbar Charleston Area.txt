Super 8 Dunbar/Charleston Area
Rating: 4
Text: I wanted a cheap, safe place to spend the night. That's what I got. It's a little run down and some things like the remote and curtains were dirty, but the staff is incredibly nice and they work hard. My smoke alarm was malfunctioning and staff was very kind, working until we reached a solution. There's also a Wendy's and Subway within walking distance so you have options for food. I would caution anyone with asthma/smoke sensitivity though. But for a single person or couple just passing through town, it's fine.

Text: Good price and a fantastic staff. Rooms were clean and quiet. The free breakfast had fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, etc. About what you would expect from a budget hotel chain. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to help out. The guy at the front desk even helped carry some luggage in for me.

Text: Boyfriend has been staying there for work.. has been there two separate times. In two separate rooms. Each time getting ate up with bed bugs..  if I'm not mistaken, that's a personal injury law suit... Should probably get rid of the bug problem...

Text: For a Super 8 this hotel definitely met my expectations! The room was well kept and seemed clean. The breakfast bar wasn't extravagant but I enjoyed my bagel and apple juice. They allow dogs which was definitely a selling point for us! The only thing that I didn't love was all the people smoking right next to the front door (which by the way did have a NO SMOKING sign on it). Overall it was a good experience!

Text: Rooms are decently clean and service is friendly and accomodating. However, it's quite noisy, the free breakfast is very limited, and the TV service is terrible. Internet is so-so for speed.
