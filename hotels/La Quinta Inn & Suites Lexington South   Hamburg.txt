Text: Great place to stay! Nice staff, polite, professional, helpful. Rooms clean. Pet friendly but no pet smells in rooms. About three miles down the road is food galore.  And there are wendy's and McDonald within a block.  

We've stayed here several times and it's always been great. Feels like home away from home.  We will be back.

Text: Very nice.  I would stay here again.  Friendly staff, clean room, good value for the price.  The pizza delivered from Donatos was excellent.  Happy the front desk recommended it.

Text: The lady that checked us in was great, very nice even when it was a bit busy. She did a great job for being her second day by herself. The room was clean. The hot tub was out of order but you could still swim. Only issue I had was explaining what a gentleman's club was to my children that is located just down the street, not the hotels fault.

Text: Huge fan of the customer service at the front desk. Friendly and pleasant, very happy with the entire exchange. The room was great, the entire experience was top-notch and there's no reason for me to stay anywhere else whenever I'm in the Lexington area. On my way out the next morning I was so pleased the service that I asked for the manager - when I told her how much I enjoyed the late night front desk employee she implied that everyone thinks that about him which made me very happy.
