Red Roof Inn Charleston West - Hurricane, WV

Text: Our room smelled moldy and old. I killed 4 stink bugs and the tenets all looked seedy. We paid over $50 for this room. When I turned on the heat the room then smelled like a hot piss. I was done. I'll NEVER stay at this place again. Go get a room at the Hampton Inn on the other side of the road. You'll feel much better.

Text: Absolutely wonderful. The room was clean and did not stink, the shower was wonderful, the fridge was clean no build up ice in the freezer. The microwave was clean and the beds were absolutely wonderful, there was one stink bug but it wasn't a bother, caught it with a cup and released it.

Text: Rooms are pretty sparse with hardwood floors. No fridge or microwave. The price attracts a certain group of loud/inconsiderate/dumb crowd so be aware of that. Raise the price just a hair, carpet the floors, and get some microwaves and fridges. Bed and pillows were shockingly comfortable however.

Text: Room is clean. Basic toiletries available. Check in was super fast/easy. Check out is at 12pm, later than I'm used to, which is great. -1 star because towels are super hard and room had a strange, damp sort of smell when I walked in. I'm acclimated now, so no big deal.

Text: The room was in extremely great condition. I assumed it was recently renovated but the staff told me it was over 7 years ago. Still looked brand new! Everything was clean and up to date.
