Text: Bed bugs! Stayed in the room next to the office. Approximately 10 pieces of carpet make up the floor. Was cheapest in town for a reason. Got bit up and freaked out. Found a bed bug and brought it to the office. She yelled at me and told me I must have done something to the room???! Refused to refund money as I was staying for the week. Gross people and horrible experience. There was a slug in my shower one night! How would it even get there?! Horrible place to stay and definitely bed bugs
