May Lodge
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed in the lodge, Room 201. Great view from the private balcony. Spotless room. Very clean and new. Great stay, lots of hiking trails. Dinner was a buffet. Very good selection. Brisket was a little tough, but the smoked flavor was superb.

Text: Beautiful scenery, close by food, liquor, and gas, rooms are decorated nicely but a little musty.   Overall a great stay for the price!!!

Text: The lodge is a monument to the Democat party swamp. Andrew Jackson May, convicted for taking bribes during WWII imprisoned for 9 months was pardoned by Pres Truman.  May also is guilty of treason though never charged.   He killed over 800 sailors and sunk 10 submarines when he revealed to to the Japanese how they where setting their depth charges to shallow....  Lets name a state park building after him...
