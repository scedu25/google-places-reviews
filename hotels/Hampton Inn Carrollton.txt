Text: Wonderful people, very helpful and courteous. Nice room. One problem though. Shower curtains don't keep water in tub. Staff is aware of it. My wife almost fell. She caught herself. I suggest you put some money in New curtains before someone gets hurt and sues you. If she fell i would have.

Text: This had one of the best handicap-friendly bathrooms ever. There was no barrier to step over or into. The tile floor simply slopes toward the center of the floor.  There is a seat attached to the wall for those who need to sit. And there is plenty of room to navigate and wheelchair around in the bathroom.

Text: The hall and room smelled like smoke. We checked in at midnight, so didn't call and ask for another room. Floor in breakfast room was sticky. Empty bowl of melted ice where yogurt should have been. When I asked, they said they had run out. Eggs were cold. Just not what I expected from Hampton Inn.  The next night we stayed in a Holiday Inn Express and Suites in Detroit. It was like night and day.
