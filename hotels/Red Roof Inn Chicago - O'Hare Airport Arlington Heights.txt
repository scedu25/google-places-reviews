Text: Great place, rooms were very private and good for the price. Nice beds but they WILL NOT give extra pillows even if you are 8 months pregnant. We usually stay here when visiting family in the city, very budget happy.

Text: This place is gross. Really dirty motel. Old stains everywhere on walls. Floor dusty and full of someone's hair. Stains on towels and sheets,   Possibly not changed sheets because it was too wrinkled and had some short hair on it. 1 star is for good speed internet. Lobby looked ok, so expected the room to be at least the same, was really disappointing.
