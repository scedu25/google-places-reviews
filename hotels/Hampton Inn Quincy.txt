Hampton Inn Quincy

Text: We arrived late to the Hampton Inn in Quincy, IL. I mean really late. Like 3 AM late. The gentleman behind the counter was awesome. He was fast and friendly. He got us checked in really quick and yet he still had time to explain everything the hotel had to offer. Like the indoor pool, the workout room and the complimentary breakfast in the morning. We were exhausted, but we still appreciated him quickly explaining everything the hotel had to offer.

The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The room offered plenty of space as far as the drawers and closet. They offered good sized beds that were very comfortable. The bathrooms were spacious. My stay at the Hampton Inn in Quincy, IL. was short, but it was absolutely sweet.

Text: Staff is great! I had an issue with my room and they were quick to help me deal with it. Breakfast is average. Beware though, not all rooms have microwaves and fridges.

Text: I accidentally left 2 shirts and a phone charger in my room and didn't realized my mistake until several hours after we left the area.  I called the front desk and the staff  mailed them to my home address immediately.  That is the kind of customer service that  has earned my loyalty.
