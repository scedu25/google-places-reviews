Knights Inn Rolla

Text: My family and I got into Rolla late at night and were quickly and easily accommodated by the front-desk staff.  We ended up staying through the weekend as were very comfortable. There has apparently been a recent change in management at the property and we found the new staff to be very friendly and helpful!

Text: I am a trucker I frequently travel on i-44, Rolla is midway for my travel so I normally stay in super8 because they have parking for trucks, but this time they were full and i have to find another place to stay ,most of small hotels in rolla dont have parking for trucks, after a little bit of research I found about ROLLAINN, they have a very big parking for trucks so I took the room, I only cared about my truck parking but when I went to the room I realized its pretty nice room for lot less than what I was paying in super8, and on top of that I have 24/7 gas station in the property so I can grab something I dont have to walk too far to get something to eat, being a trucker i cant drive my truck to restaurants. the staff were friendly and I had very good sleep coz it was too quite. I am definitely going to stop   here again.
