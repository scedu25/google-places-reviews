Text: Enjoyed it very much. Super friendly, helpful, accommodating. Beautiful house, property. Room with antique accents and comfortable bed. Horseback ride was a life experience.

Text: I called to ask for a job and asked where they were located. The woman told me if I don't know where they are then I am not qualified to work there and hung up on me. I've never talked to a more rude person. I never give bad reviews but this time I can't keep my mouth shut. It is appalling...

Text: This was my first time staying there. Jen and Dana and Ty at First Farm were great. They are so kind and the service and food they provide are excellent. It's a nice, relaxing place to stay. It was also fun to go out and visit with her horses.I can't wait to go back because I hope to get to ride next time!

Text: My husband and I stayed at First Farm Inn for 2 nights as part of our anniversary trip. We loved it and wished we could stay longer but we had to get back to our kids. The food was great, the house was clean and in order and Jen was very friendly. The 3 of us took a ride for a good amount of time. While out we were able to gain a lot of information about the horses and their care (we plan to have some in the future). We had never been to a B&B before and this was a great first experience! We plan to return and will share with our friends and family. :)

Text: Jen gave us a great experience horseback riding and made a great breakfast.  My wife and I really enjoyed talking to Ty.  We left our door cracked and got to have a couple cats sleep with us, which really made sleeping so much cozier. Ody (sp?) was a lot of fun and got my wife and I both to play soccer; my wife got to pet a chicken.  I can't stop scanning Facebook pictures for Blue (the horse I rode both days) because he was great.  We had such a nice stay, and our first anniversary really set the bar with First Farm Inn.  Thank you!
