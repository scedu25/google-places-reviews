Text: Just left Sunset point after a great weekend. We asked the owners about the issue that the guest that was in a cast had. They said that guest did not tell them of any issues so they were unaware, otherwise they would have tried to accomodate. 
The rooms are immaculate and very cozy. I would recommend a visit here to anyone.

Text: New ownership is amazing. Any amenity we needed was provided. The game room, pool, and tennis court allowed for plenty of fun during the stay. Cabin was clean and comfortable. Will definitely be returning in the near future
