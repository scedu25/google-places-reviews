Text: Only thing good about this place is the liquor, I live very close and have ordered food from here and it was completely cold.  I live 2 minutes away is it really that hard to actually cook your food? Will only go for drinks.  Will never order food from here again

Text: Not your typical local dive bar. Open early and open late. You will always feel welcomed and they've got great cold beers and cocktails. Not the largest selection but you don't need that when you're stopping here. Enjoy a game of billiards or play some songs on the jukebox that plays damn near every song imaginable.
