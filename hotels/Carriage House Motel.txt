Carriage House Motel

Text: Run from this "motel".  The woman tending the reception desk speaks limited english.  The motel lobby and outdoor walkways are littered with junk and trash which, I believe, would draw mice.  The room looks like it has not seen a vacuum in years.  I can deal with a bathroom that has poor lighting and no mirror, but it was hard to tell if the floor was just very old or has never been cleaned.  The room smelled musty and moldy.  
Any positive reviews regarding this flea bag motel must be from friends and family.

Text: Cheap, fantastic air conditioning, clean and helpful staff. I don't know what's wrong with these other reviews. The building is old but everything works except one of the three locks on the door. No biggie. 5 stars

Text: The first impression I noticed was the stench of curry (this was before i even entered the office) and it only got worse, the manager's wife did not speak english very well at all, she couldn't find my reservation, after 15 minutes of what i assume a conversation  at a street vender in India would be like, I ended up paying for another room and doing the paperwork over again, then the "husband" ( I assume the manager) meanders out of the back room and then magically they found my room reservation... 
    
So after 20 minutes of refunding and playing with credit cards ( you know ill be watching my banking account now) the manager instructs me on how to finagle with the heater to get it to work, there is a single power strip for us to use and the door doesnt lock, it has a chain instead... 

AND THIS PLACE WASNT EVEN CHEAP, 65 for a 2 bed for one night!
