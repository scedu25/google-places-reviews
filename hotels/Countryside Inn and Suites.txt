Countryside Inn and Suites

Text: Very quiet, and clean hotel. The pool and hot tub are simple, but enjoyable. Our choice to stay at with children. Non smoking hotel so it's a wholesome place. The breakfast is more diverse than is typical of this pricing. Nice staff is always helpful.

Text: Pretty much your only choice in Brown County. Nice that it has a pool and free breakfast. No fitness room anymore.

Text: Somewhat updated.  No carpet in the downstairs rooms, which is good for allergy sufferers like me.  Beds had hair and dirt on the sheets, so it's obvious they weren't washed.  Beds were very loud and sounded like they were gonna break in.  Furniture is trashy looking with scuff marks all over it.  $100 a night, I suppose I can't complain too much.  Breakfast was ok.  Most hotel breakfasts under $100 a night aren't the greatest.  This one is no exception.  Water pressure was amazing downstairs.  Upstairs rooms the pressure is horrible.  Air conditioner works very well.  Room kind of stinks.  Smells old.  Has a microwave and a mini fridge.  The room door shook every time someone closed a door nearby.  You can hear noises easily through the walls, but I was still able to sleep.  The outside appearance was nice, with a country like setting.  Seems to be away from heavy traffic.  I was in room 104, double queen bed room.

Text: AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Didn't realize credi card swipe needed cleaning so card denied until asked to punch in numbers.
No elevator and only 2 floors but I have bad knees.
Room air conditioning inoperable but no one to look at it. Told take a refund and leave or an other room.
Moved rooms since no other hotels nearby.
2nd room air conditioner also stopped.
Horrible situation no resolution.
