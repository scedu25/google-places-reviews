Text: Sheets and comforter was very dirty. Even in our second room after getting moved. Pleasant service but just could stay.

Text: We had an awful experience. When we came into our room it was very messy and our bed was not made. Our pillows and sheets had dirt stains. We called the front desk and asked the lady to put clean sheets on our bed, but she told us to make our own bed and handed us a basket of sheets.

Text: This place kinda sucks..sure good price but u sacrifice good service for it. They never have clean towels .." they're in the wash". The sink handle comes off in it hand, tub don't drain... Been waiting on maintenance to take care of that for 2 days. We took the sink handle to the front desk they ask what happened ,i said it came off n they said.." they didn't come n fix it?" Now would I be holding the handle if they did! I won't be back!

Text: The people in the room next to me partied all night and made a bunch of noise. I got no sleep. I called in a noise complaint twice, and the front desk did nothing. I called the police, and they didn't do anything either, which explains why the front desk ignored me. By far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I want to leave but am afraid to get robbed by the thugs next to me. Will wait for sunrise and hope for the best. Oh and btw, there's no wifi in the rooms. As if it makes a difference. You are better off holing up under an overpass.

Text: It was affordable. Seemed okay. If you're just needing a quick place to stay without breaking the bank it is fine. Nothing special about it.
