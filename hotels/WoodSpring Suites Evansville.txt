Text: I found this gem on an expedia product. With a  reservation of,  the max, 28 days, the company offered me a great rate. Upon arrival, I was greeted and checked in by the general manager. He was extremely patient when working with other customers. There was a difficult patron ahead of me and the manager did not let this complication effect my interaction. The room and its amenities were clean. The building and accommodations were up to par.

Text: Nice helpful staff. Able to answer all questions I had. Lobby looked clean I assume the rooms are nice. I was not in for an overnight stay myself, but based on the people I spoke to, I would recommend to family and friend coming for a visit.

Text: Booked two rooms, one was slightly dirtier than the other. The cleaner room had a slight smell of smoke. No other problems or complaints. Front desk was very helpful.
