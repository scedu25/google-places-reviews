Text: We arrived in the rain, were given a room and it was fair, Sheets were not tucked in and I would say that it is outdated. We bought a puppy while there and were asked to move rooms which we did promptly. That room was horrible, Smelled bad, dirty floors, no coffee pot, hair dryer or iron. Continental breakfast was limited. Cold cereal or waffle, the coffee many morning was cold.
