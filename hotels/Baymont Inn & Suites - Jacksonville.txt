Baymont Inn & Suites - Jacksonville
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed at this place for 2-3 days and loved it. My kids could enjoy with our dog as it is a pet-friendly hotel. We also have a small kid so the crib was available on short notice. My kids wanted to stay longer so we did a late checkout. We look forward to going back for a more fun filled stay at Baymont Inn.

Text: Thanks a lot to the people of Baymont Inn for arranging the things I need on a small notice. My kids loved the breakfast and they want me now to cook pancakes like they had here. I loved the place and we look forward to spending more time at the Inn soon.

Text: Very clean, staff called the room to make sure we were satisfied, which I thought was a nice touch. Breakfast was adequate, the waffle recipe they use needs to be changed, I couldn't eat mine. But for the money, good deal.

Text: Cozy and clean rooms and the staff is always friendly. They help you in the best possible way. The food is good and I had a good night’s sleep after a long road trip. This is a good place for family as well and can spend a good weekend here.

Text: Easy to check out and check in. The reception service is always available even during late evenings or midnight. I had a small kid with me and the room service people quickly arranged a crib for him. Thanks for being so responsible guys! Looking forward to visit again.
