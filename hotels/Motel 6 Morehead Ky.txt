Motel 6 Morehead Ky

Text: Never stay there-  Room was filthy and gross...I don't believe the bathroom toilet was cleaned before I arrived. No extra toilet paper...had to ask for that when I ran out. Nail clippings and dead bugs on the floor under the bed. Tub drain barely worked. Sheets and bedspreads had holes in them. (I pray they were changed) I stay further away from town before I stay here again. I was supposed to be there 3 nights...decided to come home a day early.

Text: I loved the fact that this location was set back away from the freeway and in addition I had a room on the back side of the building that overlooked the forest, so I felt like I was miles away from the highway- very quiet!!! I also did not hear any noises from the hall or next door.  Coin laundry available

Text: The housekeeping could be better:  the bloody pillowcase was not changed even though it was left out dirty side up;  bits of snack bags from previous client stayed on floor for all of my three day stay; upon opening the curtain I found a take out cup of drink from the previous client. Upon checking in the worker behind the desk was obviously not trained thoroughly and was dressed for a very casual day at home instead of a workplace.

Text: Location was conveniently located right off the highway. Rooms were outdated but kept clean. Pillows were uncomfortable. AC worked fantastic and cooled down quick. Service was excellent, everyone was very friendly.

Text: Well the people doing check-in seemed to care less and they did not appear to know exactly what they were doing. I had checked the reviews online and it said this place was newly renovated....my room did not appear to be even remotely newly anything, especially the TV.  It was actually a little creepy and I felt uncomfortably leaving my room.
I got a decent nights sleep but I don't think I would stay here again.
