Text: Fantastic. An absolute Delight. I highly recommend this B&B. It's a picturesque setting. There are also individual cabins available. The owner  is a gracious and lovely woman. Breakfast was phenomenal. It's peaceful it's quiet ,we spent most of our trip sitting on the wonderful porch enjoying the view and the breeze. We stayed in the barn. The barn was CLEAN,the bedding & towels where wonderful, it has a full kitchen and decorated just delightfully. We will be back.
