Hotel Frederick
Rating: 5
Text: I was totally blown away by the Hotel Frederick! The rooms are so unique and different -- and every detail has been taken care of. It has all the charm of a bed and breakfast, with the sophistication of a hotel in a big city. I was so impressed by the bathroom and the design of the room. 

The lobby was beautiful, the continental breakfast had everything and the restaurant and bar were to die for. I HIGHLY recommend anyone try this hotel, you will not be disappointed.

Text: Great hotel! Loved the authentic old historical feel to it. Staff was so friendly and helpful. Only complaint is the beds we're very uncomfortable. Didn't sleep well and would've loved to have sat out on the beautiful balcony and had a drink from the bar but there were no umbrellas or shade so it was too hot for our bunch. Otherwise it was a great experience for the money!

Text: Loved our stay!  The staff is amazing, friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  It's a beautiful building!  Makes you feel right at home.  OMG the whirlpool tub is a must!  Only complaint is the bed needed updated (a bit worn out).  But, I'm willing to over look an older bed for the lovely experience we had.

Text: What a unique place! Staff extremely personable and helpful. Room large and comfortable. Breakfast was Continental with good variety. For bicycle enthusiasts, Katy Trail literally runs next to hotel.

Text: We had a family reunion here and it was perfect.  The facility is historic and is located next to the Katy Trail and the bridge across the Missouri River.  The dining room is spacious and the food is delicious,  as well as having reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and very accommodating to all of our requests.  The rooms are reasonably priced and all are comfortable.
