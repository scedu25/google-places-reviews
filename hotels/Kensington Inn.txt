Text: Room was clean and comfortable. We had a Jacuzzi Suite witch had a small microwave and fridge, witch also looked clean and sanitary. The only things I noticed that would have improved our stay was to add extra pillows and programming that included a guide, I spent 20 minutes searching each channel to find an enjoyable program or movie.

Text: The staff is absolutely awesome. Chris the manager definitely knows his job. He has to deal with a lot of issue with customers/tenants. My opinion is he does his job extremely well to handle all issues.

Text: Not fancy, but has an awesome bed, shower and internet. It's great for the price and very clean. There's a decent size fridge and microwave. Good deal.

Text: This hotel is right by Taco bell and I love that. The hotel room consequently smells of burrito bowls. Not a huge problem, it airs out nicely by opening the door. The curtains were clean. Everything was clean.

Text: Exactly what you would expect from a weekly. Internet cuts out every 30 minutes, no coffee pot in rooms, staff is rude, entitled and not helpful, had to ask several times for sheets and towels even on their weekly cleaning day. Still too expensive for what you get. One positive, the rooms are clean and bug free.
