Hampton Inn Olathe
Rating: 5
Text: Staff were friendly and helpful. Building, rooms, and grounds were clean and well-kept. Beds were very comfortable. The pool was a little on the small side but enough for kids to have fun, and the hot tub was fantastic. I also used the fitness and business centers which were awesome. A great price for a great stay.

Text: Convenient location just off the interstate. Plenty of restaurants and shops in walking distance, but the area doesn't reward walking (wide, busy streets, parking lots everywhere). The hotel staff has been friendly and helpful, the morning breakfast above average, and the room is clean and has the expected amenities. The shower head was acceptably high for me (I'm 6'4" - looking out for the tall folks). The pool and is quite small, but would probably entertain children for a bit. The exercise room has an elliptical machine, a bike, a couple treadmills, and some weights - pretty basic.

Text: It's a nice hotel construction is not so much you can feel it when you walk in the second floor that you are in the air and probably noisy for the first floor. But other than that it's nice clean bery good bed. Hate the small pillows. Nice pool indoors and hot tube. Nice breakfast and nice crew, very attentive.
