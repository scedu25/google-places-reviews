Text: Comfort and history. In-house breakfast was delivered to my room, and I was encouraged to dine on the open balcony. Gorgeous trees and landscaping. This place feels like a kind old lady who knows what you need. Well-thought out hospitality. Within walking distance to downtown Springfield and culture.

Text: We are in the midst of planning a rehearsal dinner. The staff, Lisa and Gary have gone above and beyond with efforts to make our event a wonderfully personal and special experience! The rooms are all lovely and the back yard is very peaceful!  The price is quite reasonable for the hours Lisa is logging to accommodate and make recommendations. The experience is approaching and I'm totally at peace and not worried about the evening. I know it's in good hands
