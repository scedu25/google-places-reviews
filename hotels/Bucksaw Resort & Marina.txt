Text: Best people. Best fishing. Best hospitality. I don't know of any other place on Earth where you can sleep in a fully-functional kitchenette that's floating on one of the most beautiful lakes on earth. Then, go get ya an exceptional breakfast just a few steps down from your room. Then, go catch your fill of crappie, catfish, white bass, and an occasional buffalo (all before noon). If your heart desires, you have plenty of time left in the afternoon to go whack a gobbler! After harvesting that Ozark Mountain thunder chicken, you still have time in the evening to crack open an ice cold one and fish off the dock. Clean your catch right there in the cleaning station, toss your slabs in the freezer, get a hot shower, put your head on a soft pillow, repeat in the A.M.
