Rustic Retreat- Cabins at Stockton Lake
Rating: 5
Text: We loved our stay at Rustic Retreat!  The cabin is both comfortable and so well decorated!  It has all the comforts of home--a well stocked kitchen, comfy beds--while having a rustic feel.    It is a short walk to the lake with hills and trees.  The fire pit was fun to roast marshmallows while talking to our neighbors.  Would definitely recommend this cabin!

Text: I love this cabin! We enjoy our time when we go to Rustic Retreat because we love to get away from the busy life at home and just relax. My kids love playing outdoors, fishing, and making s'mores by the campfire at night!! I definitely recommend this cabin for your next vacation!
