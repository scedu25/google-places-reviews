Clark Street Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Our group of 9 Katy Trail bikers have stayed in the cottage for the past 2 years and we absolutely love the accommodations! Our last visit was Oct 8th 2017, and once again, Mark made us feel at home and was very quick to help when needed. We will definitely stay again, and again, and again... Thanks for making our bike trip the best it could be Clark Street Lodge!!
