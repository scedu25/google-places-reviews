Text: I was very please at how clean the room was. Set up with fridge microwave TV and more. The staff was very friendly and helpful to help me locate places in local area. I would stay there again if in the area.

Text: Very comfortable rooms could have been a little cleaner. Also being a stay over, they only cleaned including trash removal once a week. I thought this to be insane but when told price I didn't mind taking out my own trash. ;)

Text: The nicest people I've ever met in my life.  This is what America is all about.  Forgot my personal hygiene bag worth of a few hundred dollars and forgot about it.  They found me and  sent it to me.  Need I say more?!?  Thank you guys.
