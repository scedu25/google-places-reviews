Hampton Inn LaPorte

Text: This hotel is seriously in the middle of nowhere.

We stayed here when we were going to a football game at Notre Dame and we didn't realize how far the drive is back and forth. 

The closest thing to the hotel was a few restaurants which I think were about 7 miles away or the other direction about 11 miles there was a casino. 

The hotel has been updated it looks like pretty recently so it looked really nice and the rooms were very clean no complaints there. They also do a free breakfast even on the weekends which is really nice and the room rate was not bad around $103.

The only complaint is the distance to anything which isn't really the hotels fault. So I still give them a 5!

Text: A 3 is being generous.  The only reasons are good water pressure, and good breakfast.  The elevator was out. I wasn't offered any assistance getting bags up or down the 3 flights of stairs,  and  Nothing was taken off my bill. The other problem was a large spider web that was hanging from the wall to my bed. I didn't see it until 3 am when lights came through my window. Sorry to say, but I was a bit disappointed.

Text: Despite having the nearby and life supporting toll road exit closed next to them.. the breakfast bar was set up and ready as if they were hosting a convention - not in quantity but quality!! The LaPorte, IN staff was awesome! I'll do this again next time I come visit my family!

Text: Nice place BUT I stay in 3 to 4 motels a week for work and this is the first one that made me give a personal credit card in case I did something to the room.
