Text: Horrible experience... came here for 5th Anniversary... spa experience was sad felt rushed my wife pedicured nail paint came off hours later the facials made us break out the message was anything but relaxing. The hotel was full of load drunk teens slamming each other around well past 10. Seriously would never recommend this to anyone. Waste of money, time anared my life. Then on top of everything we contact the front desk and the say look we contacted are security and hang up on us 3 different times! We ask for a manager and they say sorry there is no manager and we did all we can. And hang up again. So middle of the night we are debating driving home on our Anniversary! Really nice experience thanks The Ridge! I’ll be sure to tell everyone about my experience!

Text: The renovation at The Ridge is excellent! We love the new coffee bar and sandwich shop. The pool is also a big attraction for us. Everyone there is really nice. Beautiful places to watch television and take pictures. Can't wait to go back!
