Candlewood Suites Columbus - Grove City

Text: One of the best hotels I've ever stayed.  I arrived on a Saturday afternoon July 08 after a long road trip, and the place was so quiet, I thought I was the only one on that floor.  The front desk guy was the nicest receptionist I've ever came across.  And everything about that room was just wonderful. The bathroom was clean, mini-kitchen area had all the item needed for extended stay. The bed and sheet were very comfortable. The room has lots of flat surfaces and storage area.  Additionally, the hotel is close to a lot of mid-high end restaurants which was very nice.  I only wish I could've stayed there longer.  I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend others to stay as well.

Text: In town for a wedding and stayed at this hotel. The staff, especially Ron, were all very kind and helpful. We were always greeted with a friendly hello and he even gave my son a $10 certificate to use in the pantry for snacks. The rooms were extremely clean, bed and pillows were super comfy, no complaints whatsoever about our room. Overall great hotel!
