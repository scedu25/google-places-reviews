Camp Lake Pla-Mor

Text: This place is a dump and they don't treat people like a reputable company should. They have parts of vehicles torn a part and trash everywhere.  My wife and I made the mistake of trying to visit this place.  They don't have signs stating whether they are open or closed and we were told in an impolite way to leave.  We even called first but they don't answer their phone either. They are unfriendly as is suggested by their sign at the gate saying "guns don't kill people, I kill people". Avoid this place and go to a reputable camp ground or a state park.

Text: Drove here to utilize their day use area for a picnic and some swimming. We tried calling, since their website says to call for reservations but nobody answered the phone, so we drove up assuming they might be busy. The sign asks you to register at the front office for use of the facility. The front gate was closed but unlocked. We opened the gate and drove through only to be yelled at that if the gate is closed, it's like your house door being closed and that they are closed. This is not a residence but a place of business. We wanted to support the only family owned/run recreational area in Jasper county. Oh well... I guess they aren't always open. As we were leaving, the individual who yelled at us rode back up to the gate and apologized for yelling. It's extremely off-putting for a business to treat people like this when the area is advertised as a family friendly recreational area. If you're closed, please lock the gate and put up a 'Closed' sign. It is very difficult for people looking for this place to know if you are closed or not.
