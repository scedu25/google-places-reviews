Text: An awesome place to stay. If peace and tranquility are what you are looking for this is the place to stay. Cabins are very well equipped. Tastefully decorated and furnished with antique furniture and nice comfortable beds. The bedding is beautiful. Plenty of dishes, pots, pans, glasses & cups were in the cabinets. Well supplied with utensils and seasonings. Couldn't have asked for anything more. The only thing I can think of would have been to have more time to stay.

Text: Absolutely adore these cabins. We have been twice, once in 2013 and just a week ago on our second visit. New owners (April of 2013), Jason and Alison, have been absolutely stellar in welcoming us and providing terrifically appointed cabins in the woods complete with full kitchens, fireplaces, nice bedding, and of course, two person jacuzzi tubs. We are fond of hiking and there are many, many parks and forests within 30 miles that we visit before retiring back to these cabins (Jude's Dream is our personal favorite), grilling some steaks or chicken, and then soaking tired muscles in the jacuzzi. Round that out with a campfire under some stars and you can't ask for anything more than perhaps a few extra days to stay right where you are. I kinda hate sharing this "secret" weekend getaway but one shouldn't be so selfish. Just go once and you'll understand.
