Residence Inn by Marriott Toledo Maumee
Rating: 5
Text: Room was very nice. We stayed in a suite. The suite accommodated three of us well with one on the pullout couch. Extra linens were provided in room. The fireplace was nice but unnecessary. Water temperature and air condition both worked great! Location is very accessible from the highway but removed enough to be quiet. Large selection of restaurants nearby. Gym, pool and breakfast were amazing! Breakfast well stocked with hot foods (waffles!), Cereals, yogurts, and juices. Gym had free weights, treadmills, and bikes.

Text: Internet is very slow. I will probably stay elsewhere in the future because of this. The hotel is very clean and the staff is fantastic. So if you have no desire or need to have fast internet this is a great place to stay.

Text: Great hotel. Stayed overnight on a road trip. Right off the highway, easy to find. Staff was awesome. I travelled alone with an infant and staff was extremely accomodating- getting a pack n play late when we got in and grabbing a high chair/helping clean up breakfast. Room was clean and good temperature. I couldn't hear any other guests. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!

Text: This place is really well maintained and comfortable. Normally I would rate it a full 5 stars, but our party had several rooms and all of them had issues with the doors getting stuck. You have to swipe you room key a few times then jiggle the door and press on it hard with your shoulder. Two of us went down and talked to the front desk about it. Just be forewarned...hard to fight with the door when you have hot coffee or are carrying luggage.

Text: Nice, well appointed suite hotel. The room had a king bed, separated from a living area with a pull out sofa. The full size refrigerator is very useful. The indoor pool and free breakfast were both great
