Text: A lot of our crew stayed here for 300 a month plus pay electric which was fine til some of our crew arrived then the rent became 400 when I inquired about this Brian the owner said there were four of them in in one camper so they should pay extra other people with two and three to a camper weren't charged any extra I feel it should be the same for everyone 
I left on poor terms and had to call the sheriff so the owner would quit calling and texting  me for 29 dollars that I owed for electricity  (I left two weeks before my pre paid month was up with no refund)
