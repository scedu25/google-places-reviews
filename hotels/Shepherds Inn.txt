Text: We reserved all three rooms for both sets of parents and out of state relatives during our wedding June 3 & 4, 2016.  One set of parents had been previous guests but the others were so excited to stay so close to our wedding venue! (Venue was a private home a few miles down the road).  All 3 couples loved the charm and hospitality of Shephards Inn and are considering making a yearly trip to visit and stay there again!  

Also the owners were gracious enough to allow my new husband and I on their property for a few wedding pictures!  We brought out our photographer (who LOVED the trees, barn and lush country landscape! We even got a few pictures of the llama nibbling on my bridal bouquet ! Fun!!

Our deepest thanks to them for helping make our wedding day & guests feel welcome in Nebraska!!
