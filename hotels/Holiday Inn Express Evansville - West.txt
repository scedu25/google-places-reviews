Text: What a pleasant surprise!  I used to stay on the other side of town, but had booked this location to save a few dollars.  Check in was quick and easy, and Diana was very helpful in recommending some local restaurants (awesome steak house just minutes away).  The room was clean, wifi was strong, and the breakfast is what I have come to love and expect from a Holiday Inn Express.  I'll be seeing you folks again next time around.

Text: Cleaning personnel doesn't know what a vacuum is.  Don't leave a clothes hanger on the bed or cleaners won't make bed.   The rooms are much smaller than typical HIE rooms. You walk through bathroom on way to bedroom.  No trash can near sink.  Hotel counter staff was very nice though.
