Text: The young lady at the front desk when we checked in on Tuesday late afternoon was very friendly and very helpful. I ask her if she could suggest a good place for dinner and she gave us one also the next morning I asked the same young lady about a good place for breakfast again she gave us one. The room we had was very nice, clean and lots of room I would recommend this motel to everyone,by the way we are from New Jersey.

Text: Very nice inn. Small and clean. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 stars rating is the lake is across the road not right out door. But will return.

Text: Nice place but very basic. Does not have a microwave in the room. Good views of the lake
