Text: Beautiful place to stay. We had the entire place to ourselves and it absolutely felt like home. I would highly recommend for groups. You can rent the entire place for under $500.

Text: When we saw the outside of the building, we thought we'd be sleeping with horses, geese and Tom Arnold. We were amazed at how fantastic and well-kept this place is. Spacious enough for privacy and intimate enough for connection. This place won't be a secret for much longer.
