Martin Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Jenny who took our reservations, and checked us until was a super nice person, and recommended a good place to get breakfast in the evening. We came down to deer hunt, and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to stay, so we took a chance on the Martin Motel. And @ the price we got I'm super satisfied, I'll be back every year. The rooms are clean with super comfortable beds, and a nice hot show goes a long way after hunting in the cold all day. There is a flat screen t.v., a desk and chair, and two beds. It's a nice looking place outside, and inside it's a little older looking, but super clean. When we came back from a 12 hours day of hunting, our beds were made, room was clean, and fresh towels had been delivered. It's a bit off of the main road, but that's nice because of the quiet neighborhood.
We'll be back again,
Thanks James & Tristan Headrick.
