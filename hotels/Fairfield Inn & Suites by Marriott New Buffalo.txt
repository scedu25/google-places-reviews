Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott New Buffalo
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel was clean and the staff outstanding.  The bathrooms really need a ventilation fan as even with a fast shower the whole room became extremely steamy.  You could see some water damage from it on the framed photo in the bathroom.  The pull out couch had dirty linens left from the prior guests.  Fridge in the room (413) had quite a strong and unpleasant odor. The breakfast area was teeming with fruit flies. Pool area was clean and adequate. We stayed to visit Warren Dunes and would probably pick a different hotel next trip.

Text: My wife & I stayed here two nights for a wedding & the room we had was nice enough while we were in town. Bed was comfortable, room was clean & decent hot/cold continental breakfast options in the morning. Great location, just a few minutes to lake, casino, golf & restaurants in new buffalo. Overall, it's your typical hotel but a good place to stay for a couple days. And while you're there, I highly recommend you check out Stray Dog, New Buffalo Bills Bbq & Beer Church Brewing...good stuff!

Text: The hotel staff were very accommodating, but the rooms left something to be desired.  First room had a bathroom covered in mold and a horrible smell throughout.  They were quick to change our room, however.  Second night, we had a couple fighting next door and slamming doors.  While our stay worked for the two days we were there, I don't think we would return. Needs updated.

Text: Nice and fairly new place.  Rooms are well appointed and spacious.  Staff is friendly.  You can take a free tram to the local casino.
