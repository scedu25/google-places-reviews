Text: My fiance and I are from Arkansas and we stayed here with his family for a funeral. They've stayed at this hotel before but this was my first time. First off Kathy (the lady at the front desk) was AWESOME! Super sassy but in a funny way! All the staff seemed super helpful and sweet! Hotel was very clean and well decorated with a cabin/rustic theme. Breakfast was good. And they even have a little bar down by the lobby. The pool/hot tub area was great with the lake house theme in the woods, even has a sauna! I wish they had this hotel in AR!!!

Text: This is kind of a throw back to the lodge era complete with the wood work, fire place and bear skins on the walls. Its very clean, comfortable and close to everything; places to eat and Quincy malls are within sight. It is the first hotel I've been in in some time that doesn't have microwaves or a mini fridge in the rooms and the wifi was a little slow but those are the only things that prevent me from giving 5 stars. We would definitely stay there again. A lot to see in Quincy.

Text: Best hotel in Quincy! Friendly staff, especially Diamond. Had an issue with out in room hot tub, Diamond went above and beyond to resolve issue, more to come...overall would have been a 5 star until, vomit from a wedding party was in main lobby, event coordinators husband circled the desk like a hawk, wedding party were friends of event coordinator... so much for 170 bucks a night for relaxation, great hotel, if hotel staff friends are not partying.....
