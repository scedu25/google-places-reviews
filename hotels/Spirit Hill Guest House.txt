Spirit Hill Guest House

Text: Gorgeous, super cozy, and meticulously maintained and clean. The owners are there to help however they can but also give complete privacy. In every way, we LOVED this place!!! So much so that we had a hard time wanting to leave it to experience the rest of Hermann. It's private and away from the main drag where all the potentially unwanted hustle and bustle is. Truly a gem that I almost don't want to tell others about, because if word gets out how awesome this place is, we might have a hard time booking! Our visit was PERFECT! By the way, not a bed "& breakfast." The cooking is up to you, but you have everything you need to make whatever you want, including a electric skillet and gas grill. Stayed in the Patio Suite, but got to see the rest of the place while hanging out with the owners for a bit after the other guests left, and it's all just incredible. Owner, Gary is quite the gardener and loves to share knowledge as well as plants and their seeds for you to start your own. Don't miss out. You won't be disappointed!

Text: My friend and I stayed here a few years ago and had a fantastic experience. The views are gorgeous and the owners are super nice. They were having a family get together and made us feel welcome as we explored Hermann.
Great amenities, peaceful setting, and amazing hosts. Definitely going to head back here.
