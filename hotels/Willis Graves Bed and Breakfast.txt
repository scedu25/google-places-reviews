Willis Graves Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: A well furnished, historic home that's been transformed into a romantic bed and breakfast. An extremely comfortable get-a-way to go and relax. The cookies present in our suite when we arrived were 'to die for'. The addition of chocolate covered strawberries was heaven sent. (Get them) The breakfast was to order from a select menu and was excellently prepared by Chef Jennifer. We'll highly recommend this B&B to friends and family. (I know it sounds sappy but we really liked this place and will go back again... maybe the log cabin next time.)

Text: Absolutely love this Historic Bed and Breakfast!  The breakfast is amazing.  We loved the William Rouse Log Cabin Suite.  Private and cozy.  Burlington Historic District is a great place to come visit and stay.

Text: Hands down, the cleanest and most charming B & B I have ever stayed at. The innkeeper Jennifer is warm and delightful. Worth a stay just for the breakfast. A great place to relax and tune out. Only 15 minutes from the airport but seems a world away. Can't wait to go back!

Text: My family and I stayed here for 3 days and literally had tears when we left.  The rooms are fabulous.  The food is from heaven.  And the service was second to none.  We will be back, hopefully very soon.  Thank you guys for a totally awesome vacation!

Text: A wonderful experience. The owner is very friendly and makes you feel right at home immediately. The rooms have a beautiful,  antique decor. They are clean and cozy. The dining room is also beautiful and the breakfast was delicious. I have a hard time trying to come up with any criticism. It is a wonderful and relaxing place to get away.
