Text: I recently stayed at this place and it was horrible. My family and I was there for a funeral the staff was not friendly, the rooms were not cleaned and when we asked for towels we were told by the clerk that he could not help us. When I went to the desk to ask him for towels he was asleep. I called out to him twice and he never moved. I had to go back to my room and call him only to be told he could not help me. He stated the staff did not come in until 11:00am. I paid for two nights and our room was not cleaned. The trash was not taken out and the bathroom was not cleaned. It was a terrible experience. Something should be done about this facility. Just because a facility may be on the low end it should be clean and the staff should take pride in having the best facility instead of people paying for a terrible experience.

Text: Room was not ready when we arrived; housekeeping was in the room even though we arrived two hours after check-in time. We were assigned another room in which the handle broke off the toilet in the morning.  The person at the front desk that morning didn't seem to understand much English,  though he did promise it would be fixed within half an hour.  We went out and came back about eight hours later to find it had not been fixed.  The person at the front desk at that time quickly jumped up and went to fix it immediately. Besides housekeeping and the overnight desk attendant not understanding much English,  the gentleman manning the desk during the day was attentive and helpful.  In regards to the room itself,  it was comfortable. It was your standard budget hotel room.  Microwave and mini fridge were a welcome addition.  The bathroom could use some updating as it appeared stuck in previous decade,  however the water pressure made up for the lack of style.  I'd give 3.5 stars if it was an option; the gentleman at the front desk during the day was attentive and helpful which made up for some of the inconvenience.

Text: WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! 

Room was in fair to poor condition. Smelled like smoke. Was stuck there cause car broke down. Paid for that night. When I explained to manager, was an Indian gentleman and another Indian woman, what had happened to the car, he simply said, "Get Out". I asked if he could give me a couple more hours till the tow truck came. He repeated, more loudly and in a threatening tone, "GET OUT".

Text: I wish I could give this minus 10 stars. The place reeked of smoke and bad Indian food. 
   There was something on the floor that was either blood or ketchup. Hairs all over the sheets. Just absolutely disgusting. The phone didn't work. Stayed an hour and was not given any apology or decent customer service. The owners were very disrespectful to me, and wouldn't give a refund. I grabbed my kids and ran out of there as fast as we could.

Text: If and only if there were an option to give negative star rating. Hotel is unsanitary and room smelled. The attendant at the front desk was a black gentleman who's pants were falling off and hanging on his knees. I'm sure he never saw the sunlight from a school in his life. When we stood in front of him there was no greeting and we mentioned we have a reservation. All he said, "NAME?". May be that's the only English word he knows. His gesture was as if we were bothering him by coming to his hotel. He charged us twice which tells me that he's is nethier efficient nor likes his job. Without a doubt this was the worst hotel experience in the world let alone the United States. My advice for the owner is first: Buy him some correct size pants and send him back to school.
