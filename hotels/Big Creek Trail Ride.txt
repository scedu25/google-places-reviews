Big Creek Trail Ride
Rating: 5
Text: I just returned from a week at Big Creek.  Brett and Lisa Howell and their family have created a trail riders paradise!  The campground is scenic, the stalls are comfortable.  The food is the best I have ever had and the cinnamon rolls made from Lisa's family recipe are to die for.  The riding is challenging, fun and exciting at the same time.  Brett leads a fast ride every day that will get even the most in shape horse and rider in even better shape by the end of the week.  I have friends that have been coming to both the May and October rides for over 15 years.  I will be counting the days until I can go back again in the spring.  Thank you Brett and Lisa for creating and hosting the perfect vacation for any trail riding enthusiast!!
