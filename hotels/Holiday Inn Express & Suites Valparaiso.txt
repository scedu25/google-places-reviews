Rating: 5
Text: Comfortable bed. Room was clean and everything looked well maintained. Front desk people were friendly and helpful. I had a question about a charge on my bill which was handled quickly and efficiently. The shower was wonderful and towels were thick and soft.

Text: Our daughter is a Valparaiso University soccer player so we are here quite often and there are plenty of hotels in the area. This Holiday Inn is  always our choice due to the outstanding people, service, & amenities. Clean rooms, friendly staff, excellent breakfast. Not certain if coincidence, but the majority of our stays we even get the same suite.

Text: We checked in to the Holiday Inn for the wedding. After some initial confusion on where the entrance to their parking lot, we found that there was ample parking even though the hotel was full. We were in the room with one King. With the bed, the pull out couch, and a cot we were able to fit 4 people and not feel cramped. The couch and cot were somewhat flat. One strange thing about the bathroom was that the shower only had a small lip separating it from the rest of the bathroom. This meant that we laid down several towels on the bathroom floor to prevent it from becoming flooded. The breakfast buffet in the morning had a good variety and was delicious.

Text: Clean room and friendly staff. I enjoy the biscuits and gravy for breakfast. Hot water is a bit aggressive in the shower. Beware.
