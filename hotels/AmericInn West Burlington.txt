Text: I generally won't give 5 stars.  I would give the stay a 4.5 but with their effort I'm bumping it to 5. Extra pleasant staff.  Nice room with a VERY comfortable bed. Quiet AC. Must be new.  Nice pool area with a large hot tub and pool. Would DEFINITELY  stay here again!  Only thing,  I would have liked bacon or sausage with the breakfast but breakfast was good otherwise.

Text: Nice hotel. Uterly beautiful lobby! Above average pool area with, ironically, a pool table. Good rooms with up to date appliances and charging ports in the lamps. Very friendly staff and a slightly above average hot breakfast bar. The downside are little things. Door is tough to shut, key doesn't always work the first time, some seemingly lingering repairs. There were some construction materials at the end of the hall, so they may be in the process of remodeling. Thus, the place has a lot to like and may be already fixing what isn't to like. So disregard this after a few months, as much may have changed. In short, I have no hesitation in returning, and likely will.
