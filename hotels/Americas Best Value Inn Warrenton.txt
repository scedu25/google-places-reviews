Text: Very nice and pleasant staff rooms standered and clean had the room for animals. Did not smell like animals has stayed before. Beds are hard bring pain meds. Very clean sheets. Plenty of towels and wash cloths. Didn't have free continental breakfast. Only complaint lamp beside bed had long hair hanging off. Kinda gross but easy fix. Would stay here again if we traveled through.

Text: Contrary to what was said on Expedia there was no refrigerator and no microwave in the room. The place had a musty smell. There were no vending machines. We arrived at night. When we came out the next morning the exterior looked like it was falling apart. Also the window and screen could easily slide open from the inside or outside with no way to lock them. Even at a fairly cheap discounted rate we still felt ripped off. There was literally one car in the parking lot other than ours. I now know why.

Text: Inexpensive. Not fancy but a good value. Clean, and owner was friendly and polite. I'd recommend upgrading to a deluxe room.

Text: I thought the room was clean, but mold under soap dish in shower. Not much for breakfast. It had waffles, but no sugar free syrup. It had cereal , 4 pieces of bread,1 honey bun that was cut in half and like 2 muffins. The lady that checked in was nice. The halls were very hot and rugs were dirty. I was afraid when we first pulled up only one car in parking lot and it looked run down.
