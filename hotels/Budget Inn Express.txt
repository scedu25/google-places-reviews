Text: Don't waste your money on this dump...Owner is a pervert and creepy individual to say the least... there's bed bugs all over the place, no clean sheets, very few tv channels, no breakfast, no coffee pot in the rooms or office...Id sleep on the street before I would ever go back to this place...there's 2 other hotels in Louisa and I've stayed at both and they were great so spend the extra few bucks and stay at one of them
