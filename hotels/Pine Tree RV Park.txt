Text: It's just a stopover.  Owner a very sweet lady who aims to please.   The park is a little tight; some long termers; also worker guys like pipelines and wheat harvesters.  Eat, sleep and move on...

Yes wifi and hook ups, yet limited options. Not easy access for anything larger then 30'. Smelt like sewer and trash was over flowing. No outside area to have tables and casual hang out. Definitely only a place to sleep.
