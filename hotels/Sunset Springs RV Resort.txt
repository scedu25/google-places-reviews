Sunset Springs RV Resort
Rating: 5
Text: First year of staying at this resort and absolutely love it! Activities every weekend for the kids and they love the fishing and swimming.  Owners are very attentive to any needs that we've had, and have found them to be very gracious people.  Beautiful quiet place for families.  5 stars just because there aren't 6!

Text: This is a wonderful, quiet, family friendly campground. Our kids feel comfortable walking by themselves to go fishing, the beach or the bathhouse, which was recently remodeled and is amazing! There is always something fun planned for the kids. The owners are very friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome.

Text: This place is a wonderful get away and has been a great home for me since May 2017 (it is July 2017 now). Cassie and Bryan continue to make this place improve daily and have been extremely curtious to me and my family, when they were able to visit. Along with these lovely views of the lake, trees, birds, fireflies, chipmunks, and squirrels, are the floating toys and zip line on the swimming side of this lake. I never had time to fish, due to work, but I see and hear them of the evening. Supplies are really only about 10 minutes away, in either direction. The surrounding campers have been a pleasure to be around, possibly due to the owners not allowing the wrong crowds to congregate here. I would recommend this place as a destination, and if I'm around again, I will come here. Thank you Sunset Springs for the blessed experience.

Text: Brian and Cassie are wonderful hosts!! Super friendly and accomodating. They are working hard to constantly improve their campground. Enjoyed using their brand new laundry room before we left. Their shower house is also brand new. My kids absolutely LOVED the weekend activities and games, along with the super fun swimming lake with zipline, slide and trampoline. Great scenery and beautiful trees. The weak electricity would be my only complaint but all the rest makes up for it. Definitely will go back if in the area!
