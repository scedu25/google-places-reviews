Courtyard by Marriott Detroit Novi

Text: Have stayed here a few times.  This time I got an email from the manager asking what they could do - I asked for Firm pillows.  She managed to find them for me (got four brand new ones) and made sure the front desk knew to let me know regardless of the time I was checking in.

Allison (the manager ) and her staff are fantastic.  I've stayed at many Courtyards this year - but she & her team take the cake for service.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food at my breakfast as well being a non-meat eater (they managed to make some excellent tasting eggs).  

Would definitely be my first choice if I had to stay on the area again!

Text: The hotel is nice as far as lobby decor. The rooms are nothing special. The service checking in and out was good. Biggest downfall to this place is the lack of soundproofing.  You hear everything. I was startled awake throughout the night while people were talking loudly in the hallway and slamming their door shut. I know they can't control people's drunkenness, but I also don't want to be able to hear my neighbor pee.

Text: Very well kept hotel. Excellent desk staff and housekeeping. The bistro service needed some help. They didn't know basic drinks and there was only one person to do the bar and make food.

Text: Typical Marriott Courtyard experience (this is good). Quick check-in. The pool is cold but it’s always been for the 10 years I’ve been staying here :)
