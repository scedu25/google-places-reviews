Text: This place was cozy and very charming. We stayed in the cave room on the back of the property. This morning we had an incredible breakfast in the main house prepared by our host. The room has a gas fireplace, microwave, and mini refrigerator.  Best of all, it's just minutes from all the fun stuff Alton has to offer.

Text: This is a great place to stop. There is the main house, a renovated barn, and the cave. We stayed in the barn and it was beautiful. A loft bedroom, a great bathroom with a whirlpool tub, a 3 season room (with heating/cooling), and a deck. If you want to stay near but not in St. Louis, this is an amazing place that is cost effective. Perfect for a long weekend vacation. Highly highly recommend!
