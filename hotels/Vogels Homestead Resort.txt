Text: I absolutely love this place,a bit rustic yet serves the purpose. I've been down here for the past 25 yrs. It's what it is a cozy place to sleep before a long day of fishing.if you're expecting dinner mint's on your pillow then you're not a fisherman (move on)  the new owner's are awesome very informative and knowledgeable. Nice and affordable come stay with them but don't expect luxury. It's a fisherman's paradise. Nothing more an above the rest. Very happy camper.?????

Text: Its a bit run down but the new owners are doing a good job fixing it back up, if I found any problems they have it fixed right away or asked if we would perfur to wait till we were out fishing to fix the problem. Definatly nice atmosphere and a great place to stay if your staying several days.

Text: I have stayed here for years and won't stay anywhere else.  Tim, Louann and JD are very courteous, friendly and attentive to your needs.  The rooms are clean, neat and comfortable and the rates are very reasonable.  There is a pool for relaxation after a day of fishing or canoeing which they rent.  It is a half mile from the park and really convienient.  Highly recommended.

Text: I read these reviews and laugh. What kind of idiot gets a room by a river and thinks there shouldn't be bugs. How are the owners supposed to pull that off ? If I were the owner I would  get mad too. Meanwhile, great place !
