Text: Nice little place to live. It is fairly quiet, a lot of children most of whom have excellent manners. The property manager is absolutely amazing. Any time we have had an issue she has been very attentive and acted in a very timely manner. The only downside is lack of lighting along the road ways.

Text: Clean little mobile home park. The roads are like a rats maze if your not familiar with them.

Text: Dont buy a home here, management seems to try and underhand you. No security lights at night.

Text: This well kept 153-site community is located in Southern Illinois. Located near Rend Lake, which offers many lakeside sports activities. In cooperation with Mt. Vernon schools Oak Grove help with the "No Child Goes Unnoticed" program by feeding children in the community their lunches Monday and Friday through the summer. Additionally in cooperation with the Mt. Vernon Police Dept. we have a neighborhood watch.
