La Quinta Inn Moline Airport

Text: Stayed at this property last Saturday night and I cannot overstate what a great experience it was! The front desk staff at check-in and check-out were phenomenal - courteous and professional! I truly felt like a guest, not just another customer. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast equals what I have had at much more expensive places. The value here is exceptional! I will definitely be returning to this motel!!

Text: Stayed here last weekend.  The property appears to be well maintained; the staff we saw were all pleasant and friendly; the room was basic, but quite nice; and the room price was even better than reasonable.  No refrigerator or microwave in the room, but at that price we didn't expect it.  Amenities (fitness center, business center, pool, vending machines) are minimal, but are provided gratis.  Free WiFi and breakfast (not luxurious, but more varied than many chains) are also provided.  This is better-than-decent lodging with limited frills, but you're not staying at (or paying for!) the Ritz Carlton.  We would stay here again when in the Quad Cities.

Text: Very convenient to the Moline Airport and at a reasonable price. I would suggest staying away from Room 137. Anytime someone went out the back door it would slam shut. Also, note the pool is outdoor and closes in September. Overall, a cheap clean place to rest your head.

Text: Beds and desk were clean, however the bathroom was a little dirty, toothpaste in the sink dried and stuck on, and there were some hairs in the sink as well. The carpet looked like it had been a day or two since it had been vacuumed as well. Overall it was an ok stay, great price. There is a 24hr McDonald's next door which is good, and another restaurant on the other side that was closed when I got in at 11pm, and a gas station next to the McDonald's that was closed that late as well. I'd recommend staying here, especially for the price!

Text: Clean and bright bathrooms with fluffy, effective towels.  Excellent support and comfort from the beds and pillows. Free breakfast was great (minus meat) and offered 3am - 10am!!  Yogurt, cereal, muffins, hard boiled eggs; toast, waffles, biscuits and gravy. Staff was helpful and corteous. And did I mention how affordable??!  Yay!
