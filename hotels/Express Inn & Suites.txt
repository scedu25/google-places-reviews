Text: The website says this hotel is pet friendly, so we made a reservation a week in advance. When we arrived after a long drive we were told that only one room is pet friendly and it was occupied. 
Needless to say we were not happy

Text: It was under construction. The rooms were numbered in weird sequences. Cigarette burns on the tub. Coffee maker didn't work. There was no breakfast, not even any tables or chairs in the kitchen. Bed was hard, and the pillows were very tiny. T.v. would cut out for a few seconds every time something in the room clicked.

Text: Cheap, not that bad. Yeah, it looks like a demiliterized zone from the outside and the halls, but my room was ok. Well, both rooms since I had to switch since the electric lock failed on the first one. That did give me the opportunity to see an employee use a slim jim on my door to get it open. How many times have you seen that at a Hilton? Had breakfast, nothing great but it was something. Cheap and I guess call it a little adventure.

Text: Quiet location & friendly staff. Cleanliness is a MAJOR fail. Dirty floors, hair everywhere (bed, sink, bathroom).

Text: Hairs in the tub .... Pool and spa are " under repair" did not tell me this. Had to go find an employee and make them serve breakfast. Front desk employee was in his boxer briefs walking around the hotel our entire stay.........not acceptable. Pillows were old and compacted...... I do not recommend this hotel.
