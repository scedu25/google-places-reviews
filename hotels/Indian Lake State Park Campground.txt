Indian Lake State Park Campground

Text: Beautiful clean beach, nice large clean pool.  We had a big private spot at the end of section c.  Perfect weekend.   I recommend the Hunt brothers pizza across the street fro. Section c and the Donut Shop in town across from the Sandy Beach Bridge which is worth a trip to walk across all i  itself.   Walk around to the back of the yacht club to see the giant virgin Mary statue.

Text: This looks like a great place to visit or live. Lots of waterfront residential and recreational frontage. I considered for a second of flashback time to give the park only 4 stars because of the missing amusement park that closed in the 70's. But, it's not the park's fault. As a kid, I thought it was cool!

Text: How rude. Went on a Sunday day after 1 and wanted to drive through to check out campsite for a future stay.  Was told "not on the weekend". How are you supposed to know what the sites are like?  Won't be coming back here anytime soon!
