Text: Pets allowed! No bed bugs! Always available rooms. Price is okay. Service could be better. But if you're looking for a hotel in the area, I would stay here. It's old but clean.

Text: Place is a bit old a beat up but not too bad. Looked fairly clean,  beds didn't have any stains in the sheets or any signs of bugs that I could see and the carpet looked clean.  I did however find mouse droppings in the drawer of the night stand. Overall OK place to stay for the night but could use some renovation and deep cleaning especially in the bathroom where there were loose tiles and grungy walls and ceiling.

Text: For the money, one of the best places I have stayed. 
I fish a lot of small towns and therefore stay in a lot small hotels/motels. Hands down one of the cleanest, comfortable $40 a night rooms I have ever had.  The owner personally escorted us to our rooms and went out of his way to provide me with the needed power to charge my boat overnight (which you cannot find in other name brand Junction City hotels).
I now have a go to place in Junction City for me and my boat...

Text: For a $40 motel, I have absolutely no complaints! Very prompt staff and a clean room.

Text: Nice place to sleep, comfy beds, hot shower and a nice lady at the front desk. Only needs would be updated shower/sink and a breakfast provided of more than just prepackaged cinnamon rolls and muffins.
