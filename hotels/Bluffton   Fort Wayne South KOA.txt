Bluffton / Fort Wayne South KOA
Rating: 4
Text: Quiet although full. Lots of families and kids. Very nice. Park is flat as a board... don't have to worry much about leveling. Lanes are narrow but the sites are long and wide. Trees could use a pruning. There's a lot of hickory trees...that means big nuts that sound like bricks falling on the roof but they're harmless. We liked it and will use it again.

Text: Been told twice that they have a trailer for us.  2 trips, $240 in lost wages between my buddy and I (only because the office closes at 5:00) and 1 1/2 hours of wasted driving.  No trailer!  Left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.  This is after I passed a background check and credit report.  Piss poor excuse for management.  PERIOD
