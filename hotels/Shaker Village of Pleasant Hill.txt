Text: I took family photos for some friends at Shaker Village, then walked some of their trails. The location is beautiful in the fall, with winding paths, white slat fences, old-style buildings and very colorful autumn trees. It's awesome that these trails and scenic spaces are open and free to visit. I've also been to Shaker Village before for dinner and I've taken the boat ride down the Kentucky River. I recommend both - the dining can be expensive but is delicious and served in a unique atmosphere you won't really find elsewhere. The boat ride is a fantastic way to see wildlife and beautiful river scenes, including bridges you pass under. I've only been in the boat ride in the fall, but I suspect that's the best time for it because all the trees are turning different colors.

Text: I greatly enjoyed seeing the historic site with all of the buildings and furniture. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The cost of the tour was reasonable. My only disappointment was that a remodeling of the parts I had wanted to see the most was going on at the time so those areas were closed. I will have to go back again to see those parts. 
As an amateur furniture maker I have a special interest in their furniture and architecture. There was plenty of it to see and I was given special permission to enter restricted areas to photograph what I wanted to.

Text: Went for lunch with family and it is a nice atmosphere for sure. The food was good but not quite spectacular. Not too expensive. I had a catfish sandwich that was about $12. Service was good. No issues so I guess that's what you really want. Overall it was a pleasant time spent with family.

Text: We were there with a group of 40+ and were provided with a wonderful guide who was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer every question our group asked her. We were in one of the meeting houses built with excellent acoustics. Before we left that particular house, our group sang "Sweet, Sweet Spirit" and it was a marvelous experience! We had lunch there as well, down in a basement, and it was wonderful. Everything was immaculate and every person we encountered was so courteous and helpful. We didn't have enough time there and plan to return as soon as we can. It was so peaceful there and a true breath of fresh air. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone.

Text: I loved our stay here. The food was really wonderful and the hiking trails were great. If you love history and architecture, this is the perfect weekend getaway. Prices are affordable and there are a lot of offerings. I don't get what all the negative reviews on Facebook are about. I went in skeptical because of them but ended up having a really lovely time and felt so relaxed after. If you don't appreciate sociology, history, contemporary dining or architecture- maybe this isn't the spot for you.
