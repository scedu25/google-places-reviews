Holiday Inn Express & Suites Mattoon

Text: The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean but we were on the second floor and unfortunately we could easily hear people walking above us on the third floor. It was also unfortunate that the ice machine and Whirlpool were out of order. It was easy to get to off of the interstate and it was conveniently located near shops and restaurants. The breakfast was good and the eating area was nice and clean but unfortunately they did not have the pancake machine. All in all I would stay there again.
