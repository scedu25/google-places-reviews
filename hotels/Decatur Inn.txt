Decatur Inn

Text: Location is central to plenty of ff restaurants, and stores, price is low, service was friendly, comes with mini fridge, microwave, & free wifi. Aside from that, you don't exactly get what you pay for, even at the price. Floors were absolutely filthy, turning bare feet black, even after a shower. Water from faucet tasted horrid, both comforter & sheets had numerous cigarette burns in them, tiny supplies of bath products. I'm always very honest in my reviews, good or bad. I'd stay there again in a pinch, but not with enthusiasm.

Text: Had a room for two weeks my door didn't shut properly complained to the office was told i was a liar by the staff and had the cops called on me and my girlfriend because we shut our door a little hard by the neighbors we never had anyone here during our stay but when the cops showed up claim they had reports of us having heavy traffic. The motel just north of us would have been a better choice in my opinion. I highly do not recommend this place our toilet leaked the whole time its just a dump for crack heads and hookers. Unfortunately it will not let me undo my 1 star because it does not deserve that
