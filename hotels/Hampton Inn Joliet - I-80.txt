Text: Great place. Very friendly and helpful people. Breakfast was great and everything hot. Great choice if you are heading east and don't want to stay in Chicago.

Text: I recently stayed at the hotel for about a month; the staff was extremely accommodating in making the stay feel like home.  One staffer lent (without hesitation) his personal phone charger cord to me when mine stopped working.  I forgot a hat at the hotel when I left; the staff found the missing article and promptly mailed it back.  Great customer service!

Text: Nice staff, and the bed was comfortable. The air conditioner was very loud, especially when turning on. It woke me throughout the night. The carpet also felt oddly wet and greasy. The location was good for the work I had to do, but I will consider other nearby hotels if I need to be in that area again.

Text: The person behind the desk was very nice and the hotel was spotless. The rooms looked like any hotel room but they were very clean as well. I would definitely come back!
