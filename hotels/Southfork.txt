Southfork

Text: I have lived at Southfork for less than a year, and two General Managers have been fired. No reason why given. We bought a 10 year old home,  and it had a few problems, but the big issue with the home is the skirting has nothing to attach to. The wood has rotted away.  I talked to maintenance about what I could do to fix this, and I have never heard back for them.  The lawn which had very little grass growing in it when we move in and it has been my nightmare.  Trying to stop the erosion, our A/C unit is no longer level and needs repositioned.  I have seeded and raked to get it to grow and I have been fighting most of the season for them not to mow it and kill it.  They tell me the grass can't be longer than 4 inches, but baby grass needs to be 3 inches to live.  I am going to do my best to pay the home off, and move it or sell it.

Text: I was shown a model home and not the home that I was applying for. Their free rent is if you qualify.  I was told that I would know in two days and it has been two weeks. I had to put down a $35 application fee plus $100 deposit while they ran my application.
