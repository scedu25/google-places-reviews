Text: The AP Green B & B was a wonderful place for our sisters' weekend! The house is beautiful, clean, full of things to do, and our hosts were welcoming and accommodating!  Breakfast was amazing each morning---a wonderful quiche and light and fluffy waffles--delicious! The bedrooms, sitting rooms, as well as the entire home, is spacious and comfortable. We would definitely stay again!
