Text: It was a nice clean new hotel. The beds are very hard and the room was warm. We ac is computer controlled or something like that. The TV has some sort of light sensor. The TV would go from bright to dark often.  we did not have a very good stay. We spoke to the front desk about both issues they said it's part of how the hotel is set up.

Text: The hotel was just okay in appearance and comfort. Front desk person took 3 to 4 minutes to even greet us upon arrival. The room was clean. Unfortunately we came on a weekend when there was a storm and the hotel lost all power overnight in excessive heat and it was very warm without air conditioning or lights or TV. Check out his supposed to be at 12 pm. But when I was in the shower at 10 a.m., our door was opened by housekeeping. Likely would not stay here again.

Text: Got a 70% off deal on this hotel online. Would NEVER pay $149. The room was good with GREAT air conditioning. Nice and quiet. Appreciated the computer room. The only drawback was no breakfast

Text: Nice comfortable rooms. Conveniently located off the interstate, and near several restaurants. Onsite Starbucks for coffee and breakfast. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars was because our room was located near the lobby and lounge, so it was very noisy with guests hanging out past 11pm. But once we were asleep the room darkening curtains allowed us to ignore any hint the sun was out. We'd stay there again, but we'd request a room away from the lobby.

Text: This hotel was really nice, when we came to check in the lobby was full of people because of a power outage. The front desk clerk (a girl named Melissa) was doing everything she could to keep people happy and taken care of, I was very impressed with her attentiveness. The room I received not only looked nice but smelled good as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to travelers.
