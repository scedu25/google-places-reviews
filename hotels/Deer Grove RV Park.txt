Text: The Deer Grove RV Park was very nice neat clean organized bathrooms available. Reasonably priced for overnight stays. Comfortable and quiet except for an occasional train that went by about 4 times a day.

Text: Very nice little camp. There were a few folks staying long term working pipeline. Plenty of pull thru spaces for over nighters.  I stayed 4 days and really enjoyed how quiet it was. Staff was wonderful!  They stayed after hours to check me in since I was running late. Will definitely stay again.
