Text: Awesome hotel for the price. Mini fridge in the room and an actual TV. The basic room with king bed also has a small reclining chair and  decent sized Desk. No overhead light but the four lamps are fine (one on a wall switch). Room was clean and had no odors. I also liked the pictures from the local state park..

Text: My great-niece, sister and I stayed her for 2 night and three days. We had the best experience. The staff was wonderful and the room was clean, comfortable and made us all feel right at home. We will all stay there again!!!

Text: Decent sized room, good location, but other things were off. Barbara at check-in was very nice, but other staff was not friendly. WiFi never worked, and the toilet ran until we fixed it. Breakfast was okay, but very little room to eat.
