Text: I stayed at the Country Gazebo Inn for a couple of weeks in April of 2009.  The beds there were HORRIBLE!  I stayed in multiple rooms and they were literally lumpy.  I don't even know how that happens.  I guess if you are not picky and are looking for something cheap, this is an ok place to go- and the WiFi and quaint location are a plus.

Because a specific weekend was booked & I couldn't stay for that weekend, I left earlier than I would have otherwise.  The owner was rude at the end since I left sooner than I had planned on, as she said she wouldn't have given me the rate she did if she knew I wasn't staying a full 3 weeks.

Overall, not incredibly business-minded owner and somewhat uncomfortable accomodations.  Ok if you are looking for something rural, inexpensive, and don't have to stay long.  I would probably choose a hotel over this for a vacation, though, since the beds were so bad.
