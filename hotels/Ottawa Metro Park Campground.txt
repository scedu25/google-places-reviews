Ottawa Metro Park Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Our family had a wonderful stay at this camp grounds. The shower house/bathrooms were kept very clean. The campsites were well maintained. We loved the trails, biking paths, and disc golf. Our family will definitely use the Metro Park Camping facility again.

Text: Clean campground that is well layed out and all sites are paved. Sites are all spaced out to give you a lot of room to camp and have your own space. The bathrooms are always clean and tidy. Its also nice but not well known that if you want a campfire you need to buy a fire pass for $10. But with that pass they have a little shed by the camp host's camper full of wood with a wagon to haul it back and you can burn all the wood you want for the length of your stay for that $10. Which I think is a pretty good deal.

Text: Great for young families and those looking to be active. Bike path, Frisbee golf, fishing, swim area, playground, nice and clean shower house, water and electric at site.

Lacking one star because trees are young and lack shade.
