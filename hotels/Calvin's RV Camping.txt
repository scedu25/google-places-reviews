Calvin's RV Camping
Rating: 4
Text: The host is amazingly sweet. The sites are level, Site 16 has sewer connection on right side instead of traditional left. It does have a tight turn which may be difficult for larger rigs. The spots are large. This RV park is located very close to an industrial park area which includes trains which love to toot their horns.  Overall though, it is a good place.

Cell Metro PCS. 4G LTE with 4 bars.
Antenna gets about 7 usable channels.
Laundry on site. 
No credit cards accepted.
Paved pull thru sites. 
50 AMP full hookups.
Paid $27 for Friday night.

Text: The hostess was very nice. Be aware that the freight trains pass by and the horns and noise could be a problem if you are a light sleeper.

Text: We showed up after hours, looking for a place to plug in. Dave showed us where to park and told us to check on in the morning. Great place and nice price. They have concrete pads and easy hookups. 

Thanks for the hospitality.

Text: We tent camped here two nights. Loved that it was right near the cute downtown area of Wamego. However, the lights and occasional noise from the Caterpillar Equipment facility next door made it a little hard to sleep. Ear plugs helped a lot. Owner was friendly and clean bathroom and decent outdoor shower. Bring mosquito repellant. Good if you're looking for a cheap place to stay near the downtown, not if you're looking to be immersed in nature.
