Text: Busy stop over hotel when traveling across country. The breakfast was the typical HI breakfast, nothing  fancy but love those 1 minute pancakes. :) Our room was on the 1st floor with a jacuzzi tub and a kitchenette. The bed was comfortable but there was a bit of a musty smell in the room. The front desk staff was very accommodating.

Text: The location was perfect right off the turnpike. We got there late and the price was high, but the associate, Kendra, helped us to get a lower rate by offering us the ihg rewards program, so we saved $20. We loved the room, it was very clean, however the beds were very hard. Air conditioning worked perfectly, bathroom was very roomy, but the door would not stay open all the way and also wouldn't close all the way in room 202. The continental breakfast was well maintained with a variety to choose from. The pool and hot tub were also nice. Overall, we had a great experience.

Text: My in-laws have been staying here for years when they come to visit. The kids stay overnight and swim in the pool or workout in the exercise room. They always have a good time.

Text: Start with the negitives. Multiple stains on walls in room. Entry door sqeeked badly opening and closing. Bathroom door in room would not stay open and bathroom stunk. Pool had no towels both days of my stay and level seemed low. Now the positives.... Breakfast was good. Room had good decor and comfortable beds, and decent amentities.
