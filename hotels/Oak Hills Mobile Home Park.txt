Oak Hills Mobile Home Park
Rating: 4
Text: My family has felt welcome by the residents. Our lot is small but that is not the norm. Most lots are much bigger. It's quiet and scenic with a fishing lake and the Big Darby within walking distance. Really like it here!

Text: I have lived here for three years and have had no problems.  I am not one of their spyes or anything else.  I am just a resident that is happy to call this home.  I have never had a problem with Luke or Debbie.  They have both done what they have said they would do and always help me when I ask.  It is quiet here and it is a good community and a great place to live.

Text: I have lived here off and on for over 5 years  Luke and Debbie are very helpful and nice. When you think of trailer park you think of a trashy area. That is not the case in this at all i love our neighborhood/community everyone waives says hi even when they don't know each other. I love being out here.

Text: My family just moved in and we love it! Luke and Debbie have been incredibly helpful, considerate and informative. There have been a few hiccups, as expected with a new home, but any issues have been taken care of quickly and they really made it as stress free for us as possible. We really feel we made the best choice for our family to move here, we couldn't be more pleased with the hard work and excellent customer service, we've been treated with nothing but respect and we look forward to being here for a long time.
