Hampton Inn & Suites I-35/Mulvane
Rating: 4
Text: We stayed in the 1br King suite. It was a good sized suite. Bathroom was big enough for a Jacuzzi tub but it had a regular tub. It also had two shower heads, one being hand held. The hand held had virtually no stream at all and was truly embarrassing that they even thought to include it. The ventilation was poor. The little kitchenette had a full size fridge and a small microwave, kitchen sink, and a small table. The carpet seam where it met the tile in the kitchen, was freezing and had strings that were 4 inches long. It made the room look shabby. The furnishings were comfortable and rustic. The hotel is decorated in the cowboy theme. For the king suite and the price we paid for it, I did expect it to be in better shape.

Text: I have traveled extensively and this hotel is just WOW.  The Staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are super nice. Hard to believe this is a Hampton and not a Hilton.  I would highly recommend staying here. 5+ stars

Text: We really enjoyed our stay at your hotel.  We were there Thursday,  Aug. 31st, and checked out Monday, Sept. 3rd.  What I was very impressed with was the staff.  We were there for my uncles 100th birthday celebration.  Had a family reunion and everyone there was very helpful with whatever we needed.  The only complaint I have is the shower curtain smelled sour when we went in.   Thank you all for your service and kindness.

Text: Taking I-35 to/from Wichita includes a toll road. Hotel serves a casino, but we did not visit it. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and included a small fridge. We were unable to find any materials that explained hotel amenities, including pool hours. There is a small room for purchase of supplies that mostly includes snacks.

Text: The attendance were very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was one of the best that I have had in long time at other inns and suites. Would stay there again and recamend it to others.
