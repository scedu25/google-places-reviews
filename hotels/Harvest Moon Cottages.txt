Harvest Moon Cottages
Rating: 4
Text: Really liked this place.  We stayed in Peacepipe, a small but comfortable two-bedroom cottage.  What I liked most was the cabins are well spaced so you feel secluded (in a good way), plus acres of your own space to walk/hike--quite unlike many of the traditional camping places I have gone to.  Clean, modern and ready to relax in hot tube was a plus also.  The inside was clean and well decorated.  Only negatives was the outside of the cabin looked somewhat worn, with a mossy roof and holes in the wood eves that made a great home for the bees.  Could use some TLC here.

Text: This place is awesome! Close to everything you want to visit. Clean cabins with everything you need. For the price of a hotel room with no view, hot tub, grilling and nature. This is hands down the place to be!  We will be back to Harvest Moon for sure!!

Text: Our annual vacation cabin getaway until we can afford to buy one for ourselves... We love Peacepipe @ Harvest Moon Cottages.

This most recent vacation we decided to go a little more remote and rustic and stayed at their Creeksong cabin. The land around it is even more beautiful but the cabin definitely feels closer to roughing it with a wood burning stove and no dishwasher. We still loved it for a change though.

Text: Very nice large "cabin". Needs a stone pathway to the firepit for when the area is muddy. Lots of entertainment options. A lot of rules posted and video cameras all around. Feels like Big Brother is watching. Only provided 5 pieces of wood for multiple fireplaces and wood burning stoves for a whole weekend.
