Text: 5 star Front Desk Staff. Housekeeping not more than 2. We were there for 5 days and our room was never vaccumned. Four adults in the room, we had to ask for coffee, cups, and water (bottled) water every day, and then received 2. Towels plentiful. Refrigerators and microwaves in rooms. Restaurant so so.

Text: This hotel has been very good. The internet is great, which has been rare at the hotels I stay at. The service has been very helpful and friendly. The beds are comfy and room service does a good job cleaning the rooms. The hotel is kept pretty clean and the view from the 16th floor is beautiful. Only issues I noticed were inconsistencies in the rooms for our large group and a lack of vending machines.
