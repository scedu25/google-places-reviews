Text: These reviews have to be from the owners family. This place is horrible! Room did not look like the picture. Had 2 young boys with me and I was afraid to stay there. Walked into the room saw the lack of security and left  drove the rest of the way home rather than stay there. Safer to drive tired than to stay there

Text: Very comfortable stay, large room (1 queen, 2 twin beds), kitchenette. Shower was great! Would stay here again! No breakfast but for the price we can eat elsewhere. Also recommend eating at Izzy & Eddys.

Text: My wife and I stayed here while I was in town to preach in a Gospel Meeting for the Tipton church of Christ which meets at 622 West Jefferson Street. We arrived on a Saturday and left the following Thursday. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the service was excellent. We especially enjoyed the convenience of the kitchen in our room. The location of the inn is great as it afforded us opportunities to take some pleasant walks through the lovely town of Tipton.

Text: Clean sheets, warm shower and decent tv with plenty of channels,  but small musty smelling room.  Hard mattress and leaking toilet.

Text: Very very clean, the lady at the desk was very accommodating and went out of her way to make sure I had a good stay. When I pass back through I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
