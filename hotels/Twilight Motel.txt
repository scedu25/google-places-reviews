Twilight Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Decent place. Very old motel but comfortable. Best beds I've slept on in years. Limited cable on 19" box TV . We had a small bathroom but my daughter had a huge bathroom. We had a small closet, she had none.  $50 for a double can't be beat.

Text: Only got here this afternoon.  Parts are still under remodel. It's an old motel. Antique furniture. Our room has a small bathroom and shower, plus a small closet. My daughter's room has a big bathroom but no closet. Both rooms have mid size refrigerator  and small microwave. 19" box TV with limited cable.  All in all for $50 per night per double room it's well worth it. Bigger problem is 20 miles to Bowling Green. Just not much in Vandalia.

Text: This small 20 room motel is right on Hwy 54 in Vandalia, MO. It's under new ownership and in just a few short weeks I have noticed a number of changes included a cleaner and brighter property. The rooms are okay, nothing too fancy, but will suit your needs for some rest. Stop by - the owners are extremely nice small town people!
