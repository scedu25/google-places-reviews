Text: Pampered Pets is a great place to board your animal. We bring our dog here daily for daily daycare. All the staff is very attentive to the animals and take great care of the dog. It is well worth the cost to bring our animal here where we know she is well looked after. They have monthly events as well where you can get something hand made by your Dog! I also really like the fact that they have a rewards system so as you bring your animal here more, you can earn free stays or daycare.

Text: They do a great job grooming my great Pyrenees. The few times we have boarded our dogs here they were well taken care of.

Text: Never again will I take my dog there..We were taking him there since we adopted him a year ago..  Never had any problems but lately they have been rude..  When we  were not able to set an appointment we would take him in as a walk in for a bath around the same time of the day each time (3:30) a total of 3 times we did this..  and today they said they couldn't take him in anymore that it was late...  Smh we've been a loyal customer to them but as of today you lost us...

Text: Been coming to Pampered pets for several years. We have 3 dogs and 1cat. Our dogs are all rescues and have had difficulties boarding and being  away from us. The first few times we were uneasy on leaving them but after they got used to the place it has been wonderful. 2 of the 3 wouldn't eat while they were there. They  staff was so wonderful with them.  They took the time to hand feed Muffin and put extra canned food in for Milo.  Our cat requires medication and has always had great care with special play time. We are  very happy with our time that the animals have spent there.  Love this place!
