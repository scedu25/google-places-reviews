Text: My stay there a few months ago was greeted by weeks old Chinese take out and Lee's chicken in the Mini Fridge that was there when I arrived. And if my memory serves me right it wreaked of smoke. I would spend the extra couple bucks and go to the Comfort in across the road.

Text: The front desk was friendly and the room felt so clean. We've been traveling cross country and this was the first room that didn't feel like we were staying in a cheap hotel. The first one that had tissues & a blow dryer & the breakfast in the morning had a wide variety too! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone passing through!

Text: The hotel is in need of renovation. The bed spread was stained, there was a hand towel that was stained, found 2 quarters on the floor, quite a few things were dusty that shouldn't have been.
