Best Western Indian Oak
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean, staff was nice & helpful.  Lobby area is really pretty.  There is NOT an elevator, keep in mind if you can't do stairs.  Also, try not to have a room next to the stairwells, it sounds like elephants on parade (we assumed it was people dragging their luggage up/down the stairs). "Indoor pool" does not equal heated pool! Other than the noises on the stairs, the hotel was very quiet.

Text: Great place to stay. Good quality, excellent service, and great employees! Stayed only 2 nights but with the help of there employees they made it a very easy stay. Our front desk guy Alex made the trip one to remember, from pointing us to night time entertainment to giving us great places to eat. Also always had a smile and great personality and one of the most friendly people I have ever met. Thanks for the stay best western. Next time I come out to Indiana I will be staying here!

Text: We loved having a room on the pond side. Was able to do a little bird watching. The mallards come up to your door to be fed.  I do not feed the wild life because it is not a good thing to do. The hotels was great and the staff very friendly. Would stay there again. the beds were very comfortable..

Text: This place is awesome. Friendly staff, clean rooms very spacious. The lake side view was a surprise to us granted it was a small lake but nevertheless it was a nice scenery. It is perfectly located near restaurants and shops all within walking distance. Thank you for the wonderful experience.
