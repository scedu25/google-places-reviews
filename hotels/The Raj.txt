Text: I love the serene, peaceful atmosphere of this place. As one approaches it on its long drive, it looms  ahead like a shining white castle. We like to eat there on our way home from the Old Fashioned Thresher's Reunion in Mt. Pleasant. The restaurant is open to the public on Sunday but since we ate there on Monday, Labor Day, we had to reserve our meals, called a Karma Lunch. This year we were served a delicious Dal soup, then a veggie wrap served with rice and Collard Greens. Dessert was pineapple - mango pudding made with coconut milk, then we drank a digestive laffe made with basil, cumin, and yogurt. The laffe was a little strange but I'm sure our digestion was helped.?? The tables are set with cloth tablecloths, the dining room is bright and spacious, and the food was delicious, vegetarian and as organic as possible. The waitress was courteous and attentive. Probably not a place for young kids.
After the meal we took a walk around the spacious grounds. This place is an oasis in the middle of Iowa heartland.

Text: From the moment I arrived at The Raj I felt wrapped in a cocoon of love. Every member of the staff was delightful, helpful, kind, and happy.  My room was extremely comfortable and delightful. The entire building was extremely clean, comfortable and i felt quite at home. The food was delicious and nourishing, and served in such a happy and personal way. The Panchakarma treatment was simply divine.  I loved that there are organic/herbal tea & water stations all around the building. I can't wait until I have an opportunity to stay at the Raj again.
