Text: We had the opportunity to visit Prairie Haven Nudist Resort last Sunday, June 19,  2016.  We had been in Kansas City, MO for the previous week and had just a short time to visit your club.  We enjoyed ourselves very much. Your facilities are very nice, and the members are quite friendly and we had such a fun time.  We have found that nudists are universally friendly, and your club has continued to prove that. Thanks for allowing our visit.

Text: I love this place!  If you like being nude and being around friendly people, this is the place to be.  I have never felt so relaxed anywhere else than I have here.  It is a serene place, somewhere that you can enjoy the company of family and friends with lots of activities to participate in.  Or, if you just want to relax and socialize, head to the pool and swim or hit the hot tub or lay out in the sun to get a nice, all over tan.  All sizes, shapes, and ages are welcome.  I lost any feeling of being self conscious about my body within minutes of being there.  Everyone is accepting and friendly.

Text: Very nice, well run place. 

Make sure you come in to the club  (the last part) from the south, the road just north of club is not maintained. My GPS brought me in from the north.... It's not a very good road.
