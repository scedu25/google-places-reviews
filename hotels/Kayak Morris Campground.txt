Kayak Morris Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Beautiful LARGE primitive sites.  Sandy gravel base.  Quiet for a place so close to town.  Nice to watch barge traffic, and people seem to have a good time kayaking though we didn't do that.  Nice folks.

Text: Several kayak river options for all skill levels. 1 hr  drive from Chicago suburbs. Old school camping but very nice in spacious, shaded area with picnic table & camp fire. Be sure to bring  water if camping. Bike path and  boat launch nearby.

Text: I would give it 5 stars if they had running water, or at least somewhere to wash up! When I hear 'glamping' I definitely pictured a shower house. I think they make trailers that have a separate connection where you just fill the tank with water and empty it later. Or even a camping sink or two. I'm sure that's far cheaper than actually running water from the city. The porta-potties were actually the cleanest I've ever seen to the point the bleach ruined my pants! I don't care because they're camping pants :-)
We also misunderstood the website and thought our tent would get set up for us, apparently it's only if someone rents a tent. I really enjoyed the people and pot luck dinner, movie and breakfast. Thanks!

Text: Great spot near Chicago but the management is hectic. Not a party place, so great for families. Great rental prices for kayaks. Not 5 because of the registration process.

Text: It is ok at best unless you have small children and do the glamp they have a movie for the kids and cook.. Last couple of times I've stayed the owner wants to put us right in the front where you can see people from the state park walk up 10 feet of where you are could just go there for free and go home.. also the il river is busy and the peacock slough is being dredged and is partially private property the Mazon river confluence is across the river not great for beginners.
