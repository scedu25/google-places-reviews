Text: STAY AWAY!!! Terrible place with terrible customer service. Our room was mediocre at best. It was dirty and it smelled pretty bad. We tried to change rooms and  dealt with hostility. No one wants to do their job there and management, Neil is terrible and indifferent. You can tell how fake they are. We also had billing issues where we were billed twice. Never had an experience like this even in the worst of the worst hotels. We will never go back. STAY AWAY!!!

Text: This place is a dump! We got stuck here for the weekend when our work vehicle broke down. A moldy smell hits you in the face when you walk into the room. The door has a sticker for "non-smoking", but the bed sheets had burn marks in them and the shower curtain was stained yellow from tobacco. We actually had to turn the shower curtain because it was covered in mold. The towels looked very dirty with stains as well.
The room was just downright filthy.  Housekeeping woke us up at 7am the first morning there wanting us to leave. Good luck trying to understand what they're saying because they don't speak english and love to yell/argue right outside your room. My sinuses were messed up after being there. So if you're looking for a bargain, pass this place up, it's not worth your health!

Text: Just got here, put in the last building farthest from the office because it's supposed to be the pet section. The room appears clean to sight but, smells like a dog so it's obvious that they don't really clean the carpet and most don't bathe their dog. There's a microwave and dorm fridge, small flat screen, table and chair set, full length dresser and desk. It's a good size room.

Text: Good value. Clean, nice staff, room didn't smell bad or weird. Good for this tier of hotels. Best Knight's Inn I've stayed at.

Text: Nice hotel. Rooms have their own entrances from the outside. The rooms were well taken care of and clean. The only downside - the floors are raised and squeak when walking. Every time our kids tried to get out of bed we could hear the floor boards. The walls are very thin too, so I could hear the family in the room next to us come in at almost midnight. For those that are a light sleeper like myself, this may be an issue. Other than that it was a good price. No food options. However, there is a very busy coffee and bakery shop right next door that looked like it was worth checking out.
