Sonesta ES Suites Dublin
Rating: 5
Text: Loved this hotel.  Very quiet, clean and spacious room. I have stayed at other extended stay suites in the area before but this was by far the best location.  Fully stocked kitchen, comfortable bed, clean room.  Felt like you had a private apartment. We will definitely be back.  I highly recommend.

Text: Huge room with a full kitchen and in a good area. The free meals on week nights is a nice bonus. Very friendly and helpful staff.

Text: We've stayed at this hotel around eight times and have had pretty good experiences in the past. Not so much this time. We booked a double suite six months ago and when we checked in we were told the suites were sold out. They split our party into two, side by side rooms, which was fine. Until we got into our rooms. Both of them stunk of mold and mildew. So bad in fact that we bought candles and air fresheners to try and combat the smell. Our closet door wouldn't open because it was so swollen from water damage. The cold water in our bathroom sink didn't work and the kitchen sink wouldn't drain. I will say that the lobby was nice and the breakfast was pretty good. But all in all, I think this hotel is definitely going down hill.

Text: Very spacious, modern, and clean! I stayed in  a 2 bedroom suite. It had a full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a living room. It looked just like an apartment. There is also free breakfast in the morning and an outdoor pool. I would 100% stay here again if I'm ever in the area again.
