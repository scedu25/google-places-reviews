Trail City Bed & Breakfast

Text: My fiance and I stayed here a few weeks ago on our travel through, we just found it last minute and we are so thankful we did! We absolutely loved staying with Lori, the B&B was spotless and one of the best places we have ever stayed (and we have been to quite few B&B's).  The rooms were beautiful, the bathrooms were so nice!  And breakfast... Don't even get us started on the french toast!  So delicious, she makes her own bread for it!  AMAZING.  We actually got to meet a few folk of the town because we had a flat tire and the whole town is so helpful and kind!  Shout out to Wade who was definitely an MVP during our stay and stopped out of the goodness in his heart and helped us with our flat!!

Highly suggested, do yourself a favor and stay a night in Coolridge, KS!!

Text: The place is excellent. Located in a small town, has no outside traffic noise. It's very clean, has unique design, is charming. Breakfast is homemade 5/5 stars, proper portion. The owner is a very interesting person to talk to.  We definitely will stop there again.

Text: Wouldn't even know this place was here just driving through, but well worth the stop. Historic saloon turned B&B with modern but rustic look inside. Comfortable rooms/beds with cable TV and WiFi, and the best breakfast in the world!

Text: An amazing place to be sure. Stayed here on a cross country trip and this was by far the best place we stayed. Amazing rooms and beautiful interior, and the best french toast Ive ever eaten. Definitely worth it and I hope to pass through here again someday.
