Text: Horrible service! Paid for 2 weeks & they refuse to offer house cleaning.. Want you to pay for all visitors & have been digging through the garbage to see if there are any diapers in it to charge us more for kids being here. The lady is VERY rude & yells at customers. Ants get in here.. No heat & no locks on Windows. Our toilet barely flushes & when you tell them about it its because of us & we have to fix it ourselves or just deal with it. I will never come back here!!!

Text: Rate was different when we checked in. on the site it said $48 for 2 people but when we got there they said $55. Also the site said internet was free when we got there they said there was a $8 charge then when i looked at their business card it said free. We were there 2 days and didn't get any clean towels or bathroom tissue and didn't empty trash. room was clean when we checked in and one bed was comfortable. would stay one night again but not any longer that that.
