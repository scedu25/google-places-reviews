Text: This would have been a 5 star review if I did not feel cheated. We loved the place and the grandkids loved the place. However we were called as we were driving home and told we were being charged a $100 cleaning fee. They listed several reasons but we disagree and felt we cleaned it well before we left. They had expectations we were not aware of and were not told, nor were written in any of the information found in our cabin. So sad, because we would have gone back over and over.
