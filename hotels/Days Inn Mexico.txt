Days Inn Mexico

Text: This place is seriously disgusting. Hair all over the bathroom. Blankets are heavily stained and threadbare. Carpets need cleaned. Weird smell. Screen on window was falling off and had holes in it. Short ceilings. Dark and creepy. Door to the bathroom could not be closed. Door knob was falling off. Fan in bathroom didn't work. I should have slept in the car.

Text: My son being accepted to Missouri Military Academy brought me out to Mexico from Florida.  I am a repeat customer because facility is clean and well kept.  Also, the room entrances are interiorly accessed and a room key needed to enter building after dark.  The night's stay does include breakfast which adds to the value.

Text: Only as a last resort.  Dirty, threadbare.  Labeled no smoking and reeked of cigarette smoke.

Text: Only reason it got over one star is the exercise equipment was decent. Rest sucked.
