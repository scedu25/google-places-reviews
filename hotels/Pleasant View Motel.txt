Text: Virtually no amenities. Barely hot water. No refrigerator. No microwave. No coffee pot. No Wi-Fi. I found some big black hairs in my freshly made bed. Found some big toenail clippings under the bed. This place is a real treat!

Text: Price!  $50 cash and we got a room (#4) that we were told was recently redone.  The room was about 10x10 and seemed clean and fresh.  We found it cute and quaint.  It's not modern by an sense of the imagination but it worked for sleeping.  :)

Text: 100% GROSS 
My Fiancee & I had no-where to go, and everything we owned in our car. we were looking for a weekly/monthly rate after talking to the guy in the office we checked in to the only open room for 1 nite because only certain rooms are available for extended stays. It's a good thing too. we only took 1 bag of cloths & toiletries in the room  with us. there were bugs in the room, and bed-bugs too. I've never been so  grossed out by a place before. I stayed up all night itching, and spraying bug spray stuff. 
left that place by 6:30 am.. slept in the car for several week because we never been that desperate again.
