Text: The owner is the real deal. He does the best he can to make this place a little piece of heaven, and he’s doing a very good job at it. Not many places like this left, so I hope to go back!

Text: My horse was starved out, he dropped 200lbs in less than 6mo.  He started mugging people at the gate b/c he wasn't being fed.  Just an honest review, hate to see anyone else put their horse through such misery.  My sweet boy deserved much better care but didn't get it. If the same owner is there breeding Paints, beware many better places to board.
