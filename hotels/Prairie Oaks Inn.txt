Prairie Oaks Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Last year my family stayed at the Prairie Oaks Inn located in Sylvia, KS. The house was very interesting with it Arts and Crafts style details and the vintage and antique furnishings. The house was perfect for our Christmas party and for all of us to spend the night afterward. If you want to have a family gathering and Grandma's house just isn't big enough anymore I would suggest this location of Prairie Oaks Inn. If you are looking for a beautiful B&B and want to enjoy the beauties of nature Kansas has to offer, I would suggest the new log cabin that Prairie Oaks Inn offers in the country near Sylvia, KS.
