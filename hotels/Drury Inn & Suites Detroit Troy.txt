Drury Inn & Suites Detroit Troy
Rating: 5
Text: I stay here whenever I am in Troy. It is a nice place with mostly friendly staff. There is a complimentary shuttle service too. I like the large rooms with its firm beds and pillows. Hotel has a DIY laundry too which is helpful during extended stays and even when town hopping. Breakfast is fresh and hot though the menu is the same over the years. Evening snacks are good and hot. In whole, a good place and recommended for all type of travelers. I like this place.

Text: Excellent service from all staff and management at this Drury Inn location. We were upgraded to a suite without asking, which gave us extra room, so it was much appreciated. The 5:30 pm kickback promotion included a great array of food to suit everyone's taste. Also included was a complimentary drink. Our bed was comfortable and we felt safe in the hotel. The morning breakfast offering was plentiful and we thoroughly enjoyed the food and beverages. All in all, a very pleasant stay in an affordable, clean hotel with a great staff that are eager to please. We will be back! Thank you Drury Inn Troy, Michigan!!!

Text: We have stayed at two other Drury inn  and liked them so much that we look for them when we are traveling but this one in Troy Michigan was just not as nice. The first room we were given smelled horribly of cigarettes so we changed rooms and they were very pleasant about it. The rooms were very small compared to previous Drury inns and the bathtub looked old and worn although it seemed very clean.

Text: Nice hotel. Clean & well kept. The staff was kind & helpful. The kick back was lacking in comparison to other locations in other states but not a deal-breaker. We enjoyed our stay & would do it again.
