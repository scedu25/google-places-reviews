High Knob Campground

Text: We had an awesome experience here! Beautiful, with many well marked trails, reasonably priced campsites with hookups and welcoming coffee  each morning. Looking forward to going back in the spring.

Text: The riding is pretty but not worth dealing with the owner. Incredibly rude and not accommodating at all. New people staying there be warned. You are either in with the owner or not. If you are not, prepared to be treated as you are always wrong and dumb. 
Will NEVER stay there again. There is much better riding and campgrounds around that are friendly and will help fill any needs. 
High knob campground is horrible and nothing can be done or said to change my view on that.

Text: I have camped at High Knob quite a few times over the past 10+ years. I absolutely love it there. The riding is fantastic with many trail head to ride out on to see something new every day. The camp owner is wonderful and does all she can to make your stay as fun as she can.
