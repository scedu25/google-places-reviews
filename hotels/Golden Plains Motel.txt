Text: This is a great spot. I stay here frequently during pheasant season (usually stay here for Christmas). It's clean, staff is great and its close to the WIA properties (a few are less than a 10 minute drive away). Dog friendly. Great spot for hunters coming from the Front Range.

Text: Best motel I have stayed at. I have stayed in 5 star hotels and not experienced such amazing customer service!!  The owners are top notch in my book and I will be staying here every time I'm through Holyoke!!! Wish I could give it 10 stars. I arrived late on a Tuesday night and I drive an 18 wheeler making it hard to get around town so the owners went to subway and picked me up dinner to make sure I was able to eat and relax. I can't say enough good about this motel!!!!
