Lucky Clover Resort LLC
Rating: 4
Text: Smaller and much QUIETER than other local resorts.  The lake attracts birds and other wildlife, and fishing is always available.  Floating is available as well.  If you are looking for a peaceful, relaxing camping hideaway Lucky Clover is it. ?

Text: i came in the off  season to be shuttled up stream and paddle to my car. the most economically priced in the area, the owner himself has done this for me four times now and i have stayed with them twice, the water was so high we could not get on the water but the lake provided fun. on the lake they have several canoes and john boats to paddle around on the water with. on my way there right now too 6/9

Text: The pool and front grounds were nice.  There is NO bathhouse.  The staff knew very little about the area, gave us wrong info several times...  Do not plan on staying here again.
