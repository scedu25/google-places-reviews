Cincinnati Marriott at RiverCenter
Rating: 5
Text: Right on the river overlooking both the Great American Ballpark and Bengals stadium. The restaurant on the main floor has an AWESOME Old Fashioned that they make with a locally sourced bourbon if I remember correctly. Plus the outdoor veranda seating area had BEAUTIFUL views of the river. Rooms were clean and orderly. Beds are comfy. Very nice hotel.

Text: Thank you Marriott Rivercenter, for our wedding guest hotel blocking!  Marriott was so accommodating and welcoming, throughout this process.  The lobby is absolutely beautiful and was our backup location for wedding photographs, if it rained.  Luckily, it was sunny that day, but it gave me such peace of mind to have this option. Their customer service is absolutely the best!  Thank you again, for such a great experience!

Text: I was here for a seminar and did not stay in a room. The meeting room was very comfortable. The power strips were set up well. The lunch that was served was top notch, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. One thing that was confusing was that the desk staff told me to go to 'room 2' but the sign on the door was labelled 'room 111' or something like that. Otherwise, this was a great experience, and I'd recommend it.

Text: Easy one night stay. Check in process was smooth, location was great and close to the water. Room was suitable. Bathrooms were clean and shower pressure was acceptable. Will stay again when given the option.

Text: This was a spectacular hotel. The staff was spectacular, genuine, and helpful. The hotel itself was beautiful and located just on the river. Our room was on the 9th floor and had spectacular views of the river and the bridges. Room was clean and well maintained. Some of the finishes were a tad dated, but still looked decent. Bed was fairly comfortable and covered in soft, fluffy pillows.
