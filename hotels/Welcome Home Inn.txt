Text: The Welcome Home Inn is gem hidden in Delaware, Ohio. Forrest and Brenda make you feel right at home the moment you step on the beautiful landscaped property. The home is straight out of a magazine. The food and cookies are beyond wonderful. 
You can see their heart for blessing and serving the moment you say hello. When your done with your stay you will leave better than when you arrived. I'm blessed to have met them and hope to see them often.
