Text: First, the most important part of the review:  This place is fabulous.

My wife and I recently made an impromptu 2-night stopover in Winterset during a recent road trip, and stumbled across this bed and breakfast primarily because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews on various travel sites.  And, all of those reviews are spot on.

Steve and Nancy have renovated a church into a understated, farmhouse-style bed and breakfast just 2 blocks from the town square of Winterset.  The accommodations are quiet, spotless, comfortable, and generously-sized.  Steve’s home-cooked breakfast is simply enormous.  There is no excuse for leaving his table hungry.  Steve and Nancy are both friendly, gracious, and accommodating hosts.  

What more can you ask for?  I can honestly give this location a five star review with no caveats.  You can’t go wrong here.  It’s that well run.

Steve, Nancy, we enjoyed our brief stay with you and loved hearing your anecdotes from your life experiences.  Best wishes for your future success.
