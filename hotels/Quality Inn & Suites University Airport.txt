Text: Great price for the proximity to Louisville! I greatly enjoyed what came with the room (the Jacuzzi bathtub, free shows on-demand, and even a small kitchen!). Would definitely consider staying here again if I ever come back to the area!

Text: The young man at the front desk was extraordinarily nice, courteous and helpful. He even printed out directions and added some information about how to get to Robley Rex VA Hospital.  I ordered dinner to be delivered and he offered me a few menus to choose from.  He is, by far, the MOST congenial, thoughtful person I have met behind a front desk.  I don't know how much money he makes , but Quality In should give him a raise to entice him to keep working at their Inn.

Text: This location is located near the Ky. Fairground.  The only issue is getting off interstate and having to make several turns to get to the Hotel.  We did not have any problems after we arrived.
