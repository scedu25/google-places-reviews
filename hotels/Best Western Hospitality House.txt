Text: Personally, I had a good experience and liked the location for our group conference. Although there had been a problem with the reservations and a few had been lost, I did not experience any personal inconvenience. However, a few of our guests had to either check out, and re-check back in, or others had to stay at a different establishment at nearby location (down the street). The banquet services and food were good. The staff was friendly, apologetic for our situation that was beyond their control. The inclusive breakfast was good food, and breakfast service was great.

Text: Friendly, helpful staff. Room was good except for shampoo/conditioner looked to have been used previously and didn't match each other.  Bed was not that comfortable. Parking was right in front of my door which was nice. Area was quiet the night I was there. Breakfast was good. Good coffee and friendly staff in restaurant.

Text: Just arrived, this isn’t a very fancy hotel but it is clean and comfortable. Nice and well kept and the rooms are in very good condition. The desk person was very nice and helpful.
I would definitely stay here again but will bring swim trunks next time for the nice indoor pool.

Text: very aged facility with exterior entrance to most rooms.  Facilities for conference are marginal, and would have to be a group of smaller than 50.  Nothing appears to be "modern" in conference set-up, and little room for any small groups.  Rooms were OK, internet was fine, pool area is very nice.
