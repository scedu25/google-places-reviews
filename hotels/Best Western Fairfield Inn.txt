Text: This hotel is on desperate need of some TLC. That is the inside of our air conditioner. I'm getting sick from breathing the air coming out of it. We turned it off & opened our hotel door into the hall out of desperation. Honestly, it's dangerous to any guest allergic to mold.The downstairs hall smells like there's some sort of plumbing issue.... ? Stayed here for a few days about a year ago, & had a better experience. Hopefully these guys will address what needs to be taken care of. It's the only major hotel in Fairfield.

Text: Very friendly staff, clean room. Water pressure was fantastic! Strong A/C during the heatwave. Ample breakfast-eggs, sausage, and the coolest pancake machine!

Text: The Best Western is my home away from home in Fairfield, Iowa.  It is always quiet and the rooms are extremely comfortable.  The beds are cushy without being too soft or too hard.  With in-room fridges, microwaves, irons, ironing boards,  and cable TV, it provides nearly all the comforts of home.  It is conveniently located on Burlington Avenue so driving to stores or the MUM campus is quick.
