Comfort Inn Cleveland Airport

Text: I stayed at this hotel 2 nights and found it to be totally comfortable. It was near reasonably priced eating places. The shuttle was available so I could use rapid transit each day. The staff were friendly and always available for suggestions and answers. Wifi always worked. I would stay here in a heart beat.

Text: clean room. happy staff. good price. only thing i didn't like was the inability to pay cash without a $200 deposit in case i damage the room. there was a $25 deposit for the same thing if i paid with credit card. i wish i had been aware of this so i could have planned accordingly.

Text: This has been a great hotel and I would stay here again. Room was clean, breakfast was good, and staff is very nice. I ended up having to change my reservations before my vacation and I'm actually glad I did. This hotel will be my go to when I'm in Cleveland.

Text: Hotel cancelled my reservation when we asked to change dates and then charged us.  Front desk agents were rude from start to end.  Room was cramped.  Door was broken.  Was told we had a renovated room but the wall was painted and the floor had new tile everything else was old. Everything squeaked and creaked.  The caulking around items was either yellow and cracked or missing.  Every encounter with the hotel staff was like I was stopping them from socializing and they just wanted me to go away.   But I'm sorry I need to check in.  And when I couldn't get into my room because the renovated door handle is falling off.  They offer absolutely no sympathy or guest service.  The only nice person I encountered the whole time was the manager.  Also over heard someone complaining about bed bugs.  I checked my room but didn't see any.  Good luck if you book here.  Wish I never did.

Text: We arrived at the hotel and at check-in, I discovered that the accessible room was for hearing disability not physically handicap as I had thought. The attendant switched us to a room that was wheelchair accessible, and sent us a bathtub safety chair. We had a pleasant night and felt well rested in the morning. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. Breakfast could have been somewhat better. The waffles were a little too hard. The fried eggs looked good but we're a little rubbery. There was sausage gravy, but I didn't get to try it because the biscuits were gone and not replaced. The coffee, tea and hot water for the oatmeal are too far away from the rest of the breakfast area for breakfast purposes. The coffee and tea is meant to be there 24/7 which is why they are where they are, but for someone with a disability it was too much separated. So, while we enjoyed our stay, we see room for improvement.
