Waterloo Sportsman's Club

Text: Interesting that some reviews have no written explanation for their less than 5 stars? My family, all 8 of us, really enjoy this club and consider it a blessing for a number of reasons. We love to camp first of all, and the camping is very reasonable. They have temperature controlled shower houses and bathrooms. They have ice available by the bag, reasonably priced and on site. They also sell fire wood by the rack (when available) very reasonably priced. The fishing in the 4 LAKES (3 open to all, 1 open to kids only!) is EXCELLENT, bass, catfish, crappie, bluegill, and walleye. Lakes are stocked regularly, and fish counts are tracked based on what is harvested. There is a trap/skeet range. The annual fish fry's are rated among the best in the area. I DISAGREE that the portions are small. In fact, you get a lot for the cost, and cheap beer! :) Among all the great activities going on here, there are plans to expand for additional recreational activities. What most folks don't realize is that ALL of the work, planning, building, etc for all activities are done by the work of volunteer members aside from care-taking! Before leaving a review with no text, consider that. Good people, good food, good fishing, good camping, and just a great place to go relax 5 minutes from home if you live in Waterloo!
