Text: Its not new.....but only 40...i guess u get what u pay for. No AC....thats a killer. Sat for a minute thinking about leaving.....but its late....and next hotel is too far. Room smelled like a cat lived here....half a bottle of ozium and frebreeze wont kill it....
   I gave one extra star because the lady who checked me in....tried her best...and she showed me the room and i didnt speak up.
    Was to tired.....if u can push on....i would.
Unfortunately....when i moved my pillow i saw a bug....may of been a tick....but i packed up and was out.....
   When i explained to the couple running it....they felt bad....i told them i didnt want my money back....I'm just checking out.
    They offered me another room......but i don't think it would of been better.
    The mattress in this place was very very old. First time in years i have seen a tube tv work......to bad the chair isn't in front of it....its next to it.
   Bugs drop it back 2...1 star.
