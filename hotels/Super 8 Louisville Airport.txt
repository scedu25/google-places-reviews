Text: Dump, dirty, hole in BR door, tv didn't work and people having sex in car in back lot at 11 AM when we checked out to go to a different hotel. You get what you pay for. Red Roof Inn much better and low price.

Text: Recently remodeled rooms. New furniture and tv. Nice bathrooms. Our room didn't have a microwave. Not sure if standard or not. Will stay there again

Text: The room smelled like icy-hot, strangely. The smoke alarm was disconnected, and a housekeeper walked into the room once without knocking the day I checked it. The room was pretty clean and wasn't the worst place I've stayed at

Text: I was honestly afraid to stay here after reading all of the negative reviews. However, we have had a decent stay. The staff have been thorough and efficient, the room has been kept clean and supplied, and the hotel is easy to access. The continental breakfast is standard. The hotel has been refurbished but shows signs of age, most notably the scent of stale or stagnant water. I haven't seen or heard any disturbances from undesirable visitors. However, you can hear the elevator, ice machine, and doors slamming.
