Text: Possibly the best hotel experience we've ever had! Exceptionally clean, staff friendly and helpful and rooms were spotless! Cherokee was our housekeeper during our stay and she was a bundle of happiness! Made us very comfortable to be away from home! Thank you!!

Text: A very beautiful and clean hotel. The rooms were the nicest I have seen in a hotel. Clean and the interior design of the entire place was simply beautiful! Helpful and friendly staff. excellent service. valet parking. Located within walking distance of the convention center in Columbus. Has a high class atmosphere. This hotel is among the best I have ever stayed in. Would definitely recommend.

Text: It was a beautiful hotel and very clean. The staff was very friendly also. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that parking isn't free for guests and there's no hot breakfast included.

Text: Staff has been very accommodating. The housekeeping service has been very delayed however. Rooms are nice. Breakfast is not included with the room, but if you have executive lounge access you can get a small continental breakfast.

Text: The staff are very friendly and work to at least give you a perk if something went wrong. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms and facilities are beautiful. There is so much nice artwork.
