Green Acre Motel

Text: Room entirely to small for the queen size bed. One would need to climb in from the foot. The price is too high for what you get. Being the only motel in town they can charge what they want.?

Text: I loved this place so much. Inexpensive, clean, so comfortable. Great TV. Plus, best of all, I could keep an eye on my brand new motorcycle in the back of my truck as I slept. Not that anything would ever happen in Rockwell City. Furniture was probably from the 1950s, but that's just what I grew up with. Too bad the new highway took a lot of business away from you guys, but I will always remember that night in March, 2009 when I had no idea where I was going to sleep that night as I travelled west across Iowa. Couldn't have loved it more! A posh hotel in Las Vegas or N.Y.C. or Europe isn't as good as staying here!

Text: BED BUGS!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!! BED BUGS!!! 
When the issue was reported on 7/15/17 to the owner (multiple rooms booked because of a family reunion) it was VERY evident that they knew about the problem already and it wasn't even an issue for them and he picked up large bugs with his bare hands then proceeding in and out of the office as well as other rooms! ? OMG when checking your room don't forget to flip the box spring. 
It was reported to the local police and the county sheriff office. This place has sooooo many code violations and they are ALL HEALTH SAFETY VIOLATIONS! 
This 'motel' needs Condemned & Owners Criminally Charged. I'm saddened to know how many people have been charged $ to be deliberately exposed.
