Riverside Estates

Text: I enjoy the park, but the management cut down our tree without notice, for no reason. Kind of disappointing as it was a great shade tree!

Text: Nice place to live but check out manager and then go to the court house and request the owners information. It's open to the public, but you won't get it from the manager.

Text: Tim and Melissa were the best and sweetest landowners I ever had. Riverside is a friendly atmosphere, nice-looking, well-kept trailer park, and best of all...the utilities and rent are very affordable. Even though my 3 kids have their own rooms now, they still say they miss living at the trailer! Wamego is considered a small town, yet it sure has it goin' on when it comes to family events, activities, a wonderful school district, and much more. Riverside Estates was an excellent place to call home and I highly recommend it to anyone :)
