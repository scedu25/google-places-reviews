COLDWATER RANCH

Text: Beautiful ranch, nice clean cabins and stalls, friendly people. Kathy is an amazing cook if you decide to purchase meals. After a long day of riding she made an awesome home cooked meal for us that hit the spot. Riding is beautiful, but if you are a novice or unfamiliar with the area you may want to pay for a guide as the trails aren't well marked. Bring your GPS and camera!!

Text: We purchased a gift certificate at a silent auction (it was a fundraiser) for "one free night cabin stay" at Cold Water Ranch in Eminence, MO. After reviewing the website, picking which cabin would be best and figuring out how much it would cost per person (we were bringing extra couples with us), I called to book the cabin and was informed that I could only use my "gift certificate" if I booked the cabin for two nights. I explained that not only did the gift certificate not state that, I would be due to deliver my baby in 4 weeks and driving 7 hours to stay at their cabins so two nights wasn't an option for us or the other couples coming with us. The lady I spoke (fairly certain it was the owner) with was rude, not helpful and frankly didn't care nor was she even apologetic. After getting off the phone with her, I emailed her and re-explained my situation hoping it was more clear and attached a picture of the gift certificate giving her another chance to honor it to which I got zero reply, which I consider to be more rude than a simple no. I'm originally from the area and have stayed several other places in the area, it's a gorgeous area with a lot to offer so basically, I would recommend anywhere but here. Grant it they wouldn't have got much revenue from us that stay and my silent auction donation still went to a good cause but they did lose future business with us and disappointed a hormonal pregnant lady really looking forward to a trip home, introducing the area to friends and a last getaway before the baby. I was required to put at least one star but that's more than they deserve. Two thumbs down to say the least.

Text: Never has a web site been more decieving.  The lake as the website says is stocked with catfish and bluegill well it was eight years ago.  And the lake is a stagnic pond. It is so over grown it isn't funny.  If your going for horse riding I guess you would be happy.  But I told her I was there for fishing and it is not handicapped friendly at all.  So i won't go back.  And she even went to say if her dog happened into our cabin we would be charged a fee.  And she gives no refunds.
