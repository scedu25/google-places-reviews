Text: Extremely clean. My husband & I just stayed there this weekend. The owners & his staff were very friendly. And wanted to make sure we had everything we needed & were happy. Quiet & very peaceful stay. Very good rate. Good breakfast. Will deffinately be coming lots of weekends this Summer for our fishing trips.

Text: It was great, especially for the price. Far better than a lot of the $100 per night range hotels I've stayed at. Everything was clean and the rooms seemed recently updated. The only complaints I would have is that the breakfast was a bit skimpy and the AC was fairly loud, but a necessary evil. I would definitely recommend.
