Text: The motel is still undergoing some renovations which seems to be going well.  Our rooms were as expected and the tub, toilet and sink and flooring looked very new.  Staff was very helpful at check in and later.  Good value.

Text: Highly recommended! Clean, quiet rooms. Very helpful staff! Great breakfast WAY past the usual Danish - full setup with waffle station, biscuits and gravy, cereal, yogurt, juices, milk. The staff even nicely corralled one of my toddlers when she got away from me... Quick and easy for AMA, Ball State, or other Muncie events!

Text: Out of all the hotels around ball state. I would recommend the baymont inn. They have the friendliest staff. Rooms are clean and prices is unbeatable. And the inside pool is a plus.

Text: Hotel seems to be in the process of some renovations. Pool heater was not working. The door to get outside gave us some issues when we opened it- a screw just fell out of the top hinge and looked about ready to break. We got locked out of our room when the safety lock somehow closed. Thankfully the front desk person had maintenance on call and was able to get us into our room even though it was very late. 

Our room was very outdated. Old heating and cooling. Old bathroom. Tub didn't drain properly and we there were wet towels in the bathroom when we arrived. Trash was also not taken care of from previous guest. 

All around disappointed in the quality of stay given the price we paid.

Text: Was not very clean. Our door licked from the inside with everything of ours inside took hours to get back into our stuff. Wifi did not work. Bed sheet dirty would not come back.
