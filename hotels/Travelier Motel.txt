Travelier Motel
Rating: 4
Text: So far a nice motel. Friendly staff,spacious room. The mattress and tv could be better but for the value it is hard to complain. If they fix the potholes in the back I would give them a better rating.

Text: I stay at Travelier Motel every time I visit Fulton, MO. They are always kind and very welcoming. The motel features a very nice back patio, laundry room and game table. The front,  upper rooms are decorated with different themes. Their location is closely accessible to everything around town.

Text: Need a great place to stay that's close to Jefferson City? This is it! Our room is nicely updated and clean. The staff is very nice and helpful. Lots of great restaurants in the nearby Brick District.  The beds could be better, but I'll still recommend staying here.
