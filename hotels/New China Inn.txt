Text: I've been going here for over 15 years and I've never had a bad experience. You might find that hard to believe but it's true. There has never been an issue with food or service. The staff works hard and I hope people understand that food to order takes time. Also remember that you're ordering Chinese food in KANSAS. So unless you've had anything close to authentic Chinese cuisine, please enlighten me on what it's supposed to taste like. This is as good as Americanized Chinese food as you'll find and I love it.

Text: Got orange chicken and sesame chicken, tasted like kids cough syrup. As far from authentic chinese food as the little microwave boxes at Wal-Mart only they are at least edible. Would not recommend.
