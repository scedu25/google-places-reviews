Super 8 Rolla

Text: This Super8 truly put the SUPER out front for me! The Front Desk attendants - Karen@Joe- made this two-day-get-away a blessing and doubled my enjoyment! The hotel itself has a great atmosphere, continental breakfast with the real waffle experience, a nice pool for a quick dip and even the room attendee is most respectful and ready to help in any way! Thanks for a great stay! ?

Text: My sister and I stayed one night at this Motel on August 22, 2017 based on the reviews I read. We were very happy with our decision and found the room to be very comfortable and clean. They offered all the services we needed plus others.  I thought the price was well worth the whole package and would definitely stay there again. The front desk staff were polite and very capable.  The morning desk staff person went out of his way to help me find a store where I could buy something I forgot to pack for my trip.

Text: It was okay and thats about it. The room itself was pretty clean but there seemed to be damage on the walls all over the room. Room also had a faint smell of cigarette smoke even though it is a smoke free room. Cant comment on the breakfasr because we didn't have it. Overall its just okay. I have been in worse and i have been in better.

Text: The staff was very pleasant and the place appeared clean. I was traveling with a group. Out off 6 rooms, only one was fine. The complaints were toilet wouldn't flush, filthy Jacuzzi, shower didn't work, spiders in room, foul odor, LOUD noises overhead all night.
