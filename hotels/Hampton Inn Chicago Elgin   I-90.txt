Hampton Inn Chicago Elgin / I-90

Text: We had a great two night stay. The free breakfast was a good perk in the mornings, definitely a large variety of food & waffle station toppings! Room was small and the carpet seemed wet but we were there to sleep. Beds were comfortable and staff was very helpful. Will be returning on our next trip!

Text: The room was clean and spacious. Staff were very nice. The mini fridge in the room was convenient. Breakfast was warm and delicious. Fresh coffee in the lobby was also very nice. Items in vending machine are at a fair price which is nice if you want a snack.

Text: Stopped here for a quick night's sleep on a road trip. Easy to get to from the highway. It was dark when we got there, and I would have appreciated their parking lot being a bit more well lit. Room was just fine, breakfast was good. They even have to go baggie breakfasts for people in a hurry, love that! Overall a good budget hotel.

Text: Clean room, decent bed, better breakfast than expected. Good value. Obviously it isn't a pricey upscale hotel. If you just need a place to sleep for the night and a hot shower, look no further.

Text: Great staff, breakfast, and clean rooms. All of these things are needed in a good hotel. The only downside 8s that they do not have a restaurant; however, there is one just a few blocks - Bennigans. Worthy of the price and visit.
