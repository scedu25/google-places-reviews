Text: stayed back in june it was cheaper then the other place around hamburg. 2. for being a motel/inn instead of hotel its one of the nice ones i seen/been in threw the U.S. 3. looked like the were renting out rooms for some people to live in and i think its better there then on the streets or somewhere worse.
