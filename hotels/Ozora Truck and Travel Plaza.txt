Text: Great food!
The food and service were good.  The burger tasted like it was fresh off the grill.  They had ribs, chicken and spaghetti along with vegetables.  The gas station doesn't look like much but we were able to get everything we needed along with a great meal!

Text: A great little old school truck stop, lots of parking, a hot food case full of fresh comfort food, dine in or out. Place could use a remodel but dont let that scare you away, places like this are disappearing across America, I will definitely be back ? was going to give four stars...but the food was just too damn good.

Text: Food was way over priced.. Ended up going to a fast-food place and got a meal for the same price.
Bathroom was disgusting.
And the only reason it's getting 2 stars is because the workers were super friendly.
