Embassy Suites by Hilton Kansas City International Airport

Text: Was there for an all day business conference. Lunch was very good, however the actual conference room was unbelievably cold! People were wearing their coats and stocking caps. The staff brought in 2 small space heaters as if that would help. Couldn't wait to leave, go outside in the snow and warm up.

Text: Nice, clean rooms.  The staff was very friendly and helpful for the most part.  Decent selection of beer and ordering food at the lobby bar was a breeze and super fast.  We had our food within 10 minutes every time.  The food was pretty good too.

Text: This hotel is extremely outdated.  The interior of the room was extremely depressing.  The A/C was so loud I wouldn't have been able to sleep without earplugs.  The carpet was very worn and looked like it had remnants of gum in one spot.  Some of the staff at the front desk looked very dirty like they hadn't showered in days.  Was very disappointed and surprised that this is an Embassy Suites hotel.  Will never go back.  PLEASE update this hotel and hire more professional front desk staff.

Text: The hotel is very nice and guest services will be done over backwards to please. From the manager's "happy hour" reception to the made to order hot breakfast station the staff certainly makes you feel like they are happy to be serving you. The only downside is the property is starting to show it's age. While in good repair everything is beginning to look like it has seen better days.
