Text: Would go there again! Wonderful owners! Well kept park as well as very clean showers/bathroom & also laundry room. Now it is one of my favorite RV Parks. Kids will like it there cuz they have mini golf & swimming pool.

Text: Super friendly just like southern hospitality.  All kinds of activities just on this property.  Clean and well maintained. Overnight stay should have been longer.  Highly recommended .
