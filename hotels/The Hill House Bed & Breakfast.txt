Text: Long road trip with the plan to do the bourbon tours. Decided on the The Hill Top house because of a recommendation, now it's my turn to recommend this lovely home and the owner Lisa. Came in Late and settled in quickly, Lisa sent us to The County Seat for dinner, a must visit, a must return and I'll be visiting their site to give a yelp review! 

Great breakfast, the other guests quickly became friends, close to the distilleries,
Lisa is great, and knows what she is doing.

We'll be back! Mary and Dan
