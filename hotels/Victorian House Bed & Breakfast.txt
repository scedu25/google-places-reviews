Victorian House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: A beautifully decorated Victorian home. Stayed in the Scarlett Room which was outstanding with a free standing claw tub surrounded by beautiful lace, outstanding views from white shuttered Windows, a king size bed with a wooden step up(so Victorian), beautiful Victorian furniture, decorated fireplace, Victorian sofa and many added touches. The owners were friendly, helpful, and aimed to please. Very good breakfasts in a Victorian dining room. Outstanding experience!! Thank you Steve and Cathy.

Text: Steve and Cathy are wonderful, friendly hosts. At breakfast we were yakking with Steve for over an hour and feel we could have gone all day! The home is beautiful. It is filled with furniture and decor that has you looking around while there. We stayed in the Melanie room and that was very comfy. We got to look at all the bedrooms and you can't go wrong with any of them. The house also has a large porch but we didn't sit out that night as we were exhausted. We will definitely stay if in the area again.
