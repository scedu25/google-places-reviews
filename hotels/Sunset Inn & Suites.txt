Text: Great party! Clean room with lots of seating. Wouldn't change anything major! Maybe the $5 deposit on towels, but it didn't ruin the experience.

Text: We stayed in the space odyssey room. It's a really cool room. The pool looks great, but was always too busy (even on weekdays). It seems like locals really like using. Maybe there will be time with no kids in it if we come here again.

Text: We Paid $6.50 to swim At their Pool For a Few Hours... They raised the Rate used to be $5!! I should of Paid the $7 and taken the Kids to A Water Park in Bloomington Only 30 Min Away!! I think 6.50 is To Expenisve For A Couple Hours. Other than that It Was Fun! Fully Booked So they were A Little Busy but A Wedding Party was there So NOT OVERLY CROWDED!!
