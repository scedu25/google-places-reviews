Text: I stayed here on Thursday night when I got there the Lady at the desk was so nice she saw I wasn't feeling good so she went and brought me some food for dinner and made sure I was OK the room was nice and during the night I passed out in the room the next morning I went and got an orange juice and cinnamon roll I still wasn't feeling good so I called down and the Lady at the desk on Friday morning brought me 3 more orange juice I highly recommend this motel

Text: Fairly clean place but a bit rundown. 
Price was cheaper at the desk than what it showed on maps so be sure to call first.
Price was a bit high for the quality of this establishment. Could use some updating for sure.  
Was pretty quiet for a Friday night. 
Water pressure was good and water was good and hot. 
Bed was comfortable. 
Offered a breakfast although we did not eat. 
Many vending machines were out of order. 
Washer and dryer on site. 
Overall a decent place to stay overnight.

Text: 2 different stays at this location. Ok place if you need a bed and shower. Internet spotty at best, television grainy picture. Room cleaning real basic if you get room cleaning, had to ask to get room vacuumed and they do minimal for bathroom. Had to ask for soap and shampoos. Pluses- room stayed cool, near truck stop with restaurants.
