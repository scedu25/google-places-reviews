Text: Good campground if you're in the new section. Old section, we had low voltage at the post. Nice little campground. Decent amount of space. Tents allowed. Close to town and good grocery store.

Text: Good rates.  Very nice campground with probably the best shower/bathrooms of any I've been to!  Also has it own ramp to launch on the river.  Would definitely recommend

Text: Nice for what be it is.  Nice tent sites near the water and pretty spacious RV sites closer to the road but with no shade.   Keep mind this is 30 seconds to downtown Berrien Springs so don't expect to hear the birds.5 to

Text: Very quiet. Nice facilities.  RV area is what you'd expect.  Tent area along river is more secluded and nice.

Text: Good people, clean, reasonable rates. Beautiful setting on the river next to a very friendly village. Close to shopping, fast food, and a night life.  WiFi not very good, that's the only downside so far.  Smart TV freezes every fifteen minutes or so until I reboot... Kind of a hassle, but other than that its a good camping.  Update- WiFi still isn't very good. Speed rating is good when you check it but fifteen, twenty minutes later it freezes again. Not a deal breaker just keeps this place from being great... Our Verizon hotspot from our jetpack is HD quality no interruptions. So it's the wifi...
