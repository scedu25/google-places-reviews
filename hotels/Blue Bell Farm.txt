Text: Jamie and Derek:  We wanted to take a moment and thank you both for a flawless wedding day.  We had so many wonderful comments about the venue, "How did you ever find this place," to the meal, "the food is amazing" and parents commenting on how those children that received the children's meal, loved it!  The bridal suite was beautiful, homelike, a relaxing environment to be in and enjoy lunch and getting ready for the day.  At the very end of the evening, Bubbles even peeked in the door to make sure all was good.  You made this day not only a wonderful memory for Emily and Brent but also the parents of the bride and groom.  Thank you again! Dennis and Karen
