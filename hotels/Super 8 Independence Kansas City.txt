Text: I've stayed here many times and never had a problem. Actually loved the place! I was always well accommodated and my stay was always comfortable and relaxing until this last time I stayed there and it will be my last. They charged me a 50 dollar deposit and never refunded and then tried to blame it on my bank for not releasing the funds While I was on the phone with my bank telling me that it was in fact the merchant that had not  released it. I had to file a claim against them and it still hasn't been resolved.

Text: Staff is always very nice.  Accommodations have been updated and were nicely done.  The air in our room was damp during our stay--even with the AC on.  Didn't mention it until checkout.  Front desk was genuinely interested in the details of what was going on and I got the impression the issue would be looked into.  Enjoyed our stay.
