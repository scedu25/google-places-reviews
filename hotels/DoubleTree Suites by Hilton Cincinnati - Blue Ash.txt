DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Cincinnati - Blue Ash
Rating: 4
Text: This double tree is a gorgeous hotel. The staff has been so exceptional at helping me with anything I needed from extra key cards to directions around town. The food is delicious and always has a great selection. You can tell everyone involved truly cares about their job and you as a guest. Even in the training meetings I'm attending the staff of the hotel is so very diligent on ensuring the coffee, water, and snacks are kept warm, cold, and delicious respectively. The hotel is also located in a great and central area and you can get to just about anything withing 15-20 minutes. I highly recommend a stay here. And as a bonus they have a gorgeous bird, named Georgia, that hangs out in the lobby and greets guests. If you're coming to Cincinnati definitely stop in give Georgia a hello.

Text: Very comfy and affordable rooms. Technically a business hotel but better priced than many of the others in the area. Bed was great, food at the Bistro was quite good and a solid breakfast buffet menu.

Text: The hotel was nice enough - has a parrot in the lobby! Great breakfast buffet. Courteous staff. The hotel could stand to be renovated a little, but everything was clean and I would definitely come back here.
