Text: very nice and polite people. The River Rat experience was great too.
The river seemed slow and was very warm, great for kids. 
It is however little red neck haven. I did not sleep all night long, as some drunkard woman kept on raging. 
Despite of welcoming owners and location, I will not be returning. too long of a drive for me to have sleepless nights.

Text: A really nice place to camp! I brought my kids there to see the total eclipse, and it was EPIC! People there were so nice, I love the laid back, yet hard working employees who worked there, and it was over all a good experience!

Text: Came here with a group of friends to watch the solar eclipse.  Had no idea this place existed but super stoked I went.  Pretty small place compared to other places I've been which means plenty of space on the river.

Text: This place is great. It was our first time but had so much fun. Real laid back place and people were great. It was very sandy but still awesome
