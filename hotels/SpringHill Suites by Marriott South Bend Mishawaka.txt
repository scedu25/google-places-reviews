SpringHill Suites by Marriott South Bend Mishawaka
Rating: 5
Text: I travel to this area occasionally for business and won't stay anywhere else. Love the room design (It feels like my own little house away from home). Love the kitchenette and work space as well as the sitting area separated from the bed. Spacious restroom, shower and vanity area.
Had to be up and out before breakfast was open each day so far so I can't comment on that.
The location is great with lots of shopping close by and about every chain restaurant imaginable (plus some great local spots).
Certainly this is not a "5 Star" hotel from a traditional luxury standpoint, but for the average business traveler such as myself, it earns 5 stars in my book.

Text: Hotel in great area, surrounded by restaurants off of Main and Grape Rd. Rooms are typical of the Springhill brand, breakfast is free and served daily. Gym has free weights, two treadmills and an elliptical. Pool and hot tub are well kept. Less than 10 minute drive to Notre Dame's campus, less than 5 minutes to the Toll Road

Text: Somehow out dated, but friendly staff and excellent service make up for it! 

Clean rooms, will stay here anytime I'm in town!
The pool looks tempting, but haven't got a chance to try it.

Ignore the response, it did meant my expectations, I don't like staying at hotels and I can tell you, I had many pleasant stay here!

Text: Front lobby is great for hanging out to chat with friends over a couple drinks. Nicely decorated and comfortable.
