Holiday Inn Express Toledo North

Text: Tony at the front desk was super friendly...And a very sharp dresser may I add. Rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. Holiday inns have really stepped up their game. They're definitely not the dated motels I remember staying at as a kid in the mid 80's.

Text: Beautiful hotel, comfortable beds, large ?ooms. Best breakfast ive ever seen in a hotel. Food is served starting @ 6:00. The only negative I seen was the carpets needed replaced. Front desk told me it was in the plans.

Text: I like the free breakfast every morning. When traveling with a family of 5, any free meal is awesome. They have a large selection of hot and cold food and they are open to 9:30 on weekdays and 10:00 on weekends. You can eat in the dining area or take it back to your room. The hostess here is very nice.
