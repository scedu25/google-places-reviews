Starlite Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I've always had a good experience at Starlite. The rooms are small, but cozy and cutely decorated. I only wish we had more direct control over the climate controls. You adjust how hot/cold you want your room by opening and closing a vent in the ceiling. Not exactly a motel room of the 21st century, but it gets the job done I suppose.

Text: The nicest little hotel I've ever stayed in. I travel for work and spend a lot of time in small rural towns like Seneca, I wish they all had a motel like the Starlight. I've spent over a month here, the rooms are very nice and clean, haven't seen a single bug. The owner is incredibly nice, offers snacks when you check in, sometimes she'll even leave a couple home made cookies in your room after they make the bed. Great place.
