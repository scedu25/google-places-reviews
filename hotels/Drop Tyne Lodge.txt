Text: Very defensive.  I often inform the management on our way out that we found this problem or that and with out fail they are grateful for our sharing, for our helping out.  We stayed at Drop Tyne Lodge on 7/27/15 and we had hot water the night we checked in but could not take showers in the AM because there was only warm water.  Also, in front of the room next to ours was some trash that had blown in along with old dog waste.  The lady, Jamie, does not man the front desk but there is a phone number taped to the front door.  I left the key in the room where we found it and called her to let her know we were leaving and of some needed attention.  To the hot water she stated that it was because of the wind, to the dog mess, she stated she could not control what animals roam in on the property.  When I stated that some sort of “I'm sorry, we will get right on that” may be in order, she said she was going to say “sorry” until I became rude.  Nice room, very poor service.
