Text: For tbe price it was more than worth it. The lobby was full of historical detail of you like that sort of thing, I do. Very welcoming lobby. Room was big, bed was really good. Smallish bathroom but updated.

Text: Large, clean rooms tastefully appointed. The lobby is elegant with a large chandelier. It's a country hotel with a lot of history. Each room has the name of someone famous who has stayed here previously. The beds are comfortable, the Wi-Fi, while spotty sometimes, is free and fairly fast. Can't ask for more in the location it is.
