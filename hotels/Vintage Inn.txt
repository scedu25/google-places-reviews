Text: This place is Awesome. American family owned/operated. Single level, spacious clean rooms, fridge and microwave in rooms, smoking and non-smoking rooms. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because no ice machine on property.

Text: Wouldn't answer 4 different phone numbers they had posted to get our room. Drove 16 hours straight to get done like this? Poor Service! Terrible way to run a business. Turn your OPEN sign off... I review places everyday for Google map. You just messed up terribly. Hope the owner looks into the problem.
