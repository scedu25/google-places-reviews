Text: Secluded off of the shore of beautiful Evans Lake, this bed and breakfast offers a cozy, rustic atmosphere at an affordable price. The hosts make their guests feel like family, which made it hard to say goodbye. This bed and breakfast is perfect for anyone wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of city living.
