Text: Recommended!!  A+++++  The most gracious hosts!!  The place is beautiful and commodious. Bathrooms were perfectly clean and the bed was amazingly comfortable!  The breakfast made from local produce (some straight from their own backyard!) was very special indeed.  Thank you John and Barb, very much for you pleasant company and service!            -Carlo & Rose
