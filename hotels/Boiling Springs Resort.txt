Text: Great prices for camping, not to mention that the owners just suffered extensive damage to the resort, which caused all of their cabins, gift shop, and even their own home to be swept away! In spite of all that, they are loyal to their customers, so they: cleaned up the camp sites, ordered more canoes and kayaks for float trips, and opened a temporary gift shop! Very impressive!

Text: Cannot recommend this place enough for cruising down the rive. It was the most relaxing day our of summer two years ago. Super friendly and helpful staff.

Text: This is my favorite Ozark river getaway!  They have canoes, tubes, kayaks, and even rafts that they shuttle up and down the Big Piney river.  They also have great little cabins you can sleep in.  The location is prime, as Boiling Springs provides a beautiful clear, cold, crisp spring you can jump into.(extremely refreshing) And they still have the best rope swing next to the beach that I have ever seen on this river.  This is a prime Ozark location and the owners will make you feel right at home!

Text: Never stayed overnight here but when we need to rent a kayak for our floats on the Big Piney, we look no further than Boiling Springs Resort. Never have a problem renting. Their kayaks are solid. Fair price for the rental as well.
