Kozy Kamp Ground

Text: I showed up to meet some people that rented a cabin the night before. I just wanted to drive to the cabin to pick them up. The lady at the office tried to get me to pay $10 to drive back there. I said ok I'll just leave her parked there and walk and get them. She says you have to pay $10 to walk on to the property.I am not a kid without money trying to sneak on the property and camp or hang out.Just was supposed to pick up some of your customers. And no I won't give you $10 for that. What a Joke. Places like these are less concerned with service than the dollar. Or this case $10.

Text: We arrived here on June 30th 2017 . We were not guided to our site by a camp host so we had to turn around and a dumpster was sitting to close to the road and our back door of trailer clipped arm sticking out on trailer and ripped it off. Our fault but if had had a guide to site it would have not happened now we have thousands of dollars of damaged if not totaled. the pool closed at 6 pm that is crappy..Campground has a pond and adjacent is the lake St Marys no bait other then minnows  shower house has a common area for everyone to get undressed did not like that.. can not even have towels in shower have to come in to common area naked..lots of stuff were left in showers  soap razors scrubies gross. The people who camped and lived there were great..Camp store has high prices go to town to get ice.. I do not even rate this a 1 star for management  but would rate it a 5 star for the people..

Text: Not what it used to be. Camped there for years  but now it's all about the dollar and not about the customer. Sad or was a great place.

Text: We have camped here a few times this season. Liked it so much we went permanent with our camper. All the people and staff have been very nice and polite. There is plenty of room for kids to play and run.
