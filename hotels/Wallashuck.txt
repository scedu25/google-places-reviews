Text: Pretty nice Corps of Engineers campsite. Price is right, especially if you have a National Park card. They do have 50 amp service, but no water or sewer, so you need to plan accordingly.

Text: Plenty of open area for big groups. Sites are not right on top of your neighbor. Great access to the lake.

Text: Great Campground, although this year all the sites in all the campgrounds around Lake Red Rock are reservation only. They are all being reserved early in the spring just on the weekends. Bad idea by the park service, now they are abandoned on weekdays.
