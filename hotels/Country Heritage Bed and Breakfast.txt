Text: This place is amazing. My husband & I have stayed twice now within 4 months AND we are renting the entire house for Fourth of July. The innkeeper Donnis is phenomenal. She's so welcoming & easy to chit chat with. The house is wonderful & cozy. This place is a MUST if you're staying in town. Or, like us, you just need a night away.

Text: My family of five stayed one night at this beautiful B&B.  It is in a very rural/farm setting near Hampton, IA (about 4 miles E off I-35) and the pleasantly pastoral setting gives you a wonderfully relaxing rest.  The night we stayed, we were the only non-long term people there.  Of the other three people, two were staying all summer and the third was staying for two months for work.  The owners bend over backwards to ensure your stay is pleasant and the breakfast is wonderful.

Adjacent to the house in an old garage is "The Giggling Goat" gift shop which is beautifully decorated using antique farm equipment and has a wonderful array of local and in-state made products such as flavored popcorn, cookie dough mix, candles, clothing, and other goods.

I can't give the Country Heritage Bed & Breakfast a higher recomendation - a 5-star establishment and a definite gem in North Central Iowa!
