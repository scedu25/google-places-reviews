Text: Oh I habe lived here for about 10 years. Management can be rude. Every year lot rent is raised sometimes twice a year. Recently multiple speed bumps were put in. They are hard on our car and SUV. SUV was bought in April and now needs new shocks and the front control arm has slipped. 
Charges for back ground checks during application but felons are still aloud to live here (No problem with felons but why charge if back ground is not taken seriously)

Text: Lived here for 10 years. It used to be a good place to be, a good neighborhood; one where you can let your kid out to play and not have to worry. Now the new management is kicking people out because they don't like them, or they "don't look good". This place is known for gang members to hang out, murders to occur- remains were found here once as well! (look it up). You're wasting your time if you move here, you'll regret it trust me.

Text: Enjoying decorating my yard. And meeting my neighbors. They are cleaning the trailer park up trying to get out the unwanted type of people here and make it a much better place. I have had no problems in here so far. Have had many compliments on the work I have been doing on my yard. My dad and I are happy here so far.

Text: This trailer court is a joke. They don't care if you're struggling in anyway and they will look for any reason to get rid of you. They're kicking my family out because we're a little behind on rent but we've been here for 11 years without any problems but new management comes along and they're ready to get rid of a bunch of people they're ivicting our neighbors too and rejecting payments from them. they tell your personal info to people that they shouldn't, I have a handicapped sibling and they do not care what so ever they gave us a week to move. Don't move here you're wasting your time.
