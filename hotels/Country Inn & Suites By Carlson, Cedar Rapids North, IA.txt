Text: The hotel is nice and their complimentary cookies and coffee are great. But the customer service is a different story. My last stay here was for my grandfathers funeral and the Hospitality I received was anything but good. Not offering a prorated option should be a thing of the past. Check in took forever because no one was at the front counter, our non-smoking room was strongly smoke scented, and check out time is at 11 am sharp. Management needs to be updated and prorated room options need to be included. This hotel has great potential, things just need to change.

Text: The front desk clerk was the friendliest gal we have encountered in all of our travels. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was amazing. The icing on the cake was the 24 hr hot tub, perfect after working long hours

Text: Great experience at this location. Front desk was wonderful day and night. Had to jump my car, and they found a staff member to come and help me. Kept well, room clean and big lobby. Pool area weak, needs upgrades. Hot tub was locked at 98° and felt warm BUT was open 24-hours which is atypical for hotels. Great stay, would recommend this place. Takes pets for $25 non-refundable.

Text: We have stayed here many times in the past and were very satisfied. This time however I was not happy with the condition of the hotel. The hotel hallways were dirty and had obviously not been vacuumed in days. Our room had a hole in the bathroom door and was not very clean The day staff was rude and not very friendly. The girl working at night was very nice though. I doubt we will ever stay here again.
