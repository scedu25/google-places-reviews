Text: My family and friends stayed here. There were 8 of us all together. some of us stayed in the rooms with a kitchenette, others stayed in the simpler rooms with 2 beds. This place was a nightmare!!! Between the fact that when we ran out of toilet paper they said they would bring some to our room....OK! The outside of the kitchenettes were full of weeds with stickers, the couch was from the 70's and you couldn't sit on it.There were dead bugs in the window seals and the windows were so filthy that you couldn't see out of them. The best part was that the floor between the living room and kitchen had a hole in it...the only thing between the floor and the hole was the carpet. The sinks and shower didn't drain well so that is a whole different story! 
There was an old man who rode around on a golf cart, cigarette hanging out of his mouth and appeared to be intoxicated....along with his dog (We all like the dog). The owner had the personality of a unhappy person.
Do yourself a favor and stay else where.
We now have a family joke.....we refer this as our family trip to THE BATES MOTEL!!

Text: We stayed 3 nights in cabin 17 and had a very nice stay.  The place is a little old but well kept. The food in the restaurant was good and the people were very nice.  Roxanne in the store was very helpful to us.  We had a great time and will plan to stay here again!
