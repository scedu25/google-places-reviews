Western KY RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed for the eclipse. Super friendly host and nice folks staying there. Very convenient to the Western Kentucky Parkway (in contrast with another reviewer below, we were surprised at how quiet it was despite proximity to freeway). Well-kept, no-frills park that should get better as shade trees mature more. Very good wifi even toward farther part of the CG. All pull-through sites. Bathrooms could be nicer (shelves or hooks by sinks and liquid soap would be nice) but enough to get business done.

Text: We stayed here with our Passport America membership, and really liked the park for its convenience and cleanliness. We stayed two nights and needed a good place to stay while visiting family on our way through the area. If we were looking for more of a secluded campground, this wouldn't be the place, but it was perfect for this trip. The owner/mgr was very friendly, and he helped us choose the best site for the size of our rig from their overnight spots. We didn't use their restrooms, showers, etc., so can't review those, but my little 3 year old cousin loved the playground.
