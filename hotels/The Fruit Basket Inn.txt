The Fruit Basket Inn
Rating: 5
Text: If you're looking for posh elegance the Fruit Basket Inn isn't for you. But if you want comfortable welcoming hospitality in a lovely old home you will love this B&B!  The owners are friendly, helpful and more than willing to accommodate their guests' needs. We will most definitely be using the Fruit Basket Inn again and again!

Text: I stayed at this B&B last year for a few days while vacationing in IN.   The food was very tasty and accomodations were nice.  Many of the same ammenities you would get at a hotel but instead you are supporting a family owned small business!
