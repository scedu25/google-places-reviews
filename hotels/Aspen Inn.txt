Aspen Inn

Text: I get the same room every time I'm in Cedar Rapids on business. Room 118 is my home away from home. It has a huge jet tub and os never more than $70 on a week day. I love this place because the location is convenient, the price is fair, the rooms are clean and i never have a single problem with my stay.

Text: Great place for the money. New mattresses.  Housekeeping and front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed 2 weeks. It is an older hotel, so some things aren't 'brand new', but the room was clean,  bedding stain free, no smoke oder, and the carpets were clean. Will stay again.

Text: I've only visited with friends who were staying from out of town. Friendly staff with reasonable rates. The folks who own the Budget Inn also run the Aspen Inn.

Text: I travel all over the country and this is the worst hotel too date! That were constantly waking me up and I work night so I t.v.g was In posable to get any sleep! That made reservations for the wrong days. Than charged me for theim "No refundable " the rooms smelt like dirty feet and every thang was dirty and greasy ! Invert room that that jumped me too in clouding the on that the big mirror over the sink fell off and was nearly fought by a screw on the wall. Creating a death trap I was afraid to be around I will never be staying here again if it was the last one onearth! I could go one
