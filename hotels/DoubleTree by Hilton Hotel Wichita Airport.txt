DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Wichita Airport

Text: The most extensive food bar I have ever seen. We happened to arrive when they were from breakfast to lunch and the assortment of gourmet entrees, fresh vegetables, salads, crudités, desserts, etc... was mind-boggling. The seafood dishes were delicious! There were four vegetarians at our table and they were very happy with the selections.

Text: Great location, easy to get to and very easy to get in and out of. The hotel is nice. The service is wonderful. Banquet food is good but not spectacular.

Text: Staff was professional not exactly friendly. Neighbors were very noisy in adjoining room. We could here them in the hallway being loud and slamming their door from going back and forth at 11pm. My daughter was able to switch rooms due to the noise thanks to staff being accommodating. Could have been worse.
