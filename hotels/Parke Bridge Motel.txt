Text: What a lovely, quaint, and nice motel! Stayed two nights here and loved it! It felt more like home than a motel. Clean, affordable, and modern. We will definitely be back!!

Text: It's an older motel but has so much charm. The rooms are theme decorated and comfortable. The owner is delightful and so accommodating. The stay was very pleasant and we slept wonderfully. We will definitely stay here again.

Text: I will be finishing up my last stay there this weekend . Been staying here since feb 2017 for work . Cyndi is amazing and this quaint place is like home away from home . It's been wonderful especially since I've been able to take my 12 year old dachshund with me . Thank you Cyndi

Text: My husband, two kids, two dogs, and I stayed at this motel for 2 weeks while my husband was in the area working and I'm so glad we went with this place. The owner has to be the nicest lady we've ever met, she went above and beyond to show true hospitality.
