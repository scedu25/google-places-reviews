Best Western Indianapolis South
Rating: 4
Text: The room and bathroom were both very clean and comfortable.  Stay was very quiet. Breakfast was basic but acceptable for value. Towels were not soft. For a comfortable stay, it delivered as advertised; just don't expect many luxuries. which I was fine with.

Text: At check in we asked for another room ,not so close to the entrance or the ice machine and were told that were none, even though it was only 3:30.The pool smelled horrible! Not just a chlorine smell but a sewage smell also. Our room was a good size, Quiet, comfy bed, water pressure was so so, plenty of outlets, wifi was pretty good. Breakfast items were good and plenty of choices but the room was way to small. Very very crowded! Next time we are in Indianapolis we will look elsewhere.

Text: Visiting for Gen Con and found this to be one of the more reasonable priced hotels. Ad this was just basically a base for sleeping and storing loot we weren't expecting The Ritz. That said, it did exceed our expectations with the breakfast and the staff has been nothing but exceptional and super friendly. Will definitely consider booking here again next year. Some great restaurants within stumbl...err...walking distance of the hotel as well!

Text: Read a lot of reviews on Google before arriving and it was way better than people were describing. Everything was clean and comfortable. Front desk was friendly. Breakfast was average. I would stay again if passing through the area.
