The Inn At Amish Acres
Rating: 2
Text: Stayed in King size spa room with Jacuzzi tub. Room was a nice size and clean, however that was about it for the good ratings for our stay. Inn overall needs a lot of updating, especially for the price we paid. Our bed was not comfortable at all, and felt like we were sleeping on a trampoline anytime we moved. We called asking for extra pillows due to a spare in our room having a large yellow stain, and were told we could have another "only if they could find one." Iron in our room, however no ironing board. Continental breakfast was overall unimpressive. We stayed on the grounds due to a wedding, and will say that the food at the reception from the restaurant was very good!

Text: Very nice inn and the most important to me is extremely comfortable bed. I have had back surgery and it is not often I find a perfect bed away from home. My back felt very good the next morning. There is a little gift shop by the lobby and they sold hand made Amish quilts as well.

Text: This hotel is great for it's location and service. Right next to Amish acres, is very convenient, specially if you can get a package deal with attractions included. Complementary breakfast every morning, complete with free Starbucks Coffee. They also have a swimming pool and clean and comfy rooms. If you get the opportunity, give it a try. It's a great experience.

Text: Great hospitality, food is good and rooms are decent. Shower didn't drain well and rooms were a 4.5 on cleanliness.  Very friendly staff and are great for Horizon transport employees
