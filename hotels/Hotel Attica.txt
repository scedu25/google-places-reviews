Text: I've never stayed at the Hotel but I've eaten at the restaurant several times and just loved it. It's a quaint place with very friendly people. Worth the drive from the Lafayette area (where we lived at the time.)

Text: The hotel is a very good value. You must like vintage hotels to enjoy staying here. For those going to events at the Badlands it's a good deal. I will stay there again.

Text: I'm sorry but 1 year ago this hotel did not look like the pictures that are shown on their website. 
Our room was terrible, air conditioning was covered with plastic from the winter, had to tear open to use it
To get in the shower we had to turn sideways because the sink was to close. 
Cords were hanging ftom the walls 
Back of the hotel was falling apart, just not a safe place to stay, never again. 
You need to update your pictures.
