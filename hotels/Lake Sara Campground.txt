Text: We left at near 11pm at night to head south for the August 21 Solar Eclipse and was going to wing it on finding somewhere to sleep. We got to our halfway point at 2:30 and the 2 hotels we had in mind were booked so we began searching campgrounds since we also brought our gear. Campgrounds nearly never have checkin in the middle of the night but the 2nd one I called miraculously called me back right away and agreed to check us in. It was one of those nice local ones where the guy lived on sight so, looked like we woke him up but he was generous enough to check us in.
