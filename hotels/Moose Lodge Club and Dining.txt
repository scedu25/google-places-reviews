Text: Saturday night was the opening of the lake.  Buy a ticket for $25 which includes a meal of pulled pork, mashed potatoes and green beans and a chance to win $1000.  They used to also have rolls and desserts but evidently had cut backs!   It's a fund raiser...I get it!  Band started at 9pm and the younger crowd came in to party until the wee hours.
