Union Park Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: I really enjoyed my stay here at Union Park Guest House. I t felt like being at home, instead of a stuffy old motel room. I will always come back to the house when I  am in Leavenworth. I t was spotless and very comfortable. Wonderful stay.  Thanks again Doug.

Text: It was a very pleasant stay in an area of Leavenworth we've never explored. Very close by the downtown shops and restaurants. The proprietor was quite attentive and helpful. Would stay again.
