Text: A very good place for the price. We were quoted $42 over the phone for two people and when we arrived a couple hours later that is what we were charged, $42, not $42 plus tax, nice surprise. Room showed signs of wear and tear from years of use, but everything was clean and worked which included both a microwave and fridge. Simple and plain..no pictures on the wall, but that's no big deal. Also had a table, chair, queen-sized bed and dresser. Get there early and you could probably get a room on the back side and avoid some of the Interstate noise. We arrived late and were on the front side.  Noise was noticeable when the A/C was not running, but not what I would consider bad. We would stay there again.

Text: This place is not kept up. It needs to be updated and maintained. It's okay for one night and in a pinch. Good TV and ac. Has microwave and mini fridge.

Text: The room met the basic needs, it had a TV with good channels, a mini fridge, and a microwave. They charged extra for another person. There were beatles on the walls in the room and bathroom, which is a definite negative. Not to mention the water turned cold in the shower when showering after another person.

Text: This is the worst place I think I've ever stayed. The bed was hard, the room smelled, the floors were gross, the door knob was almost broken. I read some good  reviews & thought I got a great deal, no. It was VERY nasty unless I got the worst room & I'm missing something. Not worth the cost at all, go for quality over cost!!!
