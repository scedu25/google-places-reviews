Hi-Lo Motel
Rating: 5
Text: This place may not be 5 star, but the people here are 5 heart!  I road up in need of a rear tire for my bike. Tiny towns aren't big on amenities and I was to far out for AAA to help. Well the lady at the Hi-Lo Motel got on her phone and started calling around and found a guy who new a guy. Anyway,  all these people found me the tire I needed to get home and refused to take money. They all said,  "Just pay it forward". The owner of the motel even loaned her car to some biker guests to go eat so could get out of the rain. LOVE THIS PLACE! ?
