Spaulding Inn Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The Spaulding Inn was a great getaway. The rooms were very nice, comfortable and well kept. The B&B is very close to downtown and a longer walking distance from the college. The owners cook breakfast every morning from scratch using high quality and often organic food that was great. The owners themselves are very gracious and kind. It was very nice to have a place to stay in town as opposed to the hotel chains out by the interstate. I would absolutely stay here next time I'm in Grinnell

Text: Absolutely wonderful experience.  Tim and Valerie were very pleasant.  She was very accommodating to my wife's gluten-free needs.  I loved the sun room.  I was able to catch up on some work in a very peaceful surrounding.

I would highly recommend the stay for a much needed step into serenity.
