Hampton Inn Marysville

Text: I was in town for my best friend's wedding, since we both came in from Cincinnati we were splitting the room. We both agree, the beds were hard as a rock and very uncomfortable. The pillows had no substance and I may as well as have put my had to rest on a stack of pancakes. The breakfast is free, yes, but we still would rather have gone to a restaurant or something. We asked for an 8 a.m wake-up call that we did not receive. However, the gentleman that worked the desk during our check-in and checkout is very gentle with customers, despite the impression I got that he couldn't care less what happens. And the renovation they're doing is quite impressive, very modern rooms and the lobby to me is a work of art, makes you feel like you're in a nicer hotel than you are, once you get past the old people smell. If you carry, like I do, but are visiting a place in town where you cannot have your weapon, be careful. I don't know if it was just our room or what, but we did not have a safe where I could set a temporary combo and lock it up, so I had to run the risk of keeping it in my car. I do not think I'd recommend this Hampton.

Text: Location of the hotel was a very convenient distance to the Honda facilities. The new renovated rooms were amazing looking. Service was great also, lots of free goodies available even when I got there late.

Text: I got the closes room to the elevator so you could usually hear the door and other people getting I'm and out which was a little unpleasant.  Besides that it was a good stay. Good clean sheets. The bathroom could be better. The employees were nice as well as the concierge. Morning free breakfast was usually similar to other hotel breakfast.
