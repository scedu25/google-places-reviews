Text: There were quite a few issues while checking in, but Christina, General Manager, showed the maximum example of professionalism, grace and calmness.  During an extremely busy check in day and time due to wedding guests for a nearby wedding and athletes and parents for a sporting event, she was kind and helpful making what could have been a major inconvenience for us to a restful and stress free experience at this hotel. She deserves a raise, promotion, employee of the month, or at least corporate recognition for her dedication and devotion to giving all guests a pleasant experience!  It should also be noted that none of the issues were her fault or negligence, but she owned the problems and took responsibly, as a manager should without hesitation!  Thank you, Christina!  (I'm sorry I didn't get your last name.)

Text: excellent, super friendly staff, however the room is terribly outdated,  floors were not clean, old awful carpet, dated and worn furniture,  and very overpriced for what you get.

Text: Best Hotel in Mesquite. I pass through frequently and have stayed at the Casino Hotels but I always depart smelling like ashtray. This hotel is non smoking, easy access, spotlessly clean, and there is a Wal-Mart next door if you need anything for your travels. They have a nice pool and have an even bigger one under construction. Also don't miss the free coffee and breakfast.

Text: Spent one night so far and wish I didn't have two more. With a deep cleaning this HIE would be must nicer.
Also issue with the lights in the pool area being automatically turned off at 9:45 when the pool doesn't close until 10 AND there is a pool full of kids!
