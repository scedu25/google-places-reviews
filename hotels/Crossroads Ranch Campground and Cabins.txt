Text: I came to Crossroads Ranch for my one year anniversary with my boyfriend! We were able to rent a cabin for the weekend. The cabin made me feel at home, I absolutely loved the decorations. Saturday morning laying in the bed we got to watch the sunrise and see the steam come off the pond. We had the priveledge of riding horseback with Rob McCauley the owner! He is very personable and great to talk to! Riding 
back in the trails, you are able to see God's creation in a great way!! Can't wait to return and watch Crossroads grow!

The arena in the campground is very convenit for people who want to watch from there camper.  The ice and firewood for sale in the campground is really nice.
