Text: Owner belligerent. Not safe if you have $ or medicine. One of two places addicts go to get out of weather when they have a few bucks. Everybody needs to relax. I don't really care except circumstances stuck me there. couple of other places have long term guests who sell pot for money. Big deal, as long as nobody gets hurt. O hoy my pills stolen there. ? and there's a police report on file. So no lies in response. Many people don't mind)

Text: This was the nastiest place I've ever stayed.   I'm completely astonished our car was not broken into or that we weren't mugged leaving the building.       Spend the extra money not to come here because you could very easily run into a tweeker in the hallway and lose a lot more then a few bucks.

Text: Came up to Bell's Brewery for a concert and brought the wife and 7 month old. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH, do not get a room here if you have children. This is the absolute worst, scariest motel I have ever seen. The parking lot was full of individuals blaring music, selling drugs, and what appeared to be hooking. It is literally next to a boarded up house. My wife works for the welfare office and runs a work program for felons, including transporting sex offenders and rapists. She wouldn't stay here, so what does that tell you? I have no idea who would give this place more than 1 star. I feel bad for anyone from out of town (like us) who was trying to save a few bucks and got duped by the pics online. We ended up checking in, looking around, throwing the key on the bed and getting the hell out of there. Spent double for a room at a different hotel but assumed we'd have more than that stolen from our car if we stayed. PLEASE DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE. I am genuinely afraid for others who check in to this hotel.

Text: Not a place to stay. Avoid. Cleanliness is not a priority. Rooms smell of smoke and marijuana. Witnessed a gentleman yelling to no one in the parking lot for three hours from the balcony. Informed the front desk after two hours, mind you it is almost 1am., to have them take care of the problem. This only got me a knock on my door that he wasn't hurting anyone. I paid $50 for the room, not a bad price, but could have stayed more in town for the $. There is no breakfast, no amenities what so ever. There were bugs on and in the bed. Was awoke at 4am to a gentleman entering my room with an actual room key. Thankfully he saw I was awake and after I said gtfo he left. This is not a place for children, the prostitution going on in almost every other room is appalling. That and the fact I was made aware of the 3 different types of drug I could purchase at a discount prices. I have been in bad parts of the world, but none so bad as this area of Kalamazoo. I would rather spend the night in the slums of Dubai then here again. It icing on the cake was the gentleman that was being arrested for rape, of a two year old, while he mother was getting high in the bathroom. I would say avoid, but I am surprised they even have backing of a national chain.
