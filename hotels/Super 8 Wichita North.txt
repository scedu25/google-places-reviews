Super 8 Wichita North
Rating: 4
Text: Great actually Amazing Value! Standard King Room Is Amazing For Such a Bargain Price. This was formerly a Wichita Inn and I have to say this remodel was amazing and my compliments to the owners. Has a suite available as well. If you get a chance grab a room here you will not be disappointed in the least! My only complaint is that the breakfast is lacking in substance. Several times they had n o juice and only waffles as far as hot foods. However plenty of restaurants close by.

Text: It was clean and comfortable (front lobby furniture is beautiful) although I don't like the fact that they withdraw 100 dollars for a deposit right away and then have to wait for it to be returned. ( 1-5 business days). North Rock Suits is right next door it is a little more pricy but worth it.  They don't take anything out of your account unless there is damage. Pool inside and out and altogether a better place to spend your money. The man at the front is very professional and made sure I was satisfied!

Text: This was the best Super 8 I have ever stayed at. The lobby is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are very clean. There was a smell that resembled a men's locker room in the hallway, but it did not smell in the room at all so it was hardly an inconvenience. I would still give this hotel a 10/10. Not to mention the incredible rate. Impossible to beat.

Text: The lady working the desk at night was SUPER friendly. The remodeling looks very unique and fun, but the rooms were in need of some minor repairs in our experience. The tub didn't drain, missing chunks of tile etc. We aren't super picky people, though and for the price it served its purpose as an overnight stop with a convenient location.
