Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Louisville Downtown

Text: The staff here are kind and helpful. The hotel room was clean and pleasant. Breakfast is pretty good, but the coffee isn't great. No restaurant/bar on site, even though it's a pretty big hotel in a big city. Still a good place to stay, within walking distance of lots of places to eat.

Text: Walking distance to multiple good restaurants and fun places. Parking was $15/night. The rooms were clean and comfy, but half the outlets didn't work in one of our rooms. With 4 girls, it made it challenging. If I'm in the area again, I would gladly stay with them again.

Text: Rented the room through Expedia which caused some complications in trying to check in early but the staff was above and beyond friendly and helpful throughout and did wind up getting me in early. The room was clean and the bed super comfortable. Continental breakfast was well stocked.

Text: We were charged $17 for parking, but there were no parking spots available whatsoever. They didn't refund us, but had us make our own spot in a high traffic area. I imagine this isn't usually an issue, seeing as how the eclipse brought in so many people. The room itself was really nice. Comfortable bed, hot shower. Overall pleased with my experience.

Text: Amazing customer service experience! The gentlemen and the other staff up front went out of their way to make sure that my family and I had a great experience. Maps and print offs of all of the restaurants and events that were close by. Letting us check in early because there was availability and my 2 young children were so excited to start swimming. Hands down the best customer experience I've had from a hotel in quite some time. Clean rooms/hotels with a good location within the city.
