Text: Pretty bad. Just overall. You're much better off going to motel 6 across the parking lot for an extra $5.

Text: I stayed there june 15th because I was traveling for business and there was a storm at that time so i end up there,  The plumbing is broken, sheets dirty, wifi didn't work, plus I came back with bed bugs bite and pneumonia.  Next morning I tried explaining it to the owner that the filter in the ac units are suppose to be wash and clean and rest of the stuff.  The owner just said ok I will let the house keeper know.  He tired defending but I was not even asking for my money back and begging him to understand that please put all your employee to clean.  He didn't think cleaning was important.   Sleeping in dirty,  stain sheets are ok, rusted pipe and broken toilet seats are ok.  It says budget inn and they charged my card the next day.

Text: Very disgusting. They don't pay there employees for there hours of work. The guy harry calls his employees fat and ugly asses very disrespectful. Would never recommend anybody to stay there. Or work there trust me. And they honestly don't wash the blankets they need to be inspected by the health department.
