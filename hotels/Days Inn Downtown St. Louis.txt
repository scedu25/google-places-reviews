Days Inn Downtown St. Louis
Rating: 1
Text: Not in downtown St. Louis! Do not stay here. The hotel description is 100% inaccurate. The hotel is in a horribly decrepit area of the city and not within walking distance of any downtown attraction. Even the desk clerk did not recommend walking anywhere in the neighborhood. Wyndham usually has better descriptions. Luckily the desk clerk cancelled the reservation for me. Otherwise I would be even more angered by the horrible inaccurate description on the Wyndham website.

Text: The building hallway smelled liked strong weed. When we got to the room the tub had hair in it, the floor was not vacuumed, ALL the towel was dirty, the products was half filled the refrigerator had left over products in it and the microwave was dirty!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!

Text: I did not feel comfortable here. Slept in my clothes and did not shower. Place was not clean. This is a place you stay at if you're broke, down on your luck or recovering from addiction.

Text: Location is terrible. I paid the price for a hotel but I ended up in a motel. Staff was nice and friendly though.

Text: 5 minutes into our stay, I found bedbugs crawling around on the comforter. We got moved to another room, which had huge stains on the carpet, blankets, and even the walls. This is genuinely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The housekeepers were very nice, though!
