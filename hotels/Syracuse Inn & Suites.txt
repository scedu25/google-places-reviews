Syracuse Inn & Suites
Rating: 3
Text: Basic accommodation, basic prices.  Nearly clean room, comfy bed. Reasonable breakfast, though some fresh fruit would be an improvement.  Workout room available at 9:00 AM--who starts their day that late, especially if they're actually motivated enough to exercise?  Don't expect to get what you don't pay for.

Text: The location of this hotel is convenient - right off the highway and only about 17 miles to Nebraska City. The hotel itself is older and not updated. The pool is not up and running. The breakfast was sparse - waffles, bread, plain bagels, cereal, milk, orange juice & coffee. We started in a family suite: two queens a hide a bed. We reserved a crib but the workers didn't seem to know anything about it. Turns out they do have two pack n plays available. The room was fairly clean, although there were two cups that had some alcohol left in them. It seems like they have a difficult time getting good help. This was confirmed by the worker at the front desk who said that another worker was not very qualified but they were desperate for help. All in all, not a terrible stay, but not exactly worth $121.

Text: The rooms were dirty and when booking online isn’t the same when you go into the hotel. Would not recommend

Text: Pleasant front desk personnel. Room was spacious with clean linens and usable pillows. Small fridge but no coffee pot. Fortunately there's a gas mart across the parking lot. For winter traveling: The room wasn't heated at the time of arrival, and with below zero temperatures it took the whole night to warm the room using the outdated heat unit. Great location off the highway.

Text: Ice machines don't work, no pool or spa as advertised, not so great service with a lot of attitude given from one of the night clerk's, not so clean, hard beds, and refrigerator doesn't work.. been a not so great hotel experience.. :(
