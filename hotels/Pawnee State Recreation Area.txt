Text: Made reservations 2 months prior to trip, when checked in (July 6, 2017) ladies in the office were nice. Noticed not many people, headed down to swim only to find out that ALL water activities had been cancelled since June 22, 2017 because of toxic algee levels. I understand it's out of their control but they could have contacted me to let me know or even told me when we checked in.  Now I am out $54 (2 campsites) and I have 3 very upset children that have been in a car for 2 1/2 hours wanting to swim???. They refused to give me a refund and told me it's a act of God and not their problem.

Text: Decent. Place is nice but it's not much for fishing. Pretty much just a lot of white perch
