Baldwin House
Rating: 5
Text: Old and charming, this house (the first floor) has everything you could want for a weekend or a week. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in, down to the 'please remove your shoes...'. SO much better than a hotel.

Text: Really enjoyed all the Comforts of home well being at the Baldwin house so many extras here included that you would not get out of motel or hotel for an overnight visit you pay a large amount for one or two people with reasonable price for Baldwin House which is close and convenient to stores and a large Park is very much worth the price that we paid
