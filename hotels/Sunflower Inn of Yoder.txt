Sunflower Inn of Yoder
Rating: 5
Text: Delightful impeccable B&B just across the road from the tiny Amish/Mennonite town of Yoder. Super comfortable bed, air conditioning, a porch and rocking chair perfect for pondering the mysteries of life, and a delicious enormous breakfast cooked by Kendra the owner before your eyes. Don't fail to visit the furniture store about 100 yards down the road which has the most beautiful handcrafted oak furniture and quilts you'll ever see, all created by local artisans.

Text: Sunflower Inn of Yoder is a quiet, quaint, relaxing peaceful place to stay to just go and get away from it all. Located across from The Carriage Crossing restaurant in Yoder famous for their pies and cinnamon rolls. Just 10 minutes from Hutchinson and 45 minutes from Wichita, KS.  I would recommend this place to anyone. It's out in the country with a farmhouse feel. I felt like I was at my grandmas house. Very clean and we'll kept. Only 3 rooms available each with their own bathroom.  Breakfast was cooked and served to all the guests in the dining room. Very good food and very nice people.  I absolutely loved this place and cant wait to go back.
