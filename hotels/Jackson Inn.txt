Text: I understand that his place had been a dump but the new owner is sinking a lot money into it.  All the rooms in our building were completely gutted and redone with new carpeting and ceramic tile on the floor, stained knotty pine wood panels on the walls and for trim around the doors, new bathrooms, mattresses, refrigerators, microwaves, coffee makers, and televisions.  The rooms were attractive, comfortable, and spotless.  They’re not decorated yet, but I was unconcerned with that detail.

The work is not done, however, so there still are some issues.  The exterior of the building is awaiting paint and updating so it’s a bit shabby, although you would never know it from inside the nice rooms.  Also, the Wi-Fi is essentially non-existent.  There is a router in the main office but it’s too far from the rooms to be any good, so neither of us was able to connect to it.  (There were a couple of routers in our building but Steve doesn’t know where they are or how to hook them up, so they’re broadcasting an empty signal.)  If Wi-Fi is absolutely critical to you, you’ll be unhappy here.  On the bright side, my Verizon signal was excellent in Jackson, although my buddy’s T-Mobile was effectively useless in the entire area.

I will stay here again the next time I'm in Jackson, and use the Wi-Fi at McDonald's if I really need it.

Text: This place is finally being remodeled! We stayed in the already remodeled building and it was like the Taj Mahal compared with the before. Great job! I miss the pool. If the wifi was actually working I would give it 5 stars.
