Text: My wife, 1-year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our 2-night stay at cabin #2 in July 2017. Great amenities, lovely secluded setting. Will be staying again.

Text: My husband and I stayed here for our first anniversary. We met at SIUC so it was great to be back! The cabin was clean and secluded. The hot tub was nice and our cabin was pet friendly so we were able to bring our dog as well.

Text: My wife and I just returned from four days/three nights at Oak Grove Cabins.  We stayed in Cabin #2.  It was absolutely wonderful.  We were there celebrating our first anniversary and couldn't have asked for a more beautiful setting.  If you're looking for a truly secluded location to spend a few days, these cabins are perfect.  We look forward to coming back again in the future!

Text: Beautiful cabins. The hot tub is amazing. Only complaint is that the beds are so squeaky. I woke up multiple times a night just rolling over because it was so loud.

Text: My husband and I have stayed several times. Everything is perfect, every time! Dorthy is a perfect hostess...always available to help if you need anything, but 100% respectful of your privacy if you don't. The cabins are very well stocked with everything you need, just bring your personal items and food (they provide seasonings, coffee, pots, pans, utensils...etc) and absolutely spotless. The hot tub is wonderful, as is the back deck, firepit, grill, gas fireplace and the beautiful view. Also all the cabins are totally private. We've stayed at the 2 bedroom, original cabins as well as the new "couples cabins" dubbed Walnut Grove and both are so enjoyable. We will continue to visit frequently!
