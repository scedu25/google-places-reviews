Text: I'll first start off by saying how adorable the front desk man is. I believe his name is Joshua! He is by far the most friendliest person I've encountered through my years of traveling! Such a warming smile and a great laugh! He was able to accommodate me and my spouse when we booked a room last minute! By even making the stay better, he took time to give us a run down of some of his favorite spots and may I just add that the restaurants he chose were SUPERB! If we are in back in the city, we will make this our FIRST choice! Clean and well-kept hotel! Would recommend 10/10!

Text: The hotel was located very close to a 24 hour dinner and Wal-Mart which was very convenient! The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. We got a room with a whirlpool tub, the tub was not quite as clean as I would have liked. The front desk was very friendly when we checked in and out.

Text: I showed up at 3:30 for a check in notice that's 30 mins after the check in time. Our room was not ready there was 4 other couples waiting on there rooms also. When I asked what time they will be available I was told there was no way of knowing that. I had booked this room a week in advance to insure I had it because I needed to prepare for a 5:30 reservation. Now it is after 4:00 And we are all still waiting in the lobby to get into my room.

Text: I stay here often when traveling for work and an always satisfied with my experience. Friendly staff and clean rooms. This hotel would benefit from a better workout facility, it is definitely lacking with just a couple treadmills, a few dumbbells, and one adjustable bench.
