Travelers Motel

Staff has its moments. It looks like a family owned motel and i can tell it means a lot to the owners. They are a cute older indian couple who i think stay on the premises. At a first glance it looks like your average motel, and the non smoking rooms are much better than the smoking ones. I was taken back by the $63 dollar a night price tag because i would expect the price for the location and commedities to be around the 40 dollar range. So i did expect more for the money. What really freaked me out was the baggy of drugs and a syringe left behind by heroin users. The front door can be opened from the inside even when locked so that was a bit odd to me but the ac unit worked well and the rotating tv stand was a nice bonus. I wouls just recomend you bring your own bed sheets as with any motel really. I would not recomend taking a shower but non smoking showers mught be better. I think with a bit of renovations this place would be great and well worth the money.
