Text: I do not remember the name of the hotel clerk who was staffed at the hotel counter the stormy evening of Wednesday July 12, 2017,  but she was fantastic, most courteous personable attendant.  Very efficient in getting us checked in.  Even opened hotel door so we can get our bags into building.  We noticed refrigerator in room was not working and she immediately checked on it and quickly assigned us to another room.  I want to praise her with more than 5 stars as she was beyond excellent.   The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable, quiet, with refrigerator and microwave,  all worked very well for us.  Very modern bathroom beyond expectations, though a hair dryer would be a nice addition.  I was totally satisfied with the accommodations.  If I am in the area again, will definitely stay here again.

Text: The room was fine but a group of Hispanics were partying all night so I couldn't sleep.  I called the front desk (at 2:00 am) but that didn't stop and loud noise.  This was the worst nights sleep I have gotten in years and I had a long drive ahead of me the next morning.

Text: The front desk lady was super informative and helpful. Loved the location right off of I-80. 
Close to a number of food chains

Text: Felt like a crack den. My door lock didn't work, the room smelled and the sheets clearly weren't changed. Pretty sure there was blood on the outside of the door. The place was a dump, I half expected one of the crack heads staying there to rob me in the middle of the night.

Text: Room was very modern and comfortable. But the tub was dirty. The fitness room was filthy, with garbage and dirty socks laying everywhere.
