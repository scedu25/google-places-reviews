Text: Pretty clean. Had a nice 32 inch flat screen T.V. with cable and, the king size bed was pretty much brand new and DAMN was it comfy! The breakfast of sausage, eggs and a homemade waffle(YOU, pour the batter into a waffle iron)was quite nice as well. Very easy access in and out of the place. I only give it 4 stars because my wife tried to take a bath and the tub wouldn't fill up. Overall good experience!

Text: Pay a bit more for someplace else. Wife wanted here cause had smoking rooms. The vent fan in bath did not work at all. The wall in bath had brown streaks likely from no vent and being damp and smoke. Informed desk at checkout but betting that it is still not working. The frame on ac kept falling off. Wife said bed was comfy. No elevator so have to walk stairs.

Text: Had a great stay, the hotel itself was as expected. Our room was clean and simple, and the breakfast was great. Staff was friendly and helpful, overall couldn't ask for much more.

Text: Rooms that you would expect from a Super 8. Clean and quiet, nothing super fancy but good for the price. The breakfast was good; I like when they have the waffle maker.

Text: Room was clean, bed was very comfortable, those are the most important things to me. Breakfast was nice in that it was more than just donut and coffee but they were kinda stingy with quantity. It only ran from 6 to 9. We came down at 8 and donuts, English muffins, peanut butter, and milk were empty. Waffles were good but no one was monitoring the room so the batter cups left by other guests weren't cleaned up and no napkins or forks to be found. It was great having a full breakfast offered but the maintenance of the breakfast room was very inadequate. If you stay, set your alarm and hopefully it's a better selection at 6.
