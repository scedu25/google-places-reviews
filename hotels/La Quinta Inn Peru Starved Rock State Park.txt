La Quinta Inn Peru Starved Rock State Park
Rating: 5
Text: This La Quinta in the Peru area severs the best breakfast !! It's great !  We found this hotel completely remodeled and it looks so fresh and clean ! The rooms were also beautifully redecorated, quite nice, only I did miss the table instead of the desk which is hard to sit around.  All of the personnel we had contact with were very friendly and all our needs were met. Definitely enjoyed our stay and would recommend !

Text: Rooms pretty clean. Continental breakfast adequate. Right near interstate and places to eat and shop. You have to meander back to find it. Parking is kind of funky. In middle of updating so what parking there is was blocked by construction stuff.

Text: Reserved a king bed back in June. When we got there in October, they only had a room with double beds. Manager didn't seem to care. In fact, she treated us as if we were lucky to even get a room.

Text: Clean, pet friendly, basic accommodations. Very reasonably priced and one of the few chains that does not charge a fee for your pet. Decent free breakfast. Good stop right off of route 80

Text: Room was very clean and nice. Guest services was accommodating with issues we experienced. Breakfast was better than most continental breakfast. Only issue was bathroom near pool was closed due to remodeling but understood that could not be helped
