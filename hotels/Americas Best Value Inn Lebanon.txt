Americas Best Value Inn Lebanon
Rating: 5
Text: For the price, it is definitely a value. $79 for two double beds. One of the best value motels I've stayed in, in fact. The staff was extremely friendly, centrally located on Route 66, good parking, mini fridge, the room was extremely clean, & comfortable all around, including beds, & nice air. My only minor complaint was after a long trip, I looked forward to soaking in the bath, and it wouldn't hold water. Lever seems to be broken. But the pros far outweighed the single con.

Text: Room twelve, double bed. For the value of the room, it was a great place to stay. Don't expect the Ritz, but expect a nice air conditioned room and a comfy bed. And breakfast in the morning!

Text: Spacious, clean rooms. 
Soft towels and hot water. 
Decent beds. I prefer softer. Very fluffy pillows.

Text: I've been to some bad hotels to know a bad one when I've seen one. I actually inspect them for a living besides. In short though, I saw no negatives. Basic amenities for a basic level stay. I stayed overnight here in between days of long routes in inspections work. No unusual odors. No bad stains or signs of debris. Looked and felt clean and the price was very reasonable. Just be sure you are honest with the staff upfront and know what the risk is if you break any of their big rules. In other words don't smoke in the non-smoking rooms, do it outside if you have to. Don't hide pets or there's a fine. But like I said, I can't complain. It's a quaint stay and close enough to plenty of restaurants and stores. Lebanon has a lot to offer to a weary traveller passing through. I'll probably stay again in the future. : )
