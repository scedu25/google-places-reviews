The White Buffalo Ranch
Rating: 5
Text:  This place is absolutely unbelievable.   There are hundreds of acres of land to explore with tons of ponds, creeks, trees, meadows...  And if that isn't enough it also butts up to the Mark Twain Forest!  We took our 1.5 year old and our newborn baby boy along and had a blast.  The accommodations were top notch.  It was so peaceful and quiet.   You felt like you were the only one around,  yet had all that you need.  The owner is a lot of fun to talk too and great to work with.  While we were there we were able to see a new born calf that was a day old!  They also let us (and our little guy) bottle feed a different calf!  The animals are far enough away from the lodge that you forget that you're on a working ranch, yet close enough to walk to if you like petting animals.  We had a great time and want to remind anyone considering going to be sure to pack a camara.  The whole area is gorgeous!

Text: This Ranch well exceeded our expections. We highly recommend it to others. We had three generations enjoying kayaking, horseback riding, fishing, playing pool and feeding the fish.
Bob, Mary and Shelomo where welcoming and went out of their way to make us feel at home.
The indoor and outdoor commercial kitchens were a cook's dream. Accommodations were very nice with soo much room to spread out for different activities. We enjoyed eating in the outdoor pavilion. Great place and people!
Thanks for the memories,
Becky from Kansas
