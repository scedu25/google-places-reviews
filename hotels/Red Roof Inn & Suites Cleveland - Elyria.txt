Red Roof Inn & Suites Cleveland - Elyria
Rating: 1
Text: This place was horrible. The pool is not heated. Lots of marijuana smoking, the rooms are filthy even though they have a cleaning crew. Utterly disgusting. We stayed in 2 different rooms. Pubes in the bathroom. Hand prints on the wall, dirty clothes still in the room from other guest. DISGUSTING

Text: This place was great for family and singles, they have free breakfast, the pool was clean and did not have to much chlorine. Their rooms were spacious and they had a variety of floor plans.  The personel are very friendly and helpful. The area is very clean and located within restaurants and shopping. A great place to stay

Text: Lobby is nice rooms were clean. Needs some cleaning up in the halls. Staff closed the pool 2 hours early so we didn't get to use it.
