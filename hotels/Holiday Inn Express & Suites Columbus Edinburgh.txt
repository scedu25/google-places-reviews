Holiday Inn Express & Suites Columbus Edinburgh
Rating: 5
Text: First, this place is clean. The rooms are clean, the public areas are clean and the grounds are clean, too. The staff is more than accommodating. The room rates are fair. I stay at this facility about once a year and been coming here for about five/seven years and I have never had a bad experience.
