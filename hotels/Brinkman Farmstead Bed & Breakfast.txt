Text: We wanted a break. To get away for a day and forget about life. After hitting a few vineyards, of which we loved Wenwood, e stopped for the evening to stay here. Marth greeted us and was very accommodating and pleasant. Her and her husband Tom are the owners and Artisans here.  This is a working dairy farm and they make their own cheese. Breakfast was amazing and be sure to check in for March/April 17 when the new calves should be being born.
