Text: I've stayed here on several occasions when in town on business and can't find anything to complain about. Close to plenty of shopping and eateries. I also enjoy the included Happy Hour lite dinner.

Text: Beautiful room! Very friendly service as well! Once we got all settled in our room, the front desk called and asked how we like our room and asked if we needed anything. Definitely will be staying here again!

Text: Had the clean new appearance, but everything else was... Eh.  Even though interior was updated, could tell it was slightly used.  Mild but noticeable smells like it hasn't seen fresh air in years.  Check in was... interesting, and I'll leave it at that.  Furnace/ac closet in bedroom was loud with clicking nose woke us out of sleep twice.  Fire alarm test or glitch for five seconds was an unexpected alarm clock early in the morning.  Only reason I gave two starts was because it has an updated appearance and the room was generally clean.  Probably wouldn't go back with all the other options available.

Text: I've stayed twice at this location and I couldn't be happier. The rooms are great. They have a good sized fridge and a mini kitchen. The morning buffet is pretty good too. The common areas include a decent gym, good sized pool, and even an outdoor fireplace. When I stay in Columbus in the future, I'll be staying here.
