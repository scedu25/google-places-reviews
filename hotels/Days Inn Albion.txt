Text: BEDBUGS!!! My wife was sitting on the bed feeding our 6 week old daughter when an adult bedbug runs across the bed! We packed up to leave. I began a more thorough inspection to find several more in the corners of the bed skirt!! I took pictures and video. Do not stay here!!!

Text: I've been here once before when it was under old management. My experience was not so good before, roaches, dirty pool, smelled like smoke, etc. This time under new management wasn't too much different. The bed was comfortable but we killed a roach in our room. The mattress had a little rip in it, pillows are too small for the bed, lamp shade ripped, check in took us almost an hour because they were over booked. No one really knew what they were doing. When it was check out day a man (house keeping) tried to force his way into one of my cousin's rooms taping on his watch. It was only 10:30am check out is at 11:00am. They had to yell at him to leave. My uncle had a issue checking out because the woman at the desk didnt know what she was doing. Other then all that our stay was okay.

Text: The first room we checked into didn't have a working air conditioner. The front desk clerk was super apologetic and quickly got us into another room. Inside the second room the TV did not work. We were pretty tired and said eff it. The entire room had patchwork repairs and such. It needed to be repainted. The doors were dirty and pretty beat up. Pretty sure there was a smashed cockroach on the wall of the bathroom. The heat lamp did not work. The whole place is in desperate need of renovation. The breakfast spread was pretty skimpy and the yogurt was expired. I can keep going but you get the idea...
