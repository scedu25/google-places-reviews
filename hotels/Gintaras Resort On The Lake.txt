Gintaras Resort On The Lake
Rating: 5
Text: BEAUTIFUL place. Had everything we needed; stove, fridge, 2 bedrooms, bathroom, and a roomy living room with a nice dining table. The best part was the view, we were right down the stairs and had a lovely view of the beach and lake. Plus there's a grill right outside and they keep the area very clean! Also if you're looking for a good place to eat or get groceries, it's all super close. I cannot wait to come back here!

Text: Peaceful and relaxing. Grounds are well cared for. Beach is amazing. Cottages are charming. They are expensive, but very nice for a special occasion.

Cosy autumn weekend in the Log Cabin.
Quick dip in the lake, dinner, song, games are all part of fun. Great accommodations at Gintaras.
