Text: We had to cancel our stay due to a family illness. They refused to acknowledge our cancellation and tried to say that we were a no show. If this is the way they handle issues like this, I can only imagine how poor the service is at the hotel. I will not be staying at Super8 again due to this.

Text: This hotel has a relatively good continmental breakfast but not a hot breakfast. Fortunately restaurants are very nearby. Bring your own sweetener and cream for coffee in your room. Not the usual for a Super 8.
