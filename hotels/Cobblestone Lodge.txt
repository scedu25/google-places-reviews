Text: Been going here 20 years, nuff said. Also, food is good, the friends you make are priceless, and the activities are always great. Cobblestone is really what you make it. Go down, be open to new experiences/ideas, make new friends and find a place you look forward to going back to year after year.

Text: Fun for families. Inexpensive and plenty of activities. Food was good enough to not plan on going somewhere for food. I will be back next year. I'm not over-flowery so don't read  this as "meh." I wouldn't have reviewed it unless it was good.

Text: Went with family for the weekend and had a very nice time. Cozy and lots of families without feeling crowded. Everyday events change to keep it interesting. No real complains, would visit again.
