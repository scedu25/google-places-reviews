Baymont Inn & Suites Bellevue
Rating: 5
Text: Loved the place.  Our private balcony overlooked the Mississippi River and reminded me of when we were at Captiva down in Florida it was so beautiful.  Our Suite was large and could easily be an apartment.  The free breakfast was very nice and just a typical Hotel full breakfast - not a private Chef down there doing the cooking for us but I was quite capable of being well fed.  I was quite surprised at the reasonable price of the Suite.  I will no doubt bring the grandchildren back for a river tour and targeting this as our place to stay.  There is a very nice bar and grill next to the hotel with good food.

Text: Not just nice for a Baymont inn, a legitimately top notch hotel. Get a river facing room, beautiful and stay at least two nights. Looking forward to my next stay in the Bellevue Baymont.

Text: View is amazing as is the food. Some trouble with booking rooms though. One day they are booked, I go on the cancellation list, buddy calls a few days later, 5 open rooms, no phone call for me. Other than that, was a very good time.

Text: Beautiful rooms, view, and service. The restaurant is wonderful also. Great food and service.  Not to mention the rates for what you get.  We have a gorgeous balcony view. Staying another night due to ALL above. Thank you?

Text: Went for an wedding. Great stay. Nice rooms. Balcony of our room made a loud whistling noise periodically but other than that it was good.
