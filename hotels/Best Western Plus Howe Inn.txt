Text: Had a marvelous experience here. Friendly staff, comfortable and cozy beds, spacious room and a spacious bathroom. Breakfast was wonderful and had more food choices than I expected! Highly recommend staying here. Will be back if I ever find myself in the Midwest again!

Text: Very pleasant stay.  Simple but plentiful hot breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausage/ham, busquirs and gravy or French toast); breakfast is all you can eat and is replenished as needed.  Staff are very pleasant.  Clean and well maintained hotel.  Only drawback is it is a long, dark drive (toll road) from ND after a late football game.

Text: This is a nice hotel.  The rooms are on the large size which is nice and the beds very comfortable.  Also everything was clean and looked very nice.  The only serious negative is the Internet service...it was almost useless as the bandwidth was too slow (pages would timeout/etc).  I did tell the staff about it and they were going to reboot the equipment which did seem to help for a short while but then it was back to poor bandwidth again.  If they can fix this i would have given them 5 stars...but Internet is important to us.

Text: Great place to stay over night in transit. The place is clean, room is a good size and internet was free. Reception was friendly. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Despite being a free breakfast, it included hot items like eggs and sausage. I would stay again.

Text: I worked here for a good year, and I want to say the owner, staff, and all management are amazing, loving and caring. They truly want the best and cleanest experience/stay for their customers. The staff there is awesome and I would highly recommend staying at this hotel as much as possible! (The pool is great too) :)
