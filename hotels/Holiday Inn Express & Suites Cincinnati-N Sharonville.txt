Text: There was an issue with my card to pay which caused by reservation to be cancelled.  I was told that they tried to call me but I never got a call.  The gentleman at the front desk was trying to fix it but it was quicker for me to make a new reservation on the mobile app and get my corporate rate. The floor of the tub was slanted on the sides so it was hard to stand up in for a guy my size. Also housekeeping don't fully look over the bathroom. There were two beer bottle lids on top of the mirror and there was a wash cloth damp and hanging in the shower. Overall it was clean and the guy at the front desk was nice and was trying to help but I don't think I would go back.

Text: Pretty basic HI, we got there pretty late at night, so i didn't get to check out the facility much. Room was clean, bedding was good, bed itself was decent as well. Had to drive a bit for food, but not too far. My favorite part was they actually had decent soap and shampoo, which is nice. Reasonable rate, no complaints.

Text: This is a great hotel. Clean and well maintained. The area feels safe and the parking lot is well lit. The pool area was warm and the area was welcoming. Breakfast was hot and restocked quickly when needed. Beds are great and the room was cozy. We stayed two nights and saw friendly staff all throughout the stay. I would stay here again.

Text: I was impressed be how friendly everyone was here at this hotel and this location in general. Stayed here for business in the Cincinnati area. Hotel was clean and well kept. Room was quiet. Couldn't ask for more.
