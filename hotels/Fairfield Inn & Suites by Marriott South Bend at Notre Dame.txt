Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott South Bend at Notre Dame
Rating: 5
Text: My favorite hotel to stay at. The front desk is very friendly and helpful. The housemaids keep the hotel so clean. I love the view of Notre dame and the tapestry in the building. When I have a problem, it's always fixed in a timely manner. The atmosphere reminds me of a home away from home.

Text: Decent hotel. Conveniently across Notre Dame and next to the Eddy Commons (with lots of restaurants). Parking is complimentary and staff are courteous and helpful. No refrigerator/microwave in rooms.

Text: Closest hotel to the University and the shops and eateries on Eddy Street.  The hotel was nicely decorated with Notre Dame memorabilia and very clean.  Breakfast was good.  My only complaint was the beds.  They were extremely creaky and the mattresses on both the beds in our room were sunken down in the middle.  They were not at all comfortable.  I mentioned it to the clerk at the front desk and she said there had been numerous complaints about the same thing in most of the rooms.  Marriott corporate was in the process of flipping and/or replacing all the mattresses.  I read a review from October of 2014 from the hotel website with the same complaint so apparently, their plans to change mattresses is just talk!!!

Text: Comfortable bed and sizable room although the set up of the work desk was cramped. While friendly front desk staff didn't respond to my message asking about delivering Advil to my room. No room service is available and outside food options were not included in guest information book.
