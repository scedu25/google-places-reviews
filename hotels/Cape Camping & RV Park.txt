Text: Beautiful campground, large grassy lots. Stayed in a Motorhome towing, pull through sites made it easy to not disconnect. Walked to nearby Sies Amigos for supper, excellent! Would highly recommend this place.

Text: Friendly staff, good rates, above average amenities, great location. They have cable, wifi, a pool, a put put course, a small pond to fish, Horeshoe pits and a volleyball area. The cities walking/biking trail goes right by it and is a short walk to the trails and facilities the Nature Center in one direction and the water park and city parks in the other. I travel a lot and this is one of the best RV parks I have had the pleasure of finding.
