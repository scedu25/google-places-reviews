Chicago Marriott Suites O'Hare
Rating: 5
Text: Amazing accommodations! Customer service at the front desk was phenomenal. We were there for an anniversary party in the city. The room was clean. I noticed a little dust on the ottoman and tray. But I am super particular about hotel rooms so this room exceeded my expectations. I would 100% stay here again and recommend to anyone. One suggestion, however, I wish the shuttle would operate within a 5 mile radius other than airport pick up. Props to the pick up though. They were always on time and fast.

Text: Rooms are really nice here. There is also an airport shuttle but be careful and make sure you tell the driver you are going to the Marriott suites or you may be taken to another Marriott, as there are multiple nearby. happened to me. Well equipped gym and nice pool. Only drawback is there is no Marriott lounge here.

Text: The room was fantastic! The bed was very comfortable. We had two private parties in three days, and had their daily brunch on the first morning there. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful. We will definitely stay there again.

Text: The location is very good - beautiful surroundings and the hotel itself is well built to be pleasing to the eye. The room was laid out although the bed sheet on my pull down bed was torn on one end which would not be expected on a hotel of this standard. But the customer service is good.

Text: Nice hotel, but there is no free wifi, which is almost unheard of these days. It seemed like a location that charged for all the extras because they expected a lot of business travelers who wouldn't mind that policy. I had to mark it down simply because the value wasn't quite there for the high price.
