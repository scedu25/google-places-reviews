Text: This place has bed bugs. Will never go back to this place. When we asked for our money back they told us they couldn't give it back to us. We would have to call back and talk to the manager after 2 pm. The employee was rude and so was the lady that checked us in. No wonder they don't make any money.

Text: The people here where very nice . They were very apoligetic about the renovation process . They updated there rooms and mine was very clean and more modern .  They have a great convience store with everything you can imagine and the staff was so helpful. On site they have a full bar and restaurant with home cooked food and a very resonable prices and great staff.  The restaurant bar made you feel so welcomed. I will continue to come there

Text: Informed front desk of ants in the room and crawling on me at night, no phones in the room, dirty nasty carpet and chairs. Complained to manager about housekeeping staff being inexperienced.  When you put the Do Not Disturb sign on your door for privacy and security they enter your room anyway.  The staff threw my legal papers in the trash or stole them for identity theft.   I would never recommend this dump

Text: This place is horrendous.  Don't stay here.  Bed bugs and incredibly rude workers.  One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at
