Text: Had stayed last weekend, the hotel itself was really nice, clean. Savannah was really kind at the front desk at check in. The room was very nice as well. The only downside was that there was a centipede in the bathroom. On the Saturday morning,  we had asked the front desk to have someone come to the room and get it, the second time I had gone to ask the reply the girl at the front at that time gave me was, "I called but no one answered, i can call again but i don't know if it will be too late." Wasn't really the response i expected considering i come from a family of hotel owners. Besides that, It was a nice hotel, and the breakfast attendants were really nice and helpful as well.

Text: Always a great place to stay in Portage! Rooms are spacious, staff is awesome! I really like the close proximity of the local restaurants. I can walk to Quaker Steak and Lube, Longhorn Steakhouse, El Salto Mexican, and Subway to name a few.
I highly recommend staying here if you are in Portage.

Text: If you have a family then staying here should be your first option. The pool area was my favorite part because it offers a kiddy area for  smaller children and a game room inside. There are fresh baked cookies and fresh fruit at the front desk for your pleasure which my children loved. The rooms are nice and spacious so little ones have room to run around and the hotel is walking distance from multiple different eateries. Overall I'd definitely come again.

Text: Love this place! Very nice and clean, great staff. Had several birthday parties going on during our stay so the hotel staff surprised us & upgraded our room to a suite!
