Text: They heavily advertise in their photos a gathering held in a tent with a band. Looked like a great time! However, we only wanted to hold our ceremony there. My fiancé and I toured the location and really liked it (it's beautiful, I will give them that and that only). We were told that we could have a tent as an inclement weather backup but most people rent another location entirely for a backup because of the costs of tents. NO MONEY BACK should the weather force us to another location. Assuming we were not being lied to, I put in a great amount of work finding a tent that would be worth the money. I even stopped looking at other venues, figuring I found our spot. I email the manager of this location to confirm that a tent of the size I found would fit only to find that a "miscommunication" had occurred. Neighbors complained about tents and they don't allow them, even for a half hour ceremony. I also requested if our date was available and was sent back confirming the wrong date, more carelessness. My suggestion is to definitely go elsewhere!
