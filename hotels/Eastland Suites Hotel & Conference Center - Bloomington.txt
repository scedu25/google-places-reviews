Eastland Suites Hotel & Conference Center - Bloomington
Rating: 5
Text: The room was clean and nice and the bed was comfortable. Staff was extremely friendly and the breakfast was nice. It would be a nice place to stay in the summer since there is a nice outdoor area and a fire pit.

Text: A great place to stay. Comfortable beds with comfy pillows, large refrigerators and open kitchen. Not your typical place yet very affordable. Free buffet breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon, sweets, juice and a waffle-maker if your are not in a hurry. Extremely pleasant staff. The semi-private community patio area was very nice too!
