Text: We have been returning to Blackhawk's Trail Lodge for several years during all seasons.  Not only is it a beautiful location, but the owners, Dee & Becky are the greatest host & hostess we have ever meet.  Their rooms are very comfortable and have everything you could need.  We strongly suggest for you to get a group of friends together for a weekend trip and enjoy the best shrimp boil this side of the mason dixon line.  It is also a wonderful place for a couple to get away for a relaxing time, during the week or weekend.  We have been there three occasions this year and are looking forward to our Labor Day weekend.  Dee & Becky are the best.
