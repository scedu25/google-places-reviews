Cardinal Inn Hotel and Event Center

Text: For the price this is one of the nicest hotels that I’ve ever stayed in. Very clean, quiet and most importantly affordable. I rolled in at 2 AM and there was someone to greet me with a smile and was very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The worst hotel I have ever been to! Staff was not professional, she couldn't even use the computer. There was mold on the air condition unit! The pub was located near the rooms, the noise from drunks was obnoxiously loud and rude! And front desk offered no help with the situation. The Television was broken and the continental breakfast was not ready at the posted time.  Do not waste your money! We would have rather slept in our vehicle!

Text: Clean and the rooms are decently big.  A room this size would easily be 180+ in any big city. Beds are comfy.
 No pool or gym and also no microwave in the room.
but they have a bar in the lobby and free WiFi.
 I would stay here again.
