Text: This is a great place to bring my boys...whether we stay a couple hours on the trails and playground or we stay camping for the weekend. The park grounds are immaculate and the restrooms are clean. My son's class came here recently on a cold day and when they arrived, the grounds keepers had a big fire going in the pavilion! And with plenty of fire wood to throw on!

Text: Extremely nice, well kept park. Spotless shower house with warm water. Excellent sites with lots of shade. Very friendly and accommodating host/personnel. Will definitely stay there again.

Text: There is no place nearby to get firewood and it isn't nearly isolated enough from cities. You can hardly see any stars because of the glow from nearby cities. Would have been a two if not for the awesome camp host who gave us wood from his personal stash for free.
