Text: Stayed here in early spring. Very spacious and shaded along with flat sites. Kids loved having multiple playgrounds to run to. The camp store has everything you need. Can bring your own wood. Will be visiting again

Text: Great camp store, okay playground, cool pedal cars and boats available for rent. The arcade is old and busted but the mini golf was good enough. Staff was nice and Christmas in July was a fun idea.

Text: I love the tall shade trees that cover the entire camp. There is a boat ramp and a swimming area on the lake. We were able to bring our dogs. The lots are rather tight. Nice place. I love the name, lol.

Text: They maintain this Park impeccably. There is always something fun to do. The lake access is plentiful and the people they attract are friendly and outgoing. Highly recommend.
