Text: The stay here was nice, the staff was really nice, it's a good location if you want to go to starved Rock about 10 minutes away. The walls aren't super thin like some other super 8 this one was well maintained. The only issue I had was the breakfast room was small for the amount of people it has staying. Only 6 tables with four chairs a piece while the food is set up for a lot more. Went down at 8:30 on a Saturday and it was so full I decided not to eat because lack of places to sit. Other than that I would totally stay here again. In fact I should be back in a month or so to check out the cupcake place again and even walk on a few trails in the area.
