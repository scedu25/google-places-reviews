Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Marion, IL
Rating: 5
Text: The Country Inn & Suites in Marion, IL. was amazing. The hotel offers a workout room with a fair amount of options. The indoor pool was a plus. Especially as we were traveling during the last week of October. They offered a pretty hearty complimentary breakfast. As far as hotels go, the Country Inn & Suites offers all the bells and whistles.

As far the room themselves, the word I would use to describe it is "Impressive." The room was huge. It includes a living room that just made the room all the better. It had a couch that had a foldout bed which came in very handy that night. The bathroom was just as huge and incredibly convenient. I can't say enough nice things about the Country Inn & Suites in Marion, IL.

Text: Had a great stay. Loved that it was pet friendly. There's a grassy area out back to take your four legged friend. They have a baggie station out there so they really thought of everything. Very clean and comfortable. They even had homemade chocolate chip cookies waiting for you at the front desk. Will stay again.

Text: My family stayed hear while travelling from Utah to Florida. It is nice and clean, and the staff is hard working and professional. Jon Schmidt was helpful and kept the place nice and clean. The room was very comfortable and was a good rate. My wife and I and our six children were all able to comfortably sleep in one room. Our only regret was that we were in a hurry to get to Florida and couldn't enjoy the pool and other amenities, but the breakfast was wonderful. Jon Schmidt needs to check out the Piano Guys, as Jon Schmidt is the name of one of the Piano Guys and they are awesome! :) Thank you Country Inn & Suites for a nice stay.

Text: The location was great with several options for food and entertainment nearby. The rooms were large and modern and very clean. Staff was very friendly. The pool area was great but does not have a hot tub which was a bit of a disappointment. The complimentary breakfast was very good and well stocked. All in all it was a very good visit and we would definitely stay here again.

Text: I am giving this place a 5 star rating. My wife is handicapped and has a service dog. I found out this motel is pet friendly witch is nice for the Country Inn system, when most of them are not. The management was very concerned that they did not have a handicapped room when we got there, but did have a ground floor room. Also the breakfast was very good. I did talk with the management and told them I was going to inform the place we get our service dogs from that this motel is a very good place to stay at.
