Text: So these might not be the most beautiful trailers on the outside, but you can do a lot with the interior,  and the landlords here are absolutely fantastic with being on top of repairs! 
You won't find anything better for the price in Carbondale, (trust me I looked everywhere), and it's really quiet here.

Text: I rented here from 2007 through 2009 and it was the best place I lived in the Carbondale area.  It is safe, quiet, Tammy is a wonderful property manager, maintenance was quick to respond to calls, GREAT price for the square footage and close proximity to the university and local businesses, storage units are available in the park as well as a laundry facility.  I really loved it here.  Very relaxing and spacious.  Too bad prices aren't this good in St. Petersburg, Florida where I live now-- haha!  I recommend Saluki Homes rentals and Tammy as a great property manager and her husband as an excellent maintenance manager. Thank you both for 2 wonderful years living in a safe community.

Text: Very friendly, and will do anything to help you if you have a problem. Landlords are very down to earth and understanding, and the maintenance works are quick when it comes to repairs. They also do a great job of notifying renters of any situations that are occurring and I honestly feel safe living here. I once left for a month and a half and forgot to lock my front door and when i came back nothing was out of place and I didn't worry to much about it while I was away because I knew everyone who lived in the park is friendly and neighborly. Great place for anyone to live.
