Text: Roaches, no towels and a stench of cat pee.... This has get to be one of the worst places I've stayed in a very long time. You need to skip this one if you can afford it.

Text: Rooms smell but I think they are putting in new carpets. Beds are small. My stay was for three months. Pet friendly. front office have their days. housekeeping is ok. you have to ask them to clean your room if you need too. however, housekeeping knocks on your door if you don't make the checkout time. Next door neighbor's party on weekdays, they have kept us awake most nights. 
I suggest you stay next door at Best Western.

Text: DONT STAY HERE! I just stayed there last weekend with my boyfriend for my 21st birthday and they have bedbugs ! BED BUUUUGS!!!! We went to go to sleep and I got bit 10+ times in the first hour. Ending up leaving at 5 a.m didn't even stay for a half of a day. Ruined my birthday, and ruined me ever wanting to stay at a hotel again.
