The Lodge Hotel & Banquets St. Louis Airport

Text: The staff was very accommodating. They get the the 3 stars. However, I'm covered in bedbug bite's, 1st floor room had roaches on the walls, & in the beds. Room 306 was good. Then went back, I had room 308,  That room has bedbugs. 
Some shady characters walking around trying doors, cause they know security guards are sleeping. 
Not a bad place to stay if you're looking for something affordable. Check your room before you commit to it. 
The hotel needs a renovation

Text: The rooms were big enough, but the sink had burn marks and the pluming didn't work well. There wasn't a garbage can in the room. The pool and hot tub was nice.

Text: Don't even go here as a last resort, better off sleeping in your car. 

None of the lights worked except for the one for the bathroom area. Multiple mysterious stains on the wall. Stained towels. The a/c felt more like a fan moving air. 
My girlfriend and her friend walked to the car to get something and were harassed but strangers and followed back to the room.

Text: I am familiar with this hotel, do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to stay.  Rooms are dirty, the hotel is dirty and the pool is dirty.  Many guest staying here seem to be seedy and not the kind you want your family around.
  What was once a nice hotel has now become a flop house.
