The Hotel at Kirkwood Center
Rating: 2
Text: apparently (per prior reviews) the Hotel at Kirkwood Center cannot handle high-capacity booking periods. a block was held for a wedding this coming weekend, and again, weekend of a big football game, rooms (that were booked months ago) were revoked last minute (within the last week) for both my family and others. Luckily, the manager handled it by finding other rooms but this overbooking and handling visiting football teams need to be handled better with NOTICE ESPECIALLY TO A WEDDING BLOCK. I would think the previous error would have prevented this. At least a few weeks notice and acknowledgement of the error would have helped, rather than the day before the stay. I understand that errors happen and acknowledge that management handled it OK for the current situation, but it could have been easily prevented.

Text: The Hotel at Kirkwood Center is the best hotel in Eastern Iowa. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms are great. I try to stay there when I'm in Cedar Rapids. Sometimes they sell out because the hotel is attached to the Kirkwood Center so plan accordingly. A great place for meetings and events. The restaurant and bar are top notch. The in-room dining is great, too.

Text: If you're going to lie to your customers you better have your story together. Hotel staff called and told me on the day of my arrival that there "was something wrong with a room" so they couldn't host us. When I asked what was wrong with the room, I got a long pause and then a lot of mumbling and stumbling. I confronted the staff with my theory that they were kicking us out because they overbooked on a University of Iowa home football weekend. She didn't even argue it. 
All I wanted was one night in an upscale hotel bed and no baby crying. I wanted it so bad I booked the occasion in May. Nearly five months of anticipation were crushed.
The property is lovely. They booked us at another hotel (not nearly as nice). If not for these two things, I would have given them one star for this mess.

Text: The food at The Class Act restaurant is phenomenal! The service is amazing (Lyndze is amazing, ask for her!). They also have an electric vehicle charging station. They earn their 4 diamond AAA rating!
