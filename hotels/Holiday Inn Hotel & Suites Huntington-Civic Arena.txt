Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Huntington-Civic Arena
Rating: 5
Text: Great hotel! Within short walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and a movie theater. Very large rooms, comfortable beds and linens, and always very clean. I’m here at least once a week for work overnights and have never had a bad experience. Great work everyone, other hotels should strive to have the quality of stay offered here.

Text: Our motorcycle broke down in the middle of nowhere. The hotel was the only one near the repair shop, but 35 miles from break down point. $280. When I asked about the breakfast I was told the price did not include it. Bottom line...a very expensive hotel, a Holiday Inn, for...a room...eh. I've stayed at nicer places for far less. That being said...it was very clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly.

Text: Nice hotel. Disappointed you have to pay for breakfast. Never paid for it in NYC at the HI. Cleaning staff didn't so much in our room but empty trash and tuck the sheets in. Staff was nice.

Text: The best thing about this hotel is there are decent places to eat walkable. The towing is overly aggressive, as we were towed in the time it took us to check in one year, before we could even put the ticket in the window. Rooms are decent, but the real reason for only rating 3 star is no outlets by the bed. Get with it people, every hotel should at bare minimum have a lamp with at least 2 plugs by the bed. This drives me crazy, everyone uses a phone. Cool little town for a short visit though.
