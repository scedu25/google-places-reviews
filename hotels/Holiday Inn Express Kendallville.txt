Holiday Inn Express Kendallville

Text: Not the worst hotel I've stayed in, but not one of the better Holiday Inn Express locations.

The front desk and dining area staff were very professional and courteous any time of the day or night.  The dining area, lobby, pool, and work out room were clean, neat and well lit, the hot tub was just right at the end of the day.  Our room was nice at check in, aside from smell of cigarette smoke.  On the first day we noticed that the sink drain was clogged enough to take several minutes to drain.  That stayed the same up to the day we left and may still be clogged.  The room was never cleaned until the day before we checked out.  Until then the bed was never made and we had to ask for clean towels repeatedly at the front desk.  I was told that they had a new cleaning crew at the time.  No, that is an incompetent or unwilling crew and an incapable supervisor not doing their job.

 Overall not horrible but will try another hotel next time.

Text: Staff was professional.  Not the nicest Holiday Inn I've ever stayed in, however not horrible.  Cable was in and out.  No answer when I called the desk about it.  Breakfast was good though.

Text: People was nice but the room wasn't cleaned right. Tub had black staff all around it and hair the window had no screen in it only opened a little bit watermarks on mirror and the bed was so worn out I slept rough. $150.08 for this room wasn't worth it. Obtw the food was cold heat wasn't on.

Text: Stayed just one night but it was a really good stay. Room was nice, breakfast was really good and the gentlemen behind the counter were very nice.
