Walnut Ridge Campground
Rating: 1
Text: Looking for a seasonal  campsite , was informed campsites were available. After quizzing us on make, model and year we were denied because only campers under 10 years old are allowed at Walnut Ridge. If we are not good enough for their campground, we will take our servicing elsewhere. You have lost a long term customer. Talk about a double standard!
