Text: Way, way, (way) overpriced for a hotel with no pool. Room was very shabby. The A/C worked well but the vent was disgusting with dirt and who knows what trapped underneath. It looks like a 12 year old painted the room with slops everywhere. Fridge/micro in room -actually, 2 microwaves, but one was broken. TV picture quality was abysmal. The furniture looked like it had been gnawed on by a pack of teething puppies. It was a handicapped room so there was a seat in the shower...I have no words to describe. Someone made an attempt to recover the bench when it looks like it should have been replaced altogether. But they covered it with non waterproof canvas, only the top surface though, the fabric didn't wrap around and wasn't secured to the underside. There's no way I would have sat my bare bottom on it, if it was even able to bear weight, which is iffy. I did a bug check before I let the family in the room, no evidence of bed bugs to my untrained eye, but we did see a cockroach in the room as we were leaving. We left all the luggage in the car when we got home just in case. Everything is going right in the washer as a precaution. On the plus side, the room seemed clean, housekeeping looks like they were doing an ok job, and the sheets and towels looked and smelled clean thankfully. The front desk people were nice. Waffles, juice, cold cereal, bagels, pastry for breakfast. Coffee/tea always available. Ton of family friendly restaurants nearby, and a Walmart across the street.
