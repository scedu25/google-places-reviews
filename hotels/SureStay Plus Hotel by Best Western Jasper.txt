After posting this review, someone from the hotel called and apologized which I really appreciate. The staff are very nice. I can't in good conscience give it a very high rating but I will give an extra star for customer service.

My air conditioning unit cycled on and off every 2-3 minutes but my room was still way too hot. The hotel smells bad at the back entrance. There is no elevator which sucks with a large suitcase. My TV remote didn't work. I'm not sure why Best Westerns in general think conditioning shampoo is a thing people want. It is not 1980 anymore. The breakfast was fine but I usually don't expect a lot so that wouldn't have made me dislike the hotel. The only positive is the check in staff member was very nice and friendly and the rooms have a mini fridge.

Text: Clean hotel that has recently been remodeled. I needed a hotel where I felt safe for one night while traveling for work. The pool looked nice and breakfast the next morning was great.

Text: First time I stayed it was under renovations and had to stay in the older section of the hotel price was only 50.00 but the rooms was clean. The second time I stayed the cost was 100.00 but was in the newly renovated section and was awesome super nice rooms staff is extremely friendly and there is a full breakfast type bar. Even have one of those waffle machines. Coffee is good too.
