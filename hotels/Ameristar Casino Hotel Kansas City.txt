Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City

Text: A great place to distract yourself for a few hours.  Take your time! Play the slots and enjoy the people watching.  The table games are great and the employees are helpful.  If you are hungry, give the deli a try.  The food is very good.

Text: I love going to Ameristar. It is my second home. Would take my Aunt here three to four times a week before she passed last year. She looked forward to getting out of the house. And never failed she'd always walk out with winnings. The staff were like a second family to me since I didn't gamble. I made a ton of friends while walking around there to kill time until time to leave. I will always visit this place. It holds many wonderful memories for me.

Text: Have been here a few times off and on through out the years, and honestly I can never get enough of the beauty of this place. The ceiling is amazing, the arcade is great and the actual casino is pretty nice. The buffet is REALLY expensive but the food is delicious. One of these days we'll drop our kids off at the kid land place. Have heard great things about it.

Text: We went for their buffet special all-you-can-eat crab legs. While it's rather expensive, about 35 dollars per person, they have a variety of options from Asian cuisine to BBQ and of course crab legs. Our waitress was excellent and very attentive. Afterwards, we went to play the penny slots at the casino. The atmosphere is very nice and decently clean. There was a bit of a smokey cigarette smell in the casino area as you are allowed to smoke in there - I personally did not like it because I'm a non-smoker with allergies, however it could be a plus to smokers who would appreciate being able to smoke while playing in the casino.
