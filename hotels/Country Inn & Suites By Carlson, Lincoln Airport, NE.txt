Text: My kids and I really enjoyed our stay here! The extras such as cookies, lemon water,  hot coffee with plenty of additions and hot water always available was awesome! Housekeeping always did a great job, I loved the detail such as folding the toilet paper. I also liked all the mirrors in the room. We would definitely stay there again!

Text: From the outside, the place looks a bit dated, but inside is very modern, and the rooms are very nice as well. The staff we all experience was very friendly, and the breakfast was very good as well. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The place was nice and very comfortable. Not as clean as it seems at first look though. However it was a very nice room and had everything that is to be expected in a room like microwave and refrigerator.
