Potawatomi Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Potawatomi Inn isn't fancy but it is clean, very comfortable,  very friendly and a favorite place for me, my husband and my sisters and their husbands.  The setting on Lake James is beautiful,  calming and serene. There are all kinds of activities all year round: boating, hiking, a nature center, swimming, and a great toboggan run all winter long (if there isn't snow they make it; and the rails are frozen).  The dining room is great and the food delicious.  My sisters and I have met two friends there every year for at least 15 yrs. We have a blast.

Text: Great lodge and conference center. I have stayed here numerous times and enjoyed my stay each time. The food is excellent and the service is great. The grounds are beautiful. Stay here and you will not regret it.

Text: Fantastic place for a family vacation. Clean open beach and calm clear lake great for all watersports. Jennifer in their reservations was AWESOME when we had a question or concern. Deena at the front desk was welcoming and friendly and Eli at the boat dock could not have been more helpful. From the abundant hiking trails to the convenient sand volleyball to the large rooms, they continue to improve. We have been coming here for 16 years and it just keeps getting better (upgraded furniture in lobby and lounges and new sheets).

Text: Beautiful lodge in a beautiful setting.  We stayed in the newer section of the lodge.  The room was a nice size, 2 queen beds.  The shower was not the greatest - not great flow or consistent temperature.  Lodge had nice amenities and a good Sunday brunch.

Text: The beds and bedding have all been replaced. Rooms are clean. Staff is accommodating and friendly. There is still plenty of updating that could be done, but it's moving in the right direction. We've been coming here about 14 years and it's great to see the place is finally getting some attention. The food is slightly better than it has been the last few years. We used to eat every meal here. Now we have decided that breakfast is decent. Lunch, meh. Dinner we haven't tried. All in all, we love this place.
