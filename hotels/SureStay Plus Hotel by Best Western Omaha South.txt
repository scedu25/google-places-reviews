SureStay Plus Hotel by Best Western Omaha South
Rating: 3
Text: Not a bad place to stay. We got in really late and it was raining outside. Got the keys quickly but half the room's floor was wet. They moved us to another and that one was fine. Breakfast was ok. We got there about an hour before it closed and the milk was gone and no one came to check on it and no one at the front desk. It could be a fun and nice stay as the rooms have different US presidents and information about them but it was a cheap hotel.

Text: Should have zero stars. THIS IS NOT a BEST WESTERN! You pay only for the name "best western" but the hotel is run down and gross. The staff were not friendly. The room had smuges and dirt all over the walls. The lighting was so blinding we had to unscrew two of the three light bulbs in the bathroom. Every light in the room was abnoxiosly bright... so much so that we only used that one light bulb in the bathroom and could see the entire room as though it were lite. The closet door had a sticky substance along the opening, and the door wouldn't shut properly. We stay at best western Numberous times a year, it's our preferred hotel because of the quality we've come to expect. It's deplorable that best western has attached its name to this discussing hotel. If we hadn't been so tired and hadn't gotten in so late we would have left immediately.

Text: My room was gross there was stains on the walls, the comforters, the lampshade, and the towels. The price was still as high as other hotels that were nicer. Will not come back
