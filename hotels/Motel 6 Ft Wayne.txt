Motel 6 Ft Wayne

Text: Do not stay here. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and hostels over the years, and this was by far the worst. The room was clearly dirty. I think there was wing sauce on the box-spring cover. The carpet wasn't swept. There was no hot water.

During my stay, I actually felt bad that I had brought my kids to this place.

The only redeeming value of the place was that the front-desk staff was friendly. It's also extremely inexpensive if that's your only consideration.

Text: This was the worst stay I have ever experienced with motel 6. The place should be burned and condemned. There is no why that place passes health code. Bodily fluids on the beds.. drugs on the floor.. stains on the carpet.. pee all over the toilet.. rust in the shower.. mold on the walls in the bathroom and on the air conditioner. Would not recommend anyone staying here.

Text: The price is the only good thing. It is right next to 2 strip clubs and a truck stop, it isn't a safe or clean place for most. 
The front attendant was very nice. The room smelled of cigarette smoke, as well as the bedding. I didn't feel safe to stay the night and left at dark. The bathroom was very clean. I am sure this is fine for some people to crash, but not for me. Tv is tiny and wifi doesn't work!!

Text: Since I previously stayed in a Motel 6 not two weeks ago and had a good experience, I did not think there would be any issues. The area felt unsafe and had two strip clubs right next to it. All the rooms claim to be non-smoking but smelled like smoke. The first thing we did when we entered the room was call the front desk because our toilet was clogged. The bathroom floor looked like it had not been cleaned in months and had visible dirt as well as the shower which my friends and myself did not feel safe using. The carpet was literally sticky and we did not walk barefoot on the floor at all. The beds were so old, it felt like I was sleeping on a box-spring and the air-conditioning was cool but could not be adjusted. Even the hallways looked like they had not been cleaned in months. The only thing positive about this location is the workers who were all very nice but really should be trained better on how to clean a hotel room. The price was cheap but I feel like I should have been paid to sleep here. If we had the time, we definitely would have asked for our money back and found somewhere else to stay. This has made me never want to come back to Fort Wayne ever again.

Text: I'm really not positive if this is the correct room or not. But I stayed at one in Indiana that was great and the manager was freaking awesome it's one of the newly renovated ones but the other one sucked. If this is the completely renovated one deserves 5 stars if it's not 1 star all the way around except the housekeepers were friendly sociable and beautiful. Everyone else and everything else sucked.
