Text: Traveling across country and stopped after 15 hours driving straight.  As soon as we entered we were immediately greeted and taken care of by Erin at the front Desk. She was super flexible with us and very accommodating. This location is very modern and updated and SUPER clean.  A gem to find on the road after traveling with great customer service !

Text: Room was quiet and comfortable. However, room had musty/smoke odor. Additionally, room was dusty in places. Upon inspecting fridge, I found a science experiment someone before me left. I often stay at HIE, so I was sort of shocked that they wanted $15 just to eat breakfast. This might work in New York, but such pricing is an insult to the history  of the HI brand.

Text: One of the nicer Holiday Inns. Large Commons area, all the staff are great. I've stayed here a few times and the place is consistently clean and employees nice.

Text: I made reservations for three rooms nearly one year in advance for a graduation event.  We chose this hotel because we were able to reserve a suite which would be used to host graduation guests.  I completed an online confirmation two days in advance of our travel dates and the king suite was still available.  However, upon check-in, I was informed that the room was no longer available and that only a typical room was available as a replacement.  Thankfully we had not purchased, in advance, all the food we planned to prepare and serve in the suite.  No apology or advance phone call was offered.

The room was clean, but the closet had trash in it when we arrived.  

The breakfast was fine, but the first morning of our stay the breakfast took over 45 minutes to be served after ordering. 

We have reserved rooms for guests at the Vanderbilt Holiday  Inn in Nashville, and this hotel doesn't come close to meeting those standards.
