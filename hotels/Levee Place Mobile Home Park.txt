Text: They charge 5 dollars a month for a "pet fee". They say its to keep the lawn up after the pets do their business.
When a tenant explained there cat was de-clawed and NEVER went outside? Ha! It didn't matter. They still had to pay it. Pure greed.
You pay it or you are evicted, and that is the one thing this new management is good at. There were people in trailers on either side of me when Ultra 2 LLC took over. They are both empty now. 
Lots of empty trailers throughout the park. Abandoned. Literally. Since Ultra 2 LLC took over, it's been a long days journey into night.
Two months ago, my lot rent jumped 39 percent because of the sewage and water change. 39 percent my friends, is financially crippling.
I asked the manager why didn't they give me a heads up about this outrageous increase and she said, "We assumed you would know about it, because it's been in the newspaper, and on the news."
Can you believe that? Yea, I couldn't either, and I was hearing to it. All true and I kid you not.
They know most people can't afford to move their trailers, or they are too old to move.
And they use that as leverage, my friends. They use that against them.
So if all of this sounds good to you, then come on down.
We got lotsa room.
