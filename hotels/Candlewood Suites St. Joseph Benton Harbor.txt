Candlewood Suites St. Joseph/Benton Harbor
Rating: 4
Text: Very basic extended-stay hotel, but quite acceptable. Excellent choice of borrowable kitchen equipment and dvd's, and the facility was clean and well-maintained. Two burner stove, refrigerator and microwave in my room. Personally, I never used any of that because I was only staying for one night, but I would not hesitate to return.

Text: Newly renovated. Reasonably priced. Near everything we wanted to do. Easy access to interstate. Close to beach. Rooms are recently remodeled and spacious. Full kitchen. Rooms look good and function well. Free self serve laundry available. A nice selection available from a pantry that includes dozens of dvds to a blender and a multitude of other items available to borrow. Reasonably priced snacks and drinks are available in a snack area. No pool or breakfast served. Nice patio area and exercise room. Staff friendly.

Text: Extended stay type place. Typically more guestss during the week. Convenient location just off interstate. Easy to reach St. Joseph beach area without the busy traffic. Recently renovated with a few things not finished when we were there last month. Free laundry was a plus. Family emergency necessitated extending our stay there day by day and the staff was extremely accomodating and appreciated. Will definitely stay there again if we're in the area.
