University Inn
Rating: 5
Text: I checked in during the mid-evening of Sat., Aug/5/2017. There was only one room left, a suite, but since I was alone, the clerk let me have it at a slight discount. The University Inn is a vintage property that is kept clean and well maintained. The grounds were recently mowed and manicured and there was no litter on grounds. Likewise, the room was clean and everything was in order. I looked thoroughly through the room and found nothing amiss. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this to friends and plan to stay there again myself, if travel takes me to Angola. Conveniently adjacent to Timbers Restaurant

Text: The location around the hotel is beautiful, but the hotel was worn down and very unkempt. People lived there and I felt like we were going to fall through the floor.

Text: Parking lot needs work done it's patchy in places. Other then that the rooms are OK and it's not that expensive to stay the night. Overall if u just needed a place to stay for the night this wouldn't be a bad place.

Text: It was nice. The on cite manager did her best to make us happy. The manager was good too they accommodated most of the things we needed. The only thing i have bad to say is the comforteres were a little warn. The matnice guy was pretty quick to get something taking care of. I didnt mind it had i not had a conflict with a person there. I would have stayed. The prices were good.
