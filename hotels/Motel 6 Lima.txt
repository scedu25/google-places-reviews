Motel 6 Lima

Text: My stay was very enjoyable! The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The morning staff were very friendly and hospitable, the evening staff... not so much. My only complaint was that after checking in I went down to the desk to ask for an extra pillow or two, and the woman working the desk told me no. I manage a hotel, so I understand that sometimes you are running short on pillows/pillowcases, but the way she handled the situation was unsatisfactory. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: I'm often nervous when staying at an inexpensive motel - will it be clean? Will it have any amenities? Will I like it?  No need to be nervous here. The room was clean, everything I needed was included, the staff was pleasant and helpful. It was well worth the price.

Text: I wish they had carpet outside of the bathroom in front of the sink. It's weird walking on vinyl floors after showering, don't know how clean the floor is. Other than that it is a good room

Text: We stayed at the Motel 6 in Lima for several days in July and again in August 2017.  I was curious to see the purported upgrades in the rooms.  We were in Room 121, a non-smoking accessible room (walk-in shower) both times.  We experienced quality and service issues during both visits.  The upgrades seemed to have been done more quickly than carefully.  Walls were not fully covered with new paint.  The toilet was not level and the old seal had not been removed from the floor.  The shower floor was very slippery; for safety, we finally bought our own tub mat. On several occasions the room was only partially serviced and on one day not at all.  We had to ask for more bath linens.  On the day when the room had not been serviced, the night manager finally came and changed the sheets while we sat on the other bed.  On our last visit, the sheets on one bed were disgustingly "pilly" and the bedspreads had multiple cigarette burns.  The replacement bedspreads also had cigarette burns!

The staff were responsive to our concerns, but there were just too many issues for us to want to try again.  We will not go back.  To their credit, we did receive a nice discount on our first stay due to the problems.

Text: Small, noise bed. It's better option to add some more money and go to a better hotel in this area. There is a some kind of truck parking, on the other side of the street
