Gosherd Valley Cottage
Rating: 5
Text: Lovely little cottage on a working goose farm. Connie, the owner, is a wonderful host and has turned this cottage into a true delight. Just far enough outside Hermann, yet close enough for those who want to spend time there. The cottage is private and set in a beautiful wooded area. You'll fall in love with Connie's many dogs (if you're a dog lover) and all of the amenities & decorations in the cottage. Plenty of sleeping quarters for up to 6 and a very nice kitchen (fully loaded) & deck.  Highly recommend this place for a secluded getaway, especially for those who are open to exploring all of the undiscovered treasures in the area.

Text: This is the most amazing B&B. Very clean and stocked with local farmers foods. Connie is most accommodating and a pleasure to know. Just 20 miles from the wineries a place you do not want to leave!  
Thank you Connie for sharing this amazing place with us!
