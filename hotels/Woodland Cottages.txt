Woodland Cottages
Rating: 3
Text: These are charming cottages that I would consider high end camping or a budget motel with no TV or WiFi.  The normal house keeping items were clean (bed linens, bathroom, etc), but paint was peeling, there was a corner of the room that's hadn't been swept in some time, and the cieling fan was so dusty I climbed up on a chair with a dirty sock to clean before turning on.  All said I would consider staying again due to the beautiful setting.

Text: The cottages are nice and roomy. I was okay with no TV. I was slightly inconvenienced with no Wi-Fi. It was a little warm during the day with no AC, but okay at night. What I really missed was having a table where we could eat or play cards.

Text: Showers (with soap and shampoo/conditioner), linens, and coffee, all for a reasonable price!
