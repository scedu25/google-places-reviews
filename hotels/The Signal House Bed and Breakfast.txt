The Signal House Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Just spent a wonderful night at this beautiful B&B on the river. Accommodations were great with antiques & lovely decor through out the historical home. Breakfast was a made from scratch treat complete with homemade bread, fresh fruit, and Vic & Betsy's raspberry jam. Heavenly. The quiche with cheddar & bacon was delicious & hearty enough for a busy day of boating. Exceeded all expectations. Our hosts could not have been more accommodating and the cost was less than a stay at a run of the mill motel.
