Pioneer Village Campground
Rating: 2
Text: We were running late and needed to find a place to park our 40' Class A motorcoach. Not much around. This place is really old and not well maintained but we got full 50 amp service including water and sewer. Good WiFi, wide sites and level gravel pads and good TV reception. That is the good things. Bad is that a railroad track is about 500 feet away and comes by, way too often. Would have been a deal at $20-$25 but at almost $42 which includes tax, that is way too much for what you get. No bathroom ir dhower facilities. But like I said, it's the only park in the area. Good news is they give you one free ticket to Pioneer Village right next foor which is worth $14.

Text: First time here. Never again.  In total dis-repair. Facilities closed up and rat traps setting around.  Motel falling apart. Restaurant for lease.   More dump than campground. I'd be embarrassed to offer this place as a campground to anyone.

Text: A nice wooded campground with roomy level gravel sites and water and electric hook-ups. Next to a truly unique attraction of Americana.
