Motel 6 Sandusky - Milan
Rating: 5
Text: I made the reservation online and requested a first floor room as I cannot do stairs.  I don't have a handicapped sticker and don't want one.  I was, however, given a handicapped room which I certainly appreciated as it makes showering much easier.  I room was  VERY clean which I also appreciated.  The heater worked well.  The location is very convenient for anyone traveling I-90.  Many good restaurants are a short drive away.  And the price was good:  $49 plus taxes.  Staff was very friendly.   I will definitely stay at this motel again!  This motel restored my confidence in Motel 6 after my horrible experience at the one in Janesville, Wisconsin.  (Room was $79 plus taxes and was filthy---human waste in the toilet.  I will NEVER stay in that one again.). You may delete the last section from my review of this motel 6 but I wanted you to know how bad it was and I'm not sure that review went through.

Text: Never have I ever been able to park, walk in, sign in, and get to my room faster than I did with this stay. I was quite tired from driving during the whole day and that was awesome.   The queen bed was extremely comfortable!

However, the only thing of note was that the room felt a little cold. Not 'temperature' cold but the overall feel of the room. I remember thinking that in the back of my mind right as I walked in.  It was very echo-y (hard floors) so that might have added to the feel.   I think the almost 'minimalistic' feel of the room definitely created that feeling as most places have full pieces of furniture lending to a cozy feeling.

Text: I usually don't write reviews but this was a must.! I LOVED my stay here.! I was very weary of what to expect but to my surprise it was very clean and even more modern looking than I expected. The pictures were pretty exact. We did have a few minor issues with checking in and out because there was only one front desk person on staff but I will forever stay here whenever I visit Cedar Point. The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish it was a little closer being that traffic was so bad and we got back late.

Text: We stayed here after cedar point.  If you're looking for a cheaper option and are okay with less frills this is the place to go.  Rooms were clean and staff was super friendly.  They even did a courtesy call a few minutes after we'd gotten to our room to make sure everything was to our standards.  Ice machine and free coffee in the morning.  Overall great experience.

Text: This hotel was wonderful and cheap! Very accommodating for our dogs also. The customer service was awesome! The room we stayed in had been updated, smelled fresh, no mold, NO bugs, fresh linens without burn holes and the Wi-Fi was good too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through Ohio. We were not disappointed!
