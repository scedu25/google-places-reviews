Green Kayak Grille & Pub
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I love this place. Music can be a little overwhelming sometimes because it's a small place but it's not a big deal. The owner is very nice and almost always comes out to chat and make sure the food is ok when he's there. Check out the nice back patio and the good view of the Ohio river across the street.

Text: Nice riverfront restaurant! Great food, good service, nice beer selection. They often have live music - have giant Jenga and a game room (darts,a couple arcade games) and a sand volleyball court out back. Outside they have a beach setting patio complete with sand. A good find if looking for a local restaurant/pub!

Text: The Green Kayak is my hometown favorite.  The owner is regularly there to welcome guests.  The beer selection is the best in town.  The food is good.  The party room upstairs is outstanding for special events.

Text: Great atmosphere.  Great river views.  Quirky, but interesting decor.  Family friendly - enjoy live music even if you can't get a baby sitter...

Text: Words cannot describe our visit. Let's just say we wish we left before seeing the little girl cry and heard what was said to her by the employee. We saw and heard enough before that point was reached. Shame..
