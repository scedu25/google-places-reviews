Text: My friends room wasn’t even cleaned. They switched rooms. They found old food in their refrigerator in the new room. We had long hair on the bathroom floor. The bed was comfortable. Who knows if it was even clean.

Text: A very convenient location to the convention center and the power and light district which has a ton of restaurants and bars. The rooms are slightly outdated, and our fridge was plugged into an outlet that didn't work but no other complaints at all. My only suggestion would be to avoid the restaurant in the hotel, terrible service.

Text: Nice hotel with a friendly staff... but, the first room we were in had bed bugs.  We were very quickly moved to a different room and the staff took the issue very seriously and maintenance and housekeeping were at the door before we got off the phone with the front desk.  The second room was nice and clean and no bugs.

Text: The hotel was located a block away from the convention center. Parking was conveniently located in the lower floors of the hotel. Our hotel was clean and had a nice view of downtown. The bottom floor has a bar, restaurant and Starbucks. Our entire experience was a good one.
