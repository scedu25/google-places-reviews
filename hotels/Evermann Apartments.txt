Evermann Apartments

Text: Dating back to the 1950s this might not be the most modern dormitory on campus, but it does house a vibrant community of international and hoosier students alike. They welcome families if you have children living with you while you work on your post graduate degrees. If you need to get to campus you have your own personal bus route, the E Route, that will even take you to the mall on Saturday and Sunday. If you can deal with less amenities this is a great low cost, on campus option.

Text: I stayed in a guest apartment, so I'm not sure what it's like to live here long term.  I hear these are much older than the other dorms on campus. They have steam heat and no air conditioning, so they're too hot all the time. The appliances are old, and the kitchen is tiny. The decor in the guest rooms is nonexistent.  My room had 3 things broken when I arrived and it took 5 days to fix them all. But the worst thing is the noises. The ceilings and walls are so thin that when someone moves around in the room above you, it's so loud you'll think they're in your apartment. I know more about my upstairs neighbor's bathroom habits than I ever dreamed possible. So basically, this place is not great. Hopefully these are next on IU's list for renovation.
