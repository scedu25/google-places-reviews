The Farm
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I stayed here for our "babymoon" a couple years ago. The house was beautifully furnished and cozy, with a great view of the stars at night from the balcony. There were plenty of animals to visit with during our stay, and a beautiful garden to walk through. It's just a short drive from Springfield, as well as other historical sites, and the rates were more than reasonable. I'd love to stay here again if I get the chance.
