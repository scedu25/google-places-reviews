Text: So beautiful! Be prepared to walk and climb stairs! The tour guide Steven was awesome and very knowledgeable about the cave system. So glad that we made the last min choice to stop and check it out. The building over the cave is a little scary, felt like it was going to cave in! The history and story of the caves are really interesting. It's a workout!!!

Text: Nice spot. Nice host. Never went to office because I didn't realize it was across the street but the host got my reservation paperwork for me. Host drove us on golf cart to pick out our site before driving trailer in. Pretty level site. Very nice green area. No bugs last night was very nice. Read lots of negative things about this place but I think it's nice and well worth the stay close to mammoth cave n.p.

Text: Place was great for us.  Big site and very friendly.  Only thing I didn't like was the extra $4 per night amenity fee.  Everything was closed!  I know it's only $4 per night but I wouldn't put $4 in a fire and burn it!

Text: We tent camp here with our family of five! We had a great experience. The pool was a lot of fun for the kids and our family enjoyed the mini golf. Mini golf is definitely run down but it is on par with what I would expect for a campground. Our tent campsite was beautiful (and inexpensive!) with lots of grass and trees. The campground was quiet in the evenings and the staff was very helpful.

Text: This is a very run down Thousand trails resort. Hopefully they have plans for improvement..  This has not been updated since the 50's. Uneven sites. Run down mini golf. Pool cement all cracked and uneven. Sites very unlevel. I was very disappointed compared to other Thousand Trail resorts.
