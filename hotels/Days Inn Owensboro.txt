Days Inn Owensboro

Text: The staff were friendly and the check in will quickly fool you that the motel was nice. It’s not, my room had an awkward smell as if it was damp and sat for a while. Found hair all around my toilet and on it. The tub was gritty on the bottom and was also dark brown from stains. Could definitely use some work. Cheapest hotel in the area but I wouldn’t go there again.

Text: The staff here are awesome. My room didn't have an ironing board, iron or microwave. When i requested these items one of the staff came to my room with a new iron and ironing board within minutes. She said that someone else would have to bring the microwave because it was too heavy for her to carry, she was a small little girl. A few minutes later there she was at the door holding this microwave. Awesome customer service!!

Text: Don't waste your money. Worse place we have ever stayed. If we had not pre-paid we would have gone someplace else. The room smelled like stale damp cigarette smoke. The commode wouldn't flush. Husband went to desk to ask for a plunger. He said give me 10 minutes. Half hour later still no plunger. Once again he went to desk. The man at the desk messaged the manager on duty. Twenty minutes later she comes to the door and said sorry I forgot. The water in the sink took forever to drain. The shower was a handheld shower head. When the maid service came to service the room she only made one of the beds. The breakfast was a joke. Cereal, toast, bagel and apples. We have stayed at several Days Inn's and they were very good. This place needs to be closed up period. Will never stay there again. If you are smart you will go elsewhere

Text: Rooms were clean, comfortable and reasonable... Was a normal continental breakfast, however, their fruit selection was limited to bananas only... Staff was friendly and helpful... My only issue was we were there with three dogs, because this was listed as a "pet friendly" hotel, yet the one and only really 'grassy' area, was the courtyard, where the pool was located, and for obvious reasons, no pets were allowed... Had to take my dogs behind the hotel, at the back of their parking lot where there were abandoned trucks, trash and plenty of ferrel cats running around...

Text: The rooms and all that were great however the WiFi wasn't the best. I feel like a password would've been helpful.
