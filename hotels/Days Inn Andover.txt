Text: It was a very nice and clean room. The pricing was very reasonable. The shower had good water pressure and the water stayed hot which is a big plus in my book! I would definitely recommend this hotel. The bed was also very comfortable!

Text: Clean room, comfortable bed, great weekday price for what you get, and wifi actually worked fast. Needs an entrance sign on Andover Rd if you are pulling a trailer and heading east. The street next to Kwik Shop is where you turn.

Text: The staff was very nice and helpful. The price was very reasonable, and the hotel was conveniently located. The only complaint I had was the overly soft beds.
