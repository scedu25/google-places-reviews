Kaye makes sure that their beautiful home provides the niceties for travelers. There is a toiletry basket in the bathroom in case you forgot anything and even a bath towel warmer for after your shower. Mike whips up homemade biscuits in the morning for an authentic country breakfast.  If there is any downside, it’s that you will never want to leave!

An excellent and beautiful place to stay. The owner Mike built the house himself and his wife did an excellent job of decorating. It's a very personal experience and it is easy to tell that the owners put a lot of love and effort in insuring that who ever stays there has the best experience possible.

Text: My husband and I stayed for only one night, May 19-20, 2015, and could not have been happier. Kaye and Mike are so friendly; their home is lovely; and thoughtful touches abound. Upon arriving they offered us a cool drink, we chatted for a spell, and Kaye recommended "The Whistle Stop Cafe" in nearby Glendale for dinner. It was a wonderful recommendation and we enjoyed our "typical Kentucky" dinner. They made us strawberry shortcake for dessert back at their home, offered to drive us to closed "Knob Creek Lincoln Home", and we had just the nicest evening chatting. We stayed in the Lincoln Room, which is just beautiful and perfect in every way. Mike has done the construction, and Kaye has done the decorating. Notice all the thoughtful and gracious touches both in each room and the entire B&B. We slept wonderfully, and breakfast the next morning was outstanding. Mike makes delicious biscuits! I had written to Kaye before arriving that we were on a "Footsteps on Lincoln" history/working vacation, and she arranged borrow some local Lincoln products from a nearby shop that would be closed the only day I'd be in town. There was no pressure to buy; it was a very thoughtful and generous gesture from a woman who instantly understood what visiting Hodgenville meant to me. When I bemoaned  it's impossible to buy sorghum in Connecticut, Kaye gave me a bottle from her pantry. We hated to leave, and would love to return. In summary, the innkeepers are fantastic and they clearly love what they do; the inn is beautiful, tasteful, and welcoming; and the rooms are lovely with many thoughtful touches. Hodgenville has a real shortage of accommodations, and this is much needed and totally appreciated. May I recommend that travelers stay here, in the town that is the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, and spare yourselves a further drive to Elizabethtown? You'll be so happy you did!
