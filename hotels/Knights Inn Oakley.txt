Text: The room was clean and spacious. And the people that worked there were nice and generous .The only problem was that there was no pool there but otherwise everything was nice and clean. And we would stay here again.

Text: This is the worst hotel in town. The rooms smell very bad and they are dirty. The air conditioner barely work and when trying to talk to the front desk they argued saying it doesn't smell and this is one of there best rooms, nothing is wrong with it . DO NOT!!!!! stay here if you can help it.

Text: The room was poorly maintained and during the night I woke to the stich from cow poop from the nearby cattle pins, it was worse when I went outside to  ask for air freshener and in the morning the guest breakfest was cupcakes and sunny delight, no coffee or fruit or even cold cereal. The manager made no apologies or compensation for any of it. Stay here only if don't wish to sleep in your car, which might have been the better choice.

Text: Hotel front desk and phone was being run by a child (very courteous and professional, though) .  Hotel room was very run down and had an old, dirty smell to room.  Overall poorly maintained and overpriced for the quality.  Wyndham should not associate their name with this place!
