Wingate by Wyndham Cincinnati / Blue Ash
Rating: 5
Text: The room was attractive, the beds were very comfortable , and the bathroom was spotless. The staff was very friendly and helpful , I had called earlier in the day to make reservations and the desk clerk recalled our conversation regarding fees and actually gave us a better price than quoted. The pool/hot tub area was clean and well stocked with towels. The included breakfast buffet although not expansive was adequate and well done. All in all a very pleasant overnight stay

Hot tub was down and pool area could use some maintenance.

Text: Very nice and clean hotel! It is in a nicer area of town, with businesses around and an awesome park that is getting finished across the street. Very friendly staff. Our daughter isn't a huge eater first thing in the morning but the staff asked of we wanted to take a plate up to her for later...after I had just asked about taking just a cup of yogurt. Rooms are nice and quiet and had plenty of room for us, our luggage, and a double jogging stroller, with plenty of floor space for our kids to still play and not feel cramped. This will be our hotel of choice for our next visit!
