Parke Place Estates

Text: Please disregard reviews by "local guides" as they do not live in the park place community and cannot give a reliable review. There is not a neighborhood watch and there used to be security but since new owners took over in January I have hardly seen anyone. 
Speaking of new owners, this used to be a "buy only" park, which is what made it different than other parks. Now it has become a "lease" park. In the last few months I have had several new neighbors move in. Even though there is supposed to be strict rules in place about how the park is kept, one neighbor is constantly working on his car at all hours, which is against the rules. Another neighbor has had the cops called, has cars parked in the grass. The old owners bought back the trailers or traded them, the new owners refuse to honor that making it almost impossible for those of us that want to sell and move get people to buy when they can lease. And the new owners don't report to the credit bureau, so those of us that were rebuilding our credit after the recession are no longer getting our mortages reported. So, while this used to be a nice quiet place to live, the new owners going to let it go the way of places like Roxbury park.
