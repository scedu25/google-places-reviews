Text: Robert and Kay are simply delightful people and have created a wonderful space for travelers of Bloomington.  The room is overlooking a gorgeous garden and has access to a quiet and peaceful screened-in porch overlooking the garden.  The only thing better than Robert's brilliant waffles and eggs (or whatever you like) in the morning, was his charming and fascinating conversations and stories.  Highly recommend staying here if you are going through Bloomington, 5 stars no hesitation.
