Homewood Suites by Hilton Columbus/Airport
Rating: 2
Text: Pleasant staff. Plenty of free parking. Spacious 1 bdrm; 2 room suite for price.
Room smelled musty/moldy/damp. Room continued to smell even after running A/C for more than 11 hours. Complimentary breakfast items over cooked. With a maximum of 6 guests in breakfast area in a 30 minute period, staff was still able to run out of plates, forks, butter, etc. Certainly not what I expect from Hilton. Stayed here 4 years ago for a month; everything was top notch. Gone down hill since then.

Text: Fantastic service! Comfortable rooms with thick walls, so even though you're by the airport, the planes aren't that loud. I forgot something in my room and they shipped it home to me the very same day. Will definitely be coming back!

Text: The facility is nice and undergoing renovations. Unfortunately, the staff is not receptive to noise complaints. I've been traveling since 3am and would love to be able to sleep, unfortunately after two complaints to the front desk there is still loud vulgar music playing in the courtyard

Text: Place was clean and friendly, but my room smelled like breakfast in the morning and the cooking of happy hour also came into my room. Must shave been right by the kitchen vent. Room #210.

Text: Screwed up the room reservation. The hallway was dirty, there were no sheets for the pull out couch and the manager gave me a hard time when I complained about a group of college students making noise at 230 am. This is a poorly run property.
