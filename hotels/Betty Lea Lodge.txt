Betty Lea Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: The main lodge at Echo Bluff State Park is filled with very helpful staff, surrounded by great amenities for family activities and very well maintained.  We stayed in one of the cabins on our back-to-school last hoorah before summer's end.  Highly recommend a visit for a weekend getaway.

Text: This lodge was beautiful. Everything was new and clean. Excellent view, nice gift store, clean bathrooms, friendly staff. I'd like to go back sometime. You should check it out. 
If you'd ever been to Camp Zoe, and are curious about what became of it, I definitely reccomend checking it out.
