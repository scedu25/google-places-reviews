Text: I gave this hotel 3 stars because of the fact that it was clean and the breakfast was great and complimentary. 

The problems I had with it was the fact that there was no water available anywhere. I woke up thirsty, there was no water in the room, none on the floor, the so called “24 hour” convenient store was closed and no one was available at the front desk. I find that outrageous. They could at least have a vending machine to use. 

I also had a problem with my bill at check out which was strange because I was only there literally one night.

Text: Everything seemed fine here. Quick check-in and out. I didn't really stay too long, just for the night while in town for a work event. But it got the job done.
