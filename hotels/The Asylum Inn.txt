The Asylum Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Good place to stay if you're a traveler from out of town and don't want the usual hotel or motel fare and want to be within walking distance of downtown and the beach.  Has three floors each which come with full living and kitchen areas  or the entire building can be reserved as one unit.  Expensive but worth it for those looking for a restful quiet area and a "get away from it all for a while" kind of place.

You can reserve alone as individual apartments or all together like a super big house. each level have individual entrance,  but you may connect them by interior doors. ground floor have laundry facilities however is in a basement that may be stay more clean. There are car space to park in property and a bbq area in exterior. Waking distance to some local store and ice cream place. walking little more, great spot of light house during summer while fresh temperature.
