Water Sports Campground and RV Park, LLC

Text: This park is the best value and quite fine for the area. We stayed here 3 nights while visiting Dodge City. The location for accessing town and price of $24 were the best. The park is large, open,  flat grass lots with easy to navigate dirt roads in our 35 foot motorhome with tow. Grass was cut, and the very few trees were neatly trimmed. The laundry area was clean, large enough and in working order. The restrooms and showers are clean and large and required a code to use. There are permanent residents,  but in a different section. The staff was very friendly. We checked out the other parks while we were in town; they are overpriced.  We would stay here again.

Text: Ive been on the road for 3 months. From the moment I walked into the office I felt the one thing I haven't felt since I left. At Home. The prices on items here are incredibly cheap, i never had to leave. I will bring my daughter here someday to enjoy this home away from Home. For keeping a light on Maam as well as a pot of coffee for the asking Thank You.
