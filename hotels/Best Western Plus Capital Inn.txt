Best Western Plus Capital Inn

Text: Top notch property in the price segment. I would recommend without hesitation. We did all Best Western on this recent trip after a decades long hiatus. I was very impressed with the consistency of the properties. And this Best Western in Jeff City was the best of our trip.

Text: My husband and I have stayed at this hotel several times.  It is one hotel I highly recommend. The staff is nice, friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable. The pool and hot tub was wonderful on my sore muscles.

Text: Nice clean and comfortable rooms. Friendly and accommodating staff. When I mentioned I was with my elderly mother, they asked if I'd like one of the handicap rooms since the shower was a handheld with a seat which made it easier for her. Jimmy made a delicious breakfast. I enjoyed chatting with him!

Text: This Best Western Plus has gone down hill since the last time we stayed here, several years ago. Needs updates including the mattress and bedding. Everything was pretty clean, but updates make a hotel look cleaner. We had no complaints about the staff, but no great, outstanding staff either. I would like to see more pastry items on the breakfast and chocolate milk ; )

Text: We had great experience at this hotel.  Very clean, modern,.  All of the people working there were very helpful, friendly.  Went out of there way assist with directions & availability of restaurants & services available.  This was a busy time for this hotel due to eclipse.  They were very well prepared.  Gave them a 10 on all services plus.
