Suburban Extended Stay Hotel Lenexa-Kansas City
Rating: 5
Text: I love this hotel. Very peaceful, quiet and only business people as hotel guest. They have everything brand new and looks like newly built hotel from the ground. The staff is wonderful and very accommodating. I am really surprised when some people write bad review about this hotel. While I have stayed here many times and every time I found more attractive and pleasant. No complaint at all. This was a nice hotel. I was treated very friendly and with respect as a customer. The beds were comfortable and clean. The hotel outside was very clean and presentable.

Text: Facilities in need of some cosmetic attention, but otherwise nice. Cusomer service could be better, but staff did what they thought was right and tried to resolve the situation at their level. Will likely use again.

Text: Great staff and perfect location!  The extended stay room came with a full size refrigerator, cooking stovetop, microwave and other amenities...  Everything was clean and well maintained.  I would definitely stay again.

Text: Great place for an extended stay. Conveniently off the freeway and love the places close. Just wish the fitness center had weights and or machines.

Text: Not a bad hotel at all. Friendly and understanding staff that helps make it a much better experience. Breakfast was on point and continental(free) and delicious. Rooms are (seemingly) clean so thats a major plus.
