Text: We were renters for all of our married lives. When it came time to buy, we looked within communities where we rented. We also looked in other areas. After years of searching, during which time we weren't ready to buy for one reason or another, we happened upon Four Seasons. We fell in love with the neighborhood. We never said this, but our salesperson could tell I'm sure of it. Buying a home in Four Seasons fulfilled a lifelong dream of home ownership. Whether or not you choose to partake in all that is offered here, you too will find this to be a place you can call home.

Text: We looked at many parks in the Illinois area.  From the moment we walked into the sales office at Four Seasons we were greeted by the friendly staff who answered our questions and showed us pictures.  The pictures showed us all the fun events they offer to their homeowners.  We were then taken on a tour of the models and the park.  We knew after seeing the cleanliness and upkeep of the park, this is where we wanted to call Home.
