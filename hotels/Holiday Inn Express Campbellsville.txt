Text: Room was clean.  Breakfast is good - too bad I had to be at work before it was served. Pool was clean. Fitness room small but will work. Close to a few restaurants and Wal-mart as well as two grocery stores. Staff is very friendly and helpful.

Text: It's a standard HIE, clean but not new. You some age everyplace you look. Staff is great and very helpful. I stay here every time I am in the area because I can't find anything better.
