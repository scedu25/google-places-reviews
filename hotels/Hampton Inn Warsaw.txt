Text: Great breakfast! We love how they bring in fresh doughnuts from a local bakery. It isn't just your standard fake eggs and stale biscuits.

Text: It should get 5 stars, however, there is not a fridge or microwave in every room.  They say they will be getting them in the beginning of 2018'.  As disappointing as that is, the staff is awesome,. The complimentary breakfast Is always good. (I wish they had turkey sausage or bacon more often).  I've stayed at a few other hotels in the area and they don't even really compare to the quality here.

Text: Employees were very nice and accommodating. No fridge or microwave in the room. Free breakfast was nice but they ran out of many items.
