Text: Generally dirty, bed linens with holes, carpet unwashed in the last year, toilet "rocked" on floor, top it all off with all the other problems: to expensive $50/night. I could have stayed in a room 10 times nicer for only $30 more. And would have gladly swam in a indoor heated pool to boot.

Text: Absolutely horrible!!!! We reserved the "family suite" online. When we got there the owner acted like it wasn't available. He had someone else staying in it free of charge and was going to put us (7 people) in a 1 bed room. He finally made the other people move to a different room. We went in and immediately saw 4 to 5 bed bugs. The AC didn't work. There is no kitchen or fridge. The price of this motel should be 20 a night for that filth. Needless to say we left immediately.
