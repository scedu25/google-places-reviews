Text: Stayed in the blue cabin.  Nice & clean & cozy!  Hot tub was great after a long gorge hike.  Both mornings I was able to fish in Phil's beautiful pond just yards from the cabin.  Very private & peaceful....we'll be back!

Text: The cedar cabin was very nice. It looks just like the pictures. The bathroom was bigger than we thought it would be. Its is right off the road so when you sit on the front porch you can see people driving by. There are trees all around so you are closed off from the neighbors and they have a really cool hiking trail to the pond on the property. It was a perfect cabin for a weekend get away and just what we were looking for.

Text: Loved our stay at the red cabin.  Very spacious, cozy and super clean.  Convenient location too.  Will definitely come back during a different season (visited late december) to check out the hills in the summer months.
