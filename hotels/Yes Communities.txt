Text: I have lived here since about 2001. This is a good community to live in. One of the nicest mobile home parks in independence, trust me I use to work in all the parks in indep. The manager is strick about standards. That's why this mobile home park is a great place to live. Keeps the trouble makes out.  Great place, I love it and still living here

Text: I used to live here with my family, and the MANAGER does have her favorites. If you are not one then expect a letter on your door at least once a month. Even though others are doing the same thing you are it doesn't matter. She never was polite to us in the alsmost 2 years we lived there. If we asked them to do anything they always had an excuse not to. Then when we finally moved she told us that we were not ever approved to live there????  Seems strange since we were there from almost 2 years... Glad to be out of there.
