Best Western Luxbury Inn Fort Wayne
Rating: 4
Text: This hotel is not the most high-end property I have ever stayed in. I can tell that some upgrades have been made but others can be done.
However I would recommend this hotel because it is a great quality property. The staff always greet you with a nice attitude and smile and for me small things like that matter.

Text: A good hotel, but a little dated.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We had a dog with us, and they informed us that all Best Westerns take dogs.  The pet fee was $20, which is better than most.  Will probably stay here again.

Text: Nice budget hotel at a very reasonable price. Rooms were quiet and fairly comfortable. No extra blankets/sheets in the room. Room needed a good vacuum but was otherwise fine. Shower was OK - got warm but not hot. Internet worked really well (no problem with work or watching Netflix). Breakfast was plentiful and OK.

Text: Affordable pricing and rooms were decent and clean. Beds were comfortable enough for a hotel. Heat/AC worked fine, etc. Only real complaint was the breakfast felt like it was always out of stock on the things we wanted. Example: The orange juice was out every day of our stay somehow. The waffle iron probably would have worked, but the thing holding the waffle mix was jammed or something and never worked. Nice lobby, staff was okay depending on who you talked to. I can't give half stars but I feel a 3.5 would be more accurate.

Text: I would definitely stay here again.  Very clean and close to stores, gas, restaurants.  Comfortable , clean rooms.  Quiet ( but it was a weekday). Easy on-off freeway.  Pleasant staff.  Fast elevator. Nothing fancy , but nice.  Breakfast eggs were really bad.  Coffee good .
