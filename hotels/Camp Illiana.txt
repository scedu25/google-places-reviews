Text: Camp Illiana is beautiful! It has nice clean facilities, a high ropes course, zip line, rock wall, nice pools, and best of all, it is run by a God-honoring staff. When I was a kid, the highlight of my summer was the week I spent at Camp Illiana. I still enjoy going to family camp and other special events as an adult.
