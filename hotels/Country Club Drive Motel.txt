Country Club Drive Motel
Rating: 4
Text: We got there at around 2 in the morning and the guy who was working was accommodating and helped us get a room. The prices are cheaper than other hotels in the area, but it is pretty run down. The paint was peeling at the ceiling and the water pressure left a little to be desired, but the water was hot and the bed was comfortable. I would stay there again and recommend it to other people who didn't mind a room that was a little beat up.

Text: The room was very nice for the price.the staff there was very helpful. Motel was old but for the price it was nice. And it looked like they were outing in new lights and coloring the doors and other stuff so it might be better then it was. And I would Definitely stay there again and recommend it to my friends.

Text: For the price it's a good room. 
Our bed was very comfortable and the area is quiet at night. I think all of the rooms have kitchenettes so it is a good place if needing a longer term stay in Colby.
The bathroom isn't very big. Not really too much room to move around in there. There is a shower, no tub.
Note that the motel appears to be a slightly upgraded former motor lodge. The parking is therefore intended for your average car.
