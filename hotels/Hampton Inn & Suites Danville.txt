Text: Lovely hotel and friendly helpful service. Their free WiFi was acting weird with my phone but I didn't care enough to ask about it. Also they had the BEST eggs of any continental breakfast I've ever had. One morning waa scrambled with fajita meat with onions and peppers and the next they were made into these little patties with ham onion and I think some cheese. I'll be dreaming about these eggs for a long time.

Text: Good hotel, nothing special. Breakfast was above average. Not particularly close to town, but convenient to highway. Would stay here again.

Text: Somewhat lackluster for a Hampton. Front desk was often unattended. Breakfast was overfilled and then left too long before being refreshed.
