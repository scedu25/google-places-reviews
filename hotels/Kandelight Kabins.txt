Kandelight Kabins
Rating: 2
Text: this secluded Log cabin require a high clearance vehicle to make it up the long and steep drive.  The cabin itself was a little tired... the fireplace didn't work, the Ac didn't work, the grill ran out of propane... the place could use some closer attention is all.  It was worth the $100 a night but could be much better.

Text: There are three cabins up the hill on a nice wooded property, all well secluded from each other.  We stayed in the Rustic Chalet and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The place was very well kept and cozy with the heat and/or wood burning stove.  Stayed for three days and didn't want to leave, highly recommended.  As a warning, AT&T didn't get a single bar of within 30 minutes of the cabin...Verizon barely worked.  Some will enjoy this, others might not...

Text: This is my opinion and vacation experience.  You make your own choices. I’ve listed a pro and con for ‘Cedar Cottage’. 
This shouldn’t be called a cottage or a cabin. It is an abused doublewide trailer. 
  CON for me: Air broken on hot tub making it useless. 2. Floor soft in spots. 3. Holes in walls, broken or missing seam covers on walls exposing nails. 4. Soot on walls, ground into carpet and ceiling.
 5. Filthy sticky blinds some are broken.  6. Broken window glass with broken screens (no fresh air unless you enjoy bugs in the trailer).  7. Bed felt like a double not a queen.  8. One electric fire alarm. 9. Peeling wall paper and cracked linoleum. 10. Smells really bad.
PRO for me: 1. Clean sheets and towels. 2. Dishwasher and soap. 3. Has some dishes.4. Full size refrigerator with ice cube tray. 5 . Big TV with movie channels. 6. Provides salt & pepper.  7.Master bedroom has a new floor and working whirlpool tub.  8. Easy driveway (the others are not easy) 9. Fire extinguisher by fireplace. 10. Outside fire ring.
