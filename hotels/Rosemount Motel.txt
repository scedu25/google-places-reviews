Rosemount Motel
Rating: 5
Text: The Rosemont has been a home to me while I'm in the transition of moving from one city to another. The staff is beyond excellent and has treated me with the up most respect during my stay here. They are very understanding and any request I have they have done their absolute best to accommodate myself and my needs. My room is perfect and nice and clean. I wasn't expected to live in a motel but to life being unexpected and changes happen to make me homeless, this is the homiest place I could have stayed while waiting to find my forever home. Thank you to Jay and the staff for being their for me and working with me in every way possible! I can NOT thank you enough!!

Text: Nice place for a getaway, staff are awesome at what they do, always checking if we are I'm ok and if we needed anything, I would recommend this place to anyone and I have to several people just this week. I'd love to stay there again. Home away from home.

Text: My husband and I LOVED our stay here! I was a bit sketchy when first booking our room because it looked too good to be true, but this was a happy surprise! We will be back the next time we are in Bedford! Thanks so much!

Text: We were shown the the room we would be staying in before paid to make to was to our liking. Management even suggested this GS to do around the area. Customer service A+++ no other hotel will ask you before you pay if the room is to your liking.

Text: The rooms are small and pretty barren, the mattresses feel cheap, and the bathroom is poorly stocked. The floor in our room also had soft spots, and the room has an unpleasant odor about it. On the plus side, there was a microwave and mini fridge, and the person running the motel seemed pleasant.
