Farmington Hotel

Text: This place is actually a bike hostel. I have been doing a cross country bike trip and found this gem while stopping in Farmington! It used to be an old jail and they converted it to a awesome place! Bunks, bathrooms, laundry, kitchen, living room, computer, wifi the works! Ended up staying an extra day!
