Text: The camp is pretty boring. The staff is rude and very strict and every meal the portions are small and the food is cold. Would never come again.

Text: Do not let your kid work here! They will work 12+ a day and be harassed by the management! The leader of the camp seems to care less! As a previous scout I'm ashamed of the organization!
