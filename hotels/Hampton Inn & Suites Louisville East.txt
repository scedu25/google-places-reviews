Hampton Inn & Suites Louisville East
Rating: 5
Text: The room was very clean. The breakfast was great. And the staff were fantastic and courteous. Kara was the best!!! She helped my husband find the closest grocery store with dry ice so we could keep our baby's milk cold all day while at the park! We will definitely stay there again our next time up.

Text: Our room was clean and the staff was polite and very helpful. They gave us coupons when we asked if there was any local pizza places and they were quick to deliver some extras we needed. We booked online while on the road and had no issues what so ever checking in. The continental breakfast in the morning had fresh fruit and coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting or looking for a place to stop by over night.

Text: Good value for the money and would recommend but the room needed updating. There was torn carpet and an exposed electrical outlet. Also, housekeeping shouldn't knock on the door when a late checkout has been arranged. Kinda defeats the purpose.

Text: I normally don't knock Hampton Inns but this is a sad state.  It's an older Hampton inn so the rooms are adequate but by no means up to modern standards.  We requested a handicap room and received nothing like it, no seat for the bath.  Then the much touted breakfast had been ransacked by the guests with staff taking over a half hour to revive it.  Pretty much a sham of a Hampton inn.  I'll not be staying here again. I love the company but this location is worthless.

Text: I had a wonderful stay at this Hampton Inn. The staff was very nice and aimed to please. There was a problem with the bathroom breaker but the front desk staff quickly got the maintenance guy there and it was fix very quickly...with a follow up call from the desk to make sure it got fixed. Highly recommend!
