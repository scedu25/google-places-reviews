Text: Do NOT use this travel agency. Worst customer service EVER. We used them to book airfare to China. I took our passports in so the names would all be spelled correctly. Three of the four people in our party have the same last name and one of them was misspelled even though the other two were correct. Easy mistake. Two letters were transposed. But names on airfare and passports have to match exactly. You have 24 hours to correct this type of error. I informed the agent (Colleen) immediately. She told me she would take care of it. Three phone calls, four emails, and six weeks later the name is still wrong. I've gotten no response from them. They don't acknowledge the emails. The one time I got Colleen on the phone, she actually lied and told me it was fixed. It is not fixed. Now I have a ticket to China for a minor child with a misspelled name. If my daughter isn't able to board with us, I will be suing Midwest Travel.

Text: They went above and beyond, when my flight was canceled due to mechanical issues they responded after hours on a weekend! It was great to know that I could call them when I needed them.

Text: Agree, extremely slow service if any at all. Customer service is non-existent at this agency. No response to inquiries, frequently bungled bookings, and basically not an agency to be used for serious travel. Would recommend using any other agent if you want your purchase to be handle competently. We made mistake of using this firm on a relatively simple booking and it was mis-handled beyond belief. Will never use this firm again.
