Text: This place was very clean and i liked the pool but you had to pay extra for a fridge. Also none of the rooms had microwaves and you have to use the one in the lobby. Lastly the beds were very uncomfortable.

Text: Some of you people crack me up with your reviews. It's a cheaply priced place to stay.

Rooms were clean. Breakfast was more than adequate. Usually a motel breakfast is continental.
No issues with the staff.
What do some of you people expect for the price. Room service? Ha ha , good one and the pool was clean. Thanks for a nice stay.

This hotel is run by morons who only care about tourist dollars. My family stayed at this horrible hotel last week and were covered with bed bugs....
Dirty sheets and when my wife told the ignorant non English speaking lady behind the desk about the bed bugs she threatened to call the police.

Text: Lower priced motel. Extremely clean in the public areas and the room. Nice breakfast included. Oatmeal,waffles, yogurt, bread, and cereals. Downside active rail line very near and trains make themselves heard. Second smoking and no smoking rooms are intermingled so the smell of cigarette smoke is evident in the hallways. Still think this motel is a good value.
