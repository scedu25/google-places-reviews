Text: It smelled a little strange in our room, like really strong lemon cleaner. We got used to it though. It seemed like a ghost town as if it used to be a really classy place but it's getting dated. The price was unbeatable though and totally worth it for a couple boys from out of town.

Text: Pretty much worst hotel I've stayed in, and I have stayed in many.  Went to use shower, bug came out faucet. Pool had a big bug in it. Continental breakfast consisted of toast, stale pastries, no hot foods offered. Went to check out... Wanted to pay cash and they had already charged my card.  I suggest finding somewhere else to stay.

Text: Building is old, and has several maintenance issues. The room was clean, and everything worked; the front desk clerk was friendly and welcoming; but the hotel looks more like a 50 dollar/night hotel than an 80 dollar/night.

Text: I'm here for 2 dad and the room they put me in was not clean. Apparently they overbooked and it was the only one the had. Kids were up running and screaming All night long. I was here last year for my daughters bday and was told to leave bc no pool party's. But now people can run around all hours of the night. And to make it even worse the "breakfast " in the morning was nothing but cereal and bread!!! Nothing to drink besides water n the milk for cereal. Don't waste your money on this hotel. It's nothing more than a oversized motel 6.
