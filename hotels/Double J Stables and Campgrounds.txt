Text: Thanks to Rocky and Dave for their hospitality.   They made my family feel welcome.  The facilities were very clean and the animals looked healthy and happy.   The trail ride was very beautiful leading into Mammoth Cave National Park.

Text: This place was great! The horses & the guides were fantastic. We learned about everything from proper horseback riding to wildlife around mammoth caves. Both beginners and experts had a great time. The horses were lovely and we all felt like we had a special bond with them by the end of it. We did the 2 hour tour and definitely recommend it for people who want to spend a morning or afternoon enjoying nature, new experiences, and the company of horses.

Text: Something I highly recommend to anyone! They have beautiful rooms above the stables where you can spend nights as well as campgrounds and most importantly fun trail rides. But what makes these stables stand out more than any others is the hospitality of rocky and Dave, they are great people who take time to get to know others and put in the effort to make sure everyone leaves happy. Beautiful place and fun people! 5 out of 5 stars!

Text: My husband, 7 year-old son, and I booked 24 hours in advance off season and the owners were very accomodating. We arrived early. We were greeted and invited to sit back and relax or pet the horses. We took an hour and a half ride. I had a stroke within the past year and I can tell you the ride was gentle and so was my horse. The guide was patient and kept a good eye on our son and his horse. We will defintely check back here next time we visit.

Text: Great for first timers and kids. The owner Dave and our guide Tina were very nice, helpful, and professional.
There are a few riding options. We chose a one hour trail ride that took us into Mammoth Cave National Park. The trail was smooth, and provided natural shade from a hot, sunny, and humid day. The stables was well kept, and the horses were well trained. 
I don't have much horseback riding experience, and can't make any comparisons, but I'm glad I chose Double J Stables.
