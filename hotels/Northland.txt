Text: It's nice and quiet and in ada which are perks. However if you buy a trailer instead of renting one the might make you jump through hoops to even move in. We were given 120 days to remove and replace the roof on the deck, Fix the skirting,remove or hide the trailer tongue and add back steps. All on a trailer we own. Also the owners alms never answer their phone.
