Lakeside RV and Campground

Text: Really liked the campground but owner didn't tell us checkout was at 11, even after we paid for 2 days of boating access to the lake...then came and made us pay another $30 for a total of $60 for 24 hours of our camper being in his campground.

Text: Very nice campground. Beautiful lake across the street. I didn't use the restroom facilities, but when I checked it out, it was very clean. The owners were great and very friendly. I would definitely come back.
