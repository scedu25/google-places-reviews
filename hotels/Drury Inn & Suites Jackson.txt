Drury Inn & Suites Jackson

Text: First, this is not a fake review, unlike a lot of others you see online.  Drury Inn Jackson is truly outstanding!  Incredible value for clean, updated rooms, great breakfast, great manager special in the evening, and tremendous and friendly customer service.  Our special needs son left one of his favorite toys behind in the hotel, and the management took the time to call us to confirm it was ours and arrange to get it mailed back to us.  It's unusual in this day and age to see people care about their customers in this way.  Great place to stay!

Text: We were road tripping in Southeast Missouri. At the end of a long day, we decided to stay here. The staff were excellent. The breakfast was superb. The only reason I did not give them five stars, is because I had to wait 10 minutes to check in. The employee was helping another guest outside of the lobbying. I found it strange the lobbying would not have someone there until 11 pm to check in guest.

Text: We brought our dog with us to Drury and they were very accommodating. They put us on the first floor, which is much nicer than some other hotels where pet owners are in a whole separate building. I was only there for one morning, but the breakfast was fairly good. Biscuits and gravy, Denver eggs, sausage, etc. Fairly standard. They did give us another room card when one went missing and they give you a bonus on their rewards program for the number of days you did not use the maid service (maid service is opt-out, go to the front desk to do so). We don't like maid service while we are staying anyway, so that's free points for us.

Text: Best hotel we have ever stayed at! It is very family friendly. The pool is nice and warm and clean. The rooms are large and are always very clean. The beds are comfortable so you can get a great nights sleep. The food is great and you always leave full! Close to the highway and gas stations so you can get snacks and head back on the road.

Text: The hotel was very nice & clean & the staff was friendly and accomodating. I just wish these hotels weren't so expensive & I REALLY wish they would serve organic food. Even the apples were genetically modified.
