Dogwood Lakes
Rating: 3
Text: As far as amenities go, Dogwood doesn't have much to offer.  They have a pool (very old), clubhouse (outdated but has WIFI AND A TV)  one decent size lake for fishing, 3 showerhouses (in desperate need of basic upkeep), and a playground for children.  The sites are very close together and offer little to no privacy.  So make sure you are a very social person before investing in a lot.  But if you are looking for cheap family fun to invest in, this is a good place.
