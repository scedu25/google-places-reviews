Text: My stay was brief, so I can't comment on everything the hotel has to offer. It seems like either fairly new construction or recently renovated; that said, it's clean and modern. The fitness center is in good shape as well. I'd stay here again.

Text: Felt safe and comfortable here. We had no problems at all. A hotel great for a place to sleep or hang out for a night or two.

Text: Staff is kind and professional. Rooms seem to be plenty big. The hot tub and pool are clean and easy to get to. Breakfast in the morning seems standard across all hotels. The building looks very modern and upon asking it was remodeled about 3 years ago.

Text: This was the over flow hotel for a weekend conference.  The hotel staff was able to accommodate our group and a large group of cross-country athletic students at the same time.  The staff was very attentive to our needs and went out of their way to make our stay remarkable.

Text: My stay was a good experience.  Although they were very busy, check-in was fairly quick.  The room was very clean; beds were exceptionally comfortable; breakfast had several tasty selections; and the pool was clean and enjoyable.
