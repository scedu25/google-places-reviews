Text: Im glad we checked in before reading other reviews, this is a great spot, very quite, large clean rooms with amenities (micro/fridge) very clean with recliner! Staff was friendly and helpful. My husband and i have been traveling the United States for many years and for such a great price we are very satisfied with our stay and the quality of our room. There are many food places and grocery store with in walking distance, and their continental breakfast was good as well :) coffee eggs toast and bananas was satisfying enough for us! Thank You for having us !!!

Text: Would not stay at this place Asian at the front was very rude and called the police because we got out a few minutes later then check out even though we were there only 5 hours,  I was having car troubles and explained this to him and he acted like he didn't understand. Very unclean rooms. I would not recommend this place to anyone
