Owls Nest Campground

Text: Nice pull through spaces. Friendly staff. Good for an overnight stay near major routes. Took a nice walk down the road and back that had some interesting architecture along the route.

Text: Clean, dry, solid roads, grassy and scenic, peaceful, and great price. Laundry, wifi, shower, and 2pm checkout. They tell you the real price. Not like how most places advertise you the price for the spare mud hole with no hookup in the back.

Text: no idea why people rate this campground so high  the staff was friendly and the grounds well cared for but it is a tiny campground next to an interstate and next to another busy road.   it is squeezed in between industrial parks and car washes. good enough for a nights stay if you are passing through but wouldn't want to stay longer than that
