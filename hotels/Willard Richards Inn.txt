Willard Richards Inn

Text: I tried to contact them via email for more information, but didn't get very far with that.  The first email was a question about pricing and whether they had a breakfast (didn't think so, but asked to make sure).  It took several days to get a response, and it was very brief and didn't answer all of my questions.  I follow-up with another email, and never actually got a response to it.  I'm sure they are really busy this time of year and probably were booked, but still....

Text: I agree with Chris Smith's review. Our room was very clean and in good repair. The bathroom was up-to-date. The A/C and fan kept the room comfortable.
This is, as Chris observed, a room rental, not a bed and breakfast, as is commonly known. If you want your privacy, you got it. No group interaction at all. The proprietors were pleasant, but not warm. It doesn't seem to be their way. We were, however kept apprised of activities via text message, which we appreciated. If this fits your requirements, then it is a good place to stay.

Text: Very historic house. Willard Richards was secretary for Joseph Smith and was actually in the Carthage Jailhouse (unharmed)  with Smith when the mob murdered the Prophet.
1) Perfect location for visit to historic area.
2) Very clean. 
3) Very comfortable bed and linens.
4) Reasonable pricing.
5) Friendly in-keepers. Nice gardens and little touches around the house.
6) Not really a B&B- they make it clear that breakfast is very simple basket delivered to your room, so do not expect to be served any breakfast in the (lovely) dining room. 
7) Only Complaint- so many guests are Mormon and thus, do not drink coffee,that the Inn's  only offering is INSTANT COFFEE, no cream  and no nothing. If you are coffee drinker, be prepared for depravation.
