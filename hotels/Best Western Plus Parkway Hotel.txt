Best Western Plus Parkway Hotel

Text: I went to law school in Saint Louis many years ago, and I'd never even heard of Alton, IL, until I came to this hotel. What a beautiful hotel standing tall only minutes from Granite City, which is exactly what it sounds like, and, of course Saint Louis. The staff was friendly, the restaurant excellent, and the room was superb. They even went above and beyond by helping me fax something to my hometown Clerk of Courts because I forgot I had a traffic court appearance the same day I was staying in Alton.

It was a quick 20-minute ride to Saint Louis (unless it's rush hour, in which case just chill in the awesome bar/restaurant for a bit before you head out). I would definitely stay there again.

Text: Best Western is a good motel chain. The one here in Alton is very comfortable. The hosts are friendly and cordial. Good Central location to Alton surrounding area.

Text: The rooms are nice, but the beds are kind of hard. The lampshades could be longer. There were not enough blankets provided, although I suppose I could have asked for more. The shower made no sense. I've been in a lot of different showers and this by far was the most confusing. I don't like baths, but I was forced to take one because I couldn't bring myself to ask the front desk how to turn the shower on.

Text: This has to be one of the best over all experiences of a hotel stay for me in 40 year's. Extremely clean, well maintained, comfortable, great staff, excellent breakfast!
