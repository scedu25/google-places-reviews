Text: Online all of the prices for the hotel say $46. When I got there, we were charged $59. I asked them about it, and they listed off a bunch of excuses. It left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, but I understand that it's a small town. I was fine with paying that amount. I just wish they hadn't given me excuses for why the prices online weren't correct. The room was nothing special. It was apparent that there was a lot of patchwork on the walls and showers. You could tell that it was a small motel with limited resources, so if my 13 extra dollars helps them to repair the motel, that's fine with me. It was nothing special. I wouldn't bend over backwards to stay there again, but if I needed to stay in California, MO, I'd stay here because it's the only motel in California, MO.
