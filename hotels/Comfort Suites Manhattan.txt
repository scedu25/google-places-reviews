Text: What an awesome place. We come here from Tennessee 4 or 5 times a year to visit our daughter. The staff is impeccable in delivering 5star service. The room is always spotless. The facilities are outstanding.

Text: Very nice atmosphere, Desk was very inviting and helpful going above and beyond to meet our needs, extra clean inside and out, room was very nice and housekeeping kept it spotless.  Breakfast was a step above expectations with good variety and freshness throughout serving hours.  Though we don't travel often because of age and disabilities, we'll be back to this Comfort Suites.

Text: The room was clean the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were clean as well. The location was Central to quite a few restaurants and a fairly good-sized Mall and also not too far away from the University. Breakfast was good, but few things weren't stocked very well. Overall, very nice stay and Comfort Suites are a good choice.

Text: Only went into the lobby to hand someone something but it looked impressive and was clean in appearance. The management however doesn't know what hospitality means. Nor do they understand how to keep staff. I've never worked here or stayed but about everyone i know has worked here for about a day or 2 due to the g.m being a rude demeaning jerk. Lame sauce comfort suites. I'll never let anyone I know stay here.

Text: Overall the staff are courteous and pleasant to work with. There hotel has complimentary on site laundry. The room design felt a little dated but was well maintained.
