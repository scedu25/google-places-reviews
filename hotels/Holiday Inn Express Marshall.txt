Text: It was clean, service level could improve quite a bit. Breakfast wasn't great. Just microwave eggs and basic no flavor items. Prefer other hotels breakfasts. Hotel was full of kids that night running all around. They should have stopped it or said something.

Text: Quiet hotel, conveniently located close to I94. My room was clean and comfortable, and they had no problem checking me in, despite arriving very late. There's a Denny's nearby for breakfast, as well as a gas station with Tesla superchargers. Truck parking is also available across the street- we parked there overnight without issue, despite the "no overnight parking" signs.

Text: It was good but not great. The service was quick and the employees were freindly. One major complaint would be the lack if vegan breakfast options.

Text: Room was clean. Staff was friendly. Breakfast was okay. Not the best I've ever had but was good. Best part was the Denny's within walking distance
