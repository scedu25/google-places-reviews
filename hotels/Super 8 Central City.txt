Text: The check-in staff was wonderful and friendly. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was hot and the breakfast staff was friendly and kind and courteous. The pool was clean and warm. When we checked out we had a wonderful man named King Arthur that was also very friendly and kind he told us to take our time checking out and always smiled. We will definitely be recommending this place as any alternative! Thank you for making our stay so pleasant. We can't say enough nice things about our stay!

Text: While we were lucky to have a room because it was after an event, it was incredibly over priced. There was a cigarette butt in the shower, no toiletries and nothing in the vending machine or open close by after 9-and the pet policy was $20 as opposed to $10 at some other hotels. Only stayed because it was the only option. However, even if it were half the price, and at it's best, I still would not want to stay here again.
