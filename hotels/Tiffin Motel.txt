Tiffin Motel

Text: This was definitely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Next year I will be making sure that I book early enough to get a room at days inn or the Holiday Inn. The only thing that was good about the room is it had Bad and had a TV. The air conditioning didn't really work well. And the dust on the TV receiver looked like it hadn't been cleaned in at least a couple weeks. There were no amenities not even a bar of soap to wash your hands.
