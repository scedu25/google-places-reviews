The Welsh Hills Inn
Rating: 5
Text: The Welsh Hills Inn is breath taken in it's beauty and simplicity. The attention to detail that Jeff and Bobbie present is awe inspiring. 15 acres of beautiful landscaped rolling hills, hidden hideaways reveal hammack for two or bocce Ball court, or just a bench for mental reflection. Bobbie and Jeff make their home your home. From the moment your foot crosses the threshold you feel welcomed. One of the two resident dogs will greet as if you were a long lost friend back home again. The rooms are large, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is welcoming. Everything from the sheets, towels to the evening turndown and bedside chocolates are sumptuous yet downplayed...like home. The best compliment I could give to The Welsh Hills Inn is even my mother would call it home.

Text: This place is delightful in every way. The thoughtful details of the Inn were a joy to experience! Delicious loose leaf teas, excellent breakfast and coffee, beautiful and unique decorations, and the just an overall cozy feel make this place one you will HAVE to visit again. Bobbi, Jeff, Ellie and Wrigley were also the most thoughtful hosts! I'm so glad my mom, sister and I got to spend quality time together in this tranquil spot.

Text: This B&B is top notch and 5 star quality all the way around. Beautiful scenery, pristine pool and hot tub and the rest of the exterior grounds very well kept. Our room was very clean and extremely comfortable. We stayed for 2 nights and we had 2 amazing breakfasts on the patio that would have cost $15-$20 a plate elsewhere. Wine,cheese and crackers each evening as well. We stayed here as a small get away while our kids were at a nearby 4H camp all week. We took in a bike ride to Johnstown on a bike path for coffee and rode back to town, then to a couples massage at the Inn. The owners, Bobbi and Jeff, are very accommodating and should be very proud of their Inn.So much better than a hotel. We will be back!

Text: Bobbi and Jeff are AMAZING hosts with a really great and well kept property. The house is beautiful and so comfortable with a lot to do. My new husband and I loved the darts, bocce ball, hiking trail, hot tub, hammocks and gorgeous porch where we spent the evenings sipping on wine. The breakfasts are delicious and this was really the perfect place to stop for a few nights and relax after our wedding. The town of Granville being so close was wonderful also and Jeff was helpful in offering a lot of restaurants to check out while we were there! I recommend a stay at the Welsh Hills for anyone who needs a breather with a view and wonderful hospitality!
