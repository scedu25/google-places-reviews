Natural Bridge State Resort Park
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice park. Trails are easy (compared to other parts of KY). Natural bridge has great views. Recommend taking the original trail then deciding if you want to go further. But one note; if you want to go from under the arch to the top there is a stairway. However, skip the extra pancake at breakfast because it is extremely narrow :(

Text: Fantastic Location. That's the most important part about this hotel. Right next to natural bridge and all the action. The service was decent and so were the rooms. Breakfast was not included, but it was pretty good for 9 dollars (typical southern breakfast fare). I would recommend it and go there again.

Text: The location of the Park is wonderful. A beautiful, wild and rugged area. A place to enjoy nature and heal any inner turmoil. The lodge here is old and quite dated but has been rehabbed fairly well. The restaurant serves good, hearty food. All in all a great place for hiking, rock climbing and eating.

Text: Beautiful area  we missed the sky lift, too much rain but it would have been amazing. Took Original trail to natural bridge from behind lodge, it was flat but had lots of steps to climb. Very slick at points, do not recommend in rain. Very well maintained, lots of benches & lil gazebos. Not long. The bridge was pretty neat. My hubby braved narrow steps to top, it was pouring down like a waterfall & very deep on stairs so I did not go up. He said it was worth it. Would love to do lift if we return to the area.

Text: This place was awesome! It takes some stamina to make it to the top for those who don't want to pay to ride the sky lift but well worth it! Absolutely beautiful. Great for all ages, our 9 year old climbed faster then we did.
