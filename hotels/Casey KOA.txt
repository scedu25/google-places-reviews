Text: I asked to dump and fill water. I was driving through with my lq trailer and was out of water. There were water faucets all around. I had money.  The lady looked at me like I was white trash and said I could dump fit 15 dollars but could not have water. Said they were full. Which was a lie.  :(

Text: We arrived sunday august 20th and stayed until the 22nd. From the minute you arrive the owners are watching, literally brought laundry to the laundry room and Kathy approached us asking what we were doing saying she was "watching us", yes, because two 30 year old mother's are up to no good after our camping gear got rained on. Poor bedside manners and a lack of accommodation. 
 We were given camp sites underneath a large street light where bugs were an abundance and it was hard to sleep and eat dinner. The next morning we asked for a new spot, which we were denied and my mother in law was rudely spoken to by both owners. Jerry yelled at my mother in law asking her "what are you doing here!". Supposedly they refused us a different site because the solar eclipse was going to bring them tons of business but in reality people must read these reviews so there were about 20 sites taken when we arrived and 10 when we left, so yes we could have switched sites without any harm.
The laundry room is dusty and dingy, the game room is moldy, the pool is halfway decent but needs to be redone, but can't get over the way we were treated as our rv broke down on the way here and we made the best of it and bought tents and supplies. We gave them good business buying local instead of going to the walmart. The owners may think they are beine nice but when you check in you get rules, its literally the land of NO LAUGHING, NO SMILING, NO FUN. 
PS. Thanks for the complimentary cookies!
