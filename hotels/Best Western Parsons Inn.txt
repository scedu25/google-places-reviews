Best Western Parsons Inn

Text: This hotel was listed on Priceline as being 3 stars. It definitely was not three star quality. A very nice 2 star or a good 2.5 star, but nothing about it was worth a 3 star rating. For one thing, they put us on the second floor and we had to walk all over the hotel looking for the elevator only to have the clerk tell us we have to take the stairs because there isn’t one. Sorry, but 3 star hotels have elevators to get to their rooms that aren’t on the first floor. Second, while the room was clean and nice, it reeked of vinegar when we walked in.

Text: The newly renovated hotel was quaint, the staff extremely friendly, and the pool kust right. Breakfast was fresh and healthy! Love our stay?

Text: A very nice hotel, with excellent staff.  I'm a chain hotel guy and had a hard time finding a good one in the region.  This BW was very good.  Some newer updates are nice, snacks at check-in nice, and room seemed recently updated.  But the best thing was at my 5 am checkout I was not expecting breakfast that early but the check-out person had already gotten much of the hot breakfast going early since many of his frequent guests need to leave before the normal 6 am breakfast time.  It is great to see that kind of guest-oriented service.

Text: I have stayed three nights. The first night I found what looked like was a flea but wasn't sure I didn't see anything else. My last night here I found four in my bed and when I got out of the shower they were all over the floor in the bathroom. I do not recommend staying here!
