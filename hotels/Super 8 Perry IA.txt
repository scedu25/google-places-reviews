Super 8 Perry IA
Rating: 3
Text: Had to ask for another set of towels upon arrival only one set in room when room was booked for a couple. Found hairs in bathtub. Husband had to jiggle handle or something so toilet would shut off. No city map in room drawers or available at front desk or lobby. Little to no info on local businesses or restaurants. When asking front desk attendant he wasn't from area and recommended fast food. Coffee pot had not been cleaned. Breakfast was grab and go. Prices higher on weekend. A little too pricy for a Motel 8 and not as clean as should've been.

Text: Room was clean. Check in was easy, even for an additional room after the wedding reception. Pretty typical super 8 experience.
