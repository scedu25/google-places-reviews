Grant Street Inn

Text: Third time staying at this charming inn, and will return again. The staff are all friendly, helpful, professional - and were accommodating over and above to find us a disability friendly room on two different visits. The breakfast buffet is delicious, nutritious, fresh....I just wish it was available a bit later than 9:30! Not a single bad word to say about this lovely place.

Text: Nice comfortable atmosphere. Within walking distance of downtown and many restaurants. Also within walking distance of Bloomington's farmers market. Parking and layout is unique. Breakfast is pretty good too.

Text: Cozy room. Close to University and many amenities. Vaulted ceiling was odd. Did not have in room AC and parking was very confusing.

Text: Has a bed and breakfast type feel because the rooms feel more like bedrooms than a cookie cutter hotel room (at least mine did). Floors tend to creak which is a bit annoying but nothing terrible.

Text: I love the consistently clean charm of the Grant Street Inn.  Great location to be able to walk to restaurants and events.  Great breakfast and conversations with staff and guests.  It's a must do if you are lucky enough to get a reservation.
