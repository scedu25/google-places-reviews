Text: The management is a joke. Unless you are friends with her or her family, she does not do anything! Never fixes anything. The pot holes ruined my new car. The children steal others belongings and are very disrespectful towards everyone. Parents do not supervise their children, very young children at that! Always have trash in my yard from their children.There is a guy on the main street who works on cars and will drive his loud car up and down the street at all hours of the day and night revving it up for no apparent reason! If you want your sanity, DON"T move into this place.

Text: The teenagers at the playground were very vulgar. My 12 year old brought my 9 year old back wanting to know what a bj was.... The actual trailer park seemed nice.

Text: We have been here for almost a year now and I must say I've never been more miserable.. 
BMF is a joke, Management is terrible and they surely don't help when there are issues that arise. Sine we have been here my neighbors skirting has been missing, they use my yard as their personal ashtray(wedontsmoke) and trash can. They refuse to put curtains and or blinds in their windows, throw their trash in the creek behind their home throw their dirty needles in my driveway.. We found out from neighbors they have been complained about for years and nothing is ever done.. I'm sorry but aren't there rules for a reason?. BMF does not choose to enforce them.. if you value your sanity whatsoever,do not move here!!! All we have asked is that the rules be enforced and that' cannot even be done..
