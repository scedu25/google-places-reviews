Text: Stayed here quite a few times, and the staff is always super friendly making check-in efficient. The rooms are newly renovated, and they are way better than they used to be! The facade of the hotel has gotten the fresh makeover, and has greatly improved the overall Aesthetics of the hotel.

Text: The Hotel was great, it location was great for why we were there. And you are within walking distance of just about an entertainment you could want. The rooms,bar/restaurant and other facilities were very nice also.

Text: Super comfy beds, very spacious rooms. Very quiet with no issues. The front desk will hold your bags until your room is ready. Walking distance from several parks, eateries, and bars. You must try Dirty Frank's hot dogs across the street!

Text: The staff is very nice especially at the restaurant/bar.  The rooms are OK.  Housekeeping just forgot to come to my room one day.   The hotel is just old and needs a major renovation.  Good location downtown.

Text: Nice hotel room but did not get it cleaned once in the 4 days I was there. There food is from a restaurants kitchen that closes a little early. Overall it isnt bad. Oh yeah almost forgot. It has shuttles that drive you around for free. Best perk by far. Might be the inly hotel in Columbus that does that
