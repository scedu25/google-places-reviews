Quad City Inn

Text: I have stayed here before.  And they usually fix problems but this time I got a room with no tools stocked. No pillows on bed. No soap.  And they finally got that stocked  but then the TV didn't have no sound.  And he tells me there's nothing he can do about it.  So here I sit watching TV with no sound.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay at Quad City inn.

Text: This room was a gift for my engagement. It was horrible. There were roaches, no tv remote, under the beds were filthy, with condoms, socks, and debris under them. The sheets were ripped, and the floors were nasty. There were spider webs all over the walls. Never again will we stay in this hotel.

Text: It's okay for a stay. No free breakfast. Maybe using blankets with holes. No fridge and microwave in room. They were kind enough to let me store the baby's milk in an employees fridge. Some of the guest when we stayed were up late and some talked near our window. Window may not open but you can still hear what is going on outside.

Text: Great hotel really brought be back to the 1980's (I was born in '91). Didnt even need to smoke because just the smell of smoke in the room got me my nicotine fix. And it's the first hotel that I stayed at that I got offered a couple prostitutes.
