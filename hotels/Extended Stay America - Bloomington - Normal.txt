Extended Stay America - Bloomington - Normal
Rating: 4
Text: The room was large and comfortable. Nice large bathroom too. The bed, however, was small and very uncomfortable. The slightest move by either of us set the bed to shaking. The pillows were very thin and worthless. We went and bought our own pillows the next day to use for our second night there. The woman who checked us in was great! I think her name was Valencia. Very sweet and friendly!

Text: Owner must paid attention to whats going on.
I last there for 14 days and got my room semi-clean..
And never got housekeeping. I had to clean the room by myself .
Other than that really nice looking place. 
There are two front desk guys that give great cost service.. The rest is like they dont care about their job.

Text: I stayed at the Extended Stay America - Bloomington, IL for one night while traveling cross country. For the price, it was one of the better hotels I've stayed at. There hotel is pretty close to the highway (although there is currently road construction making it a little tricky to find the entrance). The rooms are quite large, clean, and have a kitchenette. I only interacted with the staff at check in/out, but they seemed friendly and efficient. The only issues that I had were that my room smelled slightly musty and that the "grab and go" breakfast was mostly just a coffee bar. Overall, pretty minor complaints considering how cheap the rooms are.

Text: The rooms are great but the breakfast is pretty much just granola bars and old coffee. Would recommend this hotel just bring food.
