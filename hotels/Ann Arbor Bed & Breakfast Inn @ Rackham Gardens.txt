Text: Adorable,  welcoming,  great energy,  warm cozy room.  If Ann Arbor is your destination,  try something different and go here.  Hotels are boring.

Text: Was in the Ocean room.  A king size bed...a great kitchenette...plus a private outside hot tub.  Food was scrumptious...drinks and snacks available.  Hosts were awesome too.  A great place to celebrate our 35th anniversary.
