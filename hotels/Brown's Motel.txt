Text: I made a reservation and wasn't any problem. This is a very clean bug free no frills motel. Staff is very friendly. Quite and comfortable. Have a nice but basic breakfast. All I can say is the price is right and would recommend it to everyone I know. Stop in on a bike trip its perfect!!!

Text: Good place. Convenient location. Our only complaint was that it was hard to get our door unlocked. They have old fashioned key on a key ring to open the room doors.

Text: Wonderful place, except for being woken up two different times in the morning. Once by housekeeping (understandable) and secondly, by a lady opening my door to check the fire alarms.
