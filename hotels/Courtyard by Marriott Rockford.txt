Courtyard by Marriott Rockford
Rating: 4
Text: Friendly staff, and nice location (close to highway and shopping). You can tell they have recently updated the hotel and are still in the process of updating parts of it. It's a good value but there are likely newer hotels nearby for comparable prices. The layout of the hotel with only one elevator and the large courtyard in the middle dues make it a challenge to get to your room quickly if it's not located near the elevator.

Text: Pretty good hotel. Prices are reasonable, breakfasts could be better though. All in all it's pretty old and needs to be refreshed. It has a small swimming pool inside and really nice & cozy patio

Text: Very nice accommodations. Hotel has a pool, and an extremely nice workout room. The restaurant can be hit-or-miss. During my last day they were closed on a Thursday night due to a call in. No backup.

Text: I was visiting the hotel to meet with friends before going to a wedding. I had not gone into any room at this location, however while staying in the lobby the hotel from what I saw was a very nice hotel. While sitting in the lobby I overheard the staff talking with some potential guests, of which the hotel overbooked. The hotel offered the guests to stay at a hotel nearby at the expense of the Courtyard by Marriott Rockford. Where it stinks that the guests where not able to stay at the hotel they booked, it was great the hotel offered to pay for their stay at the other hotel. Since I couldn't see everything the hotel had to offer I would rate the hotel 4/5 for what I saw. The staff and policies of the hotel I would rank 5/5 for how helpful they were to me and the guests I overheard from. Overall 4.5/5 for my experience at this hotel.

Text: My stay was very enjoyable. The room was nice, clean and the bed was especially comfortable. Staff was polite. I didn't have the chance to use it but there's an indoor pool and a cute outdoor courtyard. I would definitely stay here again.
