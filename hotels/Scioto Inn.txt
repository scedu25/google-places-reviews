Scioto Inn

Text: Great Place!!!  I grew up in Urbana and came back for a family wedding.  There were more visitors than could fit at my mother's house so she arranged for several of us to stay here and it was great.  Our room was large, clean and updated yet had charm and character.  This is without a doubt the nicest place to stay in or around Urbana.

Text: I stayed with my 2 sons at the Scioto Inn over Thanksgiving as our family's house was full.  The Inn is very nice and recently renovated. Everything was very clean and convenient and the service was excellent.   We stayed in Suite 103 which was perfect as it had a bed + 2 bunk beds, a kitchenette and sitting area.  Each bunk bed each had it's own TV!  We will definitely stay there again and we highly recommend it.
