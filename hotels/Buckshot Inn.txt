Text: I have had plenty of friends and family stay with Stan and Kim at the Buckshot Inn over the years with no complaints just compliments.This is a very clean and well managed motel. The owners Stan and Kim Smith both grew up in Smith Center. They will make sure you are treated well during your stay in Smith Center. Great place to stay and nice owners to get to know!!
