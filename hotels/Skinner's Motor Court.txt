Text: WARNING...DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Had reservations. The motel sign was not legible, so we passed it....pulled in and all I could think of was...this is like a horror movie and we may never be from seen again. Entered office and it totally confirmed my feelings. Checked in, got key....this place was so worn down,one roof was dipped in, half of room numbers not there, windows screens ripped off, doors with plywood nailed on. Hadn't been painted probably since it opened. Opened door and couldn't believe this place was in business. First thing I did was lift the mattress...in the bright daylight there were bedbugs crawling everywhere. I can't imagine what it was like at night. I went running out of there.This place needs condemned. They had the nerve to try to charge $60 a night....guess I have to leave 1 star or it won't let me make a review...I don't want to leave 1 star
