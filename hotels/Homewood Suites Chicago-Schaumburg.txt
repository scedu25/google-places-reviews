Text: My stay over the weekend was fabulous! Margarita at the front desk  was professional and plesant. Receiving a gift bag at the front desk was extremely nice and hospitable. The hotel was clean. Every thing was just perfect. Anna was very nice. She made sure we hadd everything during breakfast. She was very helpful and informative. I will plan to stay here again soon.

Text: Great staff. I had problems with my business card and they were helpful the whole time. They even have free dinner Monday thru Thursday. It's off the main road so it's really peaceful

Text: Putting this review after a long delay. I stayed here for almost two months. Quite literally became my home. Amazing, friendly staff. You are always greeted with a bright smile which gets your day going. The rooms are decent, albeit a little outdated perhaps. The best part is the free supper with beer and wine on tap. There's a good variety on the menu too. It was a wonderful couple of months stay here.
