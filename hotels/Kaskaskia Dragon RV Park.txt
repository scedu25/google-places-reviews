Kaskaskia Dragon RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: Thrilled to find this place.  November traveling and most rv parks are closed for winter.  Awesome metal dragon to help you find your way, has everything you need here.  Full hookups, dump on site, laundromat across the street along with a pet wash.  Staff are super friendly.  Restaurants are nearby, driving distance.

Text: We had a great stay here for the last 2 weeks! It was very clean. Customer service and the staff were excellent with helping to meet all needs. Convenient location with Kaskaskia Supply, laundry mat, dog wash, and car wash across the street. Walmart, grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations within 2 miles! The fire breathing dragon is located here also and is a must see!
