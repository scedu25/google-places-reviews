Text: Should have paid better attention to reviews. Be warned!!  It is a dump.  Don't walk across the carpet barefoot....your feet will be black.  Room smelled of smoke.  Bathroom was filyhy, moldy and reeked of urine.   It was disgusting!  Can I give a review of less than 1?  How can such a dirty place pass health inspection?

Text: If I could give this place a zero I would. It horrible rude customer service, place smelled horrible. We came into town for an event. I ended up getting horrible allergies and being sick all night from this place after my husband and finally decided to leave at 3:00 am because I was just too sick the guy was incredibly rude while we were checking out. There is black mold on that ceiling and in corners of the bathroom. The guy would not refund or do a partial refund, of offer to give you another room! This hotel will be reported and hopefully banned so no one else can stay here until it's up to code. Clearly this room was never cleaned. There was hair on the floors in the bathroom and bedroom that didn't belong to us.

Text: Beds are uncomfortable, shower water pressure is terrible. My buddy almost had a very large picture that was hanging above his bed fall on him. I get that its a low end motel and $55/night really aint bad. But you gotta have a certain quality standard and this place does not meet mine.

Text: This is my second time visiting this location and the staff is always friendly and helpful the rooms are acceptable for the value. Would definitely recommend this place if you need to save money but have a decent place to stay. The owner was very helpful and when we needed something he made sure we were taken care of! Will definitely visit again!
