Text: Loved my stay.  Comfortable, clean, secure. Julie (the owner) was wonderfully hospitable; great breakfast.  The location is also great - set off a side road, with sense of privacy.

Text: The manager, Julie, was so friendly and accommodating to us! The only down side I would mention would be the inn's close proximity to the railroad track, which we could hear several times in the night.
