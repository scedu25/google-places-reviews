Text: Clean hotel. Owner was more than willing to get us whatever we needed for our room. Worked nights and was accommodating as far as what time the maids came. Very satisfied with our month stay!

Text: If I could give this hotel 0 stars I would. They have bed bugs. I literally just woke up and had little red bugs crawling on me. I go to tell management and she gets an attitude and says there shouldn't be any bed bugs that's a new mattress. I showed them the bites I had on my neck and arms. I asked to speak to the manager and was told I'd have to wait and couldn't wait in another room that doesn't have bed bugs. The custodian came to check the bed to see if there were bed bugs and pulled back the mattress and there were several. I took pictures of the bugs as proof. The manager did not care and would not refund me my money for the room. I wouldn't refer anyone to this old hotel. The management doesn't care what so ever.
