Text: I love the staff here. It's location is perfect for where I go when I'm in town. Service is great, especially Tracy. The rooms aren't top notch but they get the job done a a reasonable price. It's cheap. The rooms are clean but in need of a renovation. I gave them a five out of five because they treat me very well.

Text: The staff are great and smile at you. Tracy at the front desk took care of everything and gave us a good deal for our staying. Plenty of parking and access to restaurants and bars a few blocks away.

Text: The staff was very friendly. Unfortunately the hotel itself was pretty unpleasant. Halls smelled awful, rooms weren't much better. The water was funky. 

There is a train line right next to the building and the trains ran all night. Not horribly loud, no whistles or anything, but it was noticeable.

They are half the price of the competition and sometimes you do get what you pay for.

Text: The room was clean and comfortable. A bit small, but it was just right for staying one night.

Text: If I could score it lower I would. The staff were fine, but the facility was worse than bad. Sorry, but we haven't had that bad a night ever. We were stunned.
