Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Charleston South
Rating: 5
Text: This is a fantastic Microtel!  The rooms are really nice, and everything is in such great condition.  Definitely the best budget hotel that I've stayed at in a long time, and at the top of the Microtel chain.  The staff is friendly, and there are places to go eat nearby.  I would definitely stay here the next time I'm passing through

Text: The hotel was only about 6 miles from our event. The room was clean, had a microwave TV, and small fridge. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of pillows and extra blankets. The shower was good, had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The complementary breakfast was good too.

Text: Overall good stay. Room had a weird smell to it but wasnt repelling. Staff was super nice after I became famous for answering the door with my shirt off... fairly good location for access to Charleston and surrounding areas. Gas station and a hardees within walking distance. Good restaurants nearby! Stayed here with 2 work mates in a double bed suite.
