Holiday Inn Express Troy, IL

Text: I wanted to rate this hotel a 5 star. 
Do to the bathtub being very slick and with one leg it was very difficult to stand up or try getting out of the tub. If I had noticed that before for I slipped into the tub I would have called down to get a mat. 
  The room is very nice and enough room to get around in my wheelchair. The bathroom was big and very beautiful 
    I would stay here again. The staff was helpful and showed me that there are no "I" in TEAMWORK. Thanks

Great place to stay! New, fresh, comfortable and clean. Rooms are big, bathrooms are nice. Seems to be a nice quiet area. Stopped here between Indiana and Texas.  Fairly close to St Louis,  but still has a rural feel. Nicest hotel we stayed at on an 8 day trip. Not fancy but nicer than any other holiday inn express we've been to. Breakfast is ok for free. Biscuits and gravy are very good. Eggs and pancakes are gross. Good coffee made up for it.

Text: Newer hotel, very friendly staff, and clean. The only  thing that I found that could be better was the water flow in the shower. The shower heads have a nice spray pattern, but the water flow was not as good as it could be. I think the shower heads are the high efficiency type, as the sink and tub faucet both had good flow.
