Super 8 Goodland
Rating: 5
Text: In our very short time here, this proved yo be one of the nicer Super 8s we've stayed at. Friendly staff, and breakfast was pretty decent. The rooms were clean and quiet. Even the coffee was pretty good.

Text: Pretty basic room. We got a non smoking room but there are burn holes in the blankets which are out dated.

Text: The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The room was okay. Breakfast was okay. Cleanliness was good , but there was a faint, unpleasant smell in the bathroom coming from the shower curtain (that smell a towel will get when water has dried on it too many times without being washed) and a cigarette burn in the top blanket. I know that doesn't mean the blanket wasn't clean, and I wouldn't necessarily say they should toss it, but it was a little off putting. For the price, it was worth it.  I would reserve again if money is my primary concern.
