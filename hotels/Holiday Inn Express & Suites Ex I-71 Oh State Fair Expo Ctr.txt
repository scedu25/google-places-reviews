Text: The first room stank of cigarette smoke and mold. The front desk clerk was very friendly and moved me to a different room. The second room smelled better except the entry and bathroom area, where there was a chemical smell. The room was unadorned. The bed was comfortable. For some bizarre reason, the toilet seat was left up in both rooms after it was cleaned. At least it looked clean.

Text: The room was generally fine except the only thing to cover the window was a light sheet and all of the outside lights shined straight through. It was like trying to sleep in daylight. We searched all around for something to cover the window so we could sleep but couldn't find anything.
