Text: We stayed on the 2nd floor in a king size bed.... we loved the setup of the room... with a small child having a second room with a tv allowed us to stay awake a little later while she went to bed. The breakfast was good but was a little disappointed in the juice machine all the drinks that came out of it tasted terrible.
