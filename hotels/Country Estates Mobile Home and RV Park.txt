Country Estates Mobile Home and RV Park

Text: Lived here 15+ years an on a scale 1-10; 3 is being generous. I've seen my lot rent increase 4 times in the last 3 years under the same ownership; bordering on criminal wouldn't you say.  There is no grass, moles cover my yard (by the way I've made several attempts to have them removed), stickers and weeds run rampant, an worse  of all no lighting.  Last but not least we have had a change in  four different Park Mangers in the last three years; which means a majority of the time complaints go un resolved.  I SURE HOPE THE OWNERS READ THIS BECAUSE SOME THINGS  NEED TO GET RESOLVED!!!
