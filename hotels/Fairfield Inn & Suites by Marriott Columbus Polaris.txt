Text: Within easy walking distance (1 minute) of the Quest Convention center, which was the reason for my stay. Checked in late at night, no problem. Room was clean with basic accomodations. Interior seems up to date, shower was great, and the room itself was cozy (king bed room on 5th floor). Check out was hassle free since I had already run my card and there were no discrepancies.

Text: I stayed in a room with a king size bed. Everything was clean, and looked wonderful. Checking in and out was a breeze. The bedding was comfortable and the bath tub/shower was awesome.

Text: Quiet hotel. Even though the hotel is apparently full since a coworker was unable to book a room, the breakfast was not crowded at all. Everything is clean and would be expected.

Text: Worst hotel we have ever stayed at. Service was so bad Im honestly going to sue these people. The room was not clean had switch rooms and over an hour to do so. If you stay here you will experience an unprofessional low class experience.

Text: Friendly service. I was switched to a room without a loud A/C right away. The renovated rooms look nice.
