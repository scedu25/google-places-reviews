Fourwinds Lakeside Inn & Marina

Text: Good place to stay. Bring your kids, lots of things to do and they are free. Miniature golf, corn hole, tennis and more. Restaurant on premise has excellent food. Why only good and not great? Great hotels pay attention to details. Too many cob webs, dirty windows, things that need paint, etc. to be great.

Text: I liked it. It was a nice simple place. Good for medium scale events like weddings too.  A few technical issues like the heating but apart from that it was cool.

Text: We attended a wedding reception at the resort. The staff was very attentive and fulfilled all of our needs. The food was very good and plentiful. It is a beautiful venue overlooking the lake from a very nice deck

Text: Came to Fourwinds to eat at the Windjammer. Everything was wonderful. The food and service was great. There is always a few specials that are a great deal. The menu looks dated and will make you think the food will be blah, but it's the opposite. The food is phenomenal! You have to pay to get into the lake area, but if you show your receipt when you eat, they will take the price of your check.
