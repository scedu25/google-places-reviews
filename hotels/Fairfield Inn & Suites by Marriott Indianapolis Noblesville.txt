Text: Looks like the whole place has just been renovated and it's all new. Comfy beds and rooms are fair in the space. Bathroom is setup kind of weird but it all works. 5 minute drive to their little downtown area that has a few little nice bars and other shops. I'd definitely stay here again.

Text: The hotel itself was great. The room was very spacious that we stayed in. The one issue we had was parking. They have a small parking lot so we had to park farther away

Text: Rooms are clear but a little worn and dated. Walls seem a little thin as I could hear the neighboring room.  When I got off the elevator the temperature in the hallway was extremely warm however the temperature in the room was comfortable.
