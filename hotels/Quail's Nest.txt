Text: Hotel needs to do basic maintenance! Carpets need replaced  (at least in the area we stayed). Linoleum was discolored in bathroom and had a bad repair job done on a rip. Wood rot in indoor pool and hot tub area. Location was good for getting to all sides of the lake in reasonable time. Staff was friendly and efficient and rooms kept clean with towels well stocked. These are the only reasons it got a two instead of a one. Spend a few more bucks and go to a newer hotel with a hot breakfast.

Text: We always stay here and it's fairly clean and no real problem. They had some construction done to the deck that began at 6 am this time around that we were not notified of so we were a little mad to be woken up so early. Overall a good place.

Text: Rooms are absolutely disgusting. After pulling back the sheets, I discovered brown stains on the mattress cover. Top sheets had hair, crumbs, and dirt all over them. When I called the lobby and asked for new bedding, I received more dirty sheets. While I paid for a smoke free room, the sheets also had burn holes in them. Rooms and hallways smell musty. The indoor pool had a green tent and looked very dirty. The bathroom sink leaks all over the counter. I would not recommend this motel to anyone and will not be staying again. Definitely needs updating or just demolished.
