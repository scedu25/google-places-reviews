Coolbreeze Estate B & B
Rating: 5
Text: I hadn't been in Evansville in 40 years, but if I return, I'll make a point to stay at the Coolbreeze Estate B&B. Clean, warm, friendly and historic in a great way in one of the city's classic neighborhoods. You get the sense of the family that lived there and the influence on the history of Evansville. This is tucked away in a quiet area with modern accommodations in a National Register quality home. This is the reason you stay in B&Bs and country inns, and why you remember stays in places like this, but a hotel is just another bed in another city.

Text: This bed and breakfast is a cornerstone of Evansville. Coolbreeze is a family oriented place with unmatched family values. The décor of the home is beautifully well done. This place is an pronominal establishment.
