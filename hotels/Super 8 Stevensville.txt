Text: My buddy and I booked this place coming from Philadelphia for a Notre Dame football game this past Friday. The room was clean and it was quiet. Room 107 was a good location and the price was great especially considering how close it was to the stadium. We will be back!

Text: Very pet friendly!  The friendly, attentive, and informative desk attendant made sure we were placed in a room with outside entry, down near the grassy dog walk area that even had doggie bags and trash can available to encourage cleaning up after your pet.  The only down sides was a slow sink drain and older/worn looking carpet, but everything else is cleaned up and looking good for our short stay

Text: For the money it is not a bad place to stay. It is not far from the beach. The bathroom is small and dated but it was clean, and we never had a problem getting more towels. The front desk was very nice.

Text: The room I received was exceptionally clean and well mannered. Also the gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind. Overall I had to say that for a lower-end hotel I would give them high ratings and compliments due to all circumstances involved in my personal situation.
