Text: Martha's suite was so lovely. Loya's tops a 4 star hotel for cleanliness, comfort and the gormet breakfast was delicious! We enjoyed  the privacy if a B&B. It was such a nice retreat.  The 15 min location to  campus was perfect. Just far enough away from Campus allowed us a nice family get away and private retreat when we were done with the campus activities and allowed us to enjoy pure Iowa. The landscaped grounds were beautiful.

Text: Cozy and a perfect place to relax. There are many rooms to support large groups. The inside of the building is filled with beautiful artwork mostly made by the owner and friends. Bed was comfortable and the space is large. Homemade food will remind you of your childhood. Overall a clean and friendly place.
