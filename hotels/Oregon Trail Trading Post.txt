Text: Our family ate at the cafe here the night before the '17 eclipse.  We were warned ahead of time that they were kind of stressed out by the crowd of tourists packed into the town for the eclipse.  However, they were very pleasant with us and the food was delicious.  It turned out to be a great place for supper.
