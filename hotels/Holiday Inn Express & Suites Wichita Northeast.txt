Holiday Inn Express & Suites Wichita Northeast

Text: Used them for out of town guests and anyone else to stay after son's wedding. Our room was very spacious, clean, comfortable. Other's commented on how they liked their rooms. We used the outdoor patio and fire pit as gathering spot after the wedding, very nice. Location was great, nearby restaurants and retail stores in a new build area. East to get to major highways, interstates. Front desk was very helpful in getting us checked in quickly, as we were running late and needed to change and get to wedding early for pictures. Will recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in Wichita.

Text: Overall it’s a friendly and nice looking hotel. It’s conveniently located next to 96 highway and close to many restaurants and shops. I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the shower. There was a significant amount of mold in the grout. Overall, I would stay again. It’s a good hotel for the price.

Text: Picked this location because I had a medical procedure performed nearby at Surgicare of Wichita.  The front desk treated us very well and were intent on accommodating our needs.  The facility is clean and neat.  Comfortable.  Nice neighborhood with everything one would have a whim to pursue!

Text: Nice hotel. Clean and great decor. Great view, i can see a beautiful park from my room with a great walking trail. The best part is the hot breakfast that has all you can eat eggs with cheese, sausage, potatoes and fresh pancakes!!!!

Text: The hotel and rooms are nice, clean, and what you would expect. The customer service could stand for some improvement, as can the breakfast that is served. Other than the cinnamon rolls, the breakfast is awful.
