Text: Great place to take the kids. 3 pools, 2 lakes and lots to do. Some activities cost extra, but the kids had fun fishing and swimming. The pool is Very busy place on Saturdays. So much so that we had to bring our own chairs to sit on.

Text: Had not been there for 5 years, it used to be way, WAY better! When we arrived I had to go to the men's room and on top of the urinal there was a dark yellow stain and 2 somewhat unique (curled) hairs. Right before leaving after checking out I thought it was a good idea to hit the men's room (It is a 2-3 hr ride back depending on traffic) AND GUESS WHAT? What looked exactly same stain and the 2 hairs were STILL there; 4 DAYS LATER! It is definitely what looks like a rundown camping ground, VERY little improvement to the grounds and incompetent staff (both on the front desk and on the sites) My kids are grown up and do not have any grandkids as of now, I will not take them to this place when they come! BTW, They do have worked on their fees, we paid for tent camping (first time ever AND LAST, I hope!) the same we used to pay for a 32 feet motorhome with full hookups 5 years ago!

Text: Polite staff. Clean cabins,  grounds, and bathroom/shower rooms. Permanent campers were super friendly to visiting campers. Easy to relax and do nothing or be involved in all of the activities.

Text: Very nice campground offering many camping options. My family and I have been visiting this site for many years and always enjoy the many activities that are available. Check out the camps website as many special events are held throughout the summer months such as live music and other activities.
