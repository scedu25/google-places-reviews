Unique Suites Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: We stayed in room 305 and found the prices to be excellent, the room clean and quiet, and the service acceptable. Breakfast was a typical continental style. The pool looked beautiful and inviting though we did not swim. However others in my family stayed in a different room that was not updated and did not enjoy their stay as much.
