Comfort Suites Stevensville - St. Joseph
Rating: 5
Text: First off let me say that My Wife and I stayed at the Painted Turtle B&B the first 2 days of our honeymoon over the Labor Day weekend and came to the Comfort Suites for the following 2 days. Had we come to the Comfort Suites1st that is where we would have spent our whole time. Michael, Cory, Cynthia, and Marina are all TOP NOTCH 1st Class People/Employees. They treated us with respect, made us feel welcome and comfortable, and went out of their way to accommodate and make our stay and time there the best and most memorable. The room was exceptional, (and clean), the hot tub and fireplace added that magic you want for a honeymoon suite, the pool and hot tub were clean, and the breakfast was hot, fresh and delicious. The supporting staff were ALL respectful and polite. Great job!!!!! We WILL be back for our Anniversary next year. Hope to see You all then. Thank You Very Much!! Oh...did I fail to mention that we were originally booked for only 1 night, but they make us feel so comfortable we decided to stay a second night...Kudos.

Text: This hotel was amazing!!!  I loved the Jacuzzi  in the room!!!  The staff was super nice! It was very clean. And I loved all the lighthouse decorations through out the hotel. The one thing  that I liked the most was the location of this hotel.  It was between the winery stuff and the beach/town area. So it was very easy to access all the fun stuff around town. Plus walking distance to cracker barrel !  I will definitely be staying here again!

Text: Very nice stay! The hotel seems to be newer as it is in great condition. The room was very clean and nice. The USB port and outlets between the beds was nice. The beds were extremely cozy, I wish I had another night to sleep in it! ? The breakfast was good, they had eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, waffles, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, pastries, juices, coffee and more. It was kept stocked all the way to the end. The pool was on the small side as was the hot tub. The room was like the Sahara desert, it was unbelievably warm and humid, so much so that it was not refreshing to use. The pool was cloudy. The Warren dunes were about 15 minutes south. There was a lot to do nearby and many restaurants and stores. The only negative is that it was impossible to get my fire stick to work. I have successfully used it at every hotel I have stayed at for the past two years (nearly 25 different places) but it would not work here, it was almost as if they had it set up to fail. Thankfully it didn't matter much to us as we had so many things to do on this trip. But on some trips, that has been important to us which is why I mention it.

Text: This hotel was sold out. I just knew it would be noisy. I never heard a thing and my room was next to the pool. Wow! Super staff, clean room...I will go back.
