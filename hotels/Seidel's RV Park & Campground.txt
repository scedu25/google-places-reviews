Text: Do not go to Lakeview. A jerk Miss Rose is just another minute on and she is a wonderful person. She does have a bunch of animals. FARM. and she is the nicest person you will ever meet. 30$ a night and shade and all hookups. Plus you can let and watch the animals.. GREATEST place.

Text: A nice, quiet, clean RV park. It's located NE of Pratt, about 2 miles off of hwy 61. The road is very well maintained so no problem getting to it. A country setting. Rose the lady that owns it is so very nice and friendly and lives on the property. She cares for several types of animals but yet there wasn't a stinch from them one might expect. The park is pretty shady but not too much so. The sites are spacious and grassy for the most part and well mowed. There are full hookups. No bathrooms nor WiFi. We had our own cable so not sure if it is available. If you are looking for a quiet country park not far from town then this is the place!! We will definitely return when in the area!!
One note I may add....A person may get confused as to exactly which RV park this is (there are 2, one right after the other), this is the SECOND one. On the web site a picture mentions "golf course", the first RV park is with the golf course. I viewed both parks and definitely prefer the second one (this one). Much nicer and easier getting in and out of and cheaper too. We paid $30 a night or $150 a week. :)
