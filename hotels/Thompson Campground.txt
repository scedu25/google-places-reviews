Text: I am the wrong one to pick. I was raised if you don't have something good to say, it's generally best not to say anything at all. Sorry. My child is not autistic, or down syndrome or has behavior problem. The list of what she is not, goes on. The diagnosis is delayed. She is 5yr and for 3yr I have asked for this broad term to be defined. I also have asked to be referred with no avail to a center that does what they do, unfortunately I have not figured out what they do. Although I have no complaint. I forgot my child somehow slipped out of the chair while seated between two doctors and struck her head, accidents happen. I trust in God and if they knew what was the matter with my child they would tell me.
