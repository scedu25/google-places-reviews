Miami Village Mobile Home Park

Text: It has nice trailers. They don't have maintenance help at all. You have to pay for pretty much everything. It's not well lit and some people just don't care how there trailers look. The only good thing is the manager there and they have some nice trailers. But there will most likely be something wrong with it.
