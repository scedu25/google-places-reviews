Embassy Suites Omaha - Downtown/Old Market
Rating: 4
Text: Really cool interior of this hotel. Great place to hang out - especially in December. Their Christmas decorations are great. The convention space is really great as well. Professional, inviting, and with almost immediate access to all that Omaha has to offer. Highly recommend.

Text: This is a fantastic hotel. I have stayed in Omaha before but never at Embassy Suites. The hotel is beautifully decorated with a large open atrium in the center. The rooms are super quiet and spacious. To top it off, this is the best hotel breakfast I have ever had (and rivals some of the better breakfast places that I like). I will certainly come back and would be happy to recommend this place to friends and colleagues!

Text: The best thing this Embassy has going for it is the location. It is located across the street from the Old Market area. It is an easy walk to many nice restaurants, bars, and quaint shops. The hotel itself is a nice hotel but a little dated. It has a nice ambience with the many plants and water features with fish.  If you are wanting a more updated hotel, then you should probably check out the Embassy at La Vista next to Cabela's. But you will give up the downtown charm.

Text: Was a great place to stay. I don't think there was anything bad during our 3 night stay. It was pretty busy during all of the activities and during the breakfast. Had lots of fun and glad the location was so good. Breakfast was good and I like that they have cooks on duty to make people omelets and pancakes, really make you feel like they care. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable too.

Text: Clean, friendly staff but difficult to get concrete information. Great breakfast and evening drink and snack service. Fantastic location, right at the old market. Biggest problem was the temperature of the common areas; the building was kept incredibly cold, so much so that people were wearing parkas and scarves inside. The room thermostats can be adjusted, but definitely bring a sweater for breakfast or the evening drink reception.
