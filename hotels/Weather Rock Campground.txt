Weather Rock Campground

Text: Stayed here for three nights.  Very friendly people, easy check in, you pick your spot.  Pool is nice and clean and the grounds are well maintained.   Only drawback for me is some of the really prettier and shady spots do not have sewer,  but a dumps station is available if needed and for three or four days it is fine.

Text: This place is awesome! It's an RV park with two outdoor pools, a hot tub, a playground that used to be McDonald's related play items (think Hamburgler on the playground) and everyone here is so friendly and the place is pretty quiet while being less than 20 miles away from the 41 bridge over the Ohio. Would highly recommend this for travelers with campers and RVs looking for a cheaper but awesome place to stop and rest with full hookups and sewer dump.

Text: I would not recommend a stay here.  Grounds are poorly kept, reception from staff not too friendly and they charged $50/night with no discounts.  Grass is mid calf in length and the place is very buggy sites are in poor condition and very small.  Not happy especially when we consider their price.
