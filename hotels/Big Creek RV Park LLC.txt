Text: Love the owners, love the campground! You ate family when you pull in...wood, small campstore for everything you forgot or broke or didn't even know you needed...all here. Spaces are nice, bathrooms and showers are spotless. Pool, washers, horseshoes, playground, arcade, beautiful creek...all better than expected. Owners loan out balls, games, equipment. Ice is on site, propane, literally everything. We will be campers here for life. Love you guys!

Text: Hidden Gem! My wife and I (and our dog Teddy) stayed here a few weeks ago and loved it. The owners are onsite and quite friendly.  We spent time relaxing in the creek just behind our campsite; and it was refreshingly peaceful.  The pool was invigorating and the showers and restrooms are immaculate.  We WILL be back.  Thanks to the owners for all their hard work making this a wonderful retreat!

Text: We chose BCRV because of it's location near everything in the Arcadia Valley area, such as Johnson Shut-Ins S.P. (amazing), Elephant Rocks S.P., Pilot Knob, and nowhere near big-town distractions. Patti & Craig are super nice and have thought of everything. On the weekends they host a small candy bar bingo game, and rubber duck races in the big creek along the park edge. These things may not be important to you, but it does give you an idea of the effort they put into guest relations. The entire place is super clean and well maintained. Camp store is well stocked with low prices. For instance, 20 pound propane refill is $15, ice $2, wood $4. Bathrooms and showers were large, modern, good pressure, and very clean. Laundry room large and clean with 2 washers & 2 dryers, plus book and DVD exchange. Meeting room available. Arcade with about 7 games. Outdoor game equipment for free loans. Large playground and whiffle ball diamond. You will have to get a site close to the Wi-Fi antenna if you want to connect. When we did connect speeds were better than most campgrounds. Back in sites are well rocked and drained. The site drive ins are about 15' wide and I guess about 45' long, and then there's about another 15' of grass between lots. Lots of space behind the lots too. Very comfortable. Don't tell the kids - they have good cable TV! BCRV will be on our list to visit at least once a year. We think you will enjoy it too. We camped at Big Creek RV Park in a Travel Trailer.

Text: It is a very nice and clean place to visit.  We rent out a room to have small parties in and it has been wonderful. It has a playground for the kids and a nice walking area.   Craig and Patty are really nice and helpful people. We have always had a good experience when we are here.
