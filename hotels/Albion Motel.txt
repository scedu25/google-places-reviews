Albion Motel

Text: Decent little place for my girlfriend and I to rest our heads for an evening while travelling across country. The service was reasonable for checking in at 2am and the bed seemed warm, cozy, and bug free. If I could do it all again, I'd pay $10 more to stay at a chain motel to get that higher quality feel though. If crunching money to fit your budget is key, this isn't a bad place to stay.
