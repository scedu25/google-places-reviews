Text: This place was probably so so beautiful back when Mary was alive. This place is far from what it once was. If your looking for beautiful county and lots of wild life this is the place for u. However the grounds are over grown but the inside of the yurts were absolutely beautiful. Was not impressed with the porta potty but that's just me however it was clean. It was still a  very beautiful area!! With a big fire pit by the tree line in front!! My big issue was if there is another family in the other Yurt you can count on no privacy at all because you can here a cricket a mile away while inside. SERIOUSLY!!
