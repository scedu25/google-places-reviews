Lighthouse Landing
Rating: 5
Text: Lighthouse Landing has great views. There are numerous boat docks with sailboats Galore and some motor boats. There are cabins that you can rent and it is directly across from Grand Rivers where there are a few restaurants grocery store some antique stores. It's very peaceful quiet and Land Between the Lakes is just a couple of miles further down the road. I try to get up there about every two weeks just to spend the day.

Text: A great place to kick back and relax in your own little cabin looking out across the lake and harbor. You can go sailing, fishing or just cruise the lake. Don't forget to enjoy a wonderful meal at Bill or Patti's in Grand Rivers just a few blocks away.
