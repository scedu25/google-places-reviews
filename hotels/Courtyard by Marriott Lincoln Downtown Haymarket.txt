Courtyard by Marriott Lincoln Downtown/Haymarket
Rating: 5
Text: Very accommodating to allow us to switch to a king vs queen room. Very modern, but comfortable look and feel both in the lobby and rooms. Rooms are oriented differently from the norm, but it works and gave it a fresh feel. My only complaint was the valet, not very speedy and had really bad timing. We checked in at the hotel and quickly got ready in about an hour, we told the valet that we would be about an hour. At 45 minutes, our car was still sitting out front, great! At just past an hour the car is now gone, parked elsewhere, fine, we call down saying we need our car. Call down was useless, we walk down and no one had any idea what was going on, the valets we're not working together. Due to this mix up which delayed us 15 minutes total, we were late for a prompt event.

Text: Room was adequate. The bathroom was okay as well. The front desk people were very nice as well were the Starbucks / bar employees. The location is in close proximity to the new downtown area and is in walking distance to a couple of bars and restaurants. The University is also a short walk away. Would recommend to ppl staying Lincoln.

Text: Located conveniently on the downtown parts of Lincoln near many of the excellent bars and restaurants, as well as the arena. However by staying in such a desirable area you pay for such in parking fees. I would never stay here again for that fact alone, given how I pay a night and it should be included, despite that the facility has an overall pleasing aesthetic. The rooms are also designed slightly differently than your usual run of the mill Courtyard. They also don't offer an sort of bonuses for dining at the Bistro or skipping housekeeping as I have seen in other Courtyards.

Text: Lovely place for a weekend getaway. I will suggest expect to find parking in a garage beforehand or pay for the valet.
