Prairie Winds Motel & Apartments
Rating: 1
Text: You have to go through U.S. Center Motel to book a place here. The clerk called to ask if the apartment was ready, and was told that it was. Took the key and stopped to eat before we headed to the apartment. Mistake. Should have went and turned the air on first then went to eat. The room was so hot it was like getting into a car in the middle of the day. We got to the room at 10 and it was 4 in the morning before it even cooled down enough to be kind of comfortable. There were 2 air conditioning units in the room and the smaller one that looked like it should be garbage worked,  better than the big one, but neither worked well enough to cool the room they were in. Couldn't open the 1 window in the place. Don't plan on being able to bend over in the shower or adjust the shower head so it's not blasting you in the face while your trying to shampoo your hair. Bad experience.
