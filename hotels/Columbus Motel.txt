Text: Stay if there is absolutely no other option for you. The chair in the room looked as if it was red at some point, but never washed since the 80s when it was first built. The bathroom had zero soap or shampoo and the room was provided one towel for 4 people. Just scary situation all around.

Text: New owners are making great strides. I have stayed here twice for a week at a time due to business.  I will be back every time I'm in the area.  Clean, friendly and great shower.  Don't let the old reviews make your decision.  They are working hard to make this a nice, comfortable, affordable stay.
