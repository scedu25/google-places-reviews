Text: Good place for the price. Be careful if you book through a third party site; they tried to charge me twice. It was easily fixed with no problems. Nothing fancy at all just a bed and warm place to sleep.

Text: Horrible service. Hotel smelled awful. Sign on outside marquee says under new management. Seems like there was no management at all. My sister made a reservation since 9/20 received an itinerary through email regarding confirmation and when we arrived nothing in the system. Rude front desk person who claims to be new then she states she's a manager. Didn't help the situation wouldn't honor the email reservation for the rooms booked. Charged my sisters credit card before stating there was no reservation in the system. DO NOT RESERVE TO STAY HERE. A WASTE OF TIME. DISGUSTING HOTEL AND SERVICE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NOT CARE YOU DO NOT HAVE A RESERVATION. Zero stars if I could.

Text: Old original paint underneath the several layers of newer paint from over the years. Staff is nice but the place just needs a remodel for it too fully look and smell clean.

Text: It was the worst.  Unfortunately it was the only hotel in Chenoa, Illinois.  Had to change room 3 times due to the A.C. not blowing well or at all.  No breakfast or coffee even though it advertised complimentary breakfast.  Did not sleep, it was too hot.

Text: Stopped here late, on our way through IL.  Outdated, but clean, quiet, & a spot to sleep....which is exactly what we were looking for.
