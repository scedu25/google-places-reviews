Text: Nice new hotel. Breakfast had plenty of options. Hotel is well built and the rooms are very quiet.

Text: Rooms were nice - everything was clean and the amenities were good. Breakfast was good, as there were plentiful options. The fitness center had free weights and a bench, so I was able to get a decent workout in. The pool was relatively clean and well-maintained. One drawback is it was tough to get into - we had to drive around the block a few times in the dark to find the entrance (FYI go to the light just east of the major intersection and there is a frontage road that gets you there).

Text: I attended a bachelorette party here with a small group of people (about 15) and the room fit us all comfortably and the hotel looked very clean and well maintained. The only thing I disliked was no signs pointing how to get there seeing how there's no driveway and have to drive a block past the hotel and turn onto a road you can barely see just to get to the hotel.
