Text: What a gem to find. Traveling across Illinois and not finding any places to camp. We were heading slowly towards Michigan. ..Decided to head up 100 along the river and tada!!. No amenities. ..so consider it rustic although there may be something up by the office.  Quiet and really nice spread. And only $8. I kinda don't want to share this and keep it to myself.  Another post said awesome sunrise.  Campground is on the west side of the water.
