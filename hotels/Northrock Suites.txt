Text: Recently stayed the the Northrock Suites in Wichita KS.  Location is nice for easy access and shopping close by.  
Ice machine didn't work on the floor I was staying, had to go to another floor and the second night, there were no ice machine working.  :(
They are doing some remodeling, but should make sure holes in the walls are patched up and not exposed.  
If you like hot showers, that's good, because you have hot water!  
Friendly staff.  Didn't get to enjoy the hot tub, a little small and over flowing with people.
Breakfast was OK, had to eat with a spoon, no forks in the place.

Text: Absolutely not impressed with the breakfast or lack of. The only thing they had was biscuits and gravy not even sausage in the gravy. Pancakes that were microwaved. Then cold cereal. Really! This is why went came here verses the courtyard marriott which is 10 times nicer just no breakfast. I will be staying there and going to IHOP from now on.

Text: Room was dirty. Carpet had not been vacuumed, shower not cleaned, woke up in the morning with a roach on the bathroom floor. Called and talked to someone and they said well it will get better.

Text: Friendly desk staff. Great breakfast.  Rooms could be a bit tidier upon arrival but the space is fabulous.
