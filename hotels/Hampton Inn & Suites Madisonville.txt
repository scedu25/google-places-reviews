Text: Our beds were super comfy. The room was nice and clean. The hotel has a great, well stocked breakfast. There was coffee and tea at night along with a cookie. A perfect visit.

Text: Came to Madisonville to watch the solar eclipse.  I expected an overcrowded hotel with a short tempered staff.  The staff and hotel far exceeded my expectations.  The staff was bubbly and had entertainment for the kids while we awaited the big event!  They catered in dinner the night before, of course had breakfast, and catered in lunch.  Amazing time!  Couldn't be more pleased with our time there!

Text: Stayed three nights at this location. Considering the area, this is one of the nicer hotels to stay in. I had a 2 queen bed room with a fridge and microwave. Free breakfast, and the to go bag was an unexpected welcomed surprise. Marriott is usually my preferred chain however, after this last visit to the Hampton and Hiltons lately, they may become my new chain for awhile. Staff was very friendly, used the mobile app and check in and out was very smooth. Had one maintenance issue, or operator ignorance, on the window air conditioner and it was resolved quickly the next day (see photos). Highly recommended if in the area and I would stay here again. Video on the YouTube Channel. Thanks for reading, literally, and if this review helps give a thumbs up!
