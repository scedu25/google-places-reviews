Text: Great hotel I will definitely stay again. Generally a nice room and breakfast was fine. I had a customer service issue and a problem with the iron in the room. I went down to the front desk with my concern and the customer service Sunday morning was OUTSTANDING! Totally impressed with the concern and quick solution. Great service!

Text: Always a pleasant stay at any IHG Hotel. The suites as always are nice, beds are always comfy. Mini fridge and microwave included in the suites. Being a Spire Elite member has its perks. Staff is friendly and don't forget to try the free breakfast wvery morning.

Text: This place is such an amazing value. We booked the hot tub suite for our wedding night and then again for our 2 year anniversary. Very friendly helpful staff, clean facility and quality rooms at a good price.

Text: The place is clean and nicely kept. However the tv was old and had horrible reception with no hook ups for a streaming device like most hotels now. The WiFi speed was sad as well. If you aren’t going to need to work and just need a clean bed it’s fine but if you expect to watch anything of your own or do anything on the internet think again.
