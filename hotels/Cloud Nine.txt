Text: Elaine is the most wonderful host. She has so many great stories to tell and is so friendly to everyone who walks through the door. The breakfast was by far the best cooking I've ever had, and the room where it is served is full of natural lighting and set up in the most elegant way. The house itself is clean, tidy and has a very welcoming atmosphere. Best bed and breakfast stay experience I've had.
