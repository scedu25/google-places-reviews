Best Western Jacksonville Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Had a room for 3 nights very quite. Bed was comfortable and Amanda is awesome. Got us checked in very fast. Didn't have a room down stairs so switch us for  a king upstairs to a queen down stairs.  This is a great place and not expensive at all.

Text: Amanda at the front desk was welcoming and had a smile for us whenever we encountered her. The room was fine, just a little noisy because it was on the first floor. The breakfast choices were much better than I anticipated. The pool wasn't crowded, and when we did run into other guests, they were pleasant. Lots of shopping nearby to stock your in-room fridge, and microwave worked fine to reheat leftovers.

Text: This Best Western was a cut above, especially for it's low price?. The indoor pool had a sunny spot and was actually warm! They also had a sauna, hot tub, and plenty of ready pool towels. The continental breakfast was excellent as well with a surprisingly large selection. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the glass mosaic decorations were tasteful and interesting. We will be back again.
