Text: So far I have seen nothing good from living here. We were lied to from the start about everything. I have text and recordings to prove that. I document every thing due to past experiences and this is by far the worst I've had to deal with. Continually getting slapped with more things that we supposedly have to pay for. Are they pocketing some of this money or what? Charged for things that are specificly written that we don't have to pay more for. Someone definitely needs to look into what this place is doing to people as if everyone is forced to hand over as much money to them as possible.
