Countryside Suites

Text: First time stay was great. The front desk check-in was very friendly and helpful. It's over-priced but I'm used to that in Lincoln on game day.

Text: This hotel was absolutely fantastic! We called 5 other hotels in the area and none of them excepted birds. We are traveling across country with our green cheek conure and needed a place to sleep at 1:30am. They let us have our bird AND they didn't charge us for it because he stayed caged. The staff were so friendly. The free breakfast was pretty good. They had a waffle maker, muffins, bagles,  cereal, and even eggs. Good drink options as well. They also had high chairs. The room was clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. I would give them 10 stars if I could.

Text: When I got there the older lady at the front desk was rude. She had an attitude the second I walked in. She looked at my address through my ID and kept insulting the neighborhood I lived in. She then kept asking why I came to the hotel and not another one. It sounded like she really didn't want me there. She then kept asking me about what I was going to do that night. I was going to Omaha and she asked why I didn't just stay there. Keep in mind all those is meningitis said with attitude and rudeness. She seemed really frustrated with me even though I have done absolutely nothing. I definitely won't go back here, just as she wanted.
