Text: Great hotel. Clean rooms. Nice pool.. Friendly staff. Would have been a 5 star if they had let us check in early. I would have even paid for half a day but that wasn't offered. Desk clerk was ready to let us in early called his manager and the manager said no.... We had driven for 14 hours and we had been awake for 26 hours when we got here. Just want to sleep, other than that we have been enjoying our stay...Love that this is close to Niemergs beat restaurant in town!!!

Text: Great rooms! Ours was a double Queen sized bed room. We loved it. The room is very fancy and we'll decorated. The bathroom is very upscale. The a/c and heat is controlled via a wall thermostat unit. Their rates are? very reasonable. They have a laundry room and pool and have complementary breakfast as well
