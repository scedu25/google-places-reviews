Rowse's 1+1 Ranch
Rating: 5
Text: Tammy and Jerry are wonderful people.  The cabins are  beautiful, cozy and have heating and air conditioning.  The cooking is sooo delicious and there is more than enough to eat.  This is my first experience on a ranch and I am loving every minute of it.  I have heard other guests here say they tried other ranches before coming here but this was by far the best experience they had.  I will most likely be back many times and I'm certain I will not want to go anywhere else.  What a fantastic experience.  If there was a way to rate higher than five stars I would!

Text: I stayed a week at the ranch and had a great time. Good horse's, good food and comfortable rooms.  The best part is that Tammy and Jerry will answer any questions about running a "real" ranch. Some of the best steak you could hope to eat.
