Circle B Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This is the best campground you will ever stay at. I have been going to Circle B for over 10 years now. Robin and her staff are wonderful. The facilities are well kept. Lots of restrooms throughout the campgrounds. The store has extended hours compared to other places I have stayed. If floating the bus picks you up from your campsite or cabin. Prices are very fair for both camping and floating. They treat you like a friend and not just a customer.

Text: Been here every labor day for the last decade. Before we found this campground we jumped around Missouri looking for a campground with great floating opportunities. Circle B was a unanimous decision after the first year and had since been an annual family gathering.

The recent flood hasn't really changed much of the landscape and the campground has recently refurbished most of the cabins and picnic tables around the tent sites.

We will continue to come to circle B for the foreseeable future in hopes of having a wonderful experience every labor day weekend.

Text: My husband and all of our family have been coming to this campground for the 10+ years as a tradition every year. We had our wedding here just this year. We love this place. They are truly family friendly and it is quiet at night. They keep it clean. Robin and her staff are accommodating especially this past year with our wedding being there. I would say this place also has the best river access and swimming area on Jack's fork river. We will continuing coming back every year!

Text: Stayed here 2 nights for a float trip. It is a very nice campground. We stayed in one of the camper cabins, which comfortablly housed 4 adults. The general store carries firewood and most things you may have forgotten on your trip. The river is perfect for floating too!

Text: Camping and canoeing is a blast at Circle B Campground. They put in the river and you finish at the campground. No long walk to your camp site. Your'e  there. Nice clean facility. We will be back.
