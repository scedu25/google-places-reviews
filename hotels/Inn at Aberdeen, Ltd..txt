Text: Awful.  I went to the Inn last week to check it out for an anniversary party, and two old ugly 70' sofas were sitting in front of the Inn, in one of their parking spaces.   I thought it was odd, but still went in.  I just went back with my husband *A WEEK LATER*, and the sofas are still sitting there.  Needless to say, we didn't bother going in.  Imagine if you had booked a party or wedding there months ago, and your guests show up to see that?  I'd be so embarrassed.  Shows very poor taste and judgement... can we rely on them to make good decisions and throw a nice party?  I don't think so.

Text: Very nice stay. The Inn is beautiful and the staff are very helpful and nice. Only downside is the lack of privacy as it's easy to hear people downstairs and nex to you.

Text: Very welcoming, very comfortable, in a great location - and includes a three course breakfast above and beyond the call of duty. Not my taste in decor necessarily but that's minor - and that style (Scottish / pseudo-baronial)  has its own charm. Really nice common areas in a charming old building. Easy parking. Get one of the rooms around the back if possible, although the road isn't really that noisy at all.
