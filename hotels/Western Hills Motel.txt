Text: Tons of bed bugs to suck the life from you and your family, when we checked the reviews and we found that someone else had the same problem a week before, I took several live ones to the office and the older gentleman claimed he hadn't had a problem in "years" but when I mentioned the review from the week before he got quiet real quick, moved us to a different room in a different building. My suggestion is to avoid it at all cost!!! I would have got a refund and gone elsewhere but it was 1:30 am.

Text: Best Ma Pa motel I have ever stayed at.   Clean a well kept.  Bed was hard...AC worked but was an older one that ran all the time.  I felt safe.  Good cafe around the corner called The Pioneer.   I have stayed there 3 times.  Around $50.00 Plus small tax.  Had free Wi FI,  phone and great cable TV.   A PLUS.

Text: Good service, and reasonable rates, rooms are extremely dated. Not very clean, and absolutely no updates made since probably the 1970's.
