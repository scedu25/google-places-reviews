Text: The room was clean, beds were comfortable I was able to check in nice and fast it was after I left that I had the problem. I left the hotel at 7Am in the morning to continue my drive to South Carolina, about 2 hours in I realized I had left a pair of earrings my boyfriend had JUST bought me for my birthday on the vanity. Check out is not until 11 and it was only 9AM I figured I could call and have someone set them aside for me until I was on my way back on Sunday. The girl who answered the phone seemed not to care about my situation at all after I told her the room I stayed in and where I left the earrings she simply said oh I'll let the maids know.. I asked her if she would like to take my number down so she could call me when they found them she said "whatever you want" at this point I should have known my earrings were goners but I held out hope. Since no one contacted me I called back about 3 hours later the same girl answered and said no one turned anything in.. I asked if they had gotten to the room yet and if anyone checked for them since I had called before the maids had even arrived. She said "no one turned them in"... no sympathy what so ever. Needless to say I stopped on my way home and they did let me check the room obviously The earrings were long gone... I understand I forgot the earrings but had the initial girl on the phone done her job as customer service I could still have those earrings, and she would not have ruined my experience with days inn. Will not be staying in a days inn ever again after that. Severely dissaponted.
