Courtyard by Marriott Chicago O'Hare
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel was nice.  Staff was super responsive.  If they offer you a "balcony" room, be prepared for the loud street noise coming from the highway.  We needed two phones on a fan app and a box fan to drown out the noise.  The Bistro was great...good food.  The free shuttle was excellent with great drivers.

Text: It's not a 4 star hotel, but it is clean, comfortable, affordable and near the airport. Modern and with good amenities. Reasonably priced. I'd stay here again of I had to, no problem.

Text: Nice location and friendly staff. The heating (fire) lamps in the courtyard area are aesthetically as well as practically nice when you want to keep warm while enjoying the outdoors. The only negative is the small weightroom that leaves a lot to be desired.

Text: Got stranded at o hare airport. Called about 8 hotels. Courtyard was the only one that actually picked up with a human being on the other end. Everyone else was using an automated call center or an off-site service that couldn't tell me if they actually had a room. Courtyard got the job done in about 30 seconds. The airport shuttle was a bit slow, but whatever. Hotel room was nice, but I was only there for about 6 hours. Having the casino next door was a nice bonus. Would recommend staying here if you fly United and they cancel your flight.
