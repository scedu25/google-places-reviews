Best Western Premier KC Speedway Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: We had an amazing time at the best western. From the minute we checked in until the time we left. The G.M. himself was awesome always smiling and laughing with us. He has some of his "regulars" there that just absolutely love him. Thank you to the whole staff everyone was great. Made my daughter's sweet 16 birthday weekend a blast.

Text: Been staying in this hotel for every one of my business trips to Kansas City. I travel here approximately 10 - 15 times per year. I won't stay at any other hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful, including the bartender. The rooms are spacious and always clean. Fitness center, pool with a spiral water slide, great breakfast, and much much more!

Text: The front staff (Hanna and Sophie) were very nice and super helpful. The breakfast was great and everything was clean! Every staff member smiled and asked how we were doing every time we walked pasted! We will be looking for best westerns for our stays from now on!

Text: Loved the hotel. Room was clean and as advertised very comfortable. The bar closes at 10:00pm but I do have to say the bartender "Starr" was very professional and talkative and actually made me a drink I'd never had before. Highly recommend the hotel and will return if in the area again.

Text: Racism, lying and towing cars.  Parking was supposed to be included.  The lot quickly became full, and the Asian lady at front desk began directing us to park in various locations around the lot.  Later the same night, the same lady who told us and many others that we could park could park in certain places called the police and began pointing at the very same cars she told could park, and asking them to be towed.  Luckily we saw from our balcony and questioned her about why she would tell us where to park then tow us immediately after.  She dodged the question then made up a rule that one room only gets one car, even though we payed for 3 nights in their largest room for 6 people.  Turns out a large group of white families arrived for softball, and our predominantly minority group for a car show was treated with much less respect and honesty, even though we had been here four 2 nights already.  We are hurt, angry and are too afraid for our vehicles to even sleep.  This is the worst hotel experience I've ever had.
