Hampton Inn Junction City

Text: The hotel is fine in of itself.  The entrance however is poor.   It is prior to the sign (coming from the highway) and is a sharp down.  This is shared by several businesses.   The entrance after the sign has no access to the hotel parking lot. 
Side note:  every member of the staff that we had any interaction with was super friendly and very helpful.   A joy just to talk with.

The housekeeper left a friendly note to the would be customer. This was a great touch. Parking was sufficient and had plenty of places. Breakfast was great Mr John is fast and efficient. Cleanliness came to mind.

Text: Room and staff get 5 stars.  Nice clean, comfortable room and a very professional staff.  Good hot breakfast is a big bonus all by itself.  Loss of 1 star due to terrible pillows. They feel like you could hold them up and read the newspaper through them.

Text: Good, clean (if a bit small) rooms. Fancy shower! Breakfast is filling and has a good variety. Service was polite and pleasant. There's not much around it (which of course is not a reflection on the hotel), but it does make a good road trip overnight stop.
