Drury Inn & Suites Champaign
Rating: 4
Text: We asked not to be located near the elevators or other public areas and they accommodated this request. Checked in right after 7PM so we missed the evening Kick Back which is a great perk of Drury. The bed was comfortable. Did hear the alarm go off in the room next to us for a long time, wondering if maybe no one was in there. Heard someone messing with a door in the hallway. Otherwise the noise level in the room was good. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were in dispensers on the wall in the shower so you were not limited in amount, however the scent was strong and not very good, bring your own. Nice to have a fridge in the room. Hot breakfast in the morning with lots of choices, would like more hot gluten free options. Good selection of gluten free cereals though. Lots of restaurants nearby too. This is a place I would stay again.

Text: Best Hotel in the Champaign area to stay at. The hotel is kept very clean and the hotel staff are very accommodating and friendly. I have stayed numerous times for business stays and the level of service is consistantly highly rated.

Text: Manager went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of on a night when a third-party agency made a mistake. She made sure that we were able to have our reservation honored even though she could have turned us away. The accommodations were clean and tidy. And the free breakfast was better than expected.

Text: My extended family recently stayed the weekend at Drury when we were together for my father’s memorial. The staff were extremely accommodating and helpful during this difficult time. The rooms and facilities were very nice and we felt well cared for during our stay.

Text: A busy hotel that still stayed quiet. I enjoyed the many choices at their free food and drink station. The pool, while small, was clean and well maintained, and the gym looked to be well equipped. 5/5, would recommend.
