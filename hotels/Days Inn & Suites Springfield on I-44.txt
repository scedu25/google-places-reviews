Days Inn & Suites Springfield on I-44

Text: Very noisy all night (sirens, metal crashing sounds, etc..).  Deadbolt only for show, did not have a hole in the door frame for the deadbolt slot into.  No safety chain latch (missing). Broken pull out bed, unusable.  Previous visitor's underwear left discarded in the corner. Blood on the curtains & unknown stains on the carpet.  Couldn't pay in cash without a very large deposit, they said they have a problem with people stealing their TV's.  Whole place felt unsafe.  They are pet friendly just be sure to keep your guard dog by the door to sleep soundly.

Text: Very clean,  they are doing major renovation,  it's a work in progress. There's Breakfast that actually gets 'served'to you.  Guy greets you and asks what you would like for breakfast. Great service!

Text: Wonderful customer service makes up for the rough edges while they remodel. Good hot breakfast with a gentleman who waits on you like it's a 4 star restaurant, serving biscuits and gravy, better then expected packaged cheese omelets, bagels, waffle maker, fresh fruit, danishes, muffins, cereal and oatmeal. Beds were decent, and the place was as clean as could be expected while they fix it up. Not bad at all if you are just looking for a place to sleep.

Text: I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Kind staff, very comfortable room.  I appreciate the staff for everything they have done for me during my stay.  Their Security Guard is a doll.  He makes the best breakfast!  Thank you!

Text: Stayed the night on Aug, 16th.  Very disappointed in the room we got for $80.  I understand they are remodeling, but that room should not be rented out to anybody.  There was mold in the bathroom and the ceiling looked like it was about to cave in also.  The room reeked of smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room.  Just a very bad room all around and this has probably ruined Days Inn for me.
