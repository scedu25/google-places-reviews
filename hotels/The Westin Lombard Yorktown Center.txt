The Westin Lombard Yorktown Center
Rating: 4
Text: We attended a weekend event at the Westin. The rooms were clean and well maintained. I was surprised by the lack of the standard clock radio. It had been replaced with a useful clock/ charging station. The in-room phone had been replaced with a VOIP unit which would not charge and did not function. The hotel staff was friendly but not terribly helpful

Text: I attended a day long conference for work. The hotel was beautiful, and clean. The staff did a great job of putting out breakfast, lunch and snacks in a neat and beautifully presented fashion. The staff was friendly and attentive. I plan on returning to enjoy the resturant and an overnight stay.

Text: I loved the Westin. Nice clean beds, great view, and great tv options. Nice indoor pool. Nice restaurant inside hotel. Great location (near many good restaurants). I recommend anyone staying in a hotel in this area, chose this hotel.

Text: We checked-in on September 8, 2017 for a two night stay.  We were offered and paid an $80 room upgrade fee.  We were asked if we would like a late checkout.  Our checkout day was Sunday so we said yes.  Well its Sunday and Jennifer the manager has let us know she will give us at 1pm checkout time, and that hotel security will be escorting us from the building.   This manager should not work in the hospitality business, perhaps at a corrections facility where her talents are better suited.  So we are looking forward to our security escort and the owners of this hotel should look forward to losing their 4.5 star rating on this hotel as Jennifer
to so keen to make happen.   Horrible.  First complaint on a SPG hotel in 25 or so years. I do hope they will help carry our bags at least.

Text: The location very good, close to the east-west toll way. The hotel located in the Yorktown mall. The layout of the hotel is nice and it has Harry Carey's restaurant. Staff are friendly and helpful.
