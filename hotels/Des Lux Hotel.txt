Text: Very nice and helpful staff - great customer service. My issue (and somewhat admittedly, were the room service fees. I ordered a dozen Coors Lights for my friend (the groom to be) and the coat was $100. Now, certainly shame on me for not just stopping at a convenience store, but that price is ludicrous at best. It feels hard to support a place who makes up some cost with prices like that.

Text: Even though we had a few bumps in our experience, still enjoyed the stay.  Room was very clean.  We stayed in the King suite with jetted tub.  The tub got stuck on and had to be reset, however after that was fine.  Staff was very pleasant and professional.  Made to order omlets for breakfast were great.  We had some trouble getting the $100 incidental that was placed on hold on our bank account removed, took about 3 weeks so just be prepared for that.

Text: I came here as part of a wedding party, and the hotel itself was pretty nice. But the bride and groom couldn't get back into their room past 2 am, since evidently the don't keep a anyone at the front desk that late. Blows my mind, since places like the Marriot always have front desk staff, and for much less.
