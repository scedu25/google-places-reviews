Text: The hotel is in need of some updates. We had some issues with the room (shower drain) in the morning but customer service was great. Management comped the room in the morning with no other questions asked and was extremely concerned with our satisfaction. Everyone at the hotel was extremely professional and friendly.

Text: Great clean rooms. Super comfy pillows. A very good ac that was easy to use. Plus they give moutwash amnities in the bathroom. We got toothpaste and a toothbrush for free and that was the most fulfilling Continental breakfast I've ever had! 10/10 great place

Text: Started out okay super nice lady working but went downhill fast!  She told me at check in that brkfast had "everything" and ALWAYS had a meat and an egg get to breakfast no meat and only an egg omelet and potato dish that was too peppery to eat.  Then after check in I realized I had been charged 3 times for my room and that they took all my $.  Mind you I had already left and ate lunch which I could not pay for.  Then I told them I had no $ for food or gas and they told me they had a system malfunction but yet blamed my bank and told me the g.m was not there so it could not be fixed and left me stranded with no food I had to sleep at a rest stop and eat NOTHING.  If possible I would give 0 stars. Also they failed to notify me that this happened so I had already ate the meal.

Text: We didn't stay but our parents did. The Continental breakfast was great! The rooms were clean. They only disappointment was that the pool was closed for maintenance and that was a main reason they booked this hotel.

Text: The beds were extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice. The room's air conditioner had a hard time regulating temperature though. I woke up in the middle of the night and had to drop it 3 degrees.
