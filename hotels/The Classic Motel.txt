Text: Beyond unhappy with this place.  Their beds are like sleeping on the ground I never have back pain and my back hurt after sleeping here.  They never cleaned our room.  The shower is big enough to stand sideways in and you hit elbows trying to wash.   You can hear every sound from the room next door.  Girls in room next to us were up laughing, watching tv loud at 2 am.  Could hear entire conversation if you had to use bathroom.   Manager very unfriendly when I called to let him know, after also letting attendant know. He not so kindly explained I should have went to the front office at 2 am to complain or called him at 2 am but there were no phones in the room and he then explained I should have used my cell to call.    Will remember this next time (its hard enough to get someone to check you in here, i am sure getting them to come dealing with loud people at 2 am will be super simple)..... will also never stay here again.  .waste of 160 dollars for 2 nights of misery!
