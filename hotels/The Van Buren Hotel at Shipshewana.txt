The Van Buren Hotel at Shipshewana
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms were very comfortable. Good selections at breakfast. Love the fresh baked cookies and coffee available throughout the day. The hostess was delightful. The only drawback is the check-in desk is so far away from the elevator.

Text: This hotel is absolutely beautiful! It is located about a mile from the center of town where all the action is.
 
The rooms look very clean and nicely decorated.  The staff is friendly and informative of any activities going on in the area. 

Thier one vice is King size bed that me and my wife slept in was way too firm for our liking.  Neither of us slept well at all.  Both of our backs were hurting in the morning.

Text: The hotel was very nice and staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great with lots of options. Would have rated five stars except the online reservation service on hotel website didn't work and didn't receive confirmation email. Had to call to make reservation the next day and wasn't able to get the room style I wanted. Will plan on staying there next time we are in the area.

Text: In general, this is a nice hotel with decent amenities like a pool, wifi, and breakfast (more on this later). The rooms are fine, although they feel a bit dated. The rooms do have refrigerators and microwaves which is always nice. They hit one of my pet peeves at hotels, which is having modern flat screen TVs but with analog cable/sat signal, giving you a terrible, fuzzy picture. Just annoying. The beds are fine and the bathroom was clean, if a bit small. My biggest complaint was the hot breakfast. They mention it in their ads very prominently, so I was expecting something like what you might get at Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. I'm theory, that may be true, in practice it seemed like they just didn't care. Breakfast is served from 7am to 10:30am, I think. I showed up at 8am, went up to get eggs, they were gone. Attempted to make a bowl of cereal, went to pour the milk, it was empty. Went over to get a bagel, all gone. There was one girl (maybe 16?) sort of tending the whole thing, but she'd wait until a whole tray of assorted items were gone before replentishing anything. The bagels shared a tray with English muffins, there were still muffins even though the bagels were gone, so there's no point in bringing a new tray I guess? The donut/pastry tray was finally completely wiped out so she finally put a new tray of those out. The eggs were finally replentished, and since there was a room full of people eagerly awaiting the advertised hot breakfast, the eggs were gone inside two minutes and I never saw them replaced again. It was disappointing because it seemed like such a meager effort. All in all, the hotel is "fine", but if I'm spending $160/night (before taxes/fees) in middle of nowhere, I expect a little better.
