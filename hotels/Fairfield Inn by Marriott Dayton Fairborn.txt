Text: Older building but the rooms were not bad. The staff were on point and friendly. 

Heads up there is no fitness center. This hotel shares a fitness center with a neighboring hotel.... which only has one broken tredmill and two other "cardio" items. They also offer a free day pass to the planet fitness about 4 miles down the road, which is an acceptable alternative.

Text: It was an average hotel. Breakfast was about average with waffles, bacon, and sausage, along with other classic hotel breakfast foods. The room was clean and smelled nice.

Text: Sub par at best. Stayed for a soccer tournament and it might have been the worst hotel I've stayed in especially for the price ($140/night). Smelly room, terrible temp control in the rooms, out dated...best two things about our stay was the water pressure and thy offered a decent breakfast.
