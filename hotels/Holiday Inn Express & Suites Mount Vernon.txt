Holiday Inn Express & Suites Mount Vernon
Rating: 5
Text: Brand new holiday Inn express and everything was great. New decor and super comfy bed. The heat/ac unit in the room was amazing. It was mounted on the ceiling and it was super quite. Room stayed ice cold. The only complaint was the size of the coffee cups. Super small. Had to take 2 for the road. Highly recommend staying here

Text: Loved this hotel! Great breakfast selection. Great rates for military ($40 discount). The area for being in Mt.Vernon, felt very safe, nice and clean. The hotel is also walking distance from a couple of restaurants. Overall we had a great experience, and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. We had a 2 bedroom with 2 young children (4yr & 5yr old) and they  enjoyed their bath in the bath tub. Although it's next to a highway, it really wasn't loud, we all slept very well.

Text: This Holiday Inn was our favorite hotel we stayed at this trip. The staff was super friendly and everything was very clean. Walking in, the lobby is very friendly and nice looking. Breakfast was awesome and they even have an automatic pancake maker! Just push a button and you get to watch two pancakes cooked on a conveyer belt. The man in charge of breakfast was named Carl. He was so friendly and the best part of breakfast. He made sure everything at the breakfast bar was ready all morning.

Text: Aesthetically, the hotel is really nice and the breakfast is better than most. However, if you have small children,  look elsewhere. The modern blinds do not keep out the light (even the lights from the building at night),  and the hotel is directly next to I-64, and all night long all we heard were the 18 wheelers and their brakes. Their also was no tub in our room, I bathed our 19 month old in the sink. We were only staying overnight, but after driving for 8 hours with 3 small kids, no one slept, and it wasn't because we weren't exhausted.
