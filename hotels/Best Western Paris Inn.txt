Best Western Paris Inn

Text: Nice, clean room and public areas. Breakfast food was good with nice variety to choose from. Quiet and off the main street. Beds comfortable, but pillows could've been softer for our preference. We would stay here again when in the area.

Text: I wish BW had better breakfast choices.   Not real good this time.  The rooms are clean but a little outdated.  Some of the new attendants were a bit crabby this stay.

Text: Nicely kept room with standard features and no extras. Breakfast was okay and consisted of eggs biscuits and gravy and the standard continental breakfast items. Beds were fairly comfortable

Text: Friendly staff but rooms smelled bad. They were courteous about moving us, but the other room smelled bad too. Breakfast not great. Rooms open to outside
