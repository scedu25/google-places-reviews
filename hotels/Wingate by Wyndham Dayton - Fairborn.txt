Text: I am really impressed so far with this stay. Its the first night. I'm up here for a career fair. The place is very clean and tidy. The environment, along with the people, feels very professional and put together.

Everything you need is in walking distance. The neighborhood is beautifully landscaped and clean. 

The surrounding restaurants and stores make me feel very safe to walk alone not to mention my most favorite store "Meijr" is right next door. ?

Text: Clean rooms, comfortable beds... That's the only good things I have to say, the wall unit every time it came on sounded like there was a dozen maracas in it. Then the breakfast was a little disappointing to say the least, the apples that were wrapped in Saran wrap looked brown one the oranges in the fruit basket literally had rotting spots.... The bananas were green....

Text: For a older hotel it was ok.  Definitely not living up to wingate name. The doors had to be pushed just right in order for it to lock. The drains were way to slow in 2 separate rooms. Rooms didnt feel and seem cleaned throughly. Towels didnt seem cleaned or fresh. Front desk and the manager were great and hence 3 stars or else I would give it 1 or 2 stars. Did not have our room ready even at 4pm but the lady at front desk resolved that issue to my satisfaction.
