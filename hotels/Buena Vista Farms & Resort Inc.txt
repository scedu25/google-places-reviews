Text: I was there for a wedding. This place is beautiful with the trees, the pond, the sunset, and the quietness of the place. It is right next to the highway but it seems like it is out in the middle of no where because it is so quiet. It's a great place to have a wedding and a reception. If you don't want to drive home, than you can stay in there cabins. They are perfect little cabins for these types of things. It was perfect to me. When I got up I went out on the front porch and watched the sunrise. The light hit the water to make the water extremely beautiful. The staff there is terrific as well. It's only a few people but it seems like there's a lot because of how nice everything is and I couldn't believe that only a few people could do such an amazing job.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone because you will have an amazing experience.
