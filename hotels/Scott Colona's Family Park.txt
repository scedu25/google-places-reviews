Text: Well,  out here today,  Saturday  July  1.
There is No  Activities to enjoy. 
Very dissapointed. 
Only  1 Personal Camper  paid for All the Activities for the kid's. 
Rest of activities cancelled for the weekend. 
Park Rangers have no clues as to what  is going on. 
?Parents Camp seasonal, then to find out no goings on.
