Holiday Inn Express & Suites Shelbyville
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed at the hotel in August and loved it. Staff was great. Room was comfortable affordable and for the most part very clean. I did see a small bug Saturday night but it was not enough to keep me from staying again

Text: Nice hotel. New beds. For some reason they did away with blackout curtains, and in place put aluminum vertical blinds. There are spotlights behind them aimed at the building so it is never dark. Much worse at sunrise. I'm a Holiday Inn Platinum guest and will never go to this hotel again.

Text: We recently stayed at the Hampton Inn in Shelbyville, KY. Although it's a bit worn (maybe not up to expectations for other Hampton Inns), the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub. We had a quiet stay and a good breakfast. Thanks to the hotel staff for their helpfulness!
