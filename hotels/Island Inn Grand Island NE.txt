Island Inn Grand Island NE
Rating: 5
Text: We had a king size bed, non-smoking, clean and comfortable room with all amenities needed, and a few unexpected ones, such as a love seat, hair dryer, extra storage, coffee to be made in microwave, and a freezer in the small fridge, for just over $60 after tax and fees. There was also a continental breakfast, and friendly, accommodating managers. Very good value. We hope to stop there again....Oh, one complaint: wall switch didn't operate any light, so entered fairly dark room to find a switch on a lamp.

Text: Very decent hotel overall for the price. The staff was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. If you are looking for a decent basic room for a reasonable price then I would recommend the Island Inn motel.

Text: Was told checkin was 3. Called at 330 was told room was clean. Entered horrible smelling building. Opened room and pillows were still messed up. Top blanket on bed was just tossed on bed. Mold in air cond. Trash was just smashed down not taken out.

Text: Low quality room.  The sheets came off the bed Everytime you rolled over leaving you laying on the dirty mattress. The hair dryer did not work so I had to go buy one. The sink dripped all night long.  Mold in the shower.  Stale smell to the room so I had to buy air fresheners. The carpet was dirty and sticky in places. The free breakfast was not impressive.  A few muffins, banana and cereal.  Will not stay here again.  You get what you pay for here.

Text: The motel was was clean and quiet. Given the price you can't expect much more than that.
