Text: Great place fair price and clean.  I'm in town getting some repair work done on my trailer, the owner of the shop recommended this hotel called and got me a room.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.

Text: Stayed there March 16 and 17, 2017.  We were very impressed by the staff and the room. It was clean and fresh with a beautiful lake view. There was a frig and microwave. Staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. We will definitely be returning to this motel.

Text: Very convenient location for our needs, very close to some restaurants, the park, and a store. Rooms were pretty clean, if a bit smoky. Did what we needed the room to do, no issues here.

Text: Incredibly "meh" and not a good value. The rooms, service, and amenities are no better than a Motel 6, but almost double the price.  The service from staff and housekeeping is pretty poor/minimal. Our bed wasn't made due to "personal belongings" on it (a pajama shirt) but housekeeping moved/threw away other items and left cleaning supplies laying around our room.
