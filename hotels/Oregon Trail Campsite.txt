Oregon Trail Campsite

Text: I honestly can't say enough about my stay here. I came up from Arizona and spent 2 full weeks at the end of August 2017. Gary and Marie are the nicest people I've met. They were very fair and accommodating. Gary is like an old buddy you haven't seen in a long time. The whole town is friendly and so helpful. This is not a resort campground with showers and activities, so don't expect that. They have 50 amp, full hook ups, great water, easy in and out and for a small farming community - the area is full of great nature attractions. Me and my dog Louie felt right at home here. I highly recommend it and we look forward to coming back. By the way, I called and received a phone call back within 12 hours... Why would someone take the time to leave a review if they've never stayed here?? These are working folks around here! There's a pay station at the front, pull in, park, sleep great, pay, done.
