Text: We rented canoes and did the 5 mile trip. It was an easy river. Very enjoyable float down the river. We paused at one point to get out and play in a deeper section of the river. We had a good time.

Text: Make reservations on Friday. Drive all the way out to Morgan's canoe rental for them to tell us if they're closed due to high water. It'd be super helpful if in the future when someone has reservations, Morgan's could call them and tell them not to bother to come out.
