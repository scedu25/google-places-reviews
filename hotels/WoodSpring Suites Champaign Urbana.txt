Text: The receptionist was sassy, unenthusiastic and seemingly unable to use the computer and check people in while feilding calls. It took upwards of 15 minutes to get checked in. The most inexcusable portion of our visit was the fact that THEY HAD BED BUGS! I found several painful bites on my legs the next morning.

Text: You get what you pay for. Nothing spectacular at all. They are very under staffed. I waited almost 30 minutes just to get someone to check me in. The time before that when I stayed, I checked in at 3 but couldn't get a room until 430p. I was even sent to the room and they were STILL cleaning but nobody was in there. Just ugh. But its not a resort so what do I expect right? I guess!!! 3 stars because I'll stay again if I'm looking for a place with a full refrigerator. I just know what to expect.

Text: The receptionist had a bad attitude. Hallways smelled musty and like cigarettes and so did the room. I understand it's a budget Motel but there are better options in the area for around the same price.

Text: I would love to give them zero stars because that's what they deserve.  Unsupervised children roaming the halls day and night.  People stomping and jumping on the floor in the wee hours of the morning, I've been here 6 nights and have YET to get one night's sleep.  Management does NOTHING about rude guests. DO NOT STAY HERE. PAY MORE MONEY AND STAY AT A RESPECTFUL HOTEL, TRUST ME. Customer service is a joke and management is the absolute WORST OMG.  Don't even bother talking to management because he doesn't care and he talks OVER you. King jack ass
