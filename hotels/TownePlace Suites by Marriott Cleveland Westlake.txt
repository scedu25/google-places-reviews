TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Westlake
Rating: 5
Text: Spacious suites, complete with dinnerware, a washing machine, all the kitchen comforts of home. Bathroom divides into two sections, sink area can be used and separate from the shower/toilet. The check in counter has food/snacks/drinks for purchase, which was a nice convenience. To compliment the pull out couch, they provide a bag of sheets, a bed cover, and a blanket.

Text: This was my second stay at this hotel. The facility is good: room was nicely equipped with kitchenette, bed was comfortable. Breakfast is quite good: bagels, English muffins, cereal, oatmeal, eggs, sausages, waffles, yogurt, muffins, boiled eggs, cheese, orange juice, tea, coffee. Some noise from the hallway and outside. Overall a good place to stay.
