Text: I am thankful they have batteries in stock, and reasonably priced as well. This place keeps getting better every year with better stock and new amenities. The folks here have been great to work with.

Text: We love coming here!  We keep our boat here and have never had any problems, we bring our camper and love the space for each camp site, and we have stayed at the motel multiple times.  We also like to sit on the marina deck and enjoy their drinks and great food.  The owners and employees are very friendly and helpful.

Text: Stayed at the campground in a tent (mostly there are campers), the bathroom was fine and rarely  used by others.  At the marina store I rented a SUP and there is a sitting area on the dock that is shady and breezy perfect for a hot weekend.  The staff is all very friendly and helpful, especially Claudia.  Thanks a bunch.

Text: This place is awesome!!!! I had a wonderful stay, and caught some big fish while I was there. Im not a huge fisherman but the owners guided me in the right direction and told me where the easiest place would be to catch a fish for an inexperienced fisherman! The room was clean, and the staff at the resort were all very nice. From my understanding it was purchased by new owners a few years ago and they really turned the place around, I rented a Pontoon boat, and cruised around it was very relaxing, I stayed in the motel for two nights and overall it was a very relaxing trip, I will be coming back and telling my family and friends about it. Thanks again for the hospitality. You guys are doing an excellent job, keep up the good work!
