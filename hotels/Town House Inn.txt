Text: They had just had renovations done which were decent, but the non-smoking rooms smelled like smoke so that was a bummer.

Text: Upon arrival I was approached by another patron with a cup. He asked if I was staying. When I replied yes, he proceeded to advise that I check my bed then motioned at the cup. It took almost 30 min to get my room key. I was overcharged and the soda machine ate my 1.50.

Text: This is a hidden gem in Jackson... great rates, good, clean and up to date rooms. The staff was also very nice and accomodating! There isn't much to look at from the street, it looks like a typical motel built in the 60's alongside a highway. Inside couldn't be farther from that. Not the biggest rooms but they are the size of a typical studio apartment, complete with a full size refrigerator, stove, sink, and microwave. Plenty of counterspace as well. 32in flat-screen also.
