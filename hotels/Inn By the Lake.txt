Inn By the Lake
Rating: 5
Text: This place is so comfy, well kept and quaint. It's perfectly located around all of the action and nice eateries. MAKE SURE to enjoy the ULTRA delightful breakfast lovingly prepared by Gina, who owns this place along with her gregarious husband. My family and I absolutely love this place and admire the owners as well; good people.

Text: Inn By the Lake rocks! It deserves 10 stars. The location is great. The rooms are quaint and comfortable. The beds are the best! The breakfast in the morning is amazing. Not just boring scrabbled eggs and bacon. Gourmet food every morning. The host, Gina and Nick, are friendly an provide incredible service. This is my "go to" place every time I am in Culver. I highly highly recommend staying at the Inn By the Lake!

Text: My husband and I stay here for few days last year. I love love this place and the owners so friendly. The breakfast they put out wow amazing, and was different breakfast tarts, casseroles. 
I used to take my kids up to this area and just love the lake, the beach, the town. 
We had went up there when summer session either starting or getting out for the academy, so the restaurants were a bit crowded. 
So excited to stay up at the In by the Lake again.

Text: Great facilities, I got a comfortable room with the lake view. They provide washing machine and dryer at other building, and in-room iron that very useful for us us who did the roadtrip. They  dont serve any breakfast, but bear cafe just beside our building, also near safeway store. The location is also very nice, not too busy, but near restaurants, gas station and groceries.
