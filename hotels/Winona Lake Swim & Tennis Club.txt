Text: The treatment here at the start was great. The other campers were friendly and the owners, a nice older couple, were a joy to work with. We were staying here during the purchase of our house but after having such a positive time, my husband and I talked about keeping the camper there for the rest of the summer and about a month ago, talked to Ms. Althea about what the cost would be. She informed us that she would have to get back with us on the cost. My husband asked that she just call and let us know and I would be more than happy to drop by with a check (we live in Lima, so it would be very easy to do). After numerous failed attempts to find out what the cost would be and realizing we weren't going to be using the site as much as we hoped, we decided to go pick up the camper and move it back to our house. As my husband was loading up the camper, the son, pulled up and blocked him in, got in my husbands face and wanted to know if he was going to leave without paying. My husband informed him that he had the check book on him and was planning on stopping at the house on his way out. My husband wrote a check but that still wasn't enough. The son then proceeded to go around to the different camp sites asking for a phone so he could verify that the check was good before my husband was allowed to leave. Now first, regardless of the situation, it's highly inappropriate to discuss any financial matter of one customer to others. Second, we have never had any issue with them before. To be treated like a criminal, was not just shocking but also highly embarrassing. And the worst part, he fully admitted that the issue wasn't with us, but with the fact that other campers have left without paying so he just assumed we'd do the same. And lastly, he had no right to keep us there.
