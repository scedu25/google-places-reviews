Text: The Pheasant Countrty bed and breakfast is beautiful place to stay when traveling to Lafayette, Indiana or just passing through the area.  It will remind you of a home away from home and is very
nicely and interestingly furnished.  I have known the owner for many years and she never fails to provide a traveler with excellent service. You will like the small town atmosphere and the windmills in the area.  Windpower is being harvested here!

Text: We stayed at the Pheasant Country Inn and had a fantastic experience. We were on our way to Bloomington for the Indiana football game and stayed a night at the Inn. We arrived late into the night, and the hostess was very courteous and accomodating. The decor was quaint; the rooms, comfortable. The hostess prepared a great breakfast for us the next morning and entertained us with her interesting stories and life experiences. We would definately stay there again and recommend it to anyone!
