Days Inn Paducah
Rating: 5
Text: We booked 2 rooms, and with the lower price we didn't expect much. We were very pleasantly surprised. While the building itself is older, the rooms were very modern, comfortable, and well suited with a nice sized refrigerator, microwave, nice flat screen tv, comfortable beds, and very clean. Staff was very nice and friendly, pool was great, if not deep, the grounds from the outside don't look like much, but inside were well maintained with very pretty landscaping. Breakfast was a light continental with not a big selection, but most hotels in this price range offer nothing, so even that was above and beyond.

We were so pleased with the hotel that we have book marked it for future visits.

Text: I gave it five stars because of the friendliness of the staff. (Read below. I changed the rating). I got here about 2 hours before check in and was still allowed to get my room. The rooms are kind of dated but clean and comfortable. I will be staying here on the return trip. On the return trip they gave me a room with no hot water for a shower. Discovered this this morning. Told the clerk and all she did was shrug her sholders. Aldo the pool had mud on the bottom on the first trip and nothing changed on the return trip. Mud was still there. 2nd thoughts about staying there again..EVER!

Text: Price was what I wanted, room was not.  Had to move to three different rooms for a 3 night stay. All room maintenance issues. The staff was very nice though.
