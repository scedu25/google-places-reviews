Text: We stayed here for my bachelorette party and loved it! We enjoy partying but also enjoy relaxation. This house was perfect for both! The house is walking distance to everything including the ferry! We loved being on the water and having a relaxing and peaceful time while still being close to the bars and pools. The house is clean and has so much space! It was perfect.

Text: The Dodge house is the perfect location in Put-in-Bay. Overlooks the bay and is two blocks from the DeRivera Park.  House is clean and well appointed. Agent was very accommodating of our needs. Highly recommended if you and you party have aged out of Dudebro territory, but still enjoy the South Bass type entertainment.
