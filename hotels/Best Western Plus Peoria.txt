Best Western Plus Peoria
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean and large! Bed was comfy! Plenty of towels available. Great water pressure in the shower. Wonderful sink space. Employees were friendly and helpful. Only downfall was the indoor pool was FREEZING! The pool itself and around it was very clean. Definitely would stay again.

Our room was a double queen, had coat closet, mini fridge, TV,  desk with chair, side lounge chair, bed side lights with convenient outlets, sink separate from tolet/shower.

Text: We have stayed at this property at least 6-8 times and have always had a positive experience.  From Gloria and her front desk staff to the clean rooms and excellent breakfast, this hotel has offered a pleasant experience at a good price.  With a child at Bradley University, this has become our home in Peoria and it feels like coming home each time we check in.  I highly recommend the property for its friendliness, its value and its location.

Text: I was very disappointed. Best Western was specifically chosen because it has an indoor pool and my granddaughters were with me on this overnight trip and they love to swim. After checking in, getting our room situated and the girls putting on their swimming suits we went to the pool only to find it cold as ice, the heater broke a few days prior and the needed part to fix the heater was on back order. Very disappointing for 2 little girls who did brave the cold water about 10 minutes untill their lips turned purple.

Text: Excellent experience.  We were attending a wedding in Peoria and it was a perfect relaxing ending to a perfect day.  Our young ones enjoyed the pool.  Breakfast was an enjoyable experience before we returned home the next day.
