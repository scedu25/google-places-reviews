Best Western Ashbury Inn

Text: Rooms are very clean,  staff are helpful and professional.   Each staff member asked us how we were going and if our stay was good.   

Only thing I can think that would be a downside is the stiff beds.    With that said, we all slept through the night.

They went above & beyond, to graciously accommodate & go out of their way to make our trip of 3 nights & about 60 people, ever so enjoyable!
