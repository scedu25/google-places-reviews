Text: Campshore Campground is amazing! We got the last spot on extremely short notice...and so thankful we did! The camp hosts were wonderful to us. This campground is clean, has a well kept pool our family loved, clean showers and bathrooms, shade trees all over, a sheltered pavilion, concession food available, and the beautiful Ohio River right on the property. It's great for all your water activities! We will definitely go back!

Text: We stayed here while visiting the Creation Museum in nearby Petersburg, about a 20 min. drive.  This campground is all about making a clean, safe environment for kids.  We were impressed with the heart of the managers and the history behind the place (started in the 1880s!).  Views of the river are great, showerhouse is spic and span, lawn manicured, staff as generous and friendly as can be.  We will definitely return!

Text: It really sucks.call and make reservations. Two weeks in a Vance. Dive 4 hour drive got there for Father's Day weekend .there for three hours. Then they told me dogs are not aloud couldn't stay.and on top of it it's a handicap dog for my child. I think they were on drugs.
