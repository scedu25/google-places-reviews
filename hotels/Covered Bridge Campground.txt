Text: FORGET THIS CAMPGROUND..It's the worst campground we have ever stayed at, out of several hundred! 
I would not recommend to anybody. 
Washrooms are filthy and badly in need of maintenance, garbage is overflowing in dumpster, no wifi, no office on site (down the street one block). My wife went to use the laundry room to find only the name on the door should have read "Storage Room".
Pricing is the same as higher end campgrounds. We were not treated as paying customers.
The owner decided to start grading the roads around our trailer after 5:00PM while we were having our dinner-creating a lot of dust and noise. This went on for over an hour, until I finally decided to ask them how much longer they would be? 
The operator of the small loader was extremely aggressive, giving both my wife and I the 'finger', cursing and threatening to put a pile of rocks in front of our truck so we could not move. We decided to leave shortly thereafter fearing even though it was dark and had to drive nearly all night to our next destination. To say the least, it was a horrible experience.
