Text: We just got home from The Pillow and Paddock.  What a fantastic time we had.  Don and Francesca were outstanding in their host and hostess duties.  They thought ahead and prepared for anything we might possibly want.  The 24-hour Guest Pantry was well stocked with beverages and snacks, games, DVDs, CDs, books, and magazines.  I especially liked the rocking chairs on the front porch.  Even though her main oven broke during our stay, she never missed a beat - including delivering hot cookies to the porch in the evening.  My husband celebrated his birthday while we were there and we came back to a room that the birthday fairy had visited leaving chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise.  Breakfast is fantastic - large enough that we weren't hungry for lunch.  It is well worth a visit.
