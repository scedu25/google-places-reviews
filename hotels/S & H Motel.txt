Text: Great little locally owned motel.  Although it's older, the rooms look like they have been redone very recently - new paint, carpet, sink, curtains etc.  Good wifi, they even have a little outlet jack with several USB charging ports on the nightstand.  Immaculately clean and very reasonbly priced.

Text: Very lovely motel. The owners are very nice. The rooms are very clean, the bed was so comfortable. I normally do not sleep well when traveling, but I had one of the best nights sleep ever. The shower in our room was pink, loved the 1950's feel. We highly recommend this motel!
