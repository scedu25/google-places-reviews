Residence Inn by Marriott Lexington North
Rating: 5
Text: I really enjoyed my stay of over a month here when I was on an official visit to Lexington. The rooms are huge and the place is very peaceful.
The staff here is very friendly and courteous. The people at the reception - Wayne, Jonathan and Casey were always willing to extend all the possible help. These friendly people made my stay even more worthwhile.

Text: The room was clean and the court yard has a fire place. I stayed in the double bed studio and it was really spacious. We had six people fit comfortable in the room. The front desk was extremely supportive of our needs also.

Text: I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff were very accommodating and genuine. The rooms are great as with all residence inns I've stayed at. The only thing I didn't like about my stay is the the doors for the rooms open to the outside, but that's just a personal preference.
