Text: We were a little worried about this place after reading the reviews. Believe though, it was just fine. Not your best, but clean! No amenities like shampoo, hair dryer, etc. did have a small microwave and little fridge which we didn't use. Very quiet! Front desk person was nice. Breakfast was your typical....waffles , cereal, mini donuts, bagels, coffee, juice.

Text: Clean hotel with large rooms, lost a star for no hot tub and small workout facility with only 2 pieces of equipment. Ample food choices nearby with fuel stations and convenient / big box stores.
