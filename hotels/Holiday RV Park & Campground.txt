Holiday RV Park & Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Very convenient location for my wife and I to meet friends who live in Nebraska. The park is clean and many good places to eat nearby. They have a very nice dog walk with pick-up bags available and convenient waste disposal. Many accessible highways and byways for riding my bike and a golf course within 10 minutes. The staff is very friendly. We'll be staying here for many years to come.

Text: Easy location off I-80.  Staff was very nice.  All pull-thru sites.  Stayed here with a 34ft travel trailer and did not need to unhook from our truck for the night.  A lot of room for big RVs.  Restrooms and showers were older but extremely clean.  The kids enjoyed the pool.  Seems to get quite busy during summer driving season, so be sure to make reservations.  We were able to call same day and save a spot.  Will stay here again if we are traveling through.

Text: Great place! Office was super friendly. The space was big enough for our 42 fifth wheel and then some! Spent one night on our way back home!
