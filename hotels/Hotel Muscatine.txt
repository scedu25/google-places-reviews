Hotel Muscatine

Text: Hotel staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to help you. There rates are the cheapest that I found in Muscatine for weekly rates. My boyfriend and I stayed for a little over a month and had a King bed with couch, flat screen TV, fridge and microwave plus the room was decent size. The full breakfast buffet in the morning is pretty good too. They have washer and dryer available, an exercise room, and free WiFi with computers available in the lobby for guests to use as well. Our only complaints are they have an inside pool and spa which were running but Out of Order the whole time we were there because they told us The City of Muscatine had to reinspect it and pass it before they could reopen it, also they only have one washer and one dryer for the guest to use, and there housekeeping needs some improvement. Love the fish pond! We will stay again!

Text: I give it one star because of the room we stayed in. The guy at the front desk was friendly. (Seemed to be the only staff there.) This place has so much potential its not even funny. But there were stains on the floors and walls. Ceiling tiles were missing in our bathroom and the electrical junction boxes above the shower in the ceiling had no cover. Everything in our room had a "someone sweated in our beds" feel to it. I know a lot of people hate this word but "moist" is the most accurate description for how my room felt.  
My parents room had no AC and the pool was closed by the Iowa Health Dept. We didn't stay for the breakfast due to the Health Dept. Signs. Figured it was safer to eat elsewhere. 
If this place were 100% revamped with new everything I'd go back. I like the 70s  feel it has, but I don't see that happening.

Text: Friendly staff. Pretty clean rooms but could be better. Eggs and sausage gravy pretty good but could do better sausage. Kind of upset no hot tub and pool when the amenities says they are here. Sucky maintenance don't think they work much here. Doesn't look like they put any money back into place.

Text: this place is so run down its actually sad.  I think these days it's geared for construction crews possibly.  Most rooms do not have working air.  Not even all electrical outlets or lights work.  Ceiling tiles missing in bathrooms. We are a soccer team with no where else to go so we are sharing notes about the bad conditions.  The toilet paper is soft,  high quality, go figure.

Text: The outlets were very concerning.  The shower still had hair in it. There is no cable. Also the pool was closed for some reason.  The front desk clerk seemed highly offended that I paid with cash.  If I don't get bed bugs I will be more surprised.  This place is disgusting. If I could have given no stars I would.
