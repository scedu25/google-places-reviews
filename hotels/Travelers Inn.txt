Text: This place is a,complete rip off. It should not be open for business. Hope u like roaches be cause they will be  your roommate for your entire visit. The room was visibly dirty upon entering. No towels, or soap available. If you're looking for a place that's clearly about taking your money, than this place is it. When was the last time a health inspection was done?!!!  Shame on you owner!!

Text: We were supposed to stay at the America's Best when our GPS landed us here, just a stones throw from the original place. There was a car in the parking lot that was jacked up and missing a tire, the pool was empty but was filled with moss. The room, well, the pictures should speak for themselves. I did not stay here, I checked in to the Courtyard Marriott downtown. Don't stay here.

Text: The rooms are decent, a little pricey. Easy access, not really a place to stay at with kids. It will work in a pinch.
