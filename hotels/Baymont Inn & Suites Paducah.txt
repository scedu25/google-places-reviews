Text: Came in late at night and they were very fast at getting me into my room. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfy. Great quality for the price. I would definitely come back. I also brought my dog and they were very friendly with her.

Text: Best hotel stay I've had in a long time. Cheap prices, clean rooms, comfortable beds, very good breakfast, friendly staff. Great place to stay especially if you are bringing your pet along. Plenty of grass outside to let your dog roam.

Text: Not the best, but it's cheap so we didn't expect much. It's one of those hotel rooms with those hideous bed spreads that look like curtains. They were very scary!! The location was not good, and the rooms were scary and smelly. But it was cheap and a place to stay which is all we needed that night before getting to our real vacation in Florida. Won't stay here again that is for sure. But if you're looking for something literally right off the highway this is the place. But it's close to nothing, and beds were pretty bad.

Text: Definitely one of the best motels I've stayed in. The staff is extremely friendly and are always going out of their way to make sure we have an enjoyable stay. Each time we come in, we're greeted with a smile and asked If there's anything they can do to make us more comfortable. If you're looking for good prices and great customer service I highly recommend staying here.

Text: Couldn't beat the price and I'm glad I didn't. The staff were more then welcoming. I was checked in quickly with no issues, and shortly after getting to my room I had a knock on the door making sure my room was as exspected and it was. Further services were suggested if needed. What a warm welcome! Everything was/is clean and comfortable. All the lights work and a remote that actually works with the TV. If I am ever through this area again I know where I will be staying. Thanks again.
