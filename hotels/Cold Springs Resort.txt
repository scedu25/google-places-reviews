Text: Not sure how they have 5 stars but we all know they asked staff to review them, we had a family reunion across the lake and we thought this will be the perfect place to spend all weekend until we walked in a dungeon, the whole place the carpets are dirty and ton, the sink was rusted and old, the room was hot, dust all over, spider warms, the carpet was old, the hole way was noisy at night people slamming the doors in the middle of the night, didn't have a fire extinguisher , I can go on and on about this place we took lots of pictures, and we had to cancel and tell other family member to cancel their booking on Friday night, it's not family friendly. They claim it was renovated but geez clean the damn resorts its disgusting!

Text: Quiet, quaint, peaceful, out-of-the-way place to stay, for anyone who enjoys alternative travel away from the Big Box Interstates.  I commend the owners for keeping this hotel in business for 150 years.  That's the kind of American spirit that I endorse.  If the rooms were modernized with water softener and individual HVAC controls, that would earn the fifth star.
