Hampton Inn & Suites Omaha-Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed at this Hampton for a short trip to Omaha to celebrate our anniversary.   Shout out to Spencer at the front desk!  Really nice guy!   Gave us a choice of floors and our room had a view of the Sports Complex which was pretty cool.  Our room was great, modern and very clean.    Took a free shuttle to Old Market for dinner. (Jackson Street Tavern was awesome!)  Neat place to spend the evening walking around. One phone call to Spencer at the end of our evening and a shuttle picked us up within a few minutes to bring us back to the hotel.  We were SO SURPRISED to find a bottle of wine, snacks and a really nice HAND WRITTEN card congratulating us on our anniversary!  Now that is going above and beyond!  Such a nice gesture!  We had so much fun on our short trip we plan to come back when we have more time.  You bet we'll stay here!   Thanks for making us feel special!    
Omaha Hampton Inn.....  Good employees are hard to find - Great employees LIKE SPENCER that care about their customers and go above and beyond to make YOUR business look good ..... those are REALLY hard to find!  Hope you give this guy some recognition and a raise!

Text: Stayed here for one and and everything was good. Front desk staff was very nice for check in and check out. Room was nice, although I feel like you can hear other people above fairly easy, I could've just had loud neighbors. Everything was very clean, breakfast was good with the standard options. Overall would stay here again.

Text: Comfortable beds as always. Nicest cleaning lady in the world. The shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor, not a huge deal for a one night stay. The hotel is great, you get all the typical Hampton stuff you'll find anywhere. The king room was very spacious with beautiful decor. No fridge or microwave.

Text: The hotel was very easy to find right in downtown Omaha. It was very close to the airport. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I liked that they had a shuttle that can take you anywhere within 3 miles. The room was clean and tidy. I had no issues whatsoever.
