Text: Very impressive. Nicer than a lot of the more popular chain hotels. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool is warm, the hot tub is hot, the bed was comfy and the breakfast was very good. I would stay there again.

Text: Nothing special. Front desk staff was nice and helpful, room was clean but too big with just a bed and tv, no microwave or fridge. Breakfast was alright but there wasn't much selection and it was a little cold. Checked to see if the room was clean when we got there and found a penis pump under the mattress.

Text: Excellent hosts, so hospitable! Great deal. Noise travels due to the wood flooring so that kinda sucked. Other than that no complaints! Breakfast was decent, just don't expect waffles. Would come back!

Text: We had a great night. The price was right, the room was clean and a free breakfast. What more could we ask? Our dog was welcome! Thanks, Brittany and staff for all your hospitality, well done.
