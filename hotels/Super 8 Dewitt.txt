Text: The room was clean and had a fresh smell. Plenty of channels on the TV. Internet was slow at night but much better in the morning. The staff were quite friendly and helpful. The coffee in the breakfast room was our only complaint as it was quite weak.

Text: Absolutely the most dishonest management   And obviously prejudiced against white people .  I have ever run into in the hotel business. I stayed for three nights and was charge for seven.   When confronted Peter the manager tried to explain to me this was normal procedure for the hotel business as if I was a dummy. 

When I have actually almost filled for passports and stayed in hundreds of hotels.  
The bed was horrible the room was very low-grade terrible breakfast very cheap place even though the price was outrageous.  

If you find yourself in Dewitt Iowa at the super eight run as fast as you can you'll end up getting ripped off.  This rated as minus a star

Text: We stayed at the motel after visiting Maquoketa Caves State Park with our dogs. We were disappointed this pet friendly motel didn't have direct access outside from the room, but otherwise we had a very pleasant stay. Room was very clean, well equipped and maintained, and service was excellent. Confusion with our reservation and the gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly. Conveniently located right off the highway, but limited local eateries.

Text: Great location but could be a little cheaper on price. Needs updating, but the staff are so friendly :-)
