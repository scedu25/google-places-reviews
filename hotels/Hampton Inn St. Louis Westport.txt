Hampton Inn St. Louis/Westport
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was very nice. Check in was easy. I had accidentally booked a smoking room and they were able to find us a nkonsmoking room. The front desk clerk was very friendly. The room was big and the bed was very comfortable. They offered a shuttle to the venue for our concert. The only complaint I had was the last shuttle was at 10:45 and most shows there don't end until 11. If they ran until 11:30, it would be perfect. Regardless, I would definitely stay here again.

Text: We enjoyed our stay here as a family. It was in a great location and near alot of places. The room was clean, comfortable, and what I always expect from a Hampton Inn. We stayed here twice on separate occasions. We would stay here again.

Text: The bed was comfortable, and I slept well. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, so I can't really speak to that. The breakfast was fine. No complaints.

Text: The location was easily accessible coming from the west, and easy to get back to from activities in the city. We got there quite late, but were still able to check in and the gentleman at the desk was polite and professional. It was difficult to find parking that late, most of the lot was full. The room was very clean. The shower was quite spacious, had decent water pressure, and I really liked that it wasn't a shower/tub combination. It was handy having a nightstand on both sides of the bed so my husband and I didn't have to reach over each other to put our phones away. A hot breakfast buffet was included and it had a good variety in what it had to offer. There was water as well as coffee and fresh fruit constantly available in the lobby. For the most part, our stay was enjoyable. The biggest con was that you had to pay an additional fee for faster internet, which didn't seem all that fair.

Text: A little hidden. Good price. About 10 minutes from the airport. Clean rooms. Breakfast was OK, but wasn't up to the Hampton standard.
