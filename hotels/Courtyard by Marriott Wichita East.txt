Text: Very nice and clean hotel! We were able to easily book over the phone as we were winding down a tiring 500 mile drive. My cousin requested a well air-conditioned room and we walked into a wonderfully cool room. The beds were comfortable and the staff were amazing. Seth delivered hairspray to our room and Judy at the bistro made the tastiest breakfast we've had in a long time. Highly recommend this location!

Text: Not bad. Got in late. Front desk was funny. That was entertaining. I appreciated his humor. Everything was great, but the room smelled weird. Not disgusting though. Just odd. So... four stars. Whichever couple parenting those kids running down the hallway at 10pm... one star. I don't like you at all.

Text: Check-in was good. Rooms are typical. Location is good for what I'm doing. Third floor smelled a bit musty. My room was too warm so they moved me. Keys are very flaky in some rooms. Stripe readers need replacement. It's pretty dead here on a Friday night.

Text: Hotel was very clean and in good repair. Indoor pool and exercise room were nice. What kept this from five stars: No refrigerator in my room. The smoke detector was not attached to the wall, it was hanging from the wall by it's wires. I turned the A/C as high as it would go and it never got the room cooled off, it did not seem to be blowing cold enough air to work effectively.

Text: We arrived and were promptly greeted and checked in without delay. We were offered something to eat and drink. The rooms were incredibly clean and the beds were comfortable. We truly enjoyed our stay.
