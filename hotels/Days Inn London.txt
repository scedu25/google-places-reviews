Text: My boyfriend is a semi truck driver. This hotel had great beds, easy parking, and was quick to get off and on the highway.

Text: Beyond horrible! Upon check in there was urine and a cigarette butt in the toilet (in our non smoking room). There was a used soap bar behind the bathroom door. There were 2 used ashtrays in the room and the table between the beds was covered in ashes. The main thing was when my 8 year old gave me a pack of rolling papers laying beside the television.  They refunded me $20.00. Really?!? Had we not had a baby traveling with us we would have slept in the truck!  I recommend ANYWHERE other than here.

Text: Found the overall experience ok. The guy at the front desk was pleasant. The room was clean and did not smell of smoke. The bathroom/sink area was clean. And a mexican restaurant across from it.

Cons: The Wifi was horrible, could not get a connection at all!  
The bed I slept in was lumpy and 2 flat pillows. 
We could not get a receipt until checkout. Went to the office to get one the next am and the printers were not on yet, so we had to get a handwritten receipt and it was for the wrong amount paid. 

This Days Inn was not as nice as any of the Days Inn's I've stayed at. But it served it's purpose as a decent place to stay for the night.

Text: The room smelled horrible and it was a non smoking room. Very dirty. The pillow on the second bed in our room still had make up still on the pillow.  No towel or wash clothes.
