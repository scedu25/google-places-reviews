Text: If you like dust dust mites dog hair mold and an unpleasant air conditioner that jingles and jams every 5 to 10 minutes this is the hotel for you if you prefer a hotel that you pay money for it to look nice and be nice. Then this is not rhr hotel for you if you bookthrew priceline you will not get your money back even when you sound like a smoking infant for staying in their room overnight these people are rude and are ridiculous and I strongly suggest that you heed the one star ratings on this page
