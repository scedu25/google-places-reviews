Altamont Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Dated rooms, but family ran. Great price and everything worked incredibly! Would recommend anyone to stay here! They even had a little kitchenette in our room with a stove and oven, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and hair dryer ? Staff is incredible and it was a VERY friendly little town!

Text: I was there to visit a friend whose home was damaged by a tree and the insurance company won't fix it, so she is having to live at the motel for now. But the Altamont Motel is easy to find! It is located at the corner of Cumberland Road and Main Street. It isn't something fancy but they do keep the rooms clean!
