Hampton Inn Collinsville
Rating: 4
Text: Easily accessible from the interstate. The hotel is currently under renovation but they do a good job of keeping it cleaned up. The rooms are nicely remodeled and have power outlets galore for all your devices. Complimentary breakfast is your typical hotel breakfast but there are many places near by to grab food if that isn't your thing. Staff is great as well. Been here multiple times and will continue to use them in the future.

Text: Clean rooms, very nice staff. Breakfast wasn't anything special but I didn't expect much. They had little to go bags with water and some snacks which was very nice! Would definitely stay here again. Convenient location to drive to St Louis

Text: Nothing special about this, typical Hampton Inn.  The rooms were clean, The bathroom had only a shower, no tub.  Several restaurants were nearby including fast food and casual dining.  Breakfast was included with the room, served buffet style in the lobby.
