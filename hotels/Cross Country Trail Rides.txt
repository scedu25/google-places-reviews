Cross Country Trail Rides
Rating: 5
Text: I went here every August for about 25 years. Eminence and CCTR is the best! Great place to go ride horses, meet a great bunch of people, see some amazing country and enjoy the river. Live bands every night of the week, 3 buffet meals a day, an indoor rodeo, etc. 

Please support the Smith family and Eminence after the big floods this year!
