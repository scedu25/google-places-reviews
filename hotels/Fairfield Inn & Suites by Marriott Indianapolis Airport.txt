Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Perfectly adequate airport hotel. Nothing fancy but the rooms are clean and the wifi is passably fast. Generic powered eggs for breakfast, but it's free and available early. Shuttle is reasonably prompt but some of the drivers are surly and lazy. (You'll be loading and unloading your own bags). Otherwise a solid 4/5.

Text: Sheets were dirty and I arrived at 2:00 am. They upgraded my room to a King suite however this room and a big screw laying on the floor right by the bed. A little run down for a Marriott however great price.
Hotel staff were super friendly.

Text: Lamp outlets for cell phone too loose for use.  Cell phones have to be plugged into laptop to charge.  Bathroom a little dated and toilet does not flush properly.  Hallways have a slightly musty smell.  Beds are clean and well kept albeit slightly on the firm side for my taste.

TV on the small side when compared to competitors in the same price range.
