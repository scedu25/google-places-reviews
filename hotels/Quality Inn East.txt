Text: I am very busy but I was so satisfied with my stay that I will take the time to share my review. My husband & I recently traveled to attend the Joyce Meyer conference which was held Oct. 13-15. We didn't feel the need to stay at an expensive "fancy named" hotel...we felt that we could save money & use the savings for other pleasures such as eating out etc so after careful research & reading other good reviews, I chose this hotel. We were not disappointed. It was very clean, quiet, had excellent staff and it was clear that comfort of their guests was their main concern. The mattresses & pillows were some of the most comfortable we'd ever slept on. The breakfast put the other "big names" hotels to shame. It was delicious with many options which  included waffles, eggs & sausage. We have now become Choice Hotels customers for life. We DEFINITELY recommend this hotel.

Text: Stayed at hotel 1 night. It's decent for a 1-2 night hotel stay. Wouldn't recommend if your wanting an extended stay with a nice hotel. It is however worth the price. Beds were comfortable. Hotel is connected to a Subway which is odd but that has no affect on me or my stay. Would recommend for a short stay and come back again if needed.

Text: Still at this hotel until Thursday. When we checked in the girl on the desk was very nice and helpful changed my room to a downstairs room and then when we got in the top. She called us to see if the room was ok. Only problem is when we came back to our room on Saturday night we could not get in the room. Went to front desk to see why was told that they had a computer glitch that morning and it checked a lot of guest out. Then he informed me that my card had been declined. When I checked with the card company they told me that the 1st charge to my card on Friday had been approved but the hotel tried to charge my card again on Saturday and that amount was declined. Now I"m asked to call my card company to have them clear the money to pay for my room
 But the hotel keeps saying they don't charge your card until you check out and I will be here until Thursday. Other then this problem it is a nice hotel nice room comfortable beds really nice hot shower a big plus there after Bing on our feet and doing a lot of walking during the dsy.

Text: Just stopped for a quick overnight while travelling, good place for that. Nice rooms, clean, spacious. There is small pool and a fitness room with a couple of machines. Good breakfast selection, waffles and a couple other hot options plus cereal and the rest.
