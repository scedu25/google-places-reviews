Text: The absolute worst place I have ever stayed! I was there for the passing of my father, the attendant at the front desk was rude! I was on the phone making notifications after the passing, house keeping came in turned on the vacuum WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE! Was told nothing could be done due to the workers not understanding English! Do not waste your money!

Text: Nothing fancy. Just a place to sleep uncomfortable. Not American owned. Support american buisness. I was told it was so I left next morning after I learned otherwise. Had giant holes in the walls and door wouldn't lock all the way. You won't catch me there again.
