Missouri Park Campground
Rating: 5
Text: I had a great time staying here.  I was looking for an affordable and safe tent camping campsite with a place to take a shower in the morning.  This place was nice and quiet with clean toilet facilities and the showers weren't bad, just a little old.  Totally usable and didn't have to scrounge up quarters to utilize them, either.  (They were free with a paid stay)  The other campers were respectful and I never once felt like my car would be broken into in the night like some campsites I've been to in the West.  Yes, the pool was closed, but they had a sign on the door of the office letting everyone know before checking in, so I don't know what that other reviewer was complaining about.  This place ain't the Bellagio hotel and resort, but it is a nice, quiet, clean and safe place to camp.  I would definitely recommend it.

Text: Great little RV park. We were a little anxious about staying after reading some reviews from a couple of years ago. We found the facilities to be clean and neat. Friendly helpful staff. We won't hesitate to stay again!
