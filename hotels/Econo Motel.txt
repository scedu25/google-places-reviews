My husband and I only needed reservation's for 1 night due to family issues, well I checked in and my husband was meeting me after work. The manager/owner told my husband that I wasn't aloud to have any visitors (I felt like I was entering prison) after my husband squared everything away my daughter brought us some food and a change of clothes around 7pm the manger came out and started being very hostile with my daughter and us as well.
So after he made my daughter leave my husband and I went to bed. Around 2am in the morning we were awaken by really loud music and door's being slammed, not only did the manger not do anything but he told me that he was going to call the police on me and my husband for having are door open. So we were made to leave after paying 50$ for a 1 night stay.
I strongly urge anyone to rethink the a reservation at the Econo Motel on 29th St Muncie IN

Text: I attempted to check on my elderly mother who was staying there despite my initial distrust of the area, and was lied to over the phone about her status AND in person even though her car was in sight, making me believe they'd done something to her. They refused to look at my ID for verification, refused to call her room and didn't even double-back on their lies to tell me her room number until I chose to get hostile and they realized I wouldn't be scared by the word "police."

Mine and my mother's compensation was free long distance, in return for not having any calls in actually transfer to her room.

These are the kinds of people that make others racist against Eastern immigrants. The only draw of the motel is the fact it's the only remaining one on that side; You can get more beds for cheaper elsewhere.

To the owners: When someone expects the worst, lying and acting ignorant only implicates yourselves. Your English is fine and everyone can tell.
