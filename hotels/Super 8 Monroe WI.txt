Text: No elevator or it would get a 5 star.  Hauling big suitcases up and down was a drag.  Doors were closed due to a fire alarm adding to the difficulty.  Staff was nice, but not at every door as they should have been to help.

Text: There are not that many choices in Monroe and this is the less expensive of the two. It's a typical Super 8 economical and vanilla. 

The pros: It's clean inside and they have a nice breakfast area with decent offerings. The rooms are clean and the place was quiet. The pool is great for kids and the location is great.

The cons: The staff is less than friendly and I mean even those fluent in English. We were greeted by a less than friendly curmudgeon at the front desk and that basically set the tone for all staff interactions. Also the giant ash trays at the doors are an eye sore and are there really fools who still smoke in this day and age. If you are going to smoke get away from the doors!

                               According To The Big Food Jerk.

This is a typical "You get what you pay for". For the price it's OK but that sums it up......It's OK.

Text: Fine budget hotel. Water pressure was nice in the shower. Rooms have fridges. Fixtures a bit dated but they have tried to add some modern updates. Did not have a chance to try pool or hot tub.
