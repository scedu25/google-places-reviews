Text: The staff is excellent. They are friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean.  The best part was the pool. The water was actually warm!!  There was no getting used to it or anything!

Text: One of the better hotels I've stayed in. Very clean suites and the air conditioning worked very well. Early breakfast for those who are up before the sun. Friendly staff. I'm completely satisfied staying here.

Text: I would not go back to this hotel unless it's the only one within budget. Check-in staff was friendly, told me all the details (breakfast time, gym & pool time, etc), and gave me a bottle of water. BUT I was given the wrong room key upon check-in and the room was already occupied - luckily the occupant was fully clothed and just sitting watching tv when I barged in! I was given a new key with some confusion over what I had booked (king bed vs two doubles), and got into my room fine. The rooms are nothing special, bathroom is outdated, and bathtub dripped water. AC worked fine and bed was comfortable. Breakfast was sub-par: the eggs were rubbery and they had the same thing both mornings (biscuits, turkey sausage, "over easy" eggs), and the "hot" water for tea and oatmeal was not hot :/. Gym is tinyyyy - luckily I was the only one in there since there's enough equipment but very little space, and no yoga mats or wipes for the machines and weights!
