La Quinta Inn & Suites Des Moines West Clive
Rating: 2
Text: Arrived late due to heavy traffic. Housekeeping pounded on door at 8:00 a.m.. Attempted to make coffee in room, but coffeemaker was filthy. Coffee grounds left in coffeemaker. Beds were comfortable. Wall behind chair needed repainting. Mirror in bathroom was streaked. Coffee in lobby was lukewarm.

Text: Would give it a 0 star if I could. Worst hotel I have been to in a long time. The staff didn't care about anything, the room we had was so dirty and smelled horrible. Trash was left all over. Bathroom was dirty. There was animal food all over the floor. They claim it was cleaned when we clearly could see it wasn't. Saw other guests come to the front claiming the room they were suppose to be in was still occupied by other guests. Breakfast food was the worst.

Text: Nice hotel. Here for work, so business paid for room. Only thing I would say negitivally is that it allows dogs, so barking at times is heard.

Text: Pool is a bit too cold, building is old. Only pet friendly hotel in Des Moines, so it is just fine. Price is okay, continental breakfast was alright. Nothing stellar, but it gets the job done.

Text: I'm not sure what our mattresses were made of but my first thought was a big whoopi cushion when they were sat on  ... and no support  ... sorry La Quinta you're going to have to do better than that. Floors felt grimy. Heh, there was a roof over our heads but can't wait to get out of here and do not intend to return ... others should be ware
