Residence Inn by Marriott Dayton Beavercreek

Text: Friendly staff from front desk to room service (kudos to the extreme cleanliness!) and especially the hard working people keeping the breakfast area clean and filled with a nice selection of food.  Although the hotel was full our room was quiet - must have splurged on the insulation :) Ample parking also as the Marriott Courtyard next door shared a lot.  Only recommendation would be to splurge on a 2nd waffle maker as the current one took longer than most and there was always a backup.

Text: Nice hotel. Rooms are a little dated, but the staff here provides outstanding service. The breakfast is great with a nice selection of food. Eggs, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, baked goods, fruit, and yogurt. The hotel also has nightly specials, such as grilled items and appetizers. 

A pool and exercise room provide a good place to work out. HBO and internet TV are also available.   Nice location across from a shopping center, although walking around the Fairfield Commons area can be frustrating due to lack of crosswalks. 

Very professional staff will ensure your stay is a great one.

Text: Loved the room. The bed was wonderful and it had a full kitchen. There was a pool n outside patio area that we didn't use but looked great. Breakfast was good and staff was friendly. Will definitely stay again if in area.
