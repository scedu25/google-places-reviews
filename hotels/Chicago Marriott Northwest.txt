Chicago Marriott Northwest
Rating: 5
Text: Clean establishment, modern twists on a lot of things, spacious rooms with refrigerators and plenty of closet space, and the shower heads were a nice surprise. Had shuttles to and from social event. Bar/restaurant is nice. Best part of all is the security on the elevators. You need room keys to go up and down.

Text: I like this Marriott Hotel because it is set away from the busy road and it is a very peaceful environment. The staff is incredibly nice and fast with their service so far. Definitely recommend this for your visits to the greater Chicagoland area.

Text: Awesome hotel. Seems very upscale especially for what it cost. The staff was very professional, i had an issue when i reserved the room and thought i would have to pay for a night I didn't stay. Mentioned it to the manager and it was taken care of immediately. I will definitely stay here again. Rooms were just right, very modern and clean. The hotel is in a great location.

Text: The staff at this Marriott are wonderful. Visit Lisa in the bar for wonderful service and a nice conversation. The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are updated. It is probably on the list of Marriotts to get updated, but it is well managed and is clean and not super out dated.

Text: Super friendly at the front desk, free shuttle around the hotel within 2 miles. Super skootchem bathrooms. Typical Marriott beds and the pillows that are way too soft. Take it from someone who basically lives in hotels all over the US and Canada with work
