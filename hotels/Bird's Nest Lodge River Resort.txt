Bird's Nest Lodge River Resort
Rating: 5
Text: I had a wonderful time at bird's nest lodge! I was able to just bring my stuff and go. Everything was set up for us - the cabin and hot tub, kitchen, and access to the river. The view from the cabin is impeccable - it is a wonderful location. All we had to do was sign up for a float time and the bus took is right up the river to start floating. Unfortunately, it started raining about 1/2 down the river. The staff was so organized, all we had to do was call them, tell them our location, and they picked us right up within 30 minutes. Even with rain, I had a wonderful time and felt right at home. I would recommend this destination to ANYONE who wants to have an outdoor experience With the freedom to camp, stay in a cabin, or bring their camper/RV! Stay wet, my friends.

Text: Such a perfect little getaway.  The staff did an amazing job at getting the cabin so clean and so relaxing . The AC was kicked up and the hot tub was warm. Check in was a breeze ... A car pulled up n told us to enjoy. :-) a perfect anniversary get away :-)

Text: Ridiculous, we showed up to check in and the room was dirty and disgusting and the door was broken. We got ahold of management and they offered us a refund and assured us that our deposit amount would be refunded in 2-3 business days. Yeah not so much, and now the phone number is disconnected and the website is disabled. 
And lots of businesses that we talked to in Steelville said they are horrible to deal with and good luck getting our money back. :-(
Jason won't return phone calls and I have a voicemail where he says he sent my refund and I never received our refund. Nothing like a business owner who lacks integrity or any kind of morals!!!!!!!!! GO TO THE HUZZAH instead. They made it right by helping us out!!!!!

Text: This company canceled on me the morning of my trip after I had already prepaid for my canoe. They blamed the rain the night before for the river being "too dangerous". I looked up water level online and it was fine and I called two other companies who also float the same section of river and they were both renting boats. I floated the river today with another company and it was perfectly fine and not dangerous. 

This company is lazy and seems like it was their plan to cancel and keep my money if there was any way to do it. They said they can't give me a refund but I can come back and float another day. How convenient given I live out of state.  Don't use this company - much better outfitters around here who are more honest and reputable!

Text: This place does not even deserve 1 star. We stayed in the Hawk cabin.  Don't believe what you read on their website - no working AC. The place was filthy and broken down. Unorganized as well - they misplaced our reservation and staff made promises to provide us with items and then never showed up. Our key didn't work to cabin so staff got in with a screwdriver. The only thing good was having a hot tub and it was at least clean. Staff member that gave us instructions on bus to go float was very rude. The whole experience was ridiculous. Some people should just not be in the hospitality business.
