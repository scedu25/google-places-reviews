Ramada Bolingbrook
Rating: 1
Text: Worst motel ever!  I have stayed in a low class hotel in China and this was much worse.  Filthy with cockroaches, unsanitary bathroom conditions including a clogged toilet and exposed wiring.  Not what I expected from a Ramada Inn.  Staff was very pleasant and tried to help but they could not rebuild the hotel in one night.  Very sad experience.

Text: Very smoky despite booking non - smoking room. Disabled shower was too low. Beds comfortable.

Text: Stale dated walls the floor coverings old and dirty.  The bed sham had some unknown stains, I suspect some type of bodily fluids. The lock to the room was broken, no furniture in the room, no couch no chairs no table or desk/work ststion. Ramada need to take a hard look at this location and fix it.

Text: Picked this location for the Chicago Open Air festival. Rooms were very affordable, althought the lock on our bathroom was broken and beds were only given what looked like a quick cleaning before our stay. This place is great for those looking to save money but not much else.

Text: Older hotel. Needs better cleaning behind beds. Broke TV stand which is annoying. Water damage to pool ceiling. No power outlets for phones or chargers. Alarm clock filthy. Musty smell carpet. Horrible parking lot condition. Two stars is over doing it, but that's Ramada and they sure live up to their reputation.
