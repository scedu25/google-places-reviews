Cruces Caboose Bed & Breakfast

Text: Had an excellent time. Damon was super friendly, and had bonfires lit for us in the evening and morning. This is such a fun destination if you're looking for something different. He can sleep up to 6 per car, and has 2 cars. If you're looking for super fancy, this isn't for you. If you're looking for an out of the box vacation in a beautiful setting... this is it. We're bringing back the whole family soon!
