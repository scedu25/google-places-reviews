Farmer's Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I spent 2 nights at the Farmers Guest House and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Susan and Don were friendly and inviting hosts and were helpful at recommending dinner locations and things to do in the beautiful Galena area. The historic building was comfortable, clean, and full of charm. The breakfasts were delicious and included mimosas with a variety of juice options. Each evening at 5:00, the guests were invited to WineTime to enjoy wine, cheese, and conversation with the hosts and other guests. To top it off, my husband and I added the couples massage to our stay, which was wonderful. I highly recommend this bed & breakfast!

Text: We stayed the night of our wedding and the following day. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have every laid in! I never wanted to leave. It was a perfect place to unwind after an amazing event. Amazing breakfast in the morning, walking distance from downtown, and the most accommodating hosts you could ask for! We can't wait to stay again!

Text: The decor was wonderful! The hostess and other staff were very personable. Breakfast was absolutely delicious! The baked items were particularly amazing! Mimosas in the morning and wine time at five were a treat! Shower heads a little weak. Overall, well recommended and we hope to be back again!
