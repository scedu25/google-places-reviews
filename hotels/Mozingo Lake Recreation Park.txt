Mozingo Lake Recreation Park

Text: Great flat and clean RV sites with very nice tables. Trees are young but will provide good shade in a few years. Lake is clean, including beach and dock areas. The bathrooms in RV area are exceptional, and there is even laundry facilities available. Free outdoor movie on Fridays!  Only negative was the vast number of children zipping around in golf carts. Several drivers looked to be just 8 or 9 years old, and their skidding on gravel as entertainment seemed dangerous to pets and people.

Text: Such an asset to our community. Just beautiful ! The walking path improvements and extensions are perfect for long or short walks, bike rides, and wildlife observation. Love it.
