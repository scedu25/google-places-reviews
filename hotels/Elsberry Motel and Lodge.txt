Elsberry Motel and Lodge
Rating: 4
Text: This is an older motel, so I wasn't really expecting much when I checked in.  However, the room was updated, and was immaculately clean.  The bed was comfortable, and there was a mini-fridge and microwave, as well as coffee in the room.  There is no telephone in the room, and my two cell phones (one Verizon and one AT&T) had no signals.  However, that won't deter me from staying there again.  I was pleasantly surprised!

Text: Older motel. I have straight talk and had full cell phone service. 104 dollars for two nights was a bit steep considering you could get a hotel in Troy for that price but since everything was booked for the fair we went ahead. The rooms were quite and modernly updated. Only drawbacks were the "local" crowd who I guess lives there and got stares and felt uncomfortable  from quite a few people while a lot of the other ones were quite nice including the owner. The shower knob in our room was broke but that's the only negative thing I can say it about it.
