Hyatt Place Fort Wayne
Rating: 5
Text: Exceptionally great hotel. Very effectiveness staff, able to check in guests quickly. Sufficient parking at any time and in a decent location for food options. The breakfast is above and beyond and the small bar area is very comfortable. Quiet rooms, and good housekeeping service. No complaints at all. First rate hotel.

Text: The hotel itself was fine.  However, when I was double charged for the pet fee, I had to deal with a very rude individual at the hotel who told me that the pending charge on my card was actually a credit, and then she hung up on me.  I ended up disputing the charge at my bank because no one at the hotel could explain to me why this alleged “credit” was showing up as a charge on my account.  Probably won’t stay here again as they can’t seem to get their billing straight, and then you get talked down to and hung up on when you call to tell them that they double billed you.

Text: My feelings were mixed.  The room felt really cramped. There was something about it that made it feel outdated. 
We were 4 in the room. That could have been part of the issue. 
The complimentary breakfast had a nice selection. The staff was accommodating and pleasant.  
Nothing fancy. Safe and comfortable.

Text: Very nice hotel. Great room. Friendly staff. However, more than half the TV stations were analog, so I was reduced to watching the MLB playoffs on a fuzzy analog TV screen. I would have expected more from a such a nice hotel.

Text: I have stayed here for about 3 weeks now for work and the staff has been super friendly! I was actually impressed with their breakfast and the variety. Looks like the hotel has been recently remodeled and is gorgeous. Nicely done! House keeping always went he extra mile for me. They didn't give me my points on my rewards account so I'm still trying to work that out but the rest was great!
