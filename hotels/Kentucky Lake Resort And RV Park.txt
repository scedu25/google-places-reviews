Text: Super clean and great location! The staff was incredibly polite and easy to work with over the phone and check in. The room had everything we needed for cooking; pots, pans, dishes, etc. Cleaning service took care of absolutely everything, including washing any dirty dishes, which was awesome! Really close to Kentucky Lake Marina and nearby trail! Thank you for everything! We'll definitely be back again :)

Text: Website is not a true portrait of this place.  Maybe at one time it looked like the pictures but very run down now.  Made reservations for the RV park and it was so bad we did not stay after paying for several nights.  The office person was very nice but the office smelled of heavy smoke and there was an open carry sign that permits open carry in the park.  Don't get me wrong we believe in having guns just not out where you will have families running around.  RV sites are not maintained and the RV's there are permanent.  Cannot recommend for the RV traveler.

Update: Called back and the gentleman that answered the phone had no clue as to what was going on. We paid for 4 nights and I wanted to get a refund because we didn't stay there once we saw the campground. SO we will see if they refund us or not. As of 7/25/17 nothing. Again we can't and won't recommend this for anyone.

Text: Nice, quiet RV park that fits my 65' rig. An older park that has a lot of new utilities. Ran two air conditioners, water heater, and microwave at the same time and voltage never dropped below 117 volts.
