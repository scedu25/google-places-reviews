Text: One Ratty community.  Bought mobile home through the park office, assured everything was tip top...enclosed porch leaked like a sieve.  Neighborhood bullies picking on small children, druggies, drunks and definitely lower echelon are the norm.

Text: This 94-site community located in Southwestern Michigan offers a countryside atmosphere and is within an hour's drive of Michigan's beautiful sunset coast. This community is surrounded by trees for privacy, a playground for children, and is centrally located to shopping, dining and more. An easy day trip to Lake Michigan or the Fern Wood Botanical Gardens makes this a great place to call home. Located close to the by-pass for easy access to South Bend, IN for more shopping and restaurants. St. Joseph, MI also in easy driving distance. Very close to the Redbud racetrack.

Text: There are a lot of drug addicts there, and management isn't very kind to visitors act like we are doing something wrong even had someone report me as doing a crime just sitting in my car waiting for a friend to come out to go to work... Just saying not eager to go back.
