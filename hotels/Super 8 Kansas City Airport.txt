Super 8 Kansas City Airport

Text: If I could leave ZERO STARS I would.  I  registered online and gave info including cellphone and email address.   TWELVE hrs later, after driving 15 hrs straight, we get to hotel only to be told they had a “glitch” and I have to go to the Barry Rd Super 8! ?  not happy.    When we get there, guess how they verified my reservation.....?..... with my cellphone.   What the hell!!!!   Could they NOT have called and told me to go to Barry Rd?!?!   I chose parknfly because it was close to airport and liked what I saw in pics.  Barry Rd is NOT like the other Super 8!   I was not the only person they did this to but he didn’t appear as agitated as I was and we had small children!  We had pulled out all our luggage, kids etc only to repack the car and drive 10 mins away!!

Text: Not at all a fancy hotel. The bathroom faucet had grime between the faucet and the wall. There was only one to well, and no hand towels. Not an expensive place to stay, so some of that is expected.

Text: Basic place, beds comfortable, hot water shower with pressure, AC worked but had a little bit of a funky odor - like pets have been around. All told, nothing too fancy nor unexpected. Staff was courteous, free shuttle ride and quick breakfast was a plus.

Text: Clean, cheap and has a great deal on park and fly rates up to 10 days.  The transportation to the airport is the front clerk, not a problem with early morning flights in and out, just have to leave a little earlier for your flight and expect a little delay to be picked up.

Text: Looks good, near to airport, free airport shuttles, car parking for $5/ day cheap than airport parking. Feels good leaving there for nights, spacious rooms, free wifi (not bad, good for browsing) and what else required.
