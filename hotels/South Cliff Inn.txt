South Cliff Inn

Text: This is such a lovely B&B! The owners were friendly and hospitable, the room was comfortable and the view was beautiful. And the breakfast was delicious! I definitely recommend this place. Also it's within walking distance of a small Beach and only a mile from downtown St. Joseph and the main beach. We will definitely be returning.

Text: My husband and I stayed at the wonderful South Cliff Inn last June and we can't wait to go back again this year. Lovely hosts, delicious food, friendly atmosphere, impeccably clean home...I honestly can't say enough good things about this little gem on Lake Michigan.
