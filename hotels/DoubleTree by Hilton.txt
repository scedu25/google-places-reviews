DoubleTree by Hilton
Rating: 4
Text: We had a wonderful stay. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the same floor as the pool, which was very convenient. If I had to be nit picky, the room needed to be touched up a little. The light in the shower was pulled out and the paint around it was pulled away. That didn't stop us from using the shower, but it seems like it could potentially become unsafe. Other than that, this is the second time that we have stayed here, and we enjoyed it.

Text: Had an excellent stay at the DoubleTree. The room and decor were very dated but it was very clean and well maintained. The bathroom was updated with a tub, walk in shower, and large countertop. Major points for a shower head mounted high enough that a guy over six feet tall doesn't have to bow his head to wash his hair. The morning breakfast place had a decent breakfast bar that I would say is a step above the usual hotel breakfast buffet. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back.

Text: Event room was spacious and welcoming. The chairs were wonderful, well-padded and allowed for rotation and extension. The food is the restaurant was very tasty and served by courteous service people with smiles. The location of the hotel was in a nice area and accessible. Parking was available and was appreciated.

Text: The place was wonderful. The rooms were clean and well kept. The staff was friendly and helpful. I missed out on the free breakfast because I didn't know that served it in the attached restaurant. I really liked that the windows opened, nice fresh air nine stories up.

Text: Location was great and the rooms were fine. Everything was fine... Which is fine. The most notable element in my experience was a very friendly staff.
