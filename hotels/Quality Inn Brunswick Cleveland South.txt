Text: The rooms are well equipped with appliances. The pillows and sheets are extremely nice. They have an excellent breakfast. The entire place is very clean and well maintained. Really just a great experience, will definitely be staying again. Only 30 min from Cleveland clinic. Excellent accommodations for a reasonable price.

Text: Pretty solid hotel for a road trip stop. The first room we were in smelled strongly of smoke, although they moved us to a new room without problem. 

The free breakfast in the morning was pretty standard, waffle cereal and juice. 

Check out Historic Medina if you have time, it is very with it.

Text: It was alright, but no frills at all. Water pressure in shower was a trickle at best. Odd smell in the hallway on the second floor. But it was quiet, clean, and close to expressway.

Text: Well I usually give pretty good reviews but this one I have to be honest and say... "first impression is everything". When we arrived for  a reserved checkin our room was available and they let us check in early.  Well as soon as you walk in the room you can smell the smoke... we were given a smoking room and neither of us smoke. They switched out room and someone was still cleaning the room when we went to the new room. (No biggie,  atleast we know they cleaned it) when we go to check out,  there's a pet fee x2 charge on the receipt.  We don't own pets. The attendant at front desk was so new she couldn't do a credit and we had to call back to speak with manager later in the day.
