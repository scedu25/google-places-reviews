Text: This is one of the best price hotels I have been in , in a long time . Staff was great!! Very pleased with the service. 
Our room was clean, everything worked in the room. The bed was the first comfortable beds I have slept in. I have a bad back an let me tell you I slept like a log. Keep up the good work folks? Enjoyed your breakfast an your hotel. Plus love the fact you don't check out till noon!!!
Thanks again an we will be back.

Text: Room was fine. Locks were kind of iffy. Toilet ran randomly. Wished breakfast had bagels. But overall a fine place for the price.
