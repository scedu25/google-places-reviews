Sudbury Court Motel & RV Park
Rating: 1
Text: Two years ago I rated this as a 5 star. It is now under new management and the difference is very apparent.

For starters, the price nearly doubled. My room had broken plumbing with no hot water. The microwaves and coffee pots are gone. As is the "American owned" sign that used to be prominently displayed.

This would be a very good $40 room, but for $75 I expected quite a bit more.

Text: Planned on staying one night March 31st . Extended for 2 more nights very quiet peaceful little campgrounds. Trains at night before bed, but didn't really bother us. Very nice owner. Great place to stop while driving through Iowa

Text: Rooms are clean, but small and very basic. Staff is friendly, and location is convenient but quiet. The price is the selling point.

Text: Pretty good for the price. But not spectacular.

Text: It is what it is, a RV park behind a motel. I tried to dump my tanks but the sewage pipe was backed up. The owner told me in 20 years he never had that problem. He would not even come outside to look,  maybe see what he could do to help. Instead he just gave me nasty attitude. This guy is an arrogant ass, you would do well to avoid this place.
