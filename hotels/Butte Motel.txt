Butte Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Very clean even though it is an older motel. Very nice, friendly manager at the desk. Reasonably priced. My only complaint is that the Wi-Fi was not great, when it worked it was great but it didn't work more than it worked.

Text: Very friendly staff. Old but very clean. Great prices if you are merely looking for a place to lay your head. Continental breakfast. Smoking and non smoking rooms available.
