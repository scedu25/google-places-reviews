Text: I ended up stopping in this town on the way to and from Kansas City because my grandmother is buried here. Stayed here both times. Rooms are cozy, dated but clean. Ice cold air conditioner, microwave, fridge, bed, cable TV, wifi... What more can you ask for? It has all the amenities. If you're not picky, snooty or high class, this is a great motel and especially for the price!! I came there to sleep, anything else was a Bonus!

Text: This motel is the worst expierience ever. The managers are crooked. There is alot of illegal activity going on here and all the doors on the upper levels do not have dead bolts! No locks whatsoever! You can use one key for multiple rooms. Definitely not a safe place!
