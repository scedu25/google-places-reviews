Holiday Inn Express Pella
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed overnight between races at Iowa Speedway. Decent rooms but definitely a little older than most HIE's I have stayed at. Located within a golf course neighborhood which was kind of odd but made it very quiet. Would stay again.

Text: If it was not so close to my business in Pella I would stay elsewhere. The internet drops constantly even when on a lan cable. The rooms always look and feel unclean. The toilets get clogged if you blow your nose and flush the toilet paper, no joke. House service will bring you the plumber to plunge it yourself. I would not reccomend this hotel even to the homeless. Shower did not even work the first time I stayed here. I have stayed here 6 times in the last year, please listen to this review and go elsewhere until they remodel this hotel. Also the door lock never works with your keycard, so that is fun to deal with every time you leave your room.

Text: Hotel was in a very quiet location, but close to food and stores. The pool was awesome and the room was very nice, with shower, tv, fridge, microwave, and coffee pot. Front desk was friendly and helpful, as well.
