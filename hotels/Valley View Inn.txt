Valley View Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Having stayed here many times, the staff is very friendly, rooms are very clean. Most if not all rooms have a refrigerator and microwave. Two suites are available, also. Most reasonably priced, and senior discounts available. Sweet gazebo just outside the South doors, and a freshly stocked trout pond within a short walk. To the east is one of Nebraska's 9 hole golf courses, some of the best scenery around. Pheasant and turkey hunting seasons as well as deer and elk are a short drive away! The Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture is located in Curtis, also. These all make this motel a big winner

Text: Nice, clean, comfy, pretty view off the gazebo, fast check-in, friendly service. Only issue we had was the continental breakfast was a little lacking other than that we were satisfied with our stay and would go back.

Text: Clean, quiet.  Can walk on trail nearby, great for birdwatching and exercise.  Good tea options.   Can't say much for the breakfast.  Bathroom tiny.  We would stay here again.

Text: Great place to stay. Family owned and operated. Good price, clean rooms and friendly staff. You can't go wrong staying here. The restaurant uptown (CCC) is a great place for food and a good beer. All the locals eat there.
