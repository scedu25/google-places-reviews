Text: Called ahead and asked if they had a lift into the hot tub as I'm recovering from an injury and wanted to speak in a hot tub but can't walk in. They said yes. There was one there but it didn't work. Plug wouldn't stay down so I could even soak in a hot bathtub. Constant water drip in the tub. Otherwise rooms were clean.

Text: Had an overall pretty great experience staying here. Only drawback was that when we were originally booking the room over the phone, whoever I was talking to had helped me book a two bedroom suite. This lead me to assume that there would be two separate bedrooms attached with common area, but instead it was just a pull out couch in one room and a set of french doors that separate it from a bedroom. I was spending 9 days in this room with my parents so the two bedrooms was kind of necessary, but it wasn't a huge deal. Also, upon explaining the long and difficult journey we had just taken from Phoenix, the woman at the front desk looked into what she could do to lower our rate. Breakfast options were very good, which was especially nice since we were there for so long. The A/C in our room worked really well, even though it was so incredibly hot and humid outside. The facilities were all very nice and clean, the only other complaint I have is the "gym", if you could even call it that. I wouldn't advertise a gym if all it consists of is a treadmill and stationary bike in a closet, but that's just me.

Text: Comfy and cozy - wish we could have stayed here longer. Easy check in, staff was great. Rooms were clean, and beds were to my liking! (Plush, my boyfriend loves firm beds) the pool area was the perfect place to come and relax - will come back again!
