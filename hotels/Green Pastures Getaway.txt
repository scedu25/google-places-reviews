Green Pastures Getaway
Rating: 5
Text: Hidden away in the little valley between the hills, this cabin is perfect for anyone who want to immerse into the atmosphere of relaxation surrounded by the people (s)he cares about. The cabin is right on the lakes edge and you can jump into the water or fish right off the back porch!  There is a sand beach to get out of water without getting all muddy and great and numerous sleeping accommodations that will easily fit 6 people. You can also relax in a hot tub right beside the lake with a grand view of the surrounding nature.
