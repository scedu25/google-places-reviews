Althoff Motel
Rating: 3
Text: Small mom & pop motel where the owners work the front desk and live on site. Super friendly. The furnishings have a '70's feel but it's nice and clean. Feels like country but you're 5 minutes from Broadway. 

*the microwave in my room sits on top of the mini fridge but cannot be used because the power cord doesn't reach any outlet. Bring your own extension or be willing to physically move the microwave.

Text: Great place for an inexpensive room for a night or a week. Nice family owned place that went above and beyond to accommodate my situation. The highest compliment I would give a business is would I use that business a second time? The answer is absolutely yes!!!!
