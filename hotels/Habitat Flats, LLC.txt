Text: Fantastic. There's no other way to describe the experience. My family has been wingshooting all over the world and the hunts they put you on never cease to amaze. If you ever make it out to Missouri, treat yourself to a cocktail and a cruise down to the refuge near dark. Nothing like seeing an aggravated beehive of 50,000-100,000 mallards lighting all around you. Tony and his family/friends are fantastic and friendly. Coming from the Texas coast we're used to experienced guides... yet their guides will meet or exceed expectations.
