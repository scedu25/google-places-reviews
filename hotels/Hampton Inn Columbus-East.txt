Hampton Inn Columbus-East
Rating: 2
Text: The staff was very friendly and nice but the hotel needs upgrading. It’s not near as nice as other Hampton’s I’ve stayed in. There’s no jacuzzi and the pool area is more like a motel 6 pool. The King Deluxe room was big but the bathroom was extremely small, like small closet size. The exercise room has one treadmill and is very, very small. The bed pillows in our room left me wanting to ask for extra pillows, they weren’t fluffy. Staff was nice though and it’s in a convient location.

Text: Very nice room with a king-size bed.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Be aware that the bathroom lights and fan are on one switch.  Very loud fan in room 139...  Very good food for free breakfast.

Text: Bathroom drain didn't work and they never even apologized for it. Large room but didn't feel super clean. Only a sheet and the comforter with no cover over the comforter.
