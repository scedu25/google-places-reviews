Text: We lived there from early 2013 to early 2014. The plumbing was horrible. It was so cold in one of the bedrooms I had to wear a heavy sweater, hat and gloves to be on the computer during the winter.  My yard was completely under water for all but appx 2 months during the hottest part of summer. One trailer caught on fire while the residents were out.  The fire killed 2 of their 3 dogs. We complained about buzzing wires in the wall of our trailer for 3 months. We were told for the first 2 months there was nothing wrong with the wireing there.  The 3rd month they finally pulled the wall out and found the end of a wire discharging electricity that they thought had been disconnected. And don't live there if you're handicaped.  They charged us $600.00 to build a ramp they should have supplied to begin with. There were roaches and bed bugs in the trailer, and we were told there were other trailers in the park that had them, too. I wouldn't want to live there again.

Text: Great place to live quiet neighborhood where people watch out for each other and kids can go out and play with no worries. The homes are well kept and the park stays nice and clean. Just like it says on their website "Country Living at it's Best !!!!!"
