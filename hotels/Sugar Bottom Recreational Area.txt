Text: Huge campground with all the amenities. Even has sewer dumps at the pads. There are playground areas and a boat dock for the lake. Be warned that the police frequently drive by and will walk around after 9 pm.

Text: Grass was tall that my kids didn't want to play in the yard. I asked on Thurs. If they would be mowing before the weekend and they said no and I was surprised. The wet grass was so tall in our camp area that you couldn't find stuff on ground & it rubbed above your ankles. Won't go back.

Text: This campground is always full and there is a reason for that.  The beach and boat access are a great amenity for campers.  The whole campground is available in Google Maps Street View which makes it very easy to pick a site to reserve.
