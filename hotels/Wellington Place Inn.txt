Wellington Place Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Somewhat noisy bar/grill place, lots of beer varieties, good service overall. My steak was a bit stringy plus had fat to trim off, but tasted OK. Loved the pretzel appetizer and enjoyed two different beers. Good ambiance for a couple or a group of friends. Fairly good value for the money, I would go back.
