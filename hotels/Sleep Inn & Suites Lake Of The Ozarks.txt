Text: We stayed here a week ago, and we were very pleased! The room and facilities were extremely clean including the outdoor pool which was better maintained than any hotel pool I've seen. The continental breakfast had many cold and hot options to chose from, and the staff members were incredibly helpful!

Text: Nicest hotel I have stayed in. It was very clean and the workers were very nice and helpful. Loved the balcony that you could go out on and eat your breakfast.

Text: I really enjoyed my time however the bathroom had tissue that was used by the last guest... I know because it was almost gone when we checked in... the toilet paper should be changed after each stay. I also noticed water stains on shower glass door. That's disgusting. Also the hot tub (inside the room) had like dirty bubbles in it that made me not want to get back in with my husband... I don't know how to clean the jets but I had to get bleach to clean it myself and it still wouldn't stop with the dirty bubbles. Other than that the room was great. Oh and my husband said the Wifi was in and out... mostly out. The location was a bit far from the main attractions of the lake, but I guess that's why the room is so affordable.

Text: Even though we ended up staying at a different Choice location the nice lady at the front desk was very helpful.  I had been having trouble with the choice hotel on line system and it appears that what I was doing wrong has been cleared up.  Thanks to her!
