Simon Kenton Inn

Text: We just got married at Simon Kenton Inn on Sunday, and I could not imagine a more perfect venue! We used their outdoor pergola and indoor reception hall. It is an absolutely beautiful place. Angie worked with me through the whole wedding planning process and took a LOT of stress off my shoulders! Simon Kenton Inn provides a venue, catering (which is DELICIOUS, by the way), bar services, and a place to stay all at once, and combining all these services really made a huge difference in the planning process. Their staff worked like a well-oiled machine to make our wedding day perfect and stress-free for us. I am so grateful and would absolutely recommend Simon Kenton Inn to anyone looking for a wedding venue, event banquets, or even just a place to stay.

Text: It was a nice place.  Room was a little dated and it was pretty pricy for what you get.  Not bad overall though.

Text: Historic inn. Good food, reasonably priced.  Friendly and helpful staff. We had a good all-day meeting with 7 people there that they supported very well. I also attended a wedding there with about 150 guests that they supported flawlessly.
