Text: Excellent extended stay hotel. I only stayed one night. If you don't want to pay for amenties you don't use, this should be perfect for you. Room is all new and spotless. Staff are friendly. Location is great for me with good restaurants close by. Rate was very affordable for a single night stay.

Text: Actually no stars....fled from this hotel on September 17, 2017 1:00am....BED BUGS ATE US ALIVE!!!!!! I thought it was the washing powder they used because im allergic to most but my roomate was itching too so we knew the deal after the fourth time of getting out of bed to scratch.  Two were in my bed one on her pillow. We didnt even bother to look for more bugs, we informed staff, she saw them for herself and we fled!

Text: Wi-Fi is ass. Beds are ass. Room service is ass. But most importantly the Wi-Fi is ASS. Even the "upgraded" plan. Don't stay here for a long period of time especially if you want to do ANY computer work. On top of all that, no pool?
