Red Roof Inn Dayton - Fairborn/Nutter Center
Rating: 1
Text: - Needed rags & towels
- For what we paid, there should of at least been some doughnuts or cereal. But NO breakfast, that's not cool.
- Customer service took a vacation, because there was none there.
- Maintenance man stayed next door, hammering, using a saw. This went on at night, and in the morning.
- I shared this with the front desk staff, who had attitudes. Like they didn't want to be at work, in the first place. 
- Not happy at all!

Text: First room had smoke detector chirping.  Free upgrade for my week stay.  Management and staff very friendly.   I enjoyed the newly remodeled room.  Elevator to third floor was nice.

Text: Had a great stay everything was clean it smelled nice definitely didn't smell like old men it stayed in the room the night before me like some hotels I've been to. The staff was very courteous although I couldn't understand the girl behind the counter. I wish the vending machine had Skittles I walked all the way from one side of the building to the other just to settle for a bag of M&Ms but that's pretty much my only complaint need more sweets in the vending machine some people don't want just chocolate maybe throw some Starburst in there definitely some Skittles but that's just my opinion

Text: The service desk personnel were very supportive. They assisted with appropriate directions and provided hot coffee all the time. The location was close to a lot of food, a mall, and just a few miles from a public park. The room we stayed in was musty and smelled of old cigarettes. I pulled the filter from the air conditioner and washed it off in the tub, and the water ran off black. Therea was a digital safe in the room but it was not working. There was Internet advertised but it was not working. There was a nice flat screen TV and plenty of channels for surfing. The TV, refrigerator, and microwave however are not secured to the wall for safety so it is not a kid friendly room.
