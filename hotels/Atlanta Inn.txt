Text: Stayed here several times during my visit to the tiny town and during interstate drives. Reception staff and the owners are very friendly. Always have a fridge and a microwave in room. Its really very quiet and peaceful, which is what you need to rest well. Good coffee and breakfast. Very reasonable and affordable price. Will visit again!

Text: Free internet? It never happened. I have to sleep during the day and window treatments to keep sunlight out would be nice.  Even the smoke detectors don't look operational. 
No bugs so far. Breakfast? Stale cereal and pastries.

Text: Motel badly in need of updating.  Breakfast was choice of Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops and some plain donuts.  Just a room.  Not a lot of dining options close by.

Text: Just stopped by on a whim. My baby needed to be fed and my 20 month old needed to be changed and i needed to sleep.

Personally, even in really "nice" hotels, i tend to throw the bedding on the floor. Too many "unknowns" and comforters only get washed once a month if at all.

So i wasnt expecting much from this place.
Wasnt surprised that the ice machine was broken. Just seemed like a broken down type place.

But the girl at the desk was really nice and the price is cheap.
I didnt really plan to stay over night, so i didnt need to be in a palace. 

For my needs, everything was satisfactory. Just fix that ice machine ;)
