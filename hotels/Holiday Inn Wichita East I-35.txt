Holiday Inn Wichita East I-35
Rating: 4
Text: Great hotel! Room was clean, bathrooms clean and stocked, bed was comfy.

There was quite a line when we checked in and it took about 20 minutes to get through. The only downside was the room cleaning. We stayed three days and had to ask twice for them to clean our room. We would leave for the day and come back around 3pm to a room that had not been cleaned.

Text: We had a double queen room and when we arrived the room was extremely clean. The receptionist was very polite and knowledgeable of the area. It was nice having him be able to recommend places to us I will happily stay at the holiday inn on future trips.

Text: This is the second time here and we love it. My husband is 6'4 and loves that the shower head is up above his head! We ordered room service last time and it was good. The staff has always been extremely nice. Definitely will be back when we go to witchita

Text: I have health issues that make me sensitive to odors (tiny  airborne particles). 2nd floor we were on smelled musty right away. The room we were in had a mild, sewer gas, smell the whole time. I wish the decent hotel chains would keep their rooms at least as nice as the effort they put into their lobbies. The room also had cobwebs all around the edge of the ceiling.

Text: I had a pleasant stay during my attendance at a conference.  I was disappointed not to have a bathtub in the room, but the shower was nice. Front desk staff was exemplary and helpful.
