Text: Management complains about every little thing consistently threatens eviction, kids are always in middle of the road and don't move, parents are nowhere to be found, stray cats everywhere having kittens under your home. water is under a boil advisory a lot and bill is ridiculously high, management will complain about something your doing wrong but will allow others to get away with it. Worst place I've ever lived can't wait to move.

Text: Nice place to live. No amenities here, though. It's pretty quiet and I've yet to hear of a crime in the area.

Text: Been here going on 5 years,  the kids just run the place and the parents don't care, they are loud after curfew.  The water is always going under a boil advisory without much notice and the bill is always sky high.  It is a nice and well kept park i will say that but management is pretty anal. But south Bloomfield PD drive through a lot to keep an eye on things,  i believe it's a safe place to live and the school districts are great.  Cant really beat it for what we pay for rent.
