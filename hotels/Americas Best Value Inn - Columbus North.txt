Text: Service was terrible. There is a deposit when paying cash. Rooms are over priced and filthy. The hotel has roaches and God knows what else. Walked in and right back out.

Text: Filthy, disgusting room.  Website says fridge & microwave in every room- they're not in every room, apparently you have to request it, which they tell you AFTER you've checked in & discovered there isn't a microwave or fridge.  We were switched to 3 different rooms & they were all filthy.  The turntable in 1 of the microwaves had food CAKED all over it.  There was a dead moth on the floor, the air conditioner only blew air out of a very tiny area, sheets had a hole in them, the bathroom counter had stuff stuck to it & there were crumbs on the counter in front of the microwave.  I was so disgusted by the filth of the plate that I forgot to take pictures.
