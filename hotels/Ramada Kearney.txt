Ramada Kearney

Text: The rooms were modern and clean. The beds were comfortable. The amazing pool has been either broken or freezing cold all five times I have been there. The hot tub was nice. The breakfast here is AMAZING. Ever option you could want: oatmeal, cereal, muffins, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, and made-to-order omelettes. If you need a good breakfast before leaving, this is the best spot in town!!!!

Text: Hotel is nice for the price. We had a king room and it was nice and clean. Hallways could use a little updating. The hotel is kind of confusing to walk around in at first with all the twists and turns. Breakfast was amazing, best omelet I've had in a long time! Loved the guy making omelets was super nice and very attentive to everyone.

Text: We stayed last minute at the Ramada Kearney on a road trip to Denver and it was clean, reasonably priced, spacious and most importantly comfortable...there are the usual fast food restaurants nearby and take outs for delivery (Pizza Hut) and the breakfast buffet was pretty good too. We didn't use the pool although it was pretty big and has a bar above it, I would stay here again and would recommend it highly.

Text: We booked our room months in advance for the solar eclipse. As soon as we arrived, the friendly staff greeted us with solar glasses, free breakfast coupons, and a newspaper outlining the eclipse. After getting settled on our room, we checked out the pool. The hot tub was broken but said the parts were ordered but not in yet. The hotel itself was really quiet and I never heard a door slam or anone talking. The breakfast the next morning was great. They had a chef making fresh made-to-order omelets. And even though it said it was $8, it would probably be worth it and it was well organized with signs telling you what each station was (waffle, toast, sweets, etc.) It was probably one of the best hotel experiences we have had. We will definitely be back!

Text: This was about the only place available in the area last minute, and I was a little nervous as everything else was full, but this one wasn't, but I was pleasantly pleased with my stay. There's definitely some maintenance, update type needs, but it wasn't anything that affected our stay. The room was clean, breakfast wad great, and it wad quiet enough.  Is stay here again.
