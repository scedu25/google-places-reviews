Text: Always amazing! We stay here every year for the Scottish festival and we are treating like gold. I seriously look forward to coming to Columbus Indiana just for this Hotel. Hotel Indigo and the Scottish festival goes hand and hand for my entire family! Love both of these events AND yes the Indigo is an event. I go around and use the public bathrooms in this hotel just to look at them. YES this hotel is that fascinating. I walk around outside just to sight see the hotel. My entire family walk around and sit in all the amazing, crazy furniture. LOVE this place!

This hotel is BRIGHT. How refreshing to walk in where you will see a brightly lit hotel with great colors and decor. The amenities are up there with some of the best hotels like Hyatt and Crown plaza international. i would suggest to stay here if your within a 20 mile radius from clients. Loved every minute of the stay. i will defiantly add this to favorites and look for this chain more often.

Text: It took a little bit of time to check in. We had to get another room because the room we were given wasn't ready but that was fine. One key didn't work so we asked about it. We were told it worked fine. It didn't work, that was why we complained. We asked for a new key again, and the front desk staff was kind of mad at us for complaining. Two front desk employees argued with me for a few minutes when I complained about the key. I wanted a new key, and they kept arguing about why it wasn't their fault. It doesn't matter who's fault is what, we needed a new key. Another employee finally stepped in, stopped the other two arguing with me, de-escalated the situation in a non-confrontational way, and calmly solved a simple problem. She also apologized for the inconvenience, while the other two seemed intent on refusing to acknowledge that it might be frustrating to be locked out of our room. The few times that I talked to the front desk, when I approached the desk someone was always looking at their phone. It feels like you have to wait in line at the desk. When the employees are done with their personal business on the phone, then you are permitted to do business unless someone else calls on the phone. Other employees are usually talking to the front desk, leaning against the desk casually talking. I always get in line behind them, because they look like guests, doing front desk stuff. I get in line behind them and get weird looks when they scatter and I think they are guests trying to get help. Location is great for walking. Columbus is a nice place to walk around. The pizza place with a Z in the name is a 15 minute walk away, there seemed to be a lot of other stuff much closer. Free parking, no valet, no bellman. The parking lot is big enough, we had no problems parking. There are train tracks near the hotel. The hotel was nice, typical Indigo style, everything is fun to look at. Board games and colorful chairs in the lobby. Water bowls for dogs and bottled water for everyone in the lobby. It was very clean I love the hard floors in the room because they look cleaner than carpet does. There was a breakfast buffet in the morning but it was 9.99 or 10.99. I didn't get to see it but it is available for a price. The indoor pool is real nice. There's a little sundeck outside and a hot tub inside.

Text: Very nice hotel, much nicer than I expected in fact. Very modern and well decorated, and the rooms were comfortable and a good size. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The only thing that I'd like to see improvement wise would be a mini fridge and a microwave. Truly enjoyed our stay there.

Text: The hotel is beautiful with lots of unique architecture. The rooms are also nice and modern. Staff seemed friendly. They had a hot breakfast buffet which was above average compared to other hotels. Overall, I would recommend. There is a local brewery that is within walking distance that is very enjoyable as well.
