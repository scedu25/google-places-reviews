Text: I fell in love with this beautiful peaceful place! Our site was perfect! From the shaded picnic area and tent pad to the perfect shore line for our kayaks to go in and out. Even the vaulted toilets were clean and easily accessible. Looking forward to many more trips!

Text: This was an absolutely beautiful campsite and pretty private considering there is only 14 sites the lake is incredible and has large fish in it I caught two largemouth bass and my wife caught the biggest bluegill hybrid I've ever seen. The owner bill was extremely accommodating and extremely helpful with everything from nearest gas stations to, firewood, and he even gave families eclipse glasses for the 2017 eclipse!! All-around fantastic and clean location would recommend it to anybody.

Text: Our family and friends have been going here for 40 years. Always an enjoyable experience. Quiet and peaceful. The last few years we have seen Eagles nesting and soaring over lake. Fishing is hit and miss, won't catch monster Bass, but plenty of bluegill and catfish to be caught for the kids. Campsites are clean with soft grass for the tents. If your looking for a big party camp, stay up late and blast your boom box all night, best place to go is Steelville and stay at Bass or Huzzah Valley.

Text: I've been tent camping here since 1961.  I've seen the ups and downs constantly and back up again recently.  It is without frills but great camping for tents, tho all sites are suitable for smaller RVs as there is black-top parking; maybe 3 sites are good for big rigs but I doubt you'd get down the gravel road & turns coming down the hill to the lake/camping area.  The lake is free of motor boats so you can swim all over.  The NF has not maintained the swim beach for more than 10 yrs so don't expect much.  There are no lifeguards or safety life-rings any more.  The 4 stall rustic wood pit toilets were removed a couple of years ago and replace with a 2 stall vault toilet concrete building ... that's a step backwards.  There are 2 water spigots BUT 1 hasn't worked for a couple of years.  There has been a wonderful Campground Host for over 10 yrs but last year it was understood there would be some changes.
