Red Roof Inn Sandusky - Milan
Rating: 3
Text: This hotel exemplifies 'average'. There is a pool, but not a hot tub. Free breakfast, but no meat. The toilets and showers do not have much power to them. The staff is kind enough though. Every is just fine. A pretty good budget choice for sure.

Text: Decent Red Roof, we have stayed here before and will stay here again when in the area. Good location right off the highway.  I have not personally used the pool but it always looks good!

Text: Everything is adaquate. There are no fancy things but it's a nice place. Has an indoor pool and fitness room and free breakfast (bagels, donuts, cereal, etc). There were some interesting people hanging around the parking lot showing off their motorcycles on Saturday night.  It is about 20 minutes away from Cedar Point and about 8 minutes South of a bunch of restaurants.  It is the definition of "no frills".

Text: Decent service. Decent food. Decent quality rooms. Overall decent. But at a good price. Usually. If you're looking for something cheap but no bugs or anything choose here.

Text: Pet friendly! Accommodated us with adjoining rooms. Staff is friendly, courteous, and professional. Decent sized indoor pool (clean) and sauna open until 11:00pm. Recently (or currently being) remodeled, so it appears that bathroom tile job could be repaired. Would stop again if traveling with pets.
