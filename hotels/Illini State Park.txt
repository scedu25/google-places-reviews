Illini State Park
Rating: 4
Text: Looks like classic Army Corps site. Sadly, Tired.  But with shrinking budgets, it must be an uphill struggle The state parks look they have done a solid job of maintaining the park. And as written before; the State provides nice recreation opportunities.  For the RV traveler; it's a gem. Land the night before Chicago or after getting through the city. Great location. Pleasant river view and welcoming hosts.
