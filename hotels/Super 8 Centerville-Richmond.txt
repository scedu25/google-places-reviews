Text: A very quaint and small place. Very clean rooms and bathrooms with friendly staff. Breakfast is served from 5am-9am and they provide free WiFi to all their guests. It's conveniently located right next to a convenience with restaurants located inside.

Text: Just do yourself a favor and pass this "Super 8" right on by, or better yet, just sleep in your car. You'll probably be more comfortable anyway. It was too late and the kids were done traveling, or we definitely wouldn't have stayed.

Text: Room just felt yuk. Dirty sheet on 1 bed. Needs updating so badly. Rate should have been in $30 range based on facility. It was a place to sleep for a late night arrival. And thank goodness I didn't need a blanket! Dosgusting!!!
