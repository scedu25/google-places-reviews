Red River Gorge Retreats

Text: The house is nice but there are some major disappointments. The hot tub is broken and the oven doesn't work (kinda why we stayed here instead of camping...). You can hear basically anyone in the upstairs unit. I can't say that I don't recommended staying here but really lower your expectations. It would take very little effort to make this place as advertised and get a 5 star rating.

Text: My good friend just had her wedding here and we all stayed at the pent house - it was amazing - the wiring in the house is a little wonky and fhe floor plan does not really make sense but it adds to the experience - I was not expecting to go off-roading to get to the cabin - but it was a pleasant surprise
