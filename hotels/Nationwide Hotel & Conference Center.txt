Nationwide Hotel & Conference Center

Text: Great breakfast. There was an omelette station and the cook did a great job. There were buffet stations as well including plenty of crispy bacon. I'm a big breakfast guy so I loved that. 

The room was nice overall and the bed was very comfortable. Once excellent feature was an input panel mounted on the front of the desk for hooking your PC or other device to the television. 

All the staff I encountered were friendly and professional. 

I would rate it 5 stars but I'm subtracting one for not being gun friendly. I'm no fan of any business going against our constitution.

Text: We stayed here for a long weekend. My god, I loved this hotel. So upscale in feel (but honestly not that expensive at ALL!), super clean, and so accommodating. The room was lovely with a deep blue on two walls, white linens, a super comfortable couch, shutters on the windows, a pocket door separating the shower and toilet from the sink. No dusty curtains, no ugly landscape paintings above the beds. And the atmosphere is gorgeous. It's an entire complex with conference centers, a restaurant, a pub... I don't even know what else is there. The breakfast buffet was exactly what you would want from the hotel breakfast, and the staff was so lovely. Honest to god, our *only* complaint was that there wasn't a hook by the shower. And what a silly, simple complaint right??? We'll be back, for sure.

Text: You will not be disappointed at this venue.  Spacious modern and beautifully Maintained buildings and grounds.  The food is great, and the staff is even more so.  I attended conferences so I haven't seen the rooms.  I can say that I look forward to doing future activities there.  I'd give it 4 stars!

Text: Great modern design for the event center. I'd say the best conference area in the Columbus area. Staff is always great and accommodating. Just recently updated the parting lot too.

Text: The hotel was very fancy with a spacious room. The wifi was solid. I was there for a conference and the halls were also spacious and relaxing. I did not have to ask for any special service, though the front desk staff was extremely helpful.
