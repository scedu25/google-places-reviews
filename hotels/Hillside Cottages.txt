Text: This place is perfect!! Home away from home!! I slept awesome and very affordable!!  And then things took a turn for the worst.. Stayed 6 paid for 7 and the insane owner lady came and beat on the door in the morning and just tried to walk in but we had screen door locked.. Thank God cause I was practically naked.. Screaming no locked doors this is my house and proceeded to rant and rave about nonsense.. To make a long story short paid for 7 days stayed for 6 she said we didn't and kicked us out it was a awsome place to stay until that happened.. For whatever reason she had for that is beyond me.. Because we couldn't even get a word in... 

So if you plan to stay make sure you check your reciept and keep it or you might just have a lunatic beating on your door in the am 

P. S. Lock all doors

Text: 4.5/5 - Fine accommodations, definitely not a cheap motel as far as quality of the rooms go. Only disappointments were the noisy (and hot) AC, and weak wifi service but I just stayed the night so it wasn't a deal breaker.

Text: Great affordable hotel for overnight stay. Not many frills but just enough to make a quick overnight stay comfortable. The location was perfect as I was able to bypass rush hour traffic on the 80!

Text: I have stayed here for a week and it has not been a pleasant stay. 8 day and my room was never cleaned. I had to ask for towels. The room was not clean and it was poorly constructed. Not at all worth the money spent. These people need to learn how to run a hotel.
