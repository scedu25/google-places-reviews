The Fontaine
Rating: 3
Text: Stayed a Saturday night with a late check in.  Entry into into the underground parking was difficult to find at first due to the surrounding one way boulevards.  Front desk staff was friendly and accommodating.  Our room was on the first floor very near the lobby which was disappointing.  We were hoping for a much better view, but our windows were situated right next to one of the parking entryways and an adjacent apartment complex.   Room was quite stark and not very well decorated.  Bathroom and shower were spacious.  Bed and sofa were adequately comfortable.

Text: Front desk was very nice, the two men that helped us seemed to absolutely love their jobs. The view from the top floor restaurant is very nice. I like how you must have a card key to access the middle levels, it's the small things ya know? Overall the hotel is quite gorgeous. The workers all really seem to love their jobs and would do anything to help you while you stay there.

Text: The restaurant and bar are just okay. For such an upscale place you'd think there would be a swanky cocktail list and a complex menu, but it's honestly just average. The restaurant was also okay, but not great. The service was great however. 

I'd go again and may have a better experience with adjusted expectations. It is a quieter atmosphere and I do appreciate that aspect of this place.

Text: Stayed in a double room- which really should have featured two queen beds instead of full sized. The room was clean but the water glasses were not! The rooftop restaurant/ bar seemed more like a lounge, & featured a great view of the plaza& pool. The pizza however was about 12"x4", cost $11 and was terrible!
Overall not a bad experience, staff were all friendly& helpful, the location is great, writhing walking distance to plenty of shopping & dining.

Text: Very sleek, comfortable hotel and almost universally great staff. Only issue was rooftop bar. A great space, great atmosphere. But the bartender was unbelievably rude and impersonal. Put a damper on whole experience at the bar. Definitely stay at the hotel, but skip the bar.
