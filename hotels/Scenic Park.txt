Scenic Park

Text: Great campground with great staff. We were really impressed with the quality of the staff here. They go out of their way to make your stay fun and enjoyable. They clean the bathrooms every day, but they can get a little gross if the campground is packed. Enjoyed having a YMCA and a park close by.

Text: What a great place to spend the night or a week. Right on the river. Quiet, nicely spaced level sites, friendly staff. No store or any shopping or dining in walking distance but the park and a walk along the river is better. Would stay again.
