Comfort Inn Grain Valley - Kansas City
Rating: 5
Text: We booked this room a bit unsure after reading a few of the reviews. I must say we were pleasantly surprised!  This was a VERY clean, nice hotel.  The room was nice size beds and pillows comfortable.  Micro, fridge.  All clean.  The breakfast was good, both hot and cold food choices, on par with the so called premier chains.  And thanks to Regina, the food areas were spotless.. Really!  How many times can you say that?  She made sure all food items were well stocked.  We were very pleased with this hotel and would highly recommend it. Oh. And the price makes this an outstanding deal!

Text: The beds are comfy and the rooms are clean. There is a nice breakfast with biscuits and gravy, eggs, waffles and sausage. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because even though we have a non-smoking room, the whole floor smelled like cigarettes. That's a huge negative. Otherwise, nice rooms and nice updated hotel.

Text: Decently upgraded recently. Seems clean throughout the building. Staff is couteous and accomodating with any special requests. The only reason they got a 3 was the pool was closed AGAIN. I have been there multiple times and it is has been being painted one time, being cleaned another time and it was just plain after hours the 3rd tine...One nice bonus is their decent fast food quality warm breakfast. Not outting them down at all I actually like the food and it was PLENTIFUL AND F-R-E-E NINETY-NINE! LOL
