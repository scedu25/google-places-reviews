Days Inn Bowling Green
Rating: 4
Text: It was a last-minute decision to stay in Bowling Green and boy did we luck out with this Days Inn. No carpeting which in my book is fine. It was clean. The beds were comfortable. I like the fact that they had a sheet then a blanket then a sheet so no one else's comforter was touching me at any point. They offered a very limited selection for breakfast, but it was free. Coffee was good and hot.  The gal in  the morning was cheerful and helpful and very nice I can't say as much about the guy when we checked in. I liked parking right in front if door. Also smoking and non smoking rooms.

Text: Julia at the front desk was awesome!!! Room was spacious and clean. Great setup with the mini kitchen too. They could upgrade the breakfast  a little with muffins or donuts. Very nice motel for the money.

Text: The motel is bad and nasty, all rooms are smell smoke, they dont have non smoking rooms, the price is too much 70$ and not even worth 40$, the manager is from Bangladish and have no idea how to treat the guests. Very BAD experience.

Text: I can't even give a star and mean it but I have to give at least one I guess ,I'm highly disappointed in the lack of respect that was shown to a customer who was dealing with what appeared to be hardships and the manager treating  her like a second class citizen ... I will be calling corporate about this matter I wish I could have helped her and her family if  he treated her this way how many others did he do this to?... I over heard her tell him that it was all worked out  and that julie switched profiles, due to name changes or something ,  I think that it was pretty horrible that because his idiot office staff screwed up she and her family had to pay for it I hope she found a safe place ... Never again will I stay there .. by the way the rooms are gross and outdated and the cleaning staff ...well they leave alot to be desired that's for sure ...... Not a good place and to expensive for what I received ..
