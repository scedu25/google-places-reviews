MOTEL 70
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed here recently for a work trip and was a great experience.  It's a locally owned hotel and they make sure your stay is pleasant.  Rooms were clean, beds are comfortable and access to the hotel was easy.  Had great conversations with the owners.  I ended up having to stay an extra night after I had already checked out and they made sure that I was taken care of.  Even moved things around to give me the same room I had previously.  Overall a great experience.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.  Thank you Tracy for making me feel so welcome.

Text: Staff is extremely friendly. Approximately 10 minutes after booking my stay, Tracey called me to warn me of a major exit being closed and if by chance I got off that exit she was going to instruct me on how to find the hotel. Once checking in she immediately asked if I needed any extra items for my room. Very welcoming and accommodating. An absolute pleasant gem i stumbled upon while traveling on a late night.

Text: Fresh clean smell in room. There was a paper strip on the toilet showing it had been completely sanitized. The room was much bigger than I thought and very comfortable. The A.C. actually cooled the room. Clean carpets in room and I never saw any stain or any unclean area. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling up or down I70. This family owned motel saw everything wrong with every other hotel and made every effort to perfect theirs.

Text: Found this place between good-sized cities.  Not brand new, but WELL kept and VERY clean.  I paid 3-times as much for a comparable place in some other hotels coming across the country.  I also made the mistake of staying in some other hotels with the same low prices -- they were dives.  My wife told me that I needed to review this place, and to say something nice about it.  I really liked the place and would sincerely recommend it to another who might be looking for a place to overnight, with not a lot of frills, but has a nice bed, clean sheets and towels; and kind desk-lady.  Bathroom, and the rest of the room was nice and clean enough (probably appeared as clean as we would have cleaned up our own house before the in-laws came over -- you know, really nice so they didn't think we were the normal slobs that they likely think we are ) that you wouldn't mind walking around in your bare feet.  ...it wasn't all worn out and rotten smellin' like some of the nasty spots that I have stayed in, to try and save a buck, when my wife didn't come with me.  Anyway, we were very pleasantly surprised.  We found the place looking over reviews on TripAdvisor.

Text:  Normally don't stay at motels that are not chains but looked very nice from the reviews. Glad I gave them a try. Exceptionally clean rooms and comfortable. Had unexpected microwave, small fridge, tea & coffee in the room.  I travelled alone and felt very safe. Lots of lighting in the parking lot and liked I pulled right up to my door. Will definitely stay again.
