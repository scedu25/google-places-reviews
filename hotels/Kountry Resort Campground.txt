Text: We found this place last minute and was pleasantly surprised. It has the feel of a lodge. Everyone is nice and the place really is beautiful. The prices seem reasonable and the pool was awesome. There is all kinds of living arrangements from fulltime rv's, tiny cabins, big cabins, and tent camping. ( although the outlets were only 30amp so we had to buy a 110 adapter)  The place can definitely use some maintenance and updating here and there but didn't bother us. The showers were hot and we found it very charming. Would definitely stay again.

Text: For what you get it is way to expensive,  No discounts. No paved streets or paved sites. Come in at 7 and leave at 7. May be 25 dollars but not $39.  ..$20 to dump also is priced to much $10. Maybe.  Iowa all hook ups on lake for 6 days also on golf coarse  out window and we payed $20.
