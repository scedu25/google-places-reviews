Text: Reasonably priced and reasonably clean. Free breakfast. The whole first floor smelled like curry and I was asked if I was leaving over and over again by housekeeping while I was getting ready to check out.

Text: Place is in horrible disrepair and dirty. I talked to the staff and they didn't seem to care. Not very friendly. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the small continental breakfast was not terrible.

Text: We told them how many people and dogs and they charge us one price and then because of vacaticy on rooms the manager wasn't nice and was rude about it. And raised it up like 40 more dollars then normal. And not fixing the Microwave.

Text: Very run down hotel. Our door was slanted and you could see into the hall way, the toilet stunk, the carpet had burn marks and was bleached, the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I've slept on. The clock didn't even work. The breakfast was mediocre. I did not even feel comfortable showering in that bathroom.
