Text: Still running quietly in sleepy small town Peru, Indiana.  I stayed for a couple nights this summer and the inn is beautiful as ever.  How often can you stay in such a magnificent mansion for so cheap? I recommend to anyone who appreciates the grand architecture, peaceful park-like setting, and quiet small town.
