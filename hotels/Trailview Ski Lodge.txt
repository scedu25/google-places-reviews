Text: WHAT A DUMP.   Don't waste your money.  Read all the negative reviews on Trip Advisor because they are spot on. 

Words can't describe how nasty this hotel was.   It hasn't been updated since the 1970's, had mold on a few spots and dirt in about every corner of every room.  The facet handle came off on the bathroom sink and the hot water wouldn't even turn on. 

No cable TV or satellite and they are so far out in the middle of anyone you can't get any Antenna channels either. 

Turns out when I got home and got my credit card statement, they overcharged me by $65 bucks (AFTER I signed the receipt)  and when I called them they refused to refund it.  

I had to send in a copy of the receipt with the amount to my credit card company to get it refunded. 

This is without a doubt the nastiest, dirtiest, biggest rip off of a hotel I've ever stayed at.
