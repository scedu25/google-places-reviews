AmericInn Lodge & Suites Monmouth
Rating: 5
Text: We really enjoy staying at this AmericInn.  The staff and management are always friendly and helpful.  The facility is always in excellent condition.  The breakfast selections are always fully loaded.  The exercise equipment and pools are well maintained.  The rooms are very comfortable.  The lobby is so comfortable and often has a treat waiting for you.  Love the towels in the room soft and plush.  Only negative is we had a mix up with housekeeping on getting our room cleaned.  My wife asked for more towels and they thought we didn't need them to clean the room.  But they were very quick to correct when we let them know.

Text: Very well kept hotel. Breakfast could have been a little better but it was your typical complimentary. Very inviting.
