Loganberry Inn

Text: This was the best B&B experience I have ever had. The room (and the whole house) were beautiful, the bed was comfortable, and there are no words to do justice to breakfast or the hospitality. Loganberry is absolutely the place you must stay if you are ever in Fulton. Thank you for the perfect anniversary weekend.

Text: I admit to being a little biased as this is the best B and B I've ever known. Top notch location, awesome amenities, and a wonderful place to relax and take a stroll through the years of history in Fulton. If you like good food, good conversation (or peace and quiet) this is the place to go. You won't be disappointed.
