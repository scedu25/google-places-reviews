Text: Great staff, very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, comfy and nicely decorated, I personally would like a little softer bed for myself because of my back. The breakfast buffet is very nicely done, lots of items to pick from and trays are kept full. Great selection of beverages for breakfast also, everything from juices, coffee, tea and milk. Close to restaurants, stores and highways. Would recommend this hotel to friends.

Text: We had a wonderful stay in a jacuzzi suite.  Everything was very clean.  The jacuzzi was large and enjoyable.  It wasn't a cheap room but it was worth every penny.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was good.  We would definitely stay again when we're back in the area visiting family!
