Text: What a great get away.  Clean, comfortable rooms.  Newly remodeled water park, ball city and climbing facility make it fun for kids.  Though there is adult fun with bars, restaurants and casino.  Also bowling alley and Go carts.  We had a great time.  The Boogaloo has good food and great drink specials too.  All the staff, friendly and helpful too.

Text: For the most part we enjoyed our stay. Customer service was great upon arrival & thru our stay 4 nights. The Spa was clean & friendly.  I only have 2 complaints. . The room was clean but previous damage, walls & furniture were apparent.  The ice box was set on a very low temp & gauge was in the back.

Text: This place is fun. Wish there were more adult life things to do. Seems like lots of wasted space and potential. Great for family. Food is good at Restaurant.
