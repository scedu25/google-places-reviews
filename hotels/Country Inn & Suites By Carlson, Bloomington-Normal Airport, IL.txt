Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Bloomington-Normal Airport, IL

Text: It was ok but nothing to write home about. The good: super friendly staff and the entire facility was clean. Check in/out was a breeze and the room was good and quiet. The bad: They seem to be behind on maintenance. Water pressure was really low, the shower curtain rod was barely hanging on, and the mattress felt like it was either old or had been used as a trampoline. All told, its a decent place to lay your head overnight, but I will probably look elsewhere in the future.

Text: Excellent experience - Staff is very helpful and quick to respond. Josh at the front desk was very professional and friendly during our stay. The complimentary breakfast provided several more options than expected. Coffee is available all day, which is appreciated when returning late.

Text: The hotel is nothing fancy, but serves it's purpose. The beds were clean and comfortable. The location is a short drive to several restaurants and shopping. The rates were reasonable.

Text: It was decent. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was mostly clean except some dust and dirt in the carpet. The pillows are way too small. Would probably stay again since it was cheaper.
