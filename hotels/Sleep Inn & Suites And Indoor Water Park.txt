Sleep Inn & Suites And Indoor Water Park
Rating: 4
Text: Room was nice, suprised to see both microwave and fridge in room. Everything seemed clean. We were wanting to take advantage of the pool and hot tub except they were constantly swarming with children the entire time the pool was open. Not surprised as didn't realize it was labeled as a water park prior to booking. That area did look nice. Breakfast they offered was decent like, they had a little bit available for everyone. Location was in decent area for us because we were going to worlds of fun and shopping which was not to far from either. I did have some issues with vending machine, but I don't think that is the hotels fault. All in all I would stay again, if I was in that area again

Text: Enjoyed our stay very much! My husband and I took our 4 yo and 1 yo boys to Kansas City for a family vacation. We stayed here and were about 20 min from everything and the boys loved the waterpark in our down time! The room was spacious and nice. The lobby and breakfast area were super nice as well. The deluxe hot breakfast was a nice spread that tasted delicious. We all ate very well our entire stay! The staff was friendly and helpful.  The view is also pretty and the keep it landscaped pretty. Overall we are very pleased with everything!

Text: Quiet rooms with comfortable beds. Kids loved the water park! I'm glad I didn't splurge on a fancier water park because my 6 yr old was afraid to try the water slide, but my 9 yr old loved it. Nice hot breakfast included.

Text: Easy check-in and super friendly staff. The rooms were clean and comfortable with great amenities like fridge and microwave. The water park was a surprising but fun extra. Sad we arrived too late to get on the big waterslide. Would recommend to anyone on the area.
