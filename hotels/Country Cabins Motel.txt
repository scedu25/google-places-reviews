Country Cabins Motel
Rating: 5
Text: We had a 6 family reunion at Country Cabins and it was one GREAT weekend!  The cabins are gorgeous, all brand new with a nice floor-plan and cute themes.  The beds are top notch with new, high-end mattresses!  GREAT night's sleep!  The common area is great, we had a nice bonfire both nights we were there and the stars are gorgeous.  There's a public lake across the street, great for fishing and swimming!  We will definitely be back!

Text: This place is awesome.  Very clean, super friendly staff. Only two drawbacks-no shampoo and smaller toilet seat. Other than that it is great. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.

Text: Nice little area on some lakes with decent pricing.  Not sure we will have a reason to go back to that area but if we did we would stay again.  P.S. management if your reading this and you found a chromecast connected to your tv that was ours haha.

 Cabins are very nice and mostly affordable. Beds very comfortable and the cabins are very clean. Some have full kitchens
 Others have full refrigerator and a microwave. Great getaway. Service is great and everyone is really friendly and outgoing.
