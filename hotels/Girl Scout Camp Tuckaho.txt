Girl Scout Camp Tuckaho

Text: My daughter always has a wonderful time at Girl Scout Camp. Girl scouts has been part of scouts for 8 years, and sure there is drama with girls sometimes. It has absolutely nothing to do with the camp they are at. Drama is as drama does. A camp is a PLACE, it does not cause drama. That first post is a review of human behavior not a camp. I flagged it as inappropriate, because it isn't related to a camp, which once again, is a PLACE. It's beautiful here. Thank you to all the volunteers.
