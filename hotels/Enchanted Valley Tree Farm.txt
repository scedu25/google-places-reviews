Text: There wasn't anything "enchanting" about this farm. We called ahead to make sure it was okay to visit without buying a tree hoping to have a fun, christmas tree farm experience and get some family pictures. We were told on the phone that it was just great to visit and a scenic spot for photos. When we arrived we found out that there wasn't any access to the actual Christmas Trees  and told they would be closing in about 15 minutes, so we wandered up a path to take some quick photos. Five minutes later we heard someone hollering for what we assumed was a dog but was apparently the "farmers wife" shouting for us to leave because they were closing. We were then asked rather rudely if we were going to be buying a wreath and if our photos were "for financial gain".  Unattractive scenery, rude employee/owner (the man was polite enough, the woman not at all), the trees they had out looked nice enough but not worth the overall bad experience.
