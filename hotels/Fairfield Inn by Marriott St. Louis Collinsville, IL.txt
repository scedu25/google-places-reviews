Text: Great place to stay. Friendly staff and nicely appointed rooms. Very nicely decorated and always a pleasant stay. Pro tip: Never leave anything of value in your car. Thief a plenty roaming around the area in Collinsville. This applies to all hotels along I-157. Even with a STATE Police HQ just down the street.
