Text: In the back yard of Goose Pond, one of the world's best bird migratory stopovers, Pleasant Grove has access to some of Indiana's most pristine wilderness areas. Aside from wildlife watching, you might hunt morels, search for Indian artifacts, fish, hunt or just enjoy a breath of fresh country air. Close by are limestone hills (check out the architecture of most of the county statehouses and the buildings at Indiana University's main Bloomington campus), an impressive train viaduct, the resorts of French Lick, and even Kentucky horse country is easily accessible for a day trip where one can also take in the famous Bourbon Trail-- I have done all of the above. And the people of southern Indiana are very friendly and willing to help. I had eight people stop to ask if they could help me when I got a flat tire in nearby Terre Haute. And the setting and comfort at the Cabin, or the Lake House, could not be more comfortable, nor the hosts more accommodating. I have stayed at both multiple times and have always had a first-rate experience.
