Motel 6 Indianapolis South
Rating: 1
Text: Worst stay ever. Flea infested room! Possibly bed bugs as well. Bites all over entire family. Nothing in room but bed and cheap TV. Smelled horrible. Drywall mud falling off the walls. No shampoo. Only 1 small bar of hand soap. Towels were stiff enough to sand a cars paint off. Desk people are rude and corporate was same. Room was rented at noon and by one o'clock was refused a refund. My family was extremely inconvenienced by staying here! Save your time and money and go elsewhere.  Unless your on drugs. They accommodate junkies very well. If you smoke a cigarette in the parking lot you will be approached several times in regards of that business.

Text: Upon arrival got room 115 went in and water was on the floor coming from the AC unit. Got 3 towels from desk and moped it up and left towel to soak up water during my stay. Reported to desk that the toilet flushed by its self all night long. Once pressure built in the water line the toilet would flush. Reported to desk that 3 outside lights one on the right and two on the left of room 115 were not working room 115 is a corner room and  on the corner it was darker than adjacent rooms and area leading up the stairs to next floor was also affected due to lights out (you did not leave the light on for me).

Text: It was nice and the staff was sweet. We had to change rooms because there was a bug but the room we were moved in was fine, so all was well.
