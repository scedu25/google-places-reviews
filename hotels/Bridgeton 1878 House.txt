Text: We rented this space for our wedding and the fact that we had access to it for four days was an amazing option that took a lot of the stress out of the equation. The fact that they have air/heat too was exceptional. The place is very spacious and decorated very cute. We loved it, and will cherish the memories we had here for our special night.
