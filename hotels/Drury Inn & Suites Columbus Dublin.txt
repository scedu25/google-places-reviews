Text: Everything was amazing. As an informed traveler, I always try to read other people's reviews and check out the amenities that each hotel offers. What made me choose to book with Drury Inn was the high eating that they got and the amenities was already above the other hotels in the area. Even the few negative reviews were, in my opinion, just minor things that were case specific and not indicative of the hotel or it's staff.
At check in, the front desk attendant explained everything that the hotel had to offer and was easily able to look up our reservation. All of the staff was very friendly and the general manager even gave me a candy bar for free when my hubby required chocolate after his surgery (which is why we were in the area) and I had no cash for the vending machines. They made you feel welcome and even noticed our loot crate shirts we had on. The Tootsie rolls on the bed at check in was a very nice touch. I will make sure to try to book with Drury Inn anywhere I go from now on. That's how much of an impression they've made on me during this trip up to Dublin.

Text: I had booked  a block of rooms back in January for a baseball tournament in June.  The person who helped me with the reservation (Elaine) was very helpful and helped provide updates periodically regarding the group of reservations.  When you are making arrangements for a large group of people, it is always a bit concerning.  You hope things will be nice, but you never know.  I have to say I am extremely pleased with our stay at this Drury Inn and Suites!  The hotel was very nice and clean...but the staff was the best!  Will greeted us at check in and continued to check in with us throughout our visit!  Every staff member that I encountered was friendly and engaging and very helpful!  The food options were great!  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for options in the Columbus area.  Excellent job!!

Text: Amazing experience! Cleanest hotel I've ever been to, very big rooms, great light dinner in the evening with 3 alcoholic drinks per adult, great breakfast with a huge variety, and the staff is amazing!! The manager working was so very nice and so personable!! Also the pool area is nice with an indoor and outdoor part. We will definitely be looking for Drury Inn & Suites hotels wherever we go! 
Also the hotel location was perfect! It is walking distance to so many restaurants, across the road from the Tuttle Mall, and just a 15 minute drive to the zoo!
