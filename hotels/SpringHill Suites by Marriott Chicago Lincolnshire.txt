Text: Fantastic property; well maintained with good landscaping. Nestled away from bustle of traffic. Friendly staff. Clean rooms and excellent breakfast buffet. Surprisingly the only thing I found lacking was notepads and pens in room.

Text: Good location, places to eat close by. Rooms are okay, but need updating. There are signs that say updateds will be happening in December 2017.. breakfast was not anything special, typically cold breakfast items with some eggs/meat but not much variety on the hot side.. lobby/breakfast area is small so it can be a little crowded in the morning. Staff is great!

Text: I had my wedding up the road from SpringHill Suites. I used SpringHill suites as a hotel for our out of town guests and couldn't be happier! The service we received from this hotel was the best I have ever had. The hotel did multiple shuttle services for us to and from our reception, they gave 'goodie bags' to all our guests along with details about their shuttle service. They also gave us , the bride and groom, Champagne in our hotel room! Not to mention the staff was always super friendly. This was the best experience I have ever had with a hotel. I highly recommend them!
