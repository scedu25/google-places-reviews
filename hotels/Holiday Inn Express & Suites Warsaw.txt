Holiday Inn Express & Suites Warsaw

Text: We were driving through and decided to stay here. I'm so glad we did! The bed was so comfortable and usually when I stay at hotels there is lots of noise. Very quiet here. The front desk staff was very nice. Skyla at the front desk was great. She checked us in and made sure we got the room we asked for. The lady in breakfast was so nice. I just wish they had a washer and dryer! I Definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Room was nice, and bed was comfortable. There is a nice lounge area on the third floor that is perfect for watching a football game with your friends. Staff was helpful and friendly. They're redoing the floors, so parts of the hotel are a mess, but it will be much improved when that is finished.

Text: Good hotel. The staff was very friendly and talked with us when we checked in and every morning. I was the guest of the day at arrival and was a pleasant experience as well.

Text: Quiet, smells nice, room was clean, most staff is friendly. Great rates, great free breakfast. Pool is small but was clean and warm. Mexican restaurant/bar very close (just at the end of the parking lot)
