Text: We requested the lower level and we got what we wanted. The room was clean and nicely set up. The free breakfast was pretty good and a nice variety of food. It was a nice hotel. I would go back again if needed.

Text: Room was nice. Workout facility was as well. I prefer not to be bothered for room cleaning until I check out and I was not bothered. One of my best hotel stays in a while, and I stay in a lot of hotels due to my business.

Text: While staying at this hotel July 6-9th, someone entered our room while we were out and stole all the cash we had in there and went through all of our personal belongings. Not only did the Manager not come see us 1st thing in the morning like we were told he would, my husband had to go find him at 11:30am, the Manager provided no follow up, like we were told we would get. They didn't even comp our room for the night we were robbed. I would not recommend this hotel since one Manager handling 2 hotels, that share the same parking lot, is clearly too much for him to handle.  
Also, on a different complaint this hotel also does not have enough bedding for the room. Thankfully we had blankets in our car so my son didn't have to use a mattress cover as a blanket.  The hotel was hosting at least 3 different sporting tournaments and couldn't provide bedding for everyone.  When I called for a blanket I was told they'd have to order some and that it will take 2 weeks.
