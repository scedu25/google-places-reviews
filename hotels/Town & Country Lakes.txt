Town & Country Lakes
Rating: 4
Text: Beautiful lake with fishing.  If you are using a tent, make note that there is only a Port-A-Potty and a community outdoor water faucet to use, so be sure to pack a basin.  Neighboring campers were very quiet, but you could hear the traffic from the interstate while sleeping.  Very relaxed management that allows you to pick your own site and set up prior to check in.  Camp site fees include some fishing.  Payment is via cash or check only (no credit cards).  Very nice place to camp with your family.

Text: Very poor and rude management. Went camping and wasn't allowed to have a camp fire. Charged $15 to put up a tent. How was we supposed to eat. I'm sorry but when you camp you heat your good over a fire.
