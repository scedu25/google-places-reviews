Hyatt Place Lexington

Text: This hotel was a phenomenal experience. They made my late check in a breeze and helped me relax after a very long day on the road. The room was huge, clean, and comfortable. Finished were too notch and luxurious. Continental breakfast was one of the best I have had and I got to enjoy it on their patio. Pool looked great but unfortunately I didn't get to partake in any swimming.

Text: I am staying two nights here and so far the first night in the hotel is went well. Super clean and updated. Location is close to many shops and really good restaurants. Breakfast was good with basic options you would get at most hotel breakfasts. Nice customer service.Overall pleased...one issue was that the toilet was refilling slower then normal.

Text: So far it's been great. We came from Florida to get away from the hurricane. The room has been nice. The breakfast is really good. The staff has been great. Would definitely come back.

Text: Nicely remodeled rooms. Only gave it 3 stars because the female staff refused to price match for a second night. Which turned out AWESOME because we extremely enjoyed staying at the Hilton Double tree a few miles away!  They have HUGE tubs and a romantic atmosphere.  Highly recommend staying at the Hilton!  Hyatt lost out over matching $20.  My gain and Hiltons!
