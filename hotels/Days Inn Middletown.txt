Text: Not a bad little hotel. We stayed to go to King's Island and had no issues getting around. The room was nice enough. Breakfast was good but typical.

Text: My boyfriend often works in Middletown and we spend a lot of time up here. He always stays here. It's a great place with great staff. For the money you couldn't ask for anything better. Comfortable beds. Fridge. Microwave. The cleaning staff are very sweet people. I was stayin here while recovering from knee surgery and they were very caring and understanding. Would recommend this place 10/10.
