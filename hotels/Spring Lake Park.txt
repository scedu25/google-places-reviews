Text: Great friendly staff! Loads of fun and variety of pretty inexpensive boats and pontoons to rent! Making it a point to return every month during spring and summer! A must of an experience! They have off-grid primitive campgrounds and mountain biking and hiking trails! Love this place!

Text: Was in Macomb for granddaughter's homecoming.  She recommended Spring Lake for our camping stay.  We have a 30 ft RV that was accommodated with ease. Will definitely return.
