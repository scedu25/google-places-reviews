Inn On Oak Street
Rating: 5
Text: I have stayed at the Inn on Oak street two times now and I have yet to be disappointed.  This B&B is hands down the best place to stay in Atchison, I honestly will not stay anywhere else while visiting Atchison.  The breakfast is amazing and everything was clean and welcoming when I arrived.  The area is quiet and it is nice to actually be able to sit on the porch in the evening and not  hear a ton of noise...only crickets.  I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.

Text: We stayed at the Inn October 2010, and will be returning October 2011. The house is so charming, with a lot of history. We stayed in the Red Room, and the room was so comfy and the bed was to die for!  We loved the breakfast in the morning, and Gini is sooo nice! Also, they owned dogs, and we loved playing with them! We had a great stay. Also, the last review was right, it is a little spooky, we had our door close twice by itself!
