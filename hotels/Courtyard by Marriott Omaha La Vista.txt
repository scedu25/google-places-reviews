Courtyard by Marriott Omaha La Vista
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is very new and is right next to the convention center. This is likely the nicest Courtyard hotel I have been too. The lobby is beautiful. The staff is friendly and attentive, as they typically are at a Marriott. There is a mini Starbucks on-site, although you would not confuse it with a full store. The breakfast is not included in the cost of the room but is available for a reasonable price, and is pretty tasty. There is a well stocked little market for items to eat or drink in your room.

Text: The room was spacious and clean. Staff were helpful and got me a late check-out so I wouldn't have to load my vehicle before going to the last day of the conference I was attending in the adjoined conference center. Location was convenient.

Text: Courtyard by Marriott was exactly what the pictures looked like. I was greeted by the front desk proudly even though there were several people checking in. The room was clean and welcoming. I loved their welcome note on the night stand.

Text: Needed a room for my boys and I to stay at while attending the race at I-80 Speedway and this offered the best balance between distance to the track and proximity to Omaha. The person checking us in was very polite and got us squared away right away. The room was very clean and the option to watch Netflix, Hulu, etc... went over very well with my two sons. I would highly recommend this hotel.
