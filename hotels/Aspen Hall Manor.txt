Text: A beautiful bed and breakfast.  Owners gave us warm welcome.   We had several women on a ladies weekend out.  Jill owner made us feel like family.

Text: House is perfect for a B&B.  I visited several and this one is very pleasant.  The owner is cold and somewhat abrupt.  When I first called, I was told very abruptly that she couldn't talk to me because a wedding was going on. She sounded stressed so I wondered why she didn't let the answering machine pick up instead of being rude.  Breakfast was one size fits all.  No inquiry of preferences, allergies, etc. and no variety.  When it's time for dishes to be collected it's clear the guests need to be done.  Breakfast has a scheduled time to begin and apparently a time to end.  The other guests were delightful, friendly and the saving grace.  The town is old a quaint.  Eddie Montgonery's new restaurant is the local attraction and the food is good.  Live music on Friday and Saturday.

Text: Amazing service, architecture, and the Romero tea service was fabulous!  The pre-Civil War antebellum house is unforgettable - along with all the delicious food.  We stayed in the violet room which has a private bathroom and was reallybeautiful/comfortable.  The owner is lovely, and makes you feel very welcome, just remember it is a B&B and someones home.  We wish we would have had the chance to spend a second night - but we will be going back with friends :)
