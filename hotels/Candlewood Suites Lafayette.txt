Candlewood Suites Lafayette

Text: Generally clean but, not particularly nice. The people who run the front counter are friendly. While I was checking in, I listened to an employee LOUDLY (from a different room) complain about another employee.  The water pressure is lacking and the automated air-conditioning is maddening. They offer a patio and grill for customers to use, but the grill is not very clean and the cover over the patio traps smoke from the grill right above your head. The TVs are difficult to operate and the pillows are terrible. If you are going to stay here, bring your own pillows.

Text: Amazing full kitchens, minus an oven. Soft beds, full exercise room and all the coffee you care to drink. The laundry room is also complimentary. The only thing lacking is a free breakfast, but you can purchase items from the hotel store. Recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: Candlewood Suites has nice rooms and great amenities. Even if your room doesn't come with an item you need or would like during your stay, they have many appliances, games, and convenience items available.

Text: we had a room we ended up having to transfer rooms, only to find out the room we transfered in had fleas or bed bugs, something was biting me, and then not to mention I had visited the hospital regards into a serious ear infection due to the pool being green and i took a swim and well i regret that completely. The manager of "Customer Satisfaction" didn't seem to care at all either. Will not be staying at there ever again.
