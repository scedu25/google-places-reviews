Suburban Extended Stay Hotel
Rating: 2
Text: This was the worst room in traveling for 3 weeks!   Such a shame because the hotel was fairly new, nice, clean.   But we were kept awake until one in the morning!   Children ran in the room above us until nearly midnight and then someone walked across the room until 1!   Unbelievable.   We asked to move, no more rooms available.  My husband has built and says it is mainly because the rooms are cheaply made, very little concrete or buffers between walls and ceilings.  DO NOT STAY there!   The only reason I gave it any starts at all was the cleanness.  No breakfast either.

Text: This hotel is better for a business trip than a family trip for a wedding. Rooms were great. No breakfast, wasn't told that. Traveling with two kids while super hungry at 7 am while trying to find some place to eat? Not a great experience.  Wi-Fi sucked. I asked three times (one time everyday I was there) how to access it and every time I got mumbling or it's on the room key holder. Also found out someone had put a large rock to stop the automatic locking exit door. I found it at 5 am while going to pack the car. We were next to some construction area and I was in a unfamiliar area. I was not happy to see that in the least. That could have let anyone inside. And you just can't tell who people are and what their intentions are anymore.

Text: The only thing that could have been better was if there was a nice hot tub to relax in. Other than that, the room had a mini kitchen, a comfy bed and fluffy pillows. All a plus
