Text: This hotel is terrible. I checked in and got my key. When I went to my room there was already another customer sleeping in it who I woke up! They assigned us both to the same room. I then go back to the desk and get a different room. There is a police car that circles the building every hour. A bunch of young people on the top floor who are obviously selling drugs and doing a terrible job of being discreet about it. There were no towels in my room and the washing machine upstairs doesn't work. It just eats your money. I wish I didn't book through a 3rd party site or I would have immediately gotten a refund and left

Text: Fair price but not good service. Shower rail was broken and microwave did not work. They were notified but never did anything during our 4 day stay.

Text: This hotel is horrible! We found a cockroach and showed it to the man at the front desk. He said they don't have bugs. After 3 times for showing him, he offered to switch our room which was at 3 AM. We have a small child who would have woken up. Throughout the 1 night we stayed I captured 13 pictures of live cockroaches, some pictures had up to 5 at once! They were even coming out of the alarm clock. Never been more disgusted. If I hadn't gotten a refund I would have called corporate.
