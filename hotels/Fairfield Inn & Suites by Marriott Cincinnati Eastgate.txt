Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Cincinnati Eastgate

Text: It was a very comfy place. But hard to get to! We couldn't figure out how to get to the parking lot. Only a sign pointing to the Holiday Inn. You must go thru the restaurants parking lot. Our suite was laid out awkwardly, but still accommodating. The breakfast was phenomenal. Sadly, other guests put a damper on our stay. (No fault of the hotel)

Text: Clean room, competitive price for the area.   We had great service from the front desk.  Our car broke down on the road right as we were pulling in.  We were told by the shop that would not be fixed till monday.  The car ended up being fixed on sunday afternoon.  They were very accommodating with not only adding the extra night, but also canceling it on short notice given our situation.  My only complaint is the area (not the hotel's fault.) can be confusing to navigate.  Don't miss a stop into Jungle Jim's nearby for giggles!

Text: Great Staff. A little hard to find the entrance. Needs a sign on where to turn. Need to go thru Charleys parking lot to get to hotel. Only one way in.

Text: A good hotel with nice amenities. Only problem was that there were a lot of baseball teams there for tournaments and there were boys everywhere. The pool was too crazy for young families. The workers were nice about dealing with it though.
