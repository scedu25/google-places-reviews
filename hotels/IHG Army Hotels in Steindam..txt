IHG Army Hotels in Steindam.
Rating: 5
Text: First of all ... This is the Newgarden Inn and it is located right on Post (Fort Knox KY).
This is a comfortable hotel for Military/their Families, and I did find the Kitchenette unit quite comfortable and a great place to stay while enjoying the craft and regular bourbon tours.
The morning breakfast is very good, rooms are clean.  Guests at the hotel also find convenient access to a laundry room on each floor as well.
I really appreciated the weekly reception too.

Text: At first glance, the outside of the hotel is as stark as the army base it sits on. But inside it is as clean and well-appointed as other holiday inns. The staff has been friendly and helpful. Our room is spacious and clean with all the amenities. I only wish there was a pool

Text: Complimentary breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage and biscuit and gravy. Cereal and various juices and milk are also available. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating. 10/10, will stay again. Reserve early as the hotel books up fast.

Text: A little dated. Plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom could definitely use some updates. I would rather stay in the hotel
