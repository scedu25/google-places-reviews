Text: The deadbolt on the door didn't work, told the manager. It didn't get fixed. Its the sketchiest hotel i've ever been in. The rooms smell horrible, the Wifi doesnt work, theres some type of fungus on the door knob, the water is too hot and the whole place makes a weird creaking noise.

Text: Paid for 60 dollar for one night. No microwave and refrigerator.what a shame of service. Said 49 dollar for a night and charged 60. Bad service and Room is kind of smell. I am not happy with what I had to pay.

Text: Terrible hotel, even for the price.  Check in is extremely slow.  The staff could not find our  reservation and made me call Expedia to resolve it rather than offering to help. The people checking in before me had very slow, problematic service as well. The room was poorly stocked - - no tissue and very little toilet paper. The air conditioner didn't work. The bedspreads in our nonsmoking room had cigarette burns.  When we tried to call the front desk, we discovered, of course, that the phone didn't work. The promised "free delicious breakfast" is a packaged sweet roll.

Text: Simple clean rooms for those on a budget.  No vending for drinks.  Not particularly close to restaurants except pancakes restaurant that closes after lunch. Limited parking for semi trucks.

Text: It was a non smoking room that smelled like it had been soaked in cigarettes. There were bugs flying around and a wet disgusting towel on the back of the bathroom door. Didn't actually stay overnight cause we were so grossed out.
