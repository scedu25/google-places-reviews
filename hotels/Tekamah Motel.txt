Text: Room was filthy and I found drugs in bathroom, called the police and they came and removed the drugs, owner blamed me for not contacting him and he would have cleaned the room. I called and made reservations like way before I arrived! don't you think room would have been cleaned if they knew we had rented it? do your self a favor and drive another 15 minutes and stay in Blair!!!  I asked the owner for my money back and have not heard anything from him.
