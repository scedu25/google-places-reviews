Heaven on Earth Bed & Breakfast

Text: We took a 4 day bike ride on the Katy Trail. This was our first overnight stop. It was absolutely perfect. Great hospitality. Fresh baked cookies upon arrival. Surrounded by woods. Homemade breakfast the following morning which was amazing. This was the perfect start to our trip, which ended with me saying "yes" to the proposal from my boyfriend. A trip to remember. We would definitely return.

Text: This was such a fun little place to stay after a long bike ride on the Katy Trail. The owners picked us (and our bicycles) up at the Katy Trailhead and drove us to our cabins. I stayed in the Cowboy Cabin, which was complete with cowboy decor, a fireplace, jacuzzi, and a loft! The owners were so friendly and accommodating - and the breakfast was amazing! Highly recommended!

Text: Located in Marthasville MO. The cabins provide all the luxury and convenience of any upscale hotel. Breakfast was excellent both days. The forced communication was the best, with no TV, no phone service and no Internet. You don't have a choice but to spend time with the one you love. We are definitely returning every year for our anniversary, this will be our little getaway

Warm soft cookies, delicious breakfast. ...i crave her French Toast every morning. Close to wineries. Hot tub is nice as well as the cabin. We loved the wood burning fire place steps from the bed.
We have stayed here 3 time and are thinking about booking again.
