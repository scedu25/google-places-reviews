Text: Freshman orientation at Miami U, so we were glad to escape to a quiet peaceful setting for the evening. Lovely young family and friendly dog. Spacious yard, wonderful wrap around porch, gazebo. Good air conditioning and fans for a hot summer night. Great full breakfast, plenty of coffee, generous hospitality.

Text: I stayed at the White Garden Inn for my daughter's Mom's Weekend.  I had a wonderful stay.  Our room was lovely.  I stayed two nights and the breakfast on both days was quite delicious.  The hosts were very nice and accommodating.  I will definitely stay here again...in fact, I just booked by husband there for Dad's weekend.
