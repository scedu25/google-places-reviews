Text: The location is fairly easy to find and the rooms were pretty clean

Text: Very nice staff and a decent tv channel line up, and that's the only reason we're giving two stars. The promised wi-fi was non existent; I requested a non smoking room and we clearly got a smoking room; and the bathroom door was filthy.

Text: Location is convenient, and the price is decent for traveling workers. The rooms are old and wore out. They are slowly working their way through fixing them up.

Text: Came to town for a large Auto race. Booked 2 months in advance. Called one week in advance to cancel 1 night and they had lost my reservation. They made me a new reservation for 20 dollars higher than originally said. When I asked them to honor the price they originally gave me, they responded with "I don't make the prices" 

Since every other hotel was already full, we took it anyway. The first night our heater wouldn't keep up, the next day our water got shutoff, and then that night we lost ALL hot water. 

Will not be back, consider looking elsewhere.
