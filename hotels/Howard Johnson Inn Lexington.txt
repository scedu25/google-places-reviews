Howard Johnson Inn Lexington

Text: In reading some of these other reviews, I'm reminded of why I hate dealing with the public.  Some people just look for things to complain about.  I thought this was a lovely hotel!  Pretty landscaping outside, large  clean rooms that have been recently updated.  The beds were super comfortable and the A/C works great.  My favorite part was the shower!  It's right off of I-75 and easy to find for travelers passing through who might not know the area.  All in all, I was very pleased and couldn't believe we only paid $65/night for such a nice hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Unfortunately our stay here was appalling. We rented out 15 rooms total during our stay. We were given a room that smelt like smoke and when the issue was addressed they would not allow for another room and the customer was "not right". On top of having to sleep in a room filled with cigarette smoke, we were not able to  linger in the lobby. We were not being disrespectful in the slightest, but the man working the front desk rudely came up and yelled at us and told us to get to our rooms like we were children. After the numerous problems as we listed only a few, we would not recommend this hotel for anyone. We would never want anyone to be treated the way we were. There are many hotels that are across the street that could be a better option. Thanks for reading, I hope you take our comment into consideration and good luck!

Text: My husband and I have stayed 50 days this summer at Howard Johnson in Lexington. Its best atribute is its staff. They always are pleasant and helpful. The housekeeping are very hard working. The hotel in all is clean. The linens are spotless. Breakfast is fresh. The smoking rooms are in need of repair. Loose shelves, toilets wobble, doors cracked or won't shut, ceiling flaking off. I recommend but stay in the non smoking rooms.

Text: I stayed here with my dog. The room was big but found a cockroach and cobweb on the window. Breakfast was the worst thing that I ever had. Only bagels, cereals, milk, yogurts and coffee. Staying with a dog and reasonable price are good points. So many fake reviews for the breakfast.

Text: Clean, comfortable, up to date.  Very happy to have a room for the night as everything for miles was booked.  Only thing is this old broad could have used an elevator to get her albatross of a suitcase up the stairs. :-)
