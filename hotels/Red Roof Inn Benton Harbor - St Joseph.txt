Red Roof Inn Benton Harbor - St Joseph
Rating: 3
Text: We stayed here for one night. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is located close to restaurants and the mall. What we didn't like so much is how small the rooms are and the condition they are in. The bathroom is tiny and there is a lot of mould in the shower. However, the price was okay.

Text: Room is clean and updated. The office staff was friendly, wish they had more flyers on things to do. The location is literally right off the highway and right next to some shops. Go have breakfast across the street at Sophias - phenomenal!

Text: The service is fine, but the room is atrocious. It's dirty, including crust on the comforter, a filthy mini fridge, and a dirty bathroom. Also, the room is plagued with gnats. There are very few restaurants in the area to seek respite either.

Text: Friendly, helpful staff. Clean but small room. Building beginning to show age.
