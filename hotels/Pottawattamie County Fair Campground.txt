Pottawattamie County Fair Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We camped here in kind of an emergency situation. I was not expecting much as I don't usually find county parks to be big rig friendly. To our surprise it was a very nice, well maintained park. The only downside which really wasn't a problem is that it is right next to the local school, so there is a fair amount of traffic early in the morning and mid-afternoon. Rates are more than reasonable.

Text: Full hookups, only 3 sites were filled on a Saturday night.  Great for a night stopover.
