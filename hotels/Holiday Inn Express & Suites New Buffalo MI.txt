Holiday Inn Express & Suites New Buffalo MI

Text: This is a very solid place. Beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are very clean. Cleaning crew is so very nice and polite and front desk was as well. It sits off from the main road so it's super quiet and the light blocking curtains make noon seem like midnight. Breakfast offers good coffee and everything you can think of both hot and cold. I would come back again.

Text: I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and 3 nights. The rooms were extremely clean and breakfast was amazing. The location was perfect because it was right next to the highway. Staff provided excellent service, I got reimbursement for the cable being out for 2 days. I would definitely stay at the hotel again.

Text: Breakfast ends at 10 am, but they wouldn't fill pancake machine at 9:45 am. Nasty cheese omelets, stale and dried up sausage, frozen bagels.  Nasty woman attendant puts food away before 10 am.  McDonald's next door must do great business!
