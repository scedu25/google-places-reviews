Text: Food was amazing. Special was a baked potato sandwich. So good! Atmosphere was good. A few drunks being loud at the bar, but never bothered anyone. There is a separate family dining side, we sat in the bar since we rode our motorcycle there. Friendly staff.

Text: They did away with their famous hand breaded onion rings,due to a new cook. We came in at 3pm on a Sat dirty tables and floors. Restrooms had mold. I have been here before never like this. Food quailty seemed to have dropped as well. The server was good.

Text: Waited 30 min to have the hostess wait on us because the waitress walked by us the entire time, then ordered 2 salads for another 30 min wait for a salad. Terrible service. Received a nice plastic cup for my beer when everyone else got glasses around us.

Text: Went to dinner at the Broadway Tavern recently and was not satisfied at all. Food was good as always yet the service was horrid and our server was very rude. I will not be back any time soon. Very slow as usual, should not take 2 hours to eat dinner anywhere.

Text: Our waitress was awesome once we found a spot. We waited for quite a while to be seated until we finally entered the bar on our own and found a spot. The beer selection was pretty limited (nothing fancy). I got a Southwest burger. It was a bit pink (not a fan of that), but it was good. I had the German Fries, and they were delicious. My friend had a reuben, which was skimpy on ingredients. She said it was yummy, however.
