Text: Location was nice. It's great to have breakfast and dinner served as well as complimentary beverages in the afternoon. Great price for all you get. Plus, really nice staff.

Text: I am a fan.  Free dinner, free happy hour, free breakfast... do you want me to just move in?  The rooms are cozy and the place is clean and quiet.  The employees are extremely friendly and welcoming.  I was asked several times during my stay from managers to house keepers "how are you enjoying your stay?"  I also rented the large conference room for a meeting and they had everything set up as I asked and it was perfect.  From now on when I travel I will seek out Drury Inn and Suites wherever I go.  I will see you in June!

Text: Best customer service I have encountered in many years. This place was super clean, friendly and soooo polite. Amazing!!! Great meals, sweet chef, just set the standard, like they really enjoy what they do , and if they don't they fake it very well.... all of the staff the best. Stay here!!! it is worth it just for the simple fact that the folks working there are literally the coolest. Rock On.

Text: Won't stay anywhere else in Evansville. Save a ton with a fantastic hot breakfast, free drinks 5-7 pm and a great dinner all included as well. Plus discounts for hospital make this an incredible value. Free soft drinksand popcorn till 10 pm. Must stay here. Bed is comfortable and pillows soft!
