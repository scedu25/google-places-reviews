Text: Friendly staff, very accommodating. Good selection of breakfast items. I had my dog with me so my room was a pet room. The carpet was stained and had been urinated on and not cleaned. I brought this to the attention of staff as I didn't want to be charged for something another animal had left. They said they would clean the carpet and thanked me for bringing it to their attention. Ok rate for hotels nowadays. I would stay there again.

Text: The hotel had an order to it. It's right next to a main interstate. The toilet was loose, very small and skinny tub. The continental breakfast was not maintained. On the other side of that, the staff was professional and nice. The beds were comfortable. The air conditioning was amazing. The breakfast was good. Free WiFi. Easy to get to.

Text: My friend was able to check in early, buy the lock to the room wouldn't work. We tried another room, but it wasn't clean yet... and the housekeepers I never came! We finally got to the third and final room, and it was just right. We were just grateful that the room was quiet even though it was next to the elevator!

Text: This is a fairly decent hotel. Water pressure was so-so. The water took a bit to heat up. The beds are firm. Only one ice machine on the bottom floor. The sheets were clean and I liked how they felt. The room smelt nice. But my favorite thing about this place was it is dog friendly. I didn't travel with a dog but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them in the lobby and parking lot.
