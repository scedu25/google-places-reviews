Text: Stayed at this Hotel with my husband for a Wedding event. We were told that our room was ready for an early check in at 1:00pm. At the time of check in we didn’t notice anything wrong with the room as we were in a rush to get checked in and head to the wedding. However, after the event I decided to lay on the bed on my belly and noticed several large nail clippings on the floor. OH HOW DISGUSTING ? We went to the front desk and informed the Rep about the situation who couldn’t do anything but have the mess cleaned up and stated that the GM would be informed the next morning.

Text: Very clean and super comfortable beds! The gentlemen that was working the night shift was very polite and friendly! 
The breakfast was good everything was presented nicely and looked fresh.
My only complaint was the air conditioner in our room would be very loud at times it woke me up at least twice.

Text: Springhill Suites South is a great place to stay. Comfy beds, friendly staff with spacious rooms. I was staying here two weeks ago and would say that the breakfast took a hit. Not sure what changed. I was here all week and something set the fire alarm off @ 11pm one night. That woke me up and everyone met downstairs and outside. It was for something small, but the FD were there in a timly manner. It was annoying but in the end, at least you can count the FD in case of something big!

Text: Awesome bed!!! Except the blood stained blankets..I understand things may happen but when you are checking in and making a bed for someone in a hotel it should be double and triple checked ....Went downstairs to ask for help was told there was no more rooms and was handed a blanket to take care of it myself .The next morning and went down To talk to a manager there was none there was told it would be handled and she would call me within the day .3 days later I have called twice and still not have returned a phone call from the manager ...Horrible customer service when I was talking to the front desk lady the morning after she said there was plenty of rooms that I could have been switch to the guy just did know how to do it ....
