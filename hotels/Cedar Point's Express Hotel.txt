Cedar Point's Express Hotel
Rating: 2
Text: Express is probably the best way to describe the hotel. It seems like they take care of the rooms so fast that they don't have time to clean the the sink, the shower, or anything in the bathroom. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in a year. The refrigerator was dirty and so we're the walls. The room next to ours had beer left in the fridge from a previous guest and their bathroom was also dirty. I don't know what housekeeping does at this hotel, but it isn't clean. There was no coffee in the room either, and the night shift lady at the front desk was very rude when I asked her for some. On a good note, the hotel is very close to Cedar Point. It also looks pretty nice if you don't look too closely.

Text: Great service. Checking in was a breeze, refund was readily given for a friend that wasn't able to make the trip, attendant at desk was very pleasant to deal with. The adjoined rooms we booked more than accommodated our group of seven. Beds/pillows were comfy, bathroom well stocked with necessary supplies including ample towels. Spotless upon arrival. Checking out the following morning took about ten seconds and we were on our way to the park for the day. Would stay again.

Text: Much cheaper than Hotel Breakers if you're only interested in the park (no beach). You do have to drive into the park each day, but it's only 5 minutes away, and with the 1 hour early entry you end up with a parking spot right at the entrance. Staying here gives you free parking passes and cheaper tickets, plus the rates were competitive with hotels in the area. Staff were very friendly, and the rooms were nice. Had a safe and mini-fridge which is perfect since we brought food for the park. Would definitely stay again on our next visit.

Text: This was a pretty solid hotel experience, my first time here. You can definitely tell that the hotel has been refurbished recently, very clean, modern decor. Check-in went very smoothly, helpful front desk clerk. The room itself was clean, perfect for a small group. We had no problems with noise even though were right next to the mechanical room. Mattress was comfortable, I was glad I brought my own pillow though. My only complaint was that the shower control was a little confusing. That may have been on me as much as anything though. Don't pay extra for breakfast though, there's a handy McDonald's right on the way to the park.

Text: I went to the Cedar Point's Express Hotel because, I was going to cedar point. The hotel gives you 2 tickets and free parking to cedar point for a pretty good price. The hotel room was very clean and had a nice view. The hotel room had 2 queen beds, a spacious bathroom, a mini fridge, a microwave, and a desk with a coffee machine. My experience at this haptel was a 5 star experience.
