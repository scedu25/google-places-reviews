Text: Very quaint, this place is an anachronism. A bit out of it's logical time, Knotty Pine in is a throw back to the 50s. They even still have actual keys, not keycards and a reservation log, not a computer. It is well priced and a safe place to stay. There are no frills, but it is clean and quite. And the pizza and fried chicken is amazing.
