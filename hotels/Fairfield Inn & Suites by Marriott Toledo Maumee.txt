Text: This is a decent hotel. It's nothing spectacular, but the location feels safe, the hot breakfast was good, and the staff were mostly helpful (especially housekeeping).

Text: The rooms were clean and comfortable. The pool area was nice. The greeting staff was not very good and there wasn't coffee or tea regularly available. Breakfast was decent

Text: Stayed here for work, was pleased with free breakfast offering gluten free food. Everything was clean and well-kept. The pool was under some sort of construction but it was fixed within a day. My only wish was that there was a microwave in the room, although the one downstairs works just fine.

Text: Quite comfortable hotel. It's your standard Fairfield inn design and the people we're nice. So I'd go back when in the area.
