Text: Fair price. The room itself was nice. Had full kitchen good tv options. All that was left was smoking rooms. Smelt like an astray. Im a smoker but this still grossed me out. Other than that friendly staff...granola bar muffin coffee breakfast.

Text: We had a great stay! There were a lot of things happening in the area and they were very busy. Staff was so pleasant and upbeat! There was a problem with the room that we booked and had to take a different room, but they were so kind and accommodating!!

Text: Would never stay here again.  Went through 2 rooms before I got one that was somewhat clean,along with the front desk person arguing with me.  Nothing was in the kitchen and after 3 separate trips by front counter I got kitchen items.  Breakfast "to go" barely covers what it available.
