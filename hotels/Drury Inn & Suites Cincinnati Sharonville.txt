Text: Everything was wonderful! We stopped here on our way to and from our destination. Pet friendly with only a $25 pet fee compared to most places of $100. Everything was clean and the room included everything that our family of 4 and a pup could need. They offer free breakfast and dinner with drinks. Not your normal bowl of cereal and apple type breakfast either. Huge variety and spread. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. Pete checked us out on our first trip and was also working when we came back for our 2nd stay and was very friendly. I saw the same manager at dinner and breakfast and he was speaking with everyone and being very hospitable. They truly do want you to be happy and comfortable. I would recommend this location to anyone and will plan to stay here on my next trip south.

Text: Nice hotel with hot breakfast served. A lot of my family loves the dinner options as well (hot dogs, nachos, small salad bar, baked potato and usually a special). The gym had really nice equipment and the pool was clean. No complaints, but it is slightly more expensive than I would hope. However, it's nice that you get three included alcoholic beverages a night per person as well. They attempt to make up for the cost in food amenities.

Text: The Drury Inn is truly a magnificent place. The staff was so friendly during our whole stay, and it is conveniently located near various restaurants, whether you are looking to sit down and have a warm meal, or get a sub sandwich to go from Subway! They even have an evening dinner at the hotel, but we never ate it although it looks delicious. The breakfast was amazing. They had: biscuits and gravy, bananas, eggs, potatoes, waffle station, oatmeal, and everything else you can really imagine for breakfast. The staff was always restocking the food too, and plenty was left at 9:00am when it began at 7:00am because of that! The hotel is pet friendly, and the rooms were the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed within. The pool area is nice, and a perfect spot to relax or have fun. I was truly impressed with this hotel, and I recommend it for everyone.
