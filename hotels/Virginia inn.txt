Text: I was very impressed with large and well furnished room with big screen TV with HBO so I did not miss season finale of GOT.  Room was well stocked, clean, and bed bug free.  Location is prime since you are within minutes of everything.  Unlike other family run operation, this place actually has a friendly staff.  I can't comment much on Cont. Breakfast since I missed it... but I do recommend this place to anyone!

Text: The room was clean and the jet tub was nice. There were a few things, like the plumbing that could be improved on.  The price seemed high for the quality, however, but the staff was very friendly and helpful!

Text: While traveling cross country, my wife and I booked a room at the Virginia Inn based on the fair price and previous positive reviews. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the rooms were indeed clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows and the facilities were updated and well kept. The extra large flat screen tv was an added bonus! Overall we can soundly recommend Virginia Inn to anyone passing through the area.

Text: We stayed here because they had decent reviews and were not super expensive. Driving onto the property, we definitely questioned whether it was actually a safe place to be as the outside appearance needs some refreshing. The clerk at the desk was nice. The room itself surprised us in how relatively nice it appeared. It was pretty clean, the beds practically brand new.  It wad a little weird that the whole floor was tile though, especially in Kansas... i imagine it gets very cold and messy during the winter. You could tell it was a budget place in the details... frayed linens, the TV had lines in it, limited toiletries, few amenities... but it was suitable for a one night stay. I don't know if I'd stay here for an extended time. Not the best but certainly not the worst. I would stay there again if I needed to. It is pretty centrally located and there is quick access to restaurants, grocery and drug stores, and several local attractions.
