Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Cincinnati-Eastgate (I-275e)
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is not a typical Holiday Inn, it's beautiful! When you enter, there's a beautiful fountain and large sitting area. They also have incredible amenities a restaurant, bar, pool, workout center, office center, meeting rooms, everything you can imagine. The staff has been very helpful and friendly. I also feel safe with security in the building. I have been very happy so far with my stay! I would recommend the hotel to anyone.

Text: Nice lobby, friendly staff. Rooms are dark, outdated, dirty, and creepy.  Not like fun haunted hotel creepy, just seedy and really uninviting.  I travel a lot, and I feel uneasy here,

Text: I don't think I have ever left a negative review, but feel I need to this time. How does this place have 4.3 stars!? Our room has carpet that is threadbare with holes and the ceiling is dusty/dirty. The furniture and decor is literally from the 80s (the complete set of encyclopedia Brittanica on the shelf in our room gives testament to this fact)... Don't be fooled by the pictures. I have stayed at much nicer places for much less money.

Text: We have hosted our student leader event here for 3 years and every year the staff including reservations, cleaning, sales, and banquet have done an incredible job! They have been professional, friendly, and accommodating for a group our size. Specifically, Carolyn in the restaurant, and Daryl and Darin in banquet services knocked it out of the park!
