Super 8 Calvert City Kentucky Lake
Rating: 5
Text: Spent the weekend here while working.  Nice clean recently refurbished. Staff are friendly, personable and will help you with requests. Breakfast was really good, the usual fare with the added bonus of freshly cooked omelets plus biscuits and gravy. 
Plenty of parking for cars, pickups with boats/ trailers (really close to lake Kentucky.) Plenty of nice mom and  pop restaurants and national franchise places also. Place of interest near by is the Kentucky Dam. Pretty place to walk and I also found a nice wooded trail near the marina. Activities such as fishing, beach area at lake for swimming, horse  back riding and zip lines with much more. Next town over is Paducah. Its a historic district and well worth a visit.

Text: Staff was very friendly despite their busyness. Discovered upon arrival there was a fishing tournament going on. Was shocked to find out there were still vacancies. Room was very clean and well maintained. They don't have carpet in the rooms, but instead have hardwood looking floors. I found that asthethically pleasing as I wasn't worried about what stains long lived in the carpet. Sound wise, you would have thought that with their high occupancy that you'd hear door slamming or people in the hallway, but it was pleasantly quiet. Would definitely recommend as a layover spot. The room rate was very reasonable.
