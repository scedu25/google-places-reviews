El Dorado Motel & Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: I come through El Dorado for work a few times a year and always stay here.  The motel has clean rooms with a refrigerator and microwave in each one. Very affordable weekly rates with daily room service provided (this is not offered by all motels in this town by my experience). 

Owners on site and very friendly. Only a few miles from the El Dorado Lake and within walking distance of movie theater, public parks, Walnut River  and tennis courts. 

Restaurant on property delivers to room and has tasty Italian food. Chef will make food to order that is not on the menu if she has the ingredients on hand. Definitely recommend!

Text: This is a wonderful place to stay. Plenty of parking for all types of vehicles. Clean and spacious rooms. The owners are helpful and treat you like family. I've been staying here almost every weekend for the past 5 years and wouldn't stay anywhere else. Prices are beyond reasonable. Isaac and Angie make everyone feel welcome! Great value and convenience.

Text: Spent less for rooms that had more. No fridge, microwave, nor any soda or snack machines. Seems like the best reviews for this place come from the restaurant but the hotel itself is majorly lacking.
