Text: I stayed here last week for two days. The elevator broke, I was on the third floor. The beds were comfortable. Maid service woke us up every morning at 8 am. That was really annoying and aggravating. The staff was nice but seemed to busy. Breakfast stopped at 0930 on Monday but 10 on weekends. We did not know this so Monday when we went to get breakfast at 0935 everything was already put away.
