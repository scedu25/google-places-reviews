Text: Great Place for some out door fun with family members!! My husband and I use to bring our granddaughter Morgan and one of her friends there all the time before my husbands accident! they had a great time skating and he taught our granddaughter Morgan to skate when she was three years old! she is now almost 16 and still skates when she gets the chance! A great place for picnics and camping and the ice cream shop is great too, especially the strawberry and chocolate which the whole family enjoys! Lots of memories from the past also! Hope it will always be there for family and friends too enjoy and spend time together in that lovely park!
