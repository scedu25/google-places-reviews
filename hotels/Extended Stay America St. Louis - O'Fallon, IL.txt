Extended Stay America St. Louis - O'Fallon, IL
Rating: 5
Text: This is a great place to stay on a budget. The room was clean and includes a full kitchen with dishes. The bed was comfortable if your doing the tourist thing and seeing St. Louis, it is close enough to give you quick and easy access to the attractions.

The "extras" of more upscale hotels are absent. No breakfast, but hot coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries are available free in the lobby in the morning. Free WiFi is available and if the manager on duty is Miss Precious(who lives up to her name), any problems you have will be addressed quickly and with a smile. She is the best. On top of it you save money as rates are half the rates most others in the area charge. The area is safe with lots of places to eat very close by. I will always stay here when in the area.

Text: Room is clean and quiet. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. We've stayed here several times, and we'll continue coming here. It's nice to have a full-size refrigerator in the room. We can actually have groceries in the room and not spend a fortune eating out. Major plus!

Text: Exactly what I was looking for. Simple clean studio setup with kitchenette. Super accommodating and extremely hospitable staff and management. The grab and go breakfast is simple and convenient, especially for non-morning people like myself who never have time to sit down for breakfast.

Text: We needed an overnight stay while our bathroom was being repaired. I never knew how hard it would be finding somewhere that accepted pets. Extended Stay advertises pet friendly, and they were. We were given a pet room with nice vinyl flooring, very smart idea on their part , and on the first floor near the outside door close to the grassy pet area. We were asked to clean up after our dog which we assume is a normal activity for pet owners. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Obviously many dog owners felt it wasn't necessary. Maybe staff is supposed to to do this, along with cleaning rooms and laundry. Fortunately, rude dog owners are not the fault of the hotel. The room also featured a king sized bed and small kitchenette along with other typical hotel room features, TV, etc. We were only there overnight but could easily been comfortable for a longer time.
