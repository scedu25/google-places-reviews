Text: The manger for this place is a huge b****!! I don't live there but I have been dropping my friend off out there for quite some time now and have drove the same speed every time! The speed limit out there is 15 I was literally doing like maybe 2 over.. anyhow she yells slow down! Then comes up to my car very aggressive and told me in so many words I needed to slow down.. then as I'm driving off ( going the speed limit ) she's screams slow down... 1st off being a park manger I would think she should be a lot more professional and said something to the effect of "hey can you please slow down a bit? We got kids around here w.e w.e w.e.." I could understand more if I was flying purposely going fast more than just 2 over.. feel sorry for the people that have to live there and deal with her shitty attitude!!! You catch more bees with honey than you do vinegar!!!
