Baymont Inn & Suites Hays
Rating: 5
Text: I'm in the transportation industry, so I spend more time in hotels than I do at home. That being said, I really enjoyed my stay here. There's a few things I prioritize and all of them checked out:

Room was clean and comfortable. No noticeable odors. Furniture was not dated or overly worn. Newer style AC worked great, constant fan mode worked. Did not have to push bedside table to the side to access outlet, outlets were conveniently placed. Mattress and pillows were comfortable. Shower had good water pressure and towels were soft. Excellent room for the price. 
Exterior is a little rough which may be a deal breaker for some but I'm of the opinion that I sleep inside the room, not outside of it. I would stay here again without hesitation.

Text: Great overnight stay. Easy access to the highway and plenty of food options around. Comfy bed, decent room. It's not your typical Baymont. The doors aren't inside. They have smoking and non smoking rooms. Breakfast was really good. I'd stay again.

Text: Room was very small and cramped, barely a space to walk. The room was so hot! The air conditioner barely worked enough. And the pillows were terrible. The staff was nice and the breakfast was decent although the breakfast area was small. Decent enough for the $60
