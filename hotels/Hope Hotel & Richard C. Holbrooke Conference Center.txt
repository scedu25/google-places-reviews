Hope Hotel & Richard C. Holbrooke Conference Center
Rating: 3
Text: I stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights. The hotel lobby area was clean and the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. My room was non-smoking but had the very distinct smell of a musty old motel room with old stale cigarette smoke. The air conditioner/heater worked well for being probably 30 years old. Only complaint about that is that it was disgustingly dirty. Thick layers of dust around the vent made me hesitant to turn it on. Otherwise the room was comfy and clean. The restaurant had pretty decent food and beer on draft.

Text: The conference center was nice and the food was great. The staff are wonderful. The cost is a little high for AV setup, but overall a very nice experience.

Text: Good location right next to the base and a lively cheap and good bar/restaurant attached. They have 'modernized' their build and is a good stay.

Text: The Wi-Fi here is so slow!!! There is one particular girl at the front desk, with dark brown hair, who is very rude. The older staff members are nice though. The people at Packys are also usually very nice. Kinda motel-ish! Would not stay here again if I had the option.
