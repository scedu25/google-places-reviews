Text: I wish I could give this hole zero stars. It is absolutely filthy. Disgusting. Dead bugs on the wall. Questionable brown smears on the bathroom walls. Dirty sink and shower. I wouldn't let my dog stay here. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should anyone stay here. Sleep in your car if you have to.

Text: I'd give it minus 5 stars if I could. In room 1; There was either puke or blood all over the curtains. The bed skirt was covered in gunk too. Halls looked like there had been a riot going on there as lots of walls had severe damage to them. Went to the desk and they said they'd put us in another room... It had spaghetti on the heater unit and was just as filthy. We ran out of there with our 3 year old daughter as fast as we could. Surely this place should be condemned!!! No exaggeration either... Yuck

Text: The room we got had just been painted so smelled strongly from that. The carpets were stained all over. The bed was a pull down from the wall so the frame is on the floor and my husband kept stubbing his toes.  Looks as if the room is used as a meeting room as well since it's quite a bit larger than a normal room and there were stacks of chairs and tables in our room. The staff was nice and helpful. This hotel is a little harder to get to, a bit off any main road then down what looks like a long abandoned drive.

Text: I would give this place zero stars but in order to post a review, I had to click on 1 star. Horrible experience. The pictures on the site are very misleading. The area is very run down and abandoned. The hotel is very rundown. The room smelled of cat urine, and was musty. The carpet was in bad condition and torn in places, walls banged up and paint chipping. Permanent dirty spots all over the hotel. Staff was rude. We did not see cockroaches or bed bugs but expected to see them. Website states early check in available but you cannot plan on it as they make you call around 10 a.m. to noon the same day of check in to see if you can have an early check in. The place was dead so why the wait to confirm a noon or 1 p.m. check in time!? Yes, the rate here is cheap but it is cheap for a reason....you get what you pay for.
