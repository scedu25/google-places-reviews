Junction City Inn & Suites

Text: Did not match the description online.  I selected this hotel for the advertised pool.  But the pool was closed for remodeling.  As I already paid, I asked for them to price match with another local hotel, and they refused.  

They do not appear to have their business together.  They have not been a Comfort Inn for over a year, yet their sign and room keys still advertise "Comfort Inn".

Text: Terrible management. No towels in room, when requested was informed they had to do laundry. Smoke detector had no batteries. Reserved online and reservations were for Comfort Inn and so was their rating. Comfort inn had closed over a year ago. Worst experience ever at a hotel!
