Text: If you are considering this place, stop now. .Go elsewhere. Management is terrible and will lie to your face. They give "violations" for no reason and try to get good residence to leave. They just want to turn over renters and don't care about those who own and would have you gone. Lot rent goes up every year and is the cost of an apartment in some areas. If you have to pay a mortgage on top of that you are better off going elsewhere. Did I mention management is terrible?

Text: Full of felons, more expensive, frequent water outages with no notice.  Managment raises rent without giving increase amounts. No professional snow removal. Only lets some tenants use half their yard space, refuses to provide property boundaries. Lots give no space/access to use back doors.

Text: Nice place with nice houses. Just hope you get good neighbors is all. They like to keep the place nice and tidy though so overall it's a pretty good place to live.
