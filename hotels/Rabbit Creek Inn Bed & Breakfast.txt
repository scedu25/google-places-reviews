Rabbit Creek Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Rabbit Creek Inn is by far the best bed and breakfast experience I have had to date. The Inn is situated among beautiful horse farms in the Kentucky countryside. The owners were so inviting and hospitable. The rooms were extremely clean and the breakfast was to die for.  I highly recommend checking this lovely place out! They also have an inground pool!

Text: We stayed one night (Mar 25th, 2016).  Glenda and Hubert were very friendly and treated us like family.  We enjoyed our room, everything was very neat and clean.  The breakfast was very good we truly enjoyed it.   It  was easy to find and not far away from local dining.  We would recommend Rabbit creek to anyone.  Thank Glenda, Hubert for help making our Anniversary a special one.
