Wray Hitch N' Post

Text: Stayed here for one night as we passed through the area. The owner was very nice and helpful, coming over to our site to wipe down the picnic table for us and make sure we were happy with the site and hookups. Showers were clean and hot, bathrooms clean and well kept. We had a popup and were put in a nice grassy area which had some substantial shade trees. The big RV area is in the sun on a crushed rock base. It was very quiet that night, the road noise from the nearby state road pretty much disappeared at night. Wray itself is one of the bigger towns in the area and had some nice restaurants.

Text: Small RV park just south of the town of Wray, CO. Gravel sites that were kinda small, but we were able to pull forward enough to get our towed out of the way. Friendly people and a big grassy/weedy area in the back to throw the ball for my pups. Bumpy driveway in to the park.
