Text: Staff was incredibly friendly. Room was very clean. Free use of the washer and dryer was a nice touch and the fitness room had a good multi use weight machine and some dumbbells for a quick exercise at night. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in the area.

Text: We stayed ten nights at the Candlewood in a Queen Suite. The kitchen was well stocked. The space was designed well and beautifully decorated. The Wednesday night communal meal was an unexpected treat. We will definitely stay here again!

Text: Great location, and easy to find. Room's are very nice and spacious! Service is good. Only negative thing I have to say is if you plan on staying a week or more, they only clean the room once a week.
