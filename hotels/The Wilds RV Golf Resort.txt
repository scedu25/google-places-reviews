Text: Pros: Level concrete parking pad. Great over air TV (27 channels). Very friendly in Club House check in. Cons: Dirty water - must not have been cleared out from winter. Cash only - no credit cards. WiFi cost $5.00 that you had to use a credit card on a website that was not secure in order to receive it. We weren’t informed of this ahead of time. A lot of train noise! Whistles 10 - 12 times per train. There must be a lot of sleep deprived RV drivers on the road. Scary! We didn’t see the golf course. It was cold and rainy. We stayed 1 night in April 2017.

Text: Stayed @ The Wilds from 4/8/17 through 4/30/17. Was traveling in my 32' Class A Motor Home. I found the staff to be friendly, knowledgeable & customer oriented. My stay was quiet, peaceful & enjoyable. The pad was concrete with a full hookup. I had no  problems & would enjoy staying here again!
