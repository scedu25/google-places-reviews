Text: A very nice place to stay. We come to Coshocton once a year and don't hesitate to book a room here. Clean, comfortable and up to date. Owner is very good and cares about his Motel. Unlike some people there is no need here to worry about whether the sheets have been changed. I highly recommend Roscoe Motor Inn!
