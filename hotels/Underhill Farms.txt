Text: I had the same experience as the other reviewer.  Poor quality product (in this case gooseberry pie) and absurd shipping cost tacked on to the order after the fact.  The pie was already a ridiculous cost of nearly $40 - then they added another $40 to ship it just 150 miles from their "kitchen".  Contacted them to adjust the shipping cost to a reasonable amount and the owner was rude and unwilling to listen.  My advice, stay away.

Text: I really don't like to leave negative reviews of a small business but they left me no choice. I ordered a large portion of meat from them. No where on their website did it mention that shipping would cost more that what you buy. I soon was charged over double of what I ordered. Within three hours of placing the order I immediately emailed twice to cancel. The responding emails were rude and totally lacking in any customer service. Three days later I am refunded and shorted $15. When I ask why I am told that it is what they were charged through the credit card company. I know this is an outright lie since my husband and I own a small business and have never heard of this with our credit card orders. In the end I found a company who sells venison with much better customer service and doesn't try to fleece their customers.
