Bluegrass Inn

Text: Clean, comfortable, great value! What more can you ask for? Just a one night stay and I was happy and slept good. AC worked amazing! Seriously worth every penny. My family was able to sleep in a clean, comfortable room for an outstanding price.

Text: Not the pretties or cleanest place I have ever stayed in, but for the price you get what you get. My room was put together at least although the distinct stale odor of smoke still permeated the air. However bearable, it wasn't pleasant.

On a side note all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and all in all if I was to stay in the area again I would most like look for the blue grass again. Even with it's troubles. The charm and atmosphere of the establishment really brings you in.

Text: Clean. Polite employees, girl at check in especially. Pool is awesome. Room was nice. Bed was a little hard but not painful. Coffee was really good. We will go back.

Text: Adequate budget hotel room. Rooms were small and dated, but clean. Woman at front desk was very friendly. 

Wifi was poor but useable. Location is quite noisy from road traffic. Area seemed safe and grounds were well-lit. 

I would consider staying here again. I'd give it a 3.5 rating if I could.
