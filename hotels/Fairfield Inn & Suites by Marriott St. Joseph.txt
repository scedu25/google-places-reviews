Text: Loved our stay here. The beds are really comfortable, and each one has about three pillows of varying firmness. The staff was terrific, offering towels and umbrellas when they saw we we're headed out into the rain. Breakfast was pretty typical for a hotel, but not in a bad way. They have a make your own waffle option. The gym seemed to have all the normal options. 

Only suggestion for the staff is the check out the shower doors. Ours was totally shut, but the weather stripping didn't meet between the doors, so we had a flood on the bathroom floor each time we look a shower. Nothing a couple towels couldn't fix, but it was a bit of a surprise!

Text: Brand new place. Great staff and nice cozy and we'll finished rooms. Typical breakfast of eggs bacon breads and the like. The guys working the breakfast area were amazing. Has a small pool and no hot tub but the rooms were very nice.

Text: We stayed there for 5 nights the second week of August. The rooms were very nice and comfortable and cleaned daily. The desk staff was very helpful. The night clerk found my CPAP extension cord that I had misplaced and their day clean up crew had turned in. She had a helpful attitude and looked in several drawers. The breakfast room had really good choices. I spent early mornings there while my wife slept in. We have relatives in the city. The ladies there were very nice and accommodating. We couldn't be happier we stayed there. Kudos all around. We will be back next year.

Text: Very friendly and helpful.   Best breakfast ever had for free at a hotel.   Very clean and comfortable rooms.  Sorry we were only passing through.   Would have like to stay and used the pool and exercise room.  Also great outdoor space.   Friendly worker this morning even gave me a zip lock bag full of ice for our cooler.
