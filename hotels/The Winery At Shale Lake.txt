The Winery At Shale Lake
Rating: 5
Text: We've been coming to Shale Lake for a few years and it's absolutely our favorite winery. We have been to several other popular wineries in the area and nothing compares to the laid back atmosphere of Shale Lake. The wine and food are delicious (our favorites are the berry sangria and the pig tail bruschetta!) We stayed at the Boathouse for our wedding night and it was the cutest, most relaxing floating cabin. Waking up to the water outside our door (literally) was such a great start to our married life!
