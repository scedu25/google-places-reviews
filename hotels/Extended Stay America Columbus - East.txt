Extended Stay America Columbus - East
Rating: 4
Text: Today I visited this location and received the best customer service I've ever received. This location is clean and safe. The hotel itself isn't perfect but they make sure that all of the residents are well taken care of. Each room includes a full functioning kitchen that also has an oven. While I ended up switching locations the District Manager  provided me with the most swift and seemless transition to the new location.  I just just have to say WOW! She deserves a promotion. ??

Text: For the price it was fine. Very quiet, clean room. Pool looked nice. Super friendly front desk staff. If you are looking for The Ritz, this isn't it and you shouldn't expect it for what you pay. But my 12 year old and I felt safe and slept well.

Text: You get what you pay for: a room to sleep in with no major complaints, but it wasn't very nice. The hallway and the room smelled pretty bad, but the room seemed clean other than that. The Internet was super slow. It was nice to have a kitchen, and they allow dogs with a refundable deposit. I'd prefer to spend more money and stay somewhere nicer, but it was a fine place to stay on a budget.

Text: I'm stay here for a month so they moved some previous bookings around to accommodate my staying so long. The rooms are extremely nice and big. I have no complaints.
