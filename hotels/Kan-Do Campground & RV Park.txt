Kan-Do Campground & RV Park
Rating: 3
Text: Tight access for 34 foot travel trailer.  Shady but of course dish network wouldn't work.  Nice dog park.  Friendly staff.  Not sure when the last time my site was rented, but I foolishly hooked up the water with a filter that immediately got clogged with dirt.  I had to flush my entire water system after that.  Lesson learned the hard way.

Text: Nice lady runs this place.  Get very disappointed when the amenities parks offer can't be used. Pool was green. Lots of long term renters. Dusty roads.

Text: As we left in the morning we saw camp sites that might have been ok, however, since we only stayed 1 night,  thank heavens,  we were given the worse possible site there was.  If you stay there bring 30 feet of pvc pipe to hook up your sewer,  chain saw to cut a tree down to help level your camper so you aren't  rolling down hill while trying to sleep.  Couldn't wait to get out of there the next morning. Nice host but The worse thing about it,  as we left we saw other decent sites,  that we could have been given and they chose not to. We would have been repeat customers,  since we go that direction,  but we will never go back.
