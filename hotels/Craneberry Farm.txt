Craneberry Farm

Text: Craneberry Farm is amazing.  I buy their organic produce and salad mix bags weekly and as many black raspberry pies as I can (they go quickly) at the farmer's market.  I've visited the farm a couple times last Fall with my family and the kids loved picking their pumpkins and going on hayrides.  I referred a buddy to the owners so he could do some deer hunting last season, he said he and his son had a great trip and will be back again this season.  Highly recommended!

Text: Craneberry Farm is one of the only organic farms in Indiana. It's in Fountain County, Indiana. During the spring, Craneberry Farm has fresh lettuce and salad mix varieties and in the summer, has black raspberries, blackberries, pick your own berries, pumpkin patch, a Christmas Tree farm, and even sells pies and bittersweet. The farm is available for deer hunting on a daily basis.

Text: I visited Craneberry Farm last fall because we were looking to take the kids on a hayride.  We loved it and can't wait to go back next year and go thru the world's smallest corn maze.  The kids got to pick a pumpkin and we ended up taking a  brochure to share with my dad because they have deer hunting.  Keep up the good work Craneberry Farm- thanks for the hospitality.
