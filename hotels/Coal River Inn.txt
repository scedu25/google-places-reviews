Text: Small, icky smelling and definitely old.  However, charming,  great place for family get together and stay. Be prepared for old!  We didn't mind though.  Stayed up late and sat out on the grass and chatted the evening away.

Text: Just got back from a 3 day motorcycle trip to Boone County West Virginia. This place was the perfect spot for a dozen bikers to spend the weekend, and I can't tell you enough how amazing the people are that run the place. So helpful and friendly.

The place itself was perfect for us, and all hands were pleased with their rooms. If you're looking for the Hilton, you may want to continue the 30-40 minutes into Charleston, but it won't have the character that this place has. 

Everything was clean, A/C worked well. Fresh towels daily. Cold water in the mini fridge, TV, Coffee Maker,, at $50 a night. When I go back I know where I'll be staying.
Thanks Mrs. Underwood, you made this weekend one we'll never forget. See you next year.
