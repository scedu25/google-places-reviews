Longview Golf Course
Rating: 4
Text: Pretty nice little course hidden between Georgetown and Frankfort.  We had the first tee time of the morning and the greens were already mown and in decent shape.  Greens need to be repaired in spots and are pretty fast on the front nine...the back nine greens seemed somewhat slower.  Not a great condition course with some clover and weeds here and there but not bad for around $27. Pace of play for us was great as we were first off and finished in 3 and a half hours.  Yardages seemnpretry accurate but    my advice is to club up one club on most greens!

Text: Tough back nine and appears overplayed most times I have played there ...the older gentleman behind the counter comes off as curt and the proper apparel sign needs to come off the door

Text: Condos were nice. People there were very nice. The course is very rough. Good layout. Good greens. Maybe due to dry season?
