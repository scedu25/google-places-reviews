Hotel Wilber
Rating: 5
Text: Hotel Wilber is the historic centerpiece of the town of Wilber. It offers moderately sized rooms with a full kitchen and dining experience. There is also a full bar in the basement and a beer garden outside the hotel. WARING this hotel is not a motel 6 or your regular hotel. You cannot just pull into town and expect to get a room here. It's much more of a sight seeing building than functional.
