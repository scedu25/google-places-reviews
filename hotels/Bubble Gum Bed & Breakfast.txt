Text: We spent our wedding night here. We came in about 11:30 PM on a Saturday night, and the host was there to welcome us! They are really nice people who went out of their way to make our room special for the evening. The breakfast was amazingly delicious too! I would definitely recommend this to anyone as a great place to stay!

Text: Great cozy house with a little fireplace in the living room. 3 rooms share one bathroom upstairs. Everything in Rockville is within walking distance from here. Elaine cooked the best breakfast I've ever had at a B&B.
