La Quinta Inn & Suites Kearney
Rating: 5
Text: Clean, quiet, comfortable stay!  We stopped here as a stop on a two day drive and could not be more happy that we did.  Hotel was beautiful inside and out.  Very clean rooms, there was no road noise, or sound from other rooms.  Staff was very friendly.  Completely happy and rested.

Text: Birthday Party fun! 
Had my son's birthday party here because the other places with swimming areas were booked. Chase and a young lady at the front desk (cant remember her name) were so polite and helpful. I tied to make it as easy as possible for clean up so had pizza delivered and had a giant cookie instead of cake. The establishment was very clean and efficient for what we needed. The kids got a little noisy in the pool because of the echo and I felt terrible but they ensured me it wasnt a bother.. Would totally stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks La Quinta Inn staff.

Text: This was the nicest La Quinta that I have stayed at. The hotel looks like it is new. The front desk staff went out of their way to greet us, and even offered to help carry bags in and out if we wanted it. There was bedding left for the hide a bed without having to ask, and my daughter said the hide a bed was very comfortable. They even mailed us a card in the mail thanking us for staying with them.

This was also the first La Quinta that I stayed at that used proximity cards for the rooms, which makes it a lot easier for opening the door than the older magnetic strip cards.

Text: The best La Quinta ever?  Possibly. It has the feeling of staying in a real up-scale and expensive hotel. Reception is bright, clean, and inviting, as are the corridors and rooms. Our room was great--large and clean and nice. Some woman had a ridiculous complaint,  because staff had told her she couldn't drink in a common area she was using. I liked the way the staff employee was firm and polite, standing up to her and not letting her have her way.

Unfortunately, the next La Quinta on our travels (Cheyenne) should just be written off and burnt to the ground.
