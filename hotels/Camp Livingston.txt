Camp Livingston
Rating: 5
Text: Camp Livingston is an amazing place for kids to have fun and experience Jewish culture with others. They also learn responsibility and team work. My daughter has gone the past three years and she came back so mature and responsibly but also loved the experience that she had there. I would recommend this to anyone with children even if they're not Jewish. They practice the religious parts in fun modern ways not extreme.

Text: Simply put, Camp Livingston is one of the best places to send Jewish kids for an overnight summer camp in the United States of America. It's a place where kids can come to get to know other Jews from the Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio region. It's a place where young Jewish kids can find a Jewish identity in today's society. It's a place where people will make connections that literally last a life time, and it's a place that hundreds of kids and adults are proud to call their home away from home. I promise that any child will not be disappointed if they are sent to spend an entire summer or even a part of their summer there.

Text: Best summer camp around! I've sent my children here for years. They have always had such a great time and counted down the days to camp. The staff is well trained and obviously cares for the campers. It's not uncommon to have multiple get togethers of camp friends over the school year, despite the distance. My children have learned a lot about themselves and I can't thank Camp Livingston enough for helping them grow and stretch.
