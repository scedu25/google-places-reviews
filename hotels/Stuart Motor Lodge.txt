Text: Love it. Fairly recent remodel. Clean, comfortable and affordable. Just 2 blocks off of I-80. Cool mini fridge with separate freezer compartment (see pic) and microwave attached to it. They also have a no-locals policy, which helps keep this place free of "unwanted activities" and the ilk that often comes along with small-interstate-motel locations. Security camera monitored lot and friendly, competent staff. I was getting WiFi downloads at 13mps which for a small motel is very good. Lots of power outlets and a few USB jacks. Expanded digital basic cable and good tvs. Barbie at front desk and manager Jill were great. Would definitely stay here again, especially for the price.

Text: Very clean appears to be newly remodeled., Nice parking, gas and eating within walking distance.  Bedding seems to be dated but I would recommend for anyone traveling east or west on I80

Text: Very clean renovated rooms with a very comfortable bed. Small bottle of shampoo+conditioner provided, which was nice. Front desk was absolutely great and very friendly. Appreciated the coffee in the morning. $60 bucks for a good night's sleep.
