Great House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 2
Text: The house was how I expected because of the pictures on the website. I was very disappointed with the breakfast. There was no country ham, fruit, cereal or muffins. We ate off paper plates with plastic utensils. We had biscuits but no gravy. We had sausage both days and I am not a big sausage eater.
