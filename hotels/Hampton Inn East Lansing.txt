Text: I got a room here for my dog and I while I was on a work trip. The staff was great and welcomed both me and my dog. It was a Comfortable room but definitely not sound proofed. Heavy walkers above me and I was next to the laundry room. I would definitely come back again.

Text: Great hotel.  Stayed here one night with husband.  Great breakfast before going out to golf.  Close to restaurants, grocery stores, and gas stations.  We went to Hopcat for dinner and drinks - great place for craft beers and some delicious food!  Room was clean, hotel was quiet at night.  Met our expectations completely.
