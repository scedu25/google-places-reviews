Staybridge Suites Lincoln Northeast
Rating: 5
Text: Great place. Free hot breakfast. Large rooms with kitchenette. Fast food, grocery store, gas station, Walmart nearby. Parking lot fills up and stalls are narrow. Can't drive up to front door and double  park because of parking lot design.

Text: If you are ever in Lincoln, NE this is the place where you want to stay at. The staff goes above & beyond to make their guests happy as can be to enjoy there stay! Lucas, Vita, Alyssa, Dionte, Drew, Allison & Laura are the few that I remember from my stay who were so kind and went out of their way to make my stay one of the best stays I've had at a hotel! Merrissa & the rest of the housekeeping attendants we're outstanding! The breakfast attendant Sharon I can't forget to mention how sweet and kind she was to everyone who came down for breakfast in the morning. True hospitality lies in within this place. I will be back in the near future!

The next morning when I checked out I received the same service from the lady in charge of breakfast to the young lady checking me out at the desk..i would definitely recommend this location to anyone who needs a place to stay in Lincoln

Text: Absolutely excellent.  The management and receptionists have been so helpful during a time of family crisis.  Thumbs up!!!!  It's nice to know compassion still exists in the work place.  Lucas Arias is the best!
