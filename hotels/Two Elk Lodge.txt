Text: Super nice people and great breakfast. Nothing fancy but clean and quiet, although I suspect a little more activity during early pheasant season.

Text: We just spent four nights here on our annual Bird Hunting Trip. This is a really neat place to stay. Comfortable rooms,  the owners are very nice , it's a fun atmosphere with all the other groups of hunters there, and great food. 

If you stay here, the answer is always yes when the owners ask if you are eating dinner. You will have a great  meal for a reasonable cost. 

We are already planning to stay here next year.
