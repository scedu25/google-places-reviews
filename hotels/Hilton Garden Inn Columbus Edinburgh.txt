Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Edinburgh
Rating: 5
Text: We  had stayed over last weekend and had a wonderful experience.  The hotel was very clean and customer service was excellent.   Ray (the general evening manager) was very attentive to the needs of his guests and really went out of the way to please you. He deserves to be recognized as an outstanding associate.  We will definitely be staying here next year.

Text: Location is convenient. Close to I65, restaurants, and an outlet mall. The room was spacious, nice, and clean. There is more noise from outside of the room, than is normally expected. The walls rattled with door closings. The service and food were good. Overall, it's a comfortable place to stay.

Text: I was disappointed  in the front desk staff (not terribly  friendly).  I also booked the hotel in part because their workout area looked really nice but most of the equipment  was not functional.  The phone in the room did not work, so when I had a need to contact the front desk I had to use my cell.  Just not what I would expect from a Hilton.
