Calamus Outfitters
Rating: 5
Text: The couple that own this place were very friendly and helpful. The cabins are small but do in fact sleep 6 comfortably. The cabins are cozy and well maintained. Make sure you bring blankets, pillows, and items for cooking as those are not provided.  The view from the cabins is spectacular and with the rule of no radio after 8 it makes for a very lovely and relaxing evening under the stars. Just know that Sprint doesn't work out there which is not their fault just a general heads up.
