Key West Inn

Text: Doesn't look anything like the pictures. The rooms are funky and dungeon smelling. In some of Key West rooms at this location do not have a place for your clothes. Here at Key West you might get a room where they have NOT changed the sheets, so be sure to examine inside the covers for body hairs. The T.V. is balanced on a very unsafe table that looks like scrap from what might have once been apart of an entertainment center(most likely). The trash can was taken from Holiday Inn and the shower curtain had a purple residue on it (might have been hair dye or bleach). We had gotten extra towels from the front desk, the towels smelled like pickled eggs and vinger. Needless to say we packed up quickly and came to the motel 6, where it was only a little bit more to stay, but well worth the money.  I wouldn't even give Key West a star, it doesn't even deserve that.

Text: Good little cheap motel. The room had a rather intense smell of cleaning chemicals but it was pretty clean for the most part albeit a bit run down. The sheets were clean. No sign of bed bugs and no bites the morning after backed that up. Old school twenty seven inch time television that we didn't watch. Great place to stay for a night if you're on a budget like we were. $50 per night with a twenty dollar let deposit for cash.

Text: Dirty but not filthy. Loud guests. Severely out-dated.
