Text: Be careful this place has owed me money for my service since june 2013 it is now december 2013. They have put me off for months i've taken the time to resubmit my invoice as they asked to no avail. I personally would not stay at a place that doesn't pay their vendors, if they are short changing us, they are doing the same to their customers I will gladly remove this when you pay me!
