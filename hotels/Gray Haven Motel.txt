Gray Haven Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Its being remolded, staff is great...very friendly, rooms are clean, and good descent prices. Its under new management and its really getting cleaned up, not only cosmetic clean up, but there are no signs of drugs there. The manager is very friendly, but very tough and cracking down on drugs and the people that bring the drugs in there. I can honestly say its a safer place now for family's with children traveling or needing a place to stay for a week or so. The motel has a big back yard for children to play.

Text: I stayed in room 19.

Pros: Cozy, clean, bed's comfy, you get what you pay for, the fridge works, the staff is nice and understanding.

Cons: I saw one bug but I quickly dealt with it so no harm there and the tub is clogged with something so it filled up with water when I took a shower but it drained quickly after I got it.

NOTICE: I told one of the faculty members about the bug and she said that she hires an exterminator every two weeks to spray the rooms and they make sure to not have any bugs in any of the rooms. As for the tub, it's just old. As long as the water drained, I was happy. 

Conclusion: I liked the place. I'll stay again when I'm back in town.
