Neon Bay

Text: I love this place! Very inexpensive for what you get, the owners are very friendly people. For the location it's a quiet place. Very clean and the view is really nice. These are hard working people who offer a service at a reasonable price. I've read some of the reviews and find some of them unfair! If your looking for a inexpensive place to bring your family and enjoy the park,,,, I highly recommend it.
