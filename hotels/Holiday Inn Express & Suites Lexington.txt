Text: Stayed here on Sunday night October 29, 2017. My wife and I are very disappointed because the sink has funky smell and the bathroom/toilet bowl also has a smell. Although, it was brought to the attention of the register person the next morning, she said that she will let the housekeeping.  The breakfast food were all dry. We know that they are mostly frozen, but at least try to make it more appealing to look fresh.

Our experienced changed our  perspective of how Holiday Inn do its business.

Text: Great experience.  Dawn the hospatility host was fun and very attentive.  Lisa, our check in staff member, also provided great customer service. Lisa focused on each guest as we checked in and took the time to answer all questions. Hotel was clean, beds were comfortable, and if we pass through this way again we will stay here.

Text: I loved my room! Spacious and clean! The in-room refrigerator was a nice size.  And the freezer was able to refreeze my ice packs so I could continue on my journey with nicely chilled drinks and snacks. Plenty of outlets so I could recharge all my tech too!

Text: The lobby was clean and inviting. Our room was spacious and comfortable. We had bunk beds in the room for our kids and they loved it as much as we did. We were very impressed with the breakfast. They had good options and the attendant was amazing. She made sure everyone had what they needed. She was the best part of our experience.

Text: Absolute worst service.   Horrible breakfasts.    Untidy rooms.   Hope you do not have the displeasure to deal w Tracy.  A very short sighted sighted woman with a great deal of judgment.   The owner defends her tactics because they have had a few problems...   well hope it keeps you in biz.  Talked to other guests  who shared in my experience.   Way to be.  Owner also said she would do whatever she could..  that ended up in a 10 dollar discount...  wow.. well done.  I wish I could explain the poor service and the flip flopping that followed.   The next day I had to see Tracy again and the level of service was on par with the day before..
