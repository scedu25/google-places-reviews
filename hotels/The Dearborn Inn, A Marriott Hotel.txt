The Dearborn Inn, A Marriott Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Love how they mixed old with new in the decor keeping allot of ideas from the 40s and 50s. The grounds are beautifully kept. All the flowers and shrubbery are well maintained. This hotel even has cottages you can stay in that are inspired by historically famous people such as Edgar Allen Poe.

Text: A quaint little hotel amongst a historic area, the Dearborn was a nice place for a stay I had for a wedding nearby. The hotel was clean, fancy, and well preserved. The only issue I had was the price of the breakfast options at the hotel which were exceedingly expensive for the actual options and variety available. Everything else went great though.

Text: Stayed for a wedding, and it was rather excellent! The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious, and the shower was plenty forceful. The staff was also friendly and helpful. On the downside, the beds were mushy and cramped (though we were sleeping two to each of the double beds), and our rooms seemed awfully far away. Still, it was a pleasant experience and I'd recommend a stay.

Text: Visited this hotel for the first time for an event. The parking lot was big, grounds were kept up and hand nice flowers around. The staff were helpful in finding the area I needed to get to. Food and desserts were good. Clean rest rooms, drinks good and hotel decor was very nice.

Text: Very nice and welcoming. I was here to attend my cousin's wedding, and to stay overnight after the celebration as well. Rooms were immaculate and the view outside was amazing as well. It really does have an intimate feel with the experience. Also a full bar in the main building with a dining area as well. Staff was very friendly and even laughed at my dumb jokes. ONLY negative I could find was that the elevators seemed quite old and not as clean as they could be, but that's reaching. Would definitely recommend.
