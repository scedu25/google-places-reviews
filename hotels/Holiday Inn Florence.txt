Text: Staff very rude at front desk. Charged 25.00 on credit card without notice. Confronted staff and they said they do that to everyone. They told me my bank would put it back on card in a few days. Then, expecting to get free breakfast like everywhere else we stay, we were charged 10.00 per person. The beds was  comfortable,  but the noise outside room was busy till fairly late.

Text: Room was nice. The beds were average but the pillows we're soft. We didn't spend a whole lot of time at the hotel but it was nice while we were there. The staff was kind and helpful.
