Text: Made a late reservation by phone directly with the motel. Quick and easy. On arrival I was checked in quickly and the clerk was friendly but not personable. Room was OK, had a small fridge in it. Some hair on the shower wall and a few stains/burn mark on bedspread, but otherwise clean and odor free. If you are looking for basic accommodation at a reasonable price, no reason not to consider.

Text: Affordable, friendly, good location, and a decent place to stay. The bathroom facilities could use some upgrades and potentially better cleaning. Our shower would fill with an inch of water before you could find the right temperature setting (barely drained) and there was some possibly permanent gunk covering the sink-top. Beds are decent and windows are nice. Parking is easy and, though a bit basic, the Continental breakfast is always nice.

Text: Good hotel. Undergoing some renovations. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are clean. Breakfast is a little skimpy.

Text: It's affordable and pretty comfortable. The bathrooms are big and ours was clean. The room was clean,  so was the bed. The bed is ok. It's a cheap hotel do I didn't expect down filled mattresses but they are comfortable enough.
