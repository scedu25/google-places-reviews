Holiday Inn Express Des Moines-At Drake University
Rating: 4
Text: Location was within about 2 blocks of Drake University campus, which was absolutely preferable for our stay. Breakfast had a pretty good selection, including pancakes, omelettes, cinnamon rolls. Beds were not great, but for the price I didn't expect amazing.

Text: Spent 2 nights at this hotel. Quaint location next to Drake University. However this hotel falls short of typical HIE standards in several areas.
* It appears to be an old remodeled building where they tried to go on the cheap.
* Bathroom is tiny and outdated.
* Breakfast area is too cramped, and I wonder if the food is NOT fresh each day.
* Business office computer is in the front entry with no privacy and much too noisy to concentrate.
* Cell service is atrocious. Had to walk outside and down the block to take phone calls.
* Internet service cut out 16 times in one hour. Obviously not enough bandwidth.

On the positive side, the staff was very friendly.

Text: Not that great for the money room heat would not turn on till it was set at 75 and was still cold. Breakfast was gross just cold been there for some time.  Not the worst hotel but not the best

Text: While staff was very nice and helpful, the room was a handi-accessible room and could've had some improvements made. The bathroom door did not lock, the tv cable was missing, and the blinds wouldn't stay closed. I have stayed there before and it was wonderful, though.
