Courtyard by Marriott Springfield
Rating: 5
Text: Went to join some professionals in town for work to have some drinks at the bar. Prices were a bit high, but I expect this at any hotel bar. The service, friendliness, and prompt attention were all above and beyond. Most Courtyard hotels have this too, but this experience was one of the best! Special shout out to the bartender for above and beyond service, and heavy pours on the wine orders. ?

Text: Very pleasant, very comfortable. Quiet ~ we got a good night's sleep every night we were there. Just wish that they served a free breakfast like the Fairfield inn and some of the other Marriott franchises do. The pool could use some steps into it but a great depth for water walking if one is 5'7" or taller. Great staff!

Text: Close to many restaurants and shops (Walmart, target, Best buy) as well as a mall. The rooms are a good size and have nice showers, there's a gym and in door pool. The staff are very nice and helpful.

Text: I was very surprised that there was no safe in the room. I travel for work a lot and stay at courtyards around the country and this was a first. And the front desk safe couldn't hold a laptop. That at was shocking. Also surprised that there was no way to order a movie on TV in the room.
