Sloan's Motel Burlington
Rating: 3
Text: Sloan's was clean and comfortable and quiet. The bed was good and I slept well. The manager was friendly and helpful. Although the lighting in the bathroom was bright, the lighting in the room was too dim, and I had to bring in my camping lantern to read by. I would stay there again.
