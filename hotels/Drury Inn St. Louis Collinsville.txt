Text: I love the way this hotel smells.  It's all about the smell.  Its about the smell of the free, uh, inexpensive drinks during the happy hour.  My favorite is a spicy bloody mary which pretty much covers up the  inexpensive vodka taste.  The other great smell is the free breakfast and free happy hour hot appetizers which in a pinch can subsitute for a dinner.  For a family of fifteen kids and three adults, these small freebies represent a significant savings.  Savings always smell great and so does Drury Inn in Collinsville.  Just super smelling.  Give it a sniff today!

Text: Staff was very nice and my room was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast and dinner tasted good. I do wish the pool was larger or outside. Other than that my stay was good.
