Text: Very clean, very comfortable sheets, beautiful lobby, no breakfast but you have a communal kitchen to use with multiple refrigerators, chest freezer, and utensils. I thought that the AC units were loud. Especially when watching television you needed to either have the volume turned up or adjust it for when the AC came on and off.  Love that there was no smoking rooms available! Also loved the room keys !  It's way more convenient not to carry a card with you everywhere-  you can just put the key ring on with your car or truck and you can keep the door unlocked if your going in and out. !!  I like that more than having to swing the safety lock out.  Love it don't change that!  Staff was very welcoming and accommodating.  Awesome Rate! And very popular with boaters charging stations for boats.

Text: Yeah I would give him a three-star my only complaint didn't have too many bottom floors for anybody that's handicapped would be very hard to go up the stairs to carry luggage and go up and down the stairs other than that they're very nice

Text: Went in an emergency situation.  was put in the most disgusting room. Brought it up the the clerks attention. She was so rude. Took personal papers we found in a drawer and asked why we should be moved.  I'm pretty sure I was the only person there.   Ended up leaving 3 hours later because it was do gross.  Slept in my car.  If I could post pics I would.  I'm sure it's nice for large groups. . But I wasn't offered anything for my situation.  My sister lives in the area and tried to contact people.  Still nothing. Was horrible.
