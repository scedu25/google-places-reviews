Text: We stayed here for a hockey tournament. Great hotel right next to the rink. Full size fridge, stove top, microwave and dish washer. Dishes and utensils as well. Swimming pool and breakfast. Everything we needed.

Text: Beds are sunken in the middle. Chair worn with torn fabric. Looks clean till you look closer.  Fruit loops in the vent, refrigerator filthy on top. Any crevice was dirty. I would not recommend. Staff very friendly.

Text: My husband and I booked a room last minute because our flight kept getting delayed. This place isn't super fancy but the bed was comfortable, our room was clean, there is free WiFi and you don't need a password for it. There is a small gym that is open 24 hours. They have a decent continental breakfast. The main thing that would bring me back here is the customer service. We checked in at 2am the young lady at the front desk was very nice and accommodating. Everyone that I came into contact with was very nice. They even let us have a late checkout at no extra charge!

Text: The fact that you get a kitchenette, gym and pool was huge for me trying to stay fit while traveling.  Very friendly place, everyone greets you warmly with genuine smiles (not fake/plastic smiles).  I'll most definitely stay here again when I travel to Fort Wayne.
