Text: What a beautiful hidden gem! Did not have time to explore the whole place but the all the staff and the beach was AMAZING!  The staff was sooo friendly and they did an amazing job with all the traffic and visitors today for the eclipse!  We will definitely be back for our family camping trips this fall!
