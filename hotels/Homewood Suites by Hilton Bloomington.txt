Text: Last summer our apartment lost power (too lengthy to explain). Our apartment complex put us up here while the problem was resolved. It was AMAZING. People were extremely friendly and very accommodating.   The rooms were neat and clean, the kitchenette was fully stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans and a dishwasher. Felt like home. The best part...NO BED BUGS, because in a University town...that is important to know. I highly recommend this hotel.
