Candlewood Suites St. Louis

Text: Awesome experience! We were here for the total eclipse and every employee we spoke to was incredibly friendly despite the fact that the hotel was completely filled up. The rooms are sizeable with a full kitchen. My only concern was that our room was beside the front desk which made it kind of loud. Despite this, the convenient location and friendly service made it worthwhile. I would stay here again!

Text: Overall, the hotel could use some renovating, and I believe it is currently doing so. The rooms are fine, it's really the common areas. That doesn't take away from the experience we had. Upon check in, we were assisted by a gentleman named Greg. I feel Greg went above and beyond in making sure we were happy and comfortable. He was very friendly and helpful, and made sure we knew he would do whatever it took to get our satisfaction. The hotel offers a rental area, which offers appliances and games for no fee, just sign out and in with the front desk. The room itself was fine. It looked modern and offered everything I'd expect in one of these resident suites. Things were in working order, and everything was clean. No breakfast is offered, unlike their nearest competitor, but they make that clear. Further, there's simply no room to even host it if they wanted. Since each room offers a kitchenette and basic cooking tools, if you really want breakfast, you can make some. The furniture was comfortable and newer looking, and there are plenty of outlets around the furniture for charging your things. All in all, a great time was had, and Greg made sure of it too. We interacted 4 times for various things, including renting some board games, and each time was great.
