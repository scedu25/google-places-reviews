Text: Everything here is perfect for one night. The beds were at a great size, the murals are gorgeous, and the room that I stayed in was clean. I would recommend this to others, Stay Here ?

Text: Remote was held together with tape and needed two hands to work it. Shower turned to hot and cold at will. Towels were sand paper.

Text: Young man working at the front desk night shift was very helpful and kind. Made a long day pleasant after talking with him.  The manager of this hotel knows how to hire the best. Definitely will be coming back next time we are in town.

Text: It was a nice stay. Very clean and loved the shampoo things in the bathroom. Staff is very friendly and no smoke smelling anywhere compare to other motels. A bit far from chicago city but worth it for the price

Text: What do you really need from a hotel near the airport? For me, not much, just a place to rest my head for a short overnight in the area. Complimentary breakfast, wifi are perks that I might use in the morning before heading out. Breakfast area was a little shabby and crowded. Rooms were nicer than the hallways suggested. Parking lot has seen better days. If you're looking for quiet, this might not be the place, due to the large intersection nearby.
