Text: Place jacks you around. Tells you they are taking care of something and sending contractor. Then the contractor doesn't show. I call to let them know the contractor didn't show so they start saying oh we need paperwork to get it done. You have to come in and fill out this paper after I already went in there to take care of this should b simple problem. They don't know how to run a professional business. When a business says they are doing something then they should do it the first time you try to get it done. I'm a stay at home mom with a young child I can't be going up there 5 days a week to get something done that should already b done. I don't have time for this.
