Louisville South KOA Holiday
Rating: 5
Text: I've stayed at a few KOA campgrounds in various cabins or RV spots. This was the nicest, most well kept one I've seen. Our cabin was immaculate and it seemed no expense was spared in the construction. The outdoor furniture is made of Rex, virtually indestructible! They've really got it together here and we will gladly stay here again. My only suggestion for improvement would be to put markers on the road with the number of the cabin or site to make it easier to find in the dark upon arrival.

Text: The only place to stay in greater Louisville.  The staff was extremely helpful.  We had full hook up with 50 AMP.  We stayed five nights as we had an event in Louisville.  Not close to downtown especially during rush hour.  Bathroom were clean and the campgrounds were kept nicely.  Many activities for kids should that be the case.  The place was a bit on the expensive side but being the only game in town it is supply and demand.  We have stayed here before and will likely return.

Text: Been coming here since I was a kid, and it's still a great family place to visit. I wish they'd keep the catfish pond clean and stocked, but everything else here is fantastic. Kids and dogs love it here!

We met Jersey at check in and then D took very good care of us the whole wkend. Such a fun, warm person.  Thanks and we are planning a much larger reunion for summer 2018.

Text: Our stay was awesome.  The campers at 200 were the best! They helped us set up camp on friday then take down on Sunday.  Our God is good.
