Riversedge Campground

Text: The employees were very nice.
Our reserved campsite wasn't a campsite.
By the time we finally worked out a new site, we had to setup in the dark.
The new camp site was not large enough for two tents(which we had reserved a site for 2 tents) so we had to setup in the field behind our campsite.
The canoe leaked and we had to constantly dip out the water.
When we told the people in the office they were very sorry for the poor experience but offered no compensation.

Text: This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced while floating. First we were given a raft that had been patched and not well and deflated at our first stop off. Then when we called them to let them know about the raft we had to ruin 2 miles of the float to make sure we can meet them to get a new one. The guy at the raft switch said he would give us all a free float but wrote only 1 raft so it didn't matter to them that all of our time was ruined. Then when I called the next morning trying to be the grown up since i was drunk and didn't want to be rude all the lady could say to me was you were suppose to come in last night and he wrote one down. Not even a sorry to me. I would not recommend anyone to spend their money here. Oh and on top of it this was for my 30th birthday.
