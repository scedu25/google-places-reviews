Candlewood Suites Salina
Rating: 5
Text: I loved everything about this place. The check-in was quick and easy and the staff was amazing (especially Joanie). I was there visiting my son in college and wanted to cook him some home cooked meals so the kitchenette is what attracted me to this hotel and it was perfect. They had everything we needed from toaster oven to wine openers and we even checked out a few games to have family game night. This will definitely be my home while visiting him in the future.

Text: A pleasant surprise after days on the road. Friendly staff. Clean comfortable room. This town has some really dodgy hotels. They post great photos on the interwebs to lure you in like a gnat to a spider's web. Don't be a gnat. Stay at motels with loads of good reviews. I would let my dear old mother stay at Candlewood. Small kitchenette if you have time to cook.

Text: Hotel itself was very nice. Rooms are big and spacious and price is good. The room itself smelled like weed however. Staff needs to watch things a bit more closely and air out the rooms before rerenting them.
