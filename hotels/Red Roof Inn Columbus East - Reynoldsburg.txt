Text: Horrible experience, and I didn't even stay there. On the site it showed "BOOK NOW" for 20% off if you book more than 1 night. Upon check out on their site, the prices kept changing. I called to book over the phone and explained the situation, their attendant spoke to me as if I was dumb deaf and blind. I explained to him the situation and offered to send him a pic of what I was seeing. While on the phone the prices changed from what I initially saw to something higher. Rather than honoring what I saw he debated with me. On to the next! finding a hotel else where.

Text: Rooms are great for the price, every other hotel was booked. Very surprised on how clean the room was and how quiet it was. Thought it would be a run down hotel and was a little nervous to book on my phone. Not bad at all, I would stay again

Text:  They charge almost as much as the higher class hotels. They also now require a cash deposit. Ridiculous.
 The staff are not friendly. They will knock on your door at least four times in the morning before check-out time. I even had one lady actually open the door and walk into my room while I was sleeping naked.
 Another time I stayed there a man claimed that there was a piece of plastic broken off of the fridge which I never used or even so much as opened.
 The rooms are trashy and that is putting it nicely. The customer service is horrible. I would not recommend anybody stay here.

Text: It's a good place to stay for the price. The room was reasonably clean. I am giving 4 stars primarily because of the receptionist. I had forgotten my mobile charger in the room after checking get out. He called me to inform  me about this. That's good customer service.

Text: Last time I stayed here was in the first building, second floor. And it wasn't too bad, maybe a 3.5 star. This time I'm not impressed with much. Back building, first floor.
