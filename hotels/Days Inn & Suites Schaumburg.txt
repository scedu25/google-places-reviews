Text: Overall service was very good. I was disappointed in the fact that they have a pool and was told new ownership has no plans for opening it back up any time soon. But location is great with many options from food and shopping and convenient to Interstates.

Text: This was a relatively nice budget hotel. It was much cheaper than hotels in Chicago. It was relatively clean but could use some updating. Breakfast was long which was nice.
