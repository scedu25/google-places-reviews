Text: Horrible conditions! Stay away from this place while you can because they take your money before showing you the conditions unfit for humans! After you see the monstrosity of this place and ask for a refund because you are incapable of staying here, they say "sorry no refunds". There are bugs in the rooms, no restrooms, the toilets are broken, there is no toilet paper, there is no soap, the key cards don't even open the doors to the rooms, there is nothing here that can define "descent conditions". The employees are more than well aware of these conditions and simply do nothing about it but trick people into buying a room. This place made me leave all angry and disappointed. I will never come here again! This place is worse than living in the conditions in India!!!!! HORRIBLE PLACE! THEY SHOULD CLOSE IT DOWN BECAUSE THEY WILL RUN OUT OF BUSINESS SOONER OR LATER! IF THERE WERE RATING STARS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE, MY RATING WOULD BE FAR ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!

Text: I've stayed in some awful hotels before, but this was by far the worst.  The pool obviously hadn't been used in a very long time, but guests still had access to it.  There was a layer of scum on the water.  
Breakfast consisted of coffee and bananas.  The deadbolt on our door didn't work.  The light bulbs in the room were so dark that I had to bring in a flashlight to see anything.  Looking back on it, it was probably done on purpose so you couldn't see how dirty the room was. I tried to get a can of soda from the vending machine, but it wasn't plugged in.  I slept in my clothes on top of the bedspread. Oh, and be careful going down the stairs outside.  Half of them are loose.  Simple a horrible experience.  Someone suggested that I look for bedbug bites, but I don't think even bedbugs would stay at this dump. How can the health department allow this place to be open? 
I had to pick a star to post.  If I had a choice, I'd give it a negative rating.

Text: There was a dead bug in our bathroom the aircondioner didn't work and couldn't shower because there was no pressure oh and the best part was we were told about the heated indoor pool, when we went to check it out it hasn't worked in who knows how long. This place should be shut down its nasty.

Text: Broken sign. Broken pool. Broken AC. Dead bugs in room. Towels in room are still damp. There seems to be a wasp problem. It's not the worst place in the world, but corporate should do something.
