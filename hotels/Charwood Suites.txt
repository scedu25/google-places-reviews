Text: A great place to stay, short term or long term.  Why stay in a hotel when you can get an apartment.  Convenient to I-65... quiet location just two to three minutes away.  Friendly staff.  The rooms are nicely appointed, full kitchen, dining area, living area and bedroom.  All the amenities, pool, fitness center and laundry areas.
