Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed in room 235. Had a couple issues with a room and elevator. But front desk took care of us promptly. Stayed here a few times now. And the location is great. Close to everything. Easy access to airport and highways.

Text: Clean rooms, comfortable, sleeping, the service was impeccable from the gentleman taking our reservation to the clerk that checked us in. Making the reservation they.  wanted to make sure we had any extra amenities we would need ready for us.. Cindy actually had us follow her out to our next destination instead of trying to explain where to go. They went above and beyond on the service.

Text: This is one of the nicest Courtyards I've stayed. The staff was spectacular. We were surprised with comp breakfast. The room was spectacular. Breakfast was made to order, the pool was great. Shuttle was on time and fantastic. Will stay here anytime I need a place in Kansas City

Text: The hotel is easy to see from the highway and set back enough to avoid traffic noise. There's a bar and counter for food as you would find at most Courtyards today. They have a small snack selection and toiletries if you've forgotten anything. Food options are a bit limited overall if the hotel isn't your scene. There's a Ruby Tuesday's next door, a Waffle House, Wendy's and if you're looking for southern cooking - Cracker Barrel. The hotel rooms are comfortable and clean, the people are very friendly and helpful. I'd stay here again if I needed to be close to the airport here in KC, MO.

Text: Very clean, great little bistro in the lobby. Was just in for a night, but a really comfortable stay. Several good restaurants easily close by for walking. Would go back to stay again
