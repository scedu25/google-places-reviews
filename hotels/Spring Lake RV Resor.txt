Spring Lake RV Resor
Rating: 5
Text: Beautiful well kept rural RV park. Quiet area. Will stay here again, if we are in the area. This time we only stayed one night, but folks we talked to say the weekends have activities planned.

Text: Nice location, nice people. Good location not too far off the I-35 corridor for the snowbirds.

Text: Spring Lake was a perfect overnight stay on the way to Colorado. The playground was very nice for our kids and it was very peaceful. Bathrooms could use a little updating, but you cannot beat it for the price. We definitely would recommend it.

Text: This used to be great country campground but now has serious clean water issues. We had dark brown water and had to change filter every three days! Not convinced it was safe! Sites not level and full of water after rains. Couldn't even get from vehicle to door without walking through water. Man mowing with riding mower threw rock and cracked truck window.  Owner didn't appear to address issues so left early. Don't plan on returning.

Text: Awsome campground near Wichita. Hope they have fixed the water problem. The water has a broken pipe in the pump house allowing dirt and debris in the water. The county would shut them down if they don't fix it. BAD WATER!! DON'T DRINK!! Also the dirt gets in your rv pipes.
