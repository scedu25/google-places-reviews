Text: Fabulous winery and service. Easy to have a conversation with owners, and the wines are of excellent quality. A gem of northeast KS.

Text: This place is a gem.  We arrived and didn't know if they were open, it was so quiet and we were greeted as if they had been waiting for us.  We will be back to stay at the bed and breakfast!
