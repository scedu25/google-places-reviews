Text: Great room for my wife's needs. The staff was very friendly at the bar. The atmosphere was great at happy hour. One thing to note: the square plates are above the food at breakfast. Easy to miss, and I was one of many that missed them !

Text: The staff seems friendly. But let me start off by saying they over change you for you room. They made me wait 40 minutes to get a room because they couldn't find my reservation then they told me they would price match but once I checked my bank account they changed me $100 a night. Now if the place was nice and clean and worth the $100 I wouldn't mind but the place is disgusting the back doors lock you out consistently forcing you to walk around the building, the rooms have the worst layout (good luck trying to get out of the toilet once your in). Overall this place need alot of work and I he staff needs to stick to their word when they tell you the so called "final price"

Text: Took the kids for a birthday swim. Situated in the far west suburbs of Chicago and located close to I-88 this hotel was very easy to get to. Room was clean and spacious though the bathroom was a little tight. The in-hotel bar fixes a mean drink.
