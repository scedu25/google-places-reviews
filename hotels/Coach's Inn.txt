Text: We arrived around 3 in the morning and could tell it was rough but we just needed sleep. A quick look around as we immediately tossed the pillows from the bed and we were uncomfortably closing our eyes. ONLY TO WAKE IN THE MORNING AND DISCOVER.....BLOOD STAINED SHEETS, BED BUGS, BLACK MOLD IN THE BATHROOM, HAIR AND GRIME ALL OVER!

THE ONLY THING 5 STAR ABOUT THIS MOTEL WAS THE BEDBUGS MEAL LAST NIGHT! THEY EVEN TRIED TO COME HOME WITH US IN OUR OWN PILLOW! HOW DISGUSTING!

When I approached the man at the front he wouldn't acknowledge my complaint and told me to leave. I called the magistrates office for a FULL REFUND OF OUR 75 DOLLARS even though their advertised price was 54 DOLLARS.

The health department was notified and I sent over pictures to them and they will be investigating Monday!

Do NOT give these people ANY money!

Text: The room was nasty. They need maids that know how to clean, I mean my 12 year old can clean better than they can. They left dirty towels on the floor the toilet wouldn't flush and I couldn't sleep because I felt like had something crawling all over me.
