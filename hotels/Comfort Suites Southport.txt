Comfort Suites Southport

Text: The staff and hotel were very nice.   Lynnette (?) is a keeper.  She was the pleasant welcome a tired traveler could use and helpful in suggesting area restaurants.   All staff members were very nice and welcoming to their guest.  I greatly appreciated the housekeeping services for taking time to get our room situated very quickly without interrupting our stay.   My only wish, would be for a better selection of breakfast offerings, as it seemed very limited, but that's just me.   It definitely didn't impact our stay or view of this hotel.
We definitely will stay here again in the future.

Text: Stayed here a few times now, never had any real problems. Rooms are clean, and big! Staff is friendly and helpful. The internet wasn't working well my last visit, but it was the first time I had that issue. I'm sure I'll be back there!

Text: Hotel was nice upon arrival. Facilities were nice, bed was comfortable. Bathroom was clean, but sink was in need of replacement. During our stay there was a problem with housekeeping. It was reported to the front desk, they were friendly and apologetic and said they would look into it. No one cleaned our room during our stay. Breakfast was good and had lots of options. Pool was closed one day due to chemical imbalance. Some noise was heard through the walls at night. If you are a light sleeper, take ear plugs or have a noise making app on your phone. Overall a good experience. But not excellent.
