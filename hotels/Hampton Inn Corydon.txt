Hampton Inn Corydon
Rating: 5
Text: Hampton Inn - Corydon, In is amazing. The staff have to be hands down the friendliest most accommodating people I have ever met. Their entire mission in life is to take care of their guests. The hotel is clean and comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and the entire area feels very safe. Great stay. Thank you.

Text: Staff was very nice, place was clean and bed was comfortable.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars for 2 reasons. 1st they took out the hottub and when it was mentioned at booking they didn't tell me it was gone.  2nd it was a holiday weekend and there was construction work being done to the outside of the building.  They did wait until 8am to wk but sometimes we sleep in and couldn't.

Text: We stayed just this weekend, lots of construction on outside causing limited parking. We checked into our room that was nice but smelled light someone had chain smoked in it. Told the front and nothing was said other than we will make note of that. Then to be woken up on a Sunday to construction workers right outside our window banging on the walls. Was not super impressed with our stay at all.

Text: There is work being done at the entrance currently and lots of workers staying at the hotel so it is loud. Rooms are very clean and nice. Bed was comfortable and I felt safe in the location. Staff was very friendly and the breakfast was good. I stay here almost monthly for work and have no issues and highly recommend.
