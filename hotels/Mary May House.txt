Mary May House
Rating: 5
Text: We had a wonderful stay at the Mary May House! DeeDee and Howard were very welcoming. The house is charming and full of history, which is just what we were looking for! The accommodations were comfortable and we felt right at home! We were within walking distance of several restaurants, boutiques, a bakery, and a newly opened bar. It was nice to stretch our legs and walk around town, it's not hard to see why it's a popular stop on The Bourbon Trail! We had breakfast at Mammy's which was delicious!

Text: They now give each person a $10.00 voucher for breakfast instead of a Continental breakfast, which can be used anywhere in town.

Text: Room was very nice and the bar downstairs was fun although a bit noisy from our room). My only complaint is that there wasn't a real breakfast, just donuts & fruit left in our room.
