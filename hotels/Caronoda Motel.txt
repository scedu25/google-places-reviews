Caronoda Motel

Text: Stayed here after sitting in traffic for 4 hours and only going 50 miles after the Eclipse on the 21st.  The room did the job, gave us a place to stay and sleep until traffic cleared out.  Not the cleanest, the stuff was still in fridge from the prior guest.  Everything else was sold out!  And this place sold out 45 minutes after we checked in.....would have liked a different place, but it did the job......but yes very old and dated.

Text: I loved it for what it was..a small rural town...only 4 hotels...my room 333 was very clean well maintained..higer calber than I expected for a small town and it apperance/percrption from the road (like an updated red roof/ super 8/motel 6)...very quiet...plenty of food variety and a 24 hr diner all walking. Safe clean place to stop and rest while on the road at a good value.

Text: It is the most dirty rooms I have every been in. The owners are very rude and I ask for a smokers room, but got an non-smoking room. Took a towel off the rack and the rack fell down. I only stay the one night and move to another motel the next day.

Text: Not only are the Indians who work there the rudest people I've ever met but as I was gathering my things to check out I found a DIRTY SYRINGE BEHIND MY BED! I lost my ecig and was trying to find it so I pulled out the bed thinking maybe it had fallen behind there when I saw a dirty needle!!!!!!! See photos for proof!!!!  That's if they'll actually allow it. All the photos they have are doctored anyway. Looks like they need to clean better too! What if a child had found this or someone got stuck by it!
