IHG Army Hotels- Candlewood Suites
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed here for just over a month.  The staff is incredibly helpful I had a couple of issues pop up with my card and my orders and they handled both expertly.  The breakfast is top notch especially on biscuit and gravy with sausage patty day.  The rooms are very clean with a small kitchen and refrigerator including a dishwasher.  The front desk is very friendly and always says hello and makes you feel welcome I would give 6 stars if I could!

Text: Hands down the best hotel we've stayed at on an army post! Customer service was excellent. Our room was perfect for our family. Hubby and I had a bedroom and the Kids slept in the living room.  Our 11 day stay here made our transition to Kansas much easier.

Text: I really enjoyed this stop on our trip across the country. We got a suite with our rewards for the single night we were there. I had laundry to do and if there was one bad thing about the place it was the washers and dryers. They had preset settings for your laundry and I need specific setting for some of my clothes. There was plenty of detergent left over from other folks so it was nice not having to use my own for once. There was a lending closet which my husband borrowed DVDs from. Even though I told him not to since we were going to be on the road early and he'll fall asleep during the first movie (which he did). We had a wonderful breakfast with a yummy variety of food. We typically try to swim while we are at the hotel but it was a closed outdoor pool (this is Memorial Day Weekend).Beautifully kept lawn with a nice large pet walking area next to the hotel. I also love how the staff are in fun t shirts and jeans! And the suite we stayed in had it's own room so we got some privacy while our son slept in the living room.
