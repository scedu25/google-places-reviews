Comfort Inn & Suites Eastgate
Rating: 5
Text: This was my first stay at any Comfort Inn hotel and I was very pleased with my stay. This is a non-smoking hotel. There is not an attached restaurant but many restaurants within one mile of the hotel. My party had four rooms and no complaints.

PROS
*Very clean (room, bathroom, halls, lobby, breakfast area, pool)
*Friendly customer service
*Kids loved the indoor swimming pool (good for younger & older children) (approximately 3-5 ft.)
*Towels available in pool area
*Plenty of hot water
*Small laundry mat area available for a fee
*Tasty breakfast with hot & cold food and beverages
*Located near shopping centers & restaurants
*Reasonably priced to comparable hotels in the area
*Ice machines on multiple floors
*Free parking
*Rooms were quiet even facing the road
*Good air circulation and temperature control

CONS
*None

BOTTOM LINE
*If traveling through this area again, I would highly consider staying at the Eastgate Comfort Inn without hesitation. It had everything I was looking for in a hotel. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in a clean hotel.

Text: I would give no stars but it will not allow me. Had the pool and hall reserved for a pool birthday party and everything planned and invitations made. Was told I was booked three times and then a manager said I could not have due to dust from renovations.  But that guests could use the pool.  What a disappointment for my son for his 7th Birthday.  Manager was very unprofessional and not helpful at all.  Would not recommend to anyone.

Text: Place looked clean at first until I woke up at midnight horribly itchy. So I ripped all the sheets off and didn't find anything until I took the pillows out of their cases and sure enough  BEDBUGS!!! I scraped 3 of them into a plastic cup and gave them to the front desk girl. We left and got a different hotel. The manager calls the next day and says he will not refund our money because they weren't bedbugs they were early stage stink bugs. I've traveled at my job for 10 years and I've never seen stink bugs bite and leave huge red marks all over your body.

Text: The room was a nice size and fit my family well. However there were two things that lost the two stars for me. 1: The person who checked me in told me there were no roll away cribs in the hotel, even though the guest services book stated that they do have them and they are available at the property. I had to bring this to the attention of the clerk. The response that I received from her was that this was her first time alone at the desk, so she would have the overnight clerk give me a call at 11pm when he arrived. I had to wait until almost midnight before I could put my 2 year old autistic daughter to bed. 2: The air conditioner frequently shut off and leaked all over the carpet. I let the clerk know about it in the morning when I checked out, but all I got was a "I will have maintenance check it out later today when he arrives." I didn't get an appology or anything. By all accounts this was probably one of the only bad stays I have ever had in a Choice hotel. I frequently stay at their properties.
