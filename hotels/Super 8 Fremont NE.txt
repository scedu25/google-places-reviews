Text: Though it may not be fancy, accommodations were perfect for my overnight stay. Very clean and comfortable room. Zach was friendly, interacted very well and was helpful throughout. He recommended where to get an affordable meal and was on target with suggestions. I would go back.

Text: They said the system froze so it took a while to get a room. Then finnaly they fixed the problem and I signed for the room they told me it was 70 plus tax so it came out to $82 for one room two beds. When we checked out in the morning the same guy asked me to sign a paper because they had me sign the wrong paper but what he didn't say was they charged me more that's why he needed me to sign this different paper so it came out to be $92.79. Don't stay here they are liars!!!!! And the rooms are not nice.
