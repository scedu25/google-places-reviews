Text: Terrible service. Filthy sheets. Roaches and bed bugs. Rude hotel manager. Should be shut down immediately by health department. Keep your  money do not waste it at this ROACH MOTEL.  I gave one star because that's the only way i could do a review. No Stars from me at all.

Text: Deceivers! At the settlement, with the chief manager, there was a five-fold eviction at eight o'clock in the evening of the next day. At 11 am, the same chief manager said to pay another $ 40. Sucks, write down everything on the recorder or on the signature.
