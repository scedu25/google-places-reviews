Cooper Motel

Text: The motel is a place to sleep that's all if you are brave enough to sleep next to a cemetery. No real pillows, remote fell apart while using, had to replace the batteries in the remote, remote for a.c. doesn't work at all, powerstrips on the wall, and no insulation. They are cheap and pet friendly with a $10 a pet fee.
