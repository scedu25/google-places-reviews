Text: Camping spaces have lots of room, the pond used to be good to fish from but this year it was full of dense moss making it hard.

Text: 2017 Memorial Day weekend our family and friends came back to share the weekend with each other. We have all stayed at Melvern Outlet campground many times before. We mostly LOVE this place. Playgrounds close, hiking trails, paved trails, clean showers and in the past fishing from our campsite. This year the fishing in the pond was awful. a few perch were caught but the pond is so full of moss that nothing was biting.    Please do something to change this Corps of Engineers. It is what brought us back year after year. Now, next Memorial day we are looking for other places to camp.

Text: We camp at the Melvern Outlet several times a year.  It is one of our favorite places.  Very relaxing.  Also, enjoy going to the church service at the pavilion.

Text: The 2017 Summer was a summer spent swimming at Lake Melvern.  It is clean, well maintained, and a well kept secret.  The volunteers made it safe and definitely worth the drive down from Topeka.

Text: Great place to camp. Very clean, staff does a great job with upkeep and maintenance. Campsite #25 is close to the water and has great views of the sunset.
