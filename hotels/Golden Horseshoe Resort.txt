Golden Horseshoe Resort
Rating: 5
Text: If you're looking for a resort where there is lake front views with clean rooms, an extremely clean swimming pool, a hot tub with a beautiful view of a quiet and serene cove with top notch hospitality from the owners, GOLDEN HORSESHOE RESORT is the resort to stay at.    This was the first time staying at the GOLDEN HORSESHOE and it won't be the last.   We can't wait to go back and we just hot home.   Kevin was a huge help right when we got to the resort.  He helped us put our boat in the lake, unhooked our trailer from our truck and parked our truck.  We didn't even ask,  excellent service by Kevin and Becky.   Keep up the good work!!?

Text: We love it here.  We stayed here in the past for several years in a row.  It's  located in a quiet cove off the main channel.  No need to worry about your boat getting beat up by waves.  You can see your boat from any room at the resort.

Text: We stayed here over the 4th of July. We've stayed a couple places on the lake and this is by far our favorite. We stayed in room #13. It was clean and had more than enough space for 2 people. The owners are very nice and willing to help if needed. This resort is much quieter than any resort we've stayed at and really has a family feel. The swimming pool is nice and so are the docks. We will definitely be back.

Text: I spent 4 nights at the Golden Horseshoe and was great.Room was clean,bed was firm and the pool was sparkling. Kevin also helped me launch my boat and take it out of the water. People  who complain,should go ahead and spend  $180 + per night if they want a nicer place! This place is priced fairly  for what they offer! Great for family.

Text: Had a great time this weekend at the resort. Check in was super quick and both the owners were super friendly, and polite. Also came in handy they sold worms in the office. Quite place to relax and lay back. Plenty of light on the docks for night fishing (bring light up bobbers) and don't forget floaties for the lake if you swim off the docks. Only complaint would be the water pressure in the shower, I have thick curly hair so it was a pain. But overall I Highly recommend it!
