The Ashley Inn At Meadow Lake Equestrian Center

Text: There are not enough words to describe the beauty that is the Ashley Inn. Looking back on our wedding day, our favorite decision in the process was picking this venue. From the very first moment my husband and I stepped foot on the premises, we knew we had to get married there. The Ashley Inn, was THE perfect backdrop for our most favorite day. There are multiple locations to get married at this venue, in front of the gorgeous inn, in front of a pond with a weeping willow, and a grove area that is also beautiful. The hardest part was deciding which one we wanted more, because we loved ALL the options. Not only is it beautiful, but Ashley Inn is staffed with THE most kindest and most helpful staff. One staff brought one of the horses to me, while we were taking pictures, and I have sweet pictures with him. Melissa helped us and celebrated with us more than we could have ever asked for. We love the Ashley Inn and are so thankful for our experience with them.

Text: I had my wedding ceremony and reception here back in 2013. They were very accommodating and helped us prepare for everything. During our ceremony, a rain storm pounded on us right at the announcement of husband and wife. About a couple hours later, at nightfall during the reception, a tree branch fell on one of the power lines that powered the entire property. We were able to get a generator and the staff was extremely helpful the entire time. I'd definitely recommend booking your event with them. Plus, the grounds are gorgeous. Was a great backdrop for our wedding photos.

Text: What an amazing facility. The Ashley Inn is hands down the most stunningly beautiful, picturesque wedding venue in Kentucky. If you are looking for exceptional service with serene vistas at every turn then this is the place for you. Highly recommended for bed and breakfast travelers too. The breakfast is soooooo delicious and the beds are beyond comfortable. Cannot say enough great things about this place. My time at the Ashley Inn was an incredible experience.

Text: Absolutely the most beautiful event venue in the Bluegrass! It's tucked away in the rolling hills of Central Ky,  just far enough from Lexington to feel like you are getting away, but close enough to still feel connected. The Inn is historic and beautiful, but the grounds and outdoor facility are spectacular!  I hope to attend more functions here, in the future!! Seems like it would be nice for more than just a wedding. I could easily see using them for an Anniversary Party, Baby Shower, Birthday Party,  Corporate Event, Engagement Party, Graduation, or Holiday Party.

Text: I stayed at The Ashley Inn recently while on a business trip, and it was the perfect place for me to unwind and get an authentic taste of Kentucky - right in the heart of the Bluegrass. I stayed in the 'Tara' suite, one of 6 rooms, overlooking a view of half the property's 135 acres. I LOVED the Inn's decor, private bathrooms with clawfoot tubs (and the cutest tile!), and of course the complimentary breakfast. I really enjoyed walking around the property in the evening surrounded by flowers, fireflies, and of course the horses. The sunset on their pond surrounded by weeping willows was gorgeous! I can see why the Inn is also a coveted wedding venue. I was even able to take horse riding lessons right there on the property at The Meadow Lake Equestrian Center. I was a little nervous since I've never really been around horses, but I felt confident with the instructors and I immediately felt at ease. I fell in love with it right away! The staff was super friendly and also helpful with suggestions of what to do during my free time. I checked out The Bourbon Trail and The Shaker Village per their advice, and both were definitely worth it. The owners plan to offer tours to both venues in the future, which would be a treat. What a pleasant surprise to find this gem just outside of Lexington for such a great price. It would be the perfect place for a Kentucky staycation, a holiday getaway, or an artist's retreat. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in the area!
