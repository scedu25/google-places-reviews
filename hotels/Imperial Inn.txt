Text: Im quite comfortable here. Room is clean, staff is friendly. Other guests dont seem to be too loud. Cameras around property help me feel safe. Only bummer is cant just easily walk into town unless i want to walk 8-10 blocks to get to downtown, had to drive down to downtown. But i can be lazy, so this may not be an issue for many.

Text: Don't know why reviews, put this at 2.6, very clean, and some big name singers have stayed here, have seen bigger named hotel chains look a lot worse. They have truck parking, just have to park where they want you, that's all. Cameras everywhere,  safe.

Text: Book early, especially during a busy weekend, like the county fair. They also still have smoking rooms, if you are in to that.
