Pounds Hollow Recreation Area

Text: A great picnic area. We've only visited it out of the season around September. It's so close to the campsite and it offers great views and recreation areas for kids and adults.

Text: This is quickly becoming a new favorite spot! Cheaper than anything else around our area, $10.00 freaking bucks a night for primitive or electric!!!!....I know! Right...very  chill spot to bring kids,and the dogs. plenty of sites..FYI if you camp at the electric sites where you pay your camping fee's,  there is a TRAIL  at the end of the run, at the "one way turn about" that leads to the beach..your welcome lol.. I found it the hard way.. beautiful place. They're expanding the camping area with beautiful sites..I definitely will drive the extra miles to go back, you will not be disappointed. Make sure you bring plenty of supplies because the nearest place to re-up is around 14 miles..there is water and restrooms picnic tables and fire pit/grill.  NO pets allowed at the beach & must be leashed at all times for good reason, our spaniel took off after a deer & had to leave home behind. some nice woman picked him up the his first day missing, and we left flyer's to hopefully get home back & thank goodness we did.so keep your dogs on a short leash..it was the worst leaving without him we searched and searched for 2 days but he was picked up his first day missing.. uhg!! Just thankful we have him home!!

Text: Great place to camp, it has a lot more sites and is better than garden of the gods but is still nearby

Text: This was a little side stop on my weekend getaway with my husband, we didn't have very long to stay because we had to get back to our kiddos, but we really enjoyed stopping here! We plan to take our kids here with us next time we visit!

Text: This is such a nice place for a hike with the family or friends for a quiet trail. Especially in the fall when all of the leaves are changing! It's kind of hidden, I hadn't heard of it before until I stumbled upon it. It's near Garden of the Gods, and I would recommend spending the day to enjoy both!
