Text: The staff is the reason that this place gets 5 stars.  If you want a water slide and a gourmet breakfast this isn't the place you want.  If you want a very clean room, comfortable beds and a friendly, very helpful staff then this is where to go.  It is an older motel that could use updates, but to me these things aren't very important.
