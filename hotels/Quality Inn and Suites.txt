Quality Inn and Suites
Rating: 3
Text: For the price Quality Inn was a decent place to stay. As always fridge and microwave in room, which was nice. The hotel was nice to look at and the lobby was updated, however, the rooms themselves seemed to be dated and a bit damp. Overall not a terrible stay, but i will be looking at other places next time I am in town.

Text: Very good value for the price of the room and facility. Clean room & bath. Facility is well maintained. Pleasant staff. Convenient to retail and restaurants. Easy to locate off I - 270 and Hwy 23 north exit in Worthington, OH. I will stay at this location again.

Text: I found this Quality Inn to be clean and adequate - a no-frills place to stay at a reasonable price.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Please note, however, that they actually do NOT have an exercise room.

Text: Good value for the price. Lobby is renovated and rooms are also not too old. 

Rooms do have typical carpet smell, but as I said value for money.

Text: I didn't get to stay in the hotel because they were booked, which was fine, but the front desk associate was one of the nicest employees I've ever met at any hotel. I'm moving to Columbus in the near future and she took time out of her day to tell me where to avoid and where to look at and had wonderful patience through all of it, because of course I didn't know any of the areas she was mentioning! It helped me a lot in my search and I will forever be grateful for her kindness
