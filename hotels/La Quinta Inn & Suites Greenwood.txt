La Quinta Inn & Suites Greenwood
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is a great value for the money! They have a great indoor pool and a free buffet breakfast every day. The employees are all very helpful and my room was spotlessly clean. There is nothing that I can complain about. If you need a hotel away from the Indianapolis traffic, make sure to check this one out!

Text: The rooms were clean and check out time was at 12:00 so that was a nice change considering most places these days make you check out by 11:00. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The location was conveniently located around any and everything you could possibly need. We would definitely stay there again.

Text: Easy to access, good parking, renovated, huge room. We reserved the only large apartment sized room in the hotel. It was much larger than expected. Very comfortable especially traveling with family or dogs. It would have been five stars except for some cosmetic touches in the room. Broken bathroom light, tears on the cloth chairs, and an open outlet on the wall. Room also included a jetted bathtub that we did not use only because we did not have the time.
