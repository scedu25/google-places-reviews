Boots Court Motel
Rating: 5
Text: The Boots Court is amazing. Double beds, beautifully staged rooms. You can see the care the owners took in restoring this landmark. Shower, no tub. No tv but "A radio in every room." Reno is still underway. Would love to come back when it's completed. Carriage Family Resturant around the corner good place for food since there is no Mic in room.
