Text: We camped for the weekend and they put us next to a shelter. They were nice in the office and the campground was nice,  the bathrooms were clean but they had rented that shelter out on Saturday.  ...they were seasonal ppl and we're rude ppl and their kids were running threw our campsite and they stayed all day.  The office didn't do anything or offer us anything for their mistake.  I don't think we will go back
