Baymont Inn & Suites St. Joseph/Stevensville
Rating: 5
Text: Real quality at the best price in the area.  This is our 3rd night.  Service is great.  Breakfast is really good.  Cleanliness is refreshingly great.  We'll stay here again every time we're in the St. Joseph area. ?

Text: Dirty, was mold in my room, window screen was bent and torn. They had a plastic pipe in the window so you couldn't open it, because it was broken. Put my suitcase on luggage rack and the leg cover broke. Unfortunately I was obligated for 2 nights, as they wouldn't refund my money. Had to wash all of our clothes at the next motel to get the musty smell out. Will NEVER stay at a Baymont Inn again. Oh and indoor pool was freezing. Asked them to turn it up and they said it was warm enough. WOW

Text: Not the worst hotel my family and I have stayed at, but this location is not up to the standard amenities of modern lodgings. We were hoping for better cleanliness, organization, service, and accommodation at the price point offered. This hotel is in need of renovations and maybe an adjustment of staff and management. As is the usual state of affairs in Stevensville, we don't expect much to change but do not plan on returning to this establishment in the future.

Text: Room smelled a little musty. It was a decent room if you are just looking for a place to sleep late at night. The included bfast was decent, hard boiled eggs, waffle maker, cereal, bagels, and other pastries.

Text: Room was fairly clean but the air was not turned on during a 90 plus degree day. When asking the front desk we were told it was off to save money per management. I would stay again but be aware of financial cut backs at the cost of the guest
