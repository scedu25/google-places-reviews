Red Roof Inn & Suites Columbus - West Broad
Rating: 4
Text: I stay at a lot of red roof inns and this was one of the nicest. Indoor entry to rooms, small pool. Main issue, which I have with all red roof inns is the lack of options at the continental breakfast. Just adding some oatmeal or toast would be nice

Text: The hotel is very small and absolutely nothing fancy but you get what you pay for. It's inexpensive as a trade off for the smokey/cleaning product smelling room, comforter with cigarette burns, and sheets with stains. The fake wood floors are a bit odd as well. Decent TV, decent shower. Pool the size of a hot tub. It's cheap.

Text: If I could select no stars I would. This place sucks. The first room they put us in the fridge was broken and made a loud ticking noise.  The second room the linens were dirty. The hotel has a strange smell to it. I would never stay at one of these again.
