DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago - Arlington Heights

Text: Stayed 11/9-11/11/17. Got a wedding block and the presidential suite for my sister's wedding.  The rooms are nice. There wasn't a microwave in the regular rooms, which was an issue for  my family who had kids but it was fine me. Besides that,  the rooms were  standard but quality. The suite was big and had a nice bathroom. Ventilation and heating were really the only problems. We couldn't find vent switches for the bathroom so it steamed up easily. The suite was drafty and it was a very cold wedding weekend; we had the thermostat at 75 and the room hovered around 68-70 even though there was a lot of us getting ready.

Also had the wedding rehearsal and dinner at the hotel. Staff was very accommodating to our asks. There was also a shuttle to and from the wedding hall. And of course their cookies. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay. Would definitely consider if we have to stay in the Arlington area again.

Text: Very nice conference rooms. I attended a trade show, did not stay at the hotel. Lunch was tasty, cold cuts and salads, although the beverage selection was limited. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and we'll maintained. The only concern I had was having to park in the rear but not allowed to enter the rear entrance, so I had to walk around to the front door in the cold and rain. Otherwise it was great. Loved the marbled rye bread served for the sandwiches!

Text: Helpful friendly staff. We were greeted as friends and allowed to check in early. Room was immaculate and the mattress as comfortable as one I would have at home. We didn't have breakfast but it looked lovely and is a great value for those with kids under 16 as they eat free with a paid adult.

Text: Could not ask for more helpful or welcoming staff. The rooms are of the good standard you expect from Doubletree and the hotel is both easy to get to and surrounded by decent options for shopping and eating. In room facilities were fine. There was no fridge, but coffee pods and an accompanying machine were on hand, as was a safe, plenty of outlets, USB charging port on the bedside alarm clock, nice office chair and desk. The bed was particularly comfortable and made for a fantastic night's sleep after a very long journey. I would not hesitate to recommend to all potentially weary travelers.

Text: Not one for writing reviews but I had to give this hotel a positive 5 star review after staying the night September 8. My wife and I decided to use a gift certificate I had received from work for a standard room with a complimentary breakfast. I myself work in the industry leaving me with a good sense of judgement about the way things should be in a good hotel , and I can say we were highly impressed by our experience. The staff was excellent with their service, as was the condition of the room and property.  I'm sure the room was upgraded because it seemed anything but standard.  Considering the fact that we were given a suite with a balcony and whirlpool tub which are not normally standard features. It was the first night we had out together since before we got married and had our daughter and we could not have had a better time. Take it from someone in the hotel and accommodations industry, I would highly recommend this hotel to any one. Thank you Double Tree Arlington Heights for a great stay.
