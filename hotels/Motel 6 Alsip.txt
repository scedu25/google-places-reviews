Motel 6 Alsip
Rating: 3
Text: Clean, comfortable bed and accommodation. Good customer service, upscale furniture and a strong heater.  This last was needed because the steel entrance door let a steady draft in through the cracks. It should be weatherstripped pronto.  The hot water in the bathtub took forever to heat up to lukewarm and never really got hot.  Few channels available on an older style TV.

Text: Absolutely bare-bones. No tissues, shampoo, hairdryer. At least I didn't see any bedbugs. Room was fairly clean, but needs total renovation. Shower was ice cold but warmed up after 5 minutes. Wondered if there would still be hot water for people who woke up later.

Text: We arrived late at night (midnight) after a long day in Chicago and were poorly received by staff. First, we were told there was no reservation under our name. Then reservation was found but needed to be paid (although we paid in advance). Once that was solved, we were given keys to our bedroom. At this point it was close to 1am. As we entered our room, we noticed it smelled like cigarettes, there were different stains in our bed sheets and chewing gum on the carpet. The shower had almost no hot water. Overall, an incredibly frustrating experience. I would stay away from this place if I were you.

Text: The hotel was clean enough, and the front desk person was nice. The room could use a coffee maker and more towels. I had one each of a hand towel, bath towel, bath cloth. Had to go out for a cup of coffee.

Text: It was a decent experience, although the accommodations that I asked for (fridge & microwave) were not provided.
