Text: The staff was not cooperative at all about registered support animal. I explain what the laws are and that I was happy to provide my documentation. They did not want to see my documentation or even meet my support animal. I ended up staying at Daniel's in LaSalle instead. The staff there were much more cooperative and were already aware of what the laws are for registered support animals.
