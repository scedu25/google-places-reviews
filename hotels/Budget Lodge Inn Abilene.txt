Budget Lodge Inn Abilene

Text: Centrally located. Breakfast below expectations. The sitting arrangement in the cramped reception for breakfast was uncomfortable. The continental breakfast that is advertised by the hoarding outside needs lot of work. The AC was in working condition but centralised and there was no way one could adjust the settings. Room was cleaned fairly regularly but slight reservations about beetles crawling on the ceiling at night. The place is reasonably OK.

Text: Would NOT recommend to anyone! FEMALE manager VERY RUDE! She would not work with us when we explained my father in law was working nights and needed to check out later then 11. She went on to tell us no other motel would work with us and that they were her rooms if we didn't like it we could leave! So that's exactly what we did we left and found a nicer room across town.

Text: We were looking for a no freals, economical motel and this was perfect. Clean, air conditioned, and the staff is super nice. We have a little dog and the pet fee was super reasonable. If we ever travel across the county again this will be a for sure over night stop.

Text: Awful rooms, hard beds, rude management. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Shady characters walking around at night. Doesn't feel family friendly. Worst of all manager doesn't is very rude.

Text: The first room was made up w/o washing the sheets. It was stained and had hairs. My second room was just fine and had no complaints.
