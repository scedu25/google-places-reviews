Text: The rooms were great, 5:30 kickback was ok and the breakfast was awesome. The thing that I was VERY displeased with was our check-in. When we arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly young lady at the desk. She took my name and began the paperwork. Then asked for a credit card to secure a damage deposit. This would have been fine had we known it was policy and been prepared for it. But as we were not informed of this when making our reservations we weren't. We had cash, and this was not accepted for this particular fee. As I am NOT a frequent guest of any motel (never have taken a vacation) I had no idea. When I asked the manager Stephanie "Why wasn't I informed about this fee and the need of it to be on a card (not a prepaid card/that's not accepted)", her response was, "That's just common knowledge." Well, not to someone who never stays at ANY motel....ever. So my suggestion is, put this on the website so stupid country bumpkins such as myself will know. After an hour and a half of trying to get this figured out and my sons girlfriend making some calls, we were finally able to get in our rooms. You would think $800.00 would make my stay just a little more simple.

Text: We have stayed here twice in the last six months prior to medical procedures at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Both times the rooms were clean and comfortable. The only complaint is that the rooms have a definite cigarette smell. Since smoking is not allowed in hotel rooms I would assume this smell remains from a previous time.

Text: Stayed at the hotel because it was the hotel of choice for a wedding I was attending. The hotel staff were friendly and the room was spacious (we actually had a coupon for an upgrade to a suite, and when none were available, they still upgraded us to an oversized King). The shower actually had water pressure, which is sometimes hard to find, and the free breakfast had plenty of variety. It is conveniently located to the airport and all attractions in and around Forest Park.

Text: If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...

We had a wonderful stay! We were very pleased with the staff. Alicia and Lyndsay were very nice and accommodating. Very clean room and comfortable beds. Great breakfast. The location of the hotel provided easy access to all the stuff we had planned for the weekend. We will definitely stay here next tine we are in St.Louis.

Text: Always love staying at Drury. We typically stay at this location any time we go to the zoo for it's close proximity. This was the first time we have ever booked the zoo package though, a discounted room rate and free adventure passes at the zoo, it was great!
