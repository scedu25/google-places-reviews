Text: Not a very good AF inn! First the lobby and rooms are very muggy and hot, it feels as the A.C. it's not on at times. Second, I had to have my card reswiped 3 times in 3 different occasions, so I could get back into my room. Third I woke up at 2am with some kind of a flying bug on my face (I won't lie, I freaked out) and lastly I went to use the bathroom sink and I encountered 3 cockroaches at that moment they seem dead but upon me trying to dispose of them BUT, they ran back to the bottom part of the sink! Now with that said the building is very dated and there is a construction project for a new AF inn but, until then beware.

Text: We should have read the negative reviews before booking.

When we arrived we discovered the room had never been cleaned from the previous occupant.  

It got worse from there.  

Do yourself a favor and read the NEGATIVE reviews!  They are accurate!

Mold in shower, peeling paint,  WiFi issues, lack of cleaning, bad pillows, musty odors are all correct.

Text: TLF is clean, but not well provisioned with kitchenware. Regular quarters are pretty worn. Air conditioning units are loud.
