Huntington / Fox Fire KOA
Rating: 5
Text: This is a wonderful family oriented campground. We have made aquaintenaces there that have made out stay here so much nicer. The owners are wonderful people who know what it takes to for families to have a great time. Campground is equipped with very nice shower and laundry houses, three catch and release fishing ponds, one large one which connects to a nice beach area that has inflatables during the summer with multiple activities. Nice playground, movie nights outside, crafts for kids, mine gem, Banana bikes, corn hole. They have a nice on site gift shop connected with the office.  Brent and Sheila run a wonderful family business  nice KOA facility.

Text: We have stayed at Fox Fire a few times now and have found the staff and owners to be very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Of all the KOA campgrounds that we have stayed at this is hands down the very best. Organized, clean and all services work great. We will definitely stay again.

Text: The campsite is very clean, and very neatly organized.  We arrived well after the office closed, found how to pay quickly, and set up camp.  Firewood was wet, but it had recently rained so no big deal there.  Camp staff we talked to in the morning was friendly and seemed to be very "protective" if you will - was asking questions about who we were, where we were going, etc.  Definitely a lot of families staying here.  

I docked two stars because of the location.  This campsite is right by the highway, and you get noise all night long from trucks driving by.  It's a nice campsite but very noisy all night long.

Text: Convenient to interstate.  Several newer amenities for both adults and kids.  Planned activities.  Clean and well kept. Staff is very nice and helpful. Close to restaurants and large mall. Great water pressure across 110 sites that is mostly level.   Only negative is some expected interstate noise but you have to realize that's why it's so convenient.  Plus we run fan  for white noise anyway so it was never a issue.  I highly recommend.
