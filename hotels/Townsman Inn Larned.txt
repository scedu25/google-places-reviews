Townsman Inn Larned

Text: Nice big room with king bed, recliner. They are apparently under New Management. There is a lot they are trying to repair and fix. It's not bad for me so far. The New Managers are  American, so it's allot easier to communicate with them and they understand any need you have! Pet friendly. Pool is not working or operable at all. Price was very nice.

Text: As a pilot car escort I spend 80 percent of my nights in a hotel. Usually I am disappointed either with cleanliness or price or both. This place was very clean, comfortable and the price is more reasonable than all others. I WANT to come back. I've been able to comfortably RELAX! Thank you Christine for the hospitality that stands out.

Text: The townsman feels like a recovering hotel. It has need for repairs all around and some deep cleaning. While i dont think it is awful. It isnt a great experience.

Text: Totally false advertising. There is a pool, but it has no water in it!  There is no continental breakfast as stated on their website.  Wifi is barely operational.  First room they showed us had mold in front of the toilet.  We stayed for two nights. They didn't clean the room while we there. Keep driving.
