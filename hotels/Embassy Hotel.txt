Embassy Hotel

Text: This is a flop house for the nearly-homeless, NOT an actual hotel. Think of Elwood's apartment at the beginning of The Blues Brothers. Get a room here if that's where you're at in life, but don't mistake it for a proper hotel.

Text: Dont ever stay there. Its a flop housr with bedbugs, junkies, alcoholics. Its where the local socal services agencies send people when they have been refused every where else.And still Police are there to evect people because of their behavior.Bad News.

Text: If you just want a bed to crash on...look no further! Prime location & great prices.. I assume that this building was purchased, not built to be a hotel.. Because it has no elevator... Which makes me think it was previously something else.. You get more than what you pay for..
