Text: Nice little place to stay!!

Reasonable price. Clean. Friendly staff. Stayed for 1 night in king size room. Included desk chair, fridge and microwave. 

Perfect for what we needed. Baseball tournament early Sat morning & we needed a place to stay so we didn't have to get around as early that morning!

Text: I was told before I went they would try to come up with a way to charge extra off a card and they did exactly that and they were so mean and rude to us! Omg! Terrible place. I will never ever go there again! Would rather sleep in my car!
