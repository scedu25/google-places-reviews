En Gedi Campground River Resort & Canoe Livery
Rating: 5
Text: Had a great time canoeing the St Joseph's river from En gedi. So beautiful and so peaceful. We met a sweet goose who followed us to the end. Amazing wild life to see along the river and in the river.  Owner's were very nice people. Will be back.

Text: My husband and I have stayed at this campground twice.  I don't know why it isn't more popular.. it is a great campground to stay at!  
It is right on the St. Joseph River and the campground offers transportation for pickup/drop off if you are interested in going kayaking or tubing (they also rent boats).  
The owners are SUPER nice and accommodating.  We like to stay right on the river which means we only get electric service.  No water.. but the owner's are nice enough to let you hook up and fill up with their hoses in front of the office.
The whole campground is ridiculously landscaped and even the sites themselves have greenery and flowers on them.  They have outhouses here and there around the campground but also have full bathrooms which include a toilet, shower (with a home-like shower head), sink and vanity IN EACH INDIVIDUAL STALL.  I have stayed at a lot of campgrounds and never seen such a private bathroom/shower situation.  
We don't have kids.. but there is a really nice playground and game room for the kiddies to enjoy as well as a horseshoe pit and I believe a baseball field.
The prices are very reasonable as well.  We stayed 3 nights at $25 a night for electric (and never ran out of water since we used their nice bathrooms for our showers).  They also have a dump station which is free to use on your way out.
The only downfall of this campground is that they are alcohol free.. but really, not a big deal considering all the awesome things about this place.  Because of the no alcohol rule, they are able to keep out rowdy groups who only camp to get drunk and disturb other campers until the wee hours of the night and the owner's are also able to maintain the property without careless people running over the flowers/greenery all the time.
As I stated before, the hubby and I have stayed at En Gedi twice for Magic Week and I'm sure the tradition will continue next year!
