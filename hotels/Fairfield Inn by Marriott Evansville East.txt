Fairfield Inn by Marriott Evansville East
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very clean. The beds felt like memory foam, incredibly comfortable. There was a thermostat in the room to control my preferred temperature. The water pressure in the showers was really good, unlike most hotels. There was a hot breakfast. The hotel included a pool, fitness room, office area, and in the main lobby you could purchase a variety of beverages, food, and laundry supplies

Text: This is my third time staying here. This hotel is very clean, my room has a fresh clean scent when I return at the end of the day. It is evident that the staff truly cleans while you are out. Staff is friendly and recognizes your Marriott status upon check in. Breakfast is good, always fresh fruit and a great variety of extras. I have stayed at another hotel next door on Eagle Crest but this one wins my business.
