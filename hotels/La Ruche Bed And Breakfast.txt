La Ruche Bed And Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Loved this B&B. Spectacular and comfortable. Historic (built in 1904) and modernized (our suite had a gorgeous large bathroom with a nice shower and a separate tub with jets). Loved the vibe and the furnishings. We asked Bonnie the owner to tell us stories about the house and how she remodeled it. She is a great host, available if you need her but not in your way. And she cooked us a delicious breakfast. Loved every minute of our stay here. Highly recommend!

Text: This was actually my first experience at a bed and breakfast, so I didn't know what to compare it with except for what I'd heard of other places over the years.  I was pleasantly surprised with what it turned out to be.

Normally, overnight stays would have been in a motel the couple nights that required my being in town with a small crew doing work at a local church, but a convention the same week of our arrival necessitated a change in plans, and arrangements were made through the church for our stay here both nights to avoid the back-and-forth to Lincoln each day.

This is an interesting old home from the turn of the last century, our "innkeeper" Bonnie indicating its having been built in 1904 in her review of its history.  Much of the original charm was retained during the renovation and modernization that readied it for its current purpose, evident in photos from others' reviews, with tasteful appointments and comfortable, warm rooms, each bedroom with a private, modern bath.

Welcomed and treated like old friends, the overall experience made it clear Bonnie works hard to make an overnight stay here a pleasant and relaxing one.  Breakfasts were two-course affairs, capably and cheerfully produced and presented by Bonnie herself, each one unique and each of which left no-one hungry!

Really, if circumstances bring you to Seward, this is certainly a refreshing alternative to your typical overnight in a motel.  You won't be disappointed.

Text: La Ruche is a gem of a B & B, a Victorian home with a grand history.  Every room is a good first choice, so you can't lose.  And the hostess, Bonnie, will welcome you into her inn like you we're family.  The breakfast--well, all I can say is, come to the table hungry for this gourmet meal will make your mouth water and rouse all of your taste buds! Truly, a must stop just a stone throw off I-80 in the quaint village of Seward.
