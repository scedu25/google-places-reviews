Text: This place was first rate for an amazing conference.  They had the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on besides home.  Immaculately clean with the exception of one conference room.  Jason, one of the hotels premier customer-service oriented staff had so many suggestions for things to do in town, we wished we had more time! He and the rest of the staff were just amazing! I'll stay here again!

Text: Had a great stay. Check the bar hours if you're planning on drinking in the afternoon. Know that there will be a $17 charge to park in their garage per night, and that their options for breakfast are to eat at their restaurant, order room service, or eat the fruit in their very nice exercise facility. Dog friendly ?.

Text: The view is excellent. Rooms are typical for a 3-star Marriott. The staff was very friendly and provided excellent service on check in. Hotel is next door to excellent art museum with an even better one nearby. The Plaza is two blocks and there is a shuttle. Hotel is across from the twin towers that overlook he Plaza. Decor is up to date.

Text: The room was very nice! Much nicer than I anticipated. We only stayed one night. The room was great. The beds were comfortable. We needed more blankets and pillows and were provided that quickly.
