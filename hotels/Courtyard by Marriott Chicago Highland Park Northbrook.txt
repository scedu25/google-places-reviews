Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Highland Park/Northbrook
Rating: 4
Text: Not bad for 120 a night. The standard king rooms are surprisingly spacious and include a coffee table and couch. The TV had a decent selection (50 channels) but was on the small aide and low res. Very comfortable bed but the linens could use some work. Breakfast was pricey but the cafe that served it was fresh and cool. Overall I was satisfied.

Text: A bit disappointed with a few of the staff. 
We were staying here for a wedding in highland park for 4 days and we immediately had issues with our toilet. As weird as that sounds it just failed to work for even small amounts of toilet paper. When requesting help for it twice we got crabby maintenance and other staff. 
The bistro staff was great during the day time and very helpful.  But at night a particular staff member at the bistro was extremely rude. It turned us off from going there for dinner at night because we didn't want to have to talk with him again. 
Otherwise the staff seemed nice but could be more cheerful perhaps.

Text: Great location and beautiful property. Easy on and off the highway. Desk staff and bistro staff super friendly and awesome. Chairs in the lobby were very comfortable. Rooms were big and clean. Beds weren't as comfortable as some Marriott property I have been at. Housekeeping staff was a little strange when answering requests for the bedding for the sleeper bed and tried to clean our room as early as 7:45 the next morning. Internet was fast and seemed reliable. I would consider staying here again.

Text: The rooms were clean. The beds were really comfortable. Pleasant atmosphere. I didn't have to takecare of booking and paying for the room so not sure how easy that was. Over all pretty good. Breakfast was good.
