Fairborn Hotel & Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Affordable hotel with old school Holiday Inn type set up. Most rooms have microwave and fridge. Restaurant and bar are good,  usually not busy. Family owned,  and aimed to help those who are displaced,  as you can work doing housekeeping or other jobs in exchange for food and a room. Very popular with truckers. No credit card necessary. Week day discounts. Cheaper than A Super 8 and nicer.

Text: I went to the Fairborn Hotel & Inn to see if their Restaurant and Bar had Billards which when I walked up I seen they did. There were people playing pool, drinking at the bar and watching football game on t.v. I got change for quartets to play couple games and the staff was polite and courteous. I played one game alone and enjoyed the atmosphere. Closing time came quick I left.
