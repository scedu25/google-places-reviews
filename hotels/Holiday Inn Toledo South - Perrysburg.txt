Holiday Inn Toledo South - Perrysburg

Text: We got a multi room suite and it was awesome. There was a kitchenette in the room which was nice. The rooms were clean and spacious. The beds were a little too firm for my liking, but my husband loved them. I loved the fact that the hotel had 2 separate pools, one for adults and one for kids. I don't mind kids playing in a pool, but every now and then it's nice to swim without all the noise and splashing. I would definitely stay here again! Great hotel!

Text: We attended a fundraiser here. The food was good! They have several large rooms for such events. The pool looked very inviting and was in a great space in the atrium. The atrium was neat in general, looked like a very fun place to stay. Hotel staff served our event and were very friendly and attentive

Text: This as my second time here. The first was many years and coming back to see that it still has the same charm and beauty, is well, kept, clean, and the same decorous in I recall from my youth. I did not have experience with housecleaning, etc. I was there for an event, but the event room was nice and in keeping with the rest of the hotel. I would recommend this place, both for small events and for overnight stays.

Text: I enjoyed the atmosphere in the hotel, from the lounge near the lobby to the New Orleans themed Holidome area. I've been coming here since I was a kid, and have not really ever been disappointed very severely. The party I was with was upset because in their room the Big Ten Network was not on the listed channels and thus they were unable to watch the Ohio State game, this did not affect my visit. What did affect my visit? The fact that the party I was with had conflict with staff, very minor but staff was not very understanding nor very friendly. As I said, minor inconveniences but always clean and appealing rooms. Will be visiting again despite being local.

Text: This is a gorgeous hotel. They have a special area for the kids to play  pool, ping pong, swim, and they even have a game room. Their indoor pools allow you to swim inside and outside at the same time weather permitting . And for your added safety nightly on sight security.
