Motel Nauvoo?

Text: The maid service is terrible. Dirty bathtub, poorly made beds, etc. Basically they just empty the trash cans and give you clean towels. Stock up on microwaveable meals and bring your own paper plates, etc. before you come because there are no dishes in the cupboards, the stove is just for looks, and the restaurants in town close by 5:30 at night. The suite IS roomy with 2 bedrooms and a couch bed along with a full- size refrigerator.

Text: We had the cheapest room, with only 1 queen size bed, and not a lot of extra space. It was difficult to get the temperature adjusted to our liking to be comfortable. The walls were pretty thin and we could hear people in the room next to us. I did enjoy the fact that it wasn't the usual "canned" pictures on the wall, they were unique. Although the room was clean, there were toiletries left in the shower from the previous guests. The wireless internet worked very well. No breakfast was included, but a discount at a local restaurant. Not a great value for the price, as we've stayed in motels in other places where we had more space, breakfast included, etc. for about the same money. However, the hospitality room was really nice, and the bed was really comfortable. It was a bit of an inconvenience to have to check in and out at the hotel down the street ... but I did like the REAL keys!
