Residence Inn by Marriott Chicago Oak Brook

Text: The room is clean and a good size. Having an essentially full sized kitchen is a great plus for business trips. Some items are missing from some rooms, but if you let the front desk know they are good about tracking one down for you. Provided breakfast is adequate, nothing exciting but it gets the job done and saves time and money. The location is very good, walkable to food options, though the road is busy so it may be wiser to drive.

Positives:  Breakfast was good, particularly on Friday (with Andouille sausage and brie).  Full size fridge and everything needed to cook is convenient, particularly if staying a week for business.  Has the potential to be much better.

Negatives: cleanliness in general.  The outer door to the pool wouldn't close and we found dead bugs in both the pool and hot tub.  Some of the cooking or eating utensils in the room still had food stuck on.  The light in the bathroom didn't work and the wallpaper above the shower head was peeling

Others at the wedding reported their rooms were in better condition, but at this price range there is no excuse for any room being like this.

Text: Set up a wedding block here and all my guests and myself were very comfortable. I can only recommend a small change: allow somehow for early check in to be an option. I was forced to rent an entire extra day prior just to guarantee I could access the room prior to their 3pm check in time.

Text: Nice room for an extended stay. All the amenities and cooking facilities. Watch out if you use Google maps navigation function. It guides you to the wrong place. It did it to all the guests I. Etc there.
