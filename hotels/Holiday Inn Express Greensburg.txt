Text: Nice hotel. Almost completed remodeling. Good breakfast.  The only complaint is we had to change our sheets when we got in at 11:00.  Dog hairs all over.   Housekeeping just needs to step it up!  Please clean and change all beds!

Text: Spent this past weekend here for my son's baseball tournament. The staff was more than accommodating with multiple teams consisting of ages 10 and younger this weekend! Jeremy and his staff were kind, courteous, and always providing the best service possible! The rooms were clean, the pool was a great space for the kids and families to unwind, and we all looked forward to breakfast! When the laundry unit was being occupied for multiple hours, Jeremy and his staff alleviated that stress by assisting to our needs! When our 7-8 year old children deactivated our keys(frequently), they were patient and kind. I truly couldn't be more satisfied with our stay.

I will recommend this hotel to everyone I know! Looking forward to next year!

Text: Paid a higher rate for a better stay to find out they closed the breakfast bar early and not open until 10:00. Couldn't even get a glass of juice. Everything was closed up by 9:30. Need better service and will go back to our motels that appreciate our business.

Text: Room was very clean. Even inspected with a black light. The cleaning staff left friendly notes after cleaning. Check in/out was very quick and orderly. Pool and gym were clean, but a little small.
