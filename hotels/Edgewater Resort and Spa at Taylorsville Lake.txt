Text: Our family stayed here as we wanted a resort like atmosphere and needed someplace between Lexington and Louiseville. The individual condo was nice -- clean and relatively new.  We cooked our meals there and the kitchen had much of what we needed. The condo itself had some cracks in the walls and nails sticking out a bit since it's built into a hillside and probably settling. The amenities were below average - the trail to the beach revealed a dirt plot on the lake about 30 ft long.  Not a beach in the resort sense of the word. No sand, only dirt, rocks, a few weeds and sticks.  The front desk mentioned it's this way as the level of the lake changes so much.  Pool is located up the street from the condos.  Outside of the pool and the dirt beach there's not much to see or do onsite.  But if you boat, the marina is less than a mile away.  Rentals are quite expensive, so bring your own.  One other minor irritant was when we called the front desk for some help, all the numbers they gave us didn't work.  There was no one there.  All in all, an OK place but not a resort, and not a place that should command resort prices.
