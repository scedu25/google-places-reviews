Text: I stayed overnight while attending a Professional Event with my company. I love McCormick's Creek and have had many positive experiences here. The hotel was very accommodating, in the staff was friendly. I felt like I got all the assistance that I needed. The hotel staff even put two window air conditioning units into our conference room when they had issues with the air conditioning to make sure we were comfortable.

Text: I have been going to the Canyon Inn almost every year for my whole life. This is one place I can disconnect and reset. It is a very calming environment that has good food onsite and plenty of activities should I want to do anything.
