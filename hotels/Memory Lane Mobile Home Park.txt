Text: Don't fall for the line they pitch about fixing the water heater or furnace it's a total lie. And then charge you 50 thousand for beat up trailers. If you get behind 1 month they start eviction process. I've never  felt like I was walking on eggshells until I moved here and then the park is full of field workers so I don't feel safe letting my kids play outside. I would never tell anyone to move to this park.
