Text: Ms. Kristi was awesome, she was so warm and loving towards our group. Maria was so sweet. Preston was informative and made himself available to us. Fernando hooked up with places and restaurants to visit. Nice hotel but great people.

Text: The rooms are incredibly comfortable; the beds are huge. Breakfast everyday has a ton to choose from, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, etc etc. There's a full service workout facility with state of the art equipment. They do a wonderful job of cleaning your room everyday. I have thoroughly enjoyed staying here.

Text: Our stay at the In At St Mary's was delightful. The people and decor were friendly and comfortable. The whole facility was upscale, clean, and well maintained. Hot Breakfast buffet was included, and staff kept refilling the buffet with freshly prepared food right up to the end of the serving hours. Our suite room had a very comfortable king bed and a fancy refrigerator. The large walk in shower looked freshly installed, and the bathroom lighting was embedded in a large mirror behind a frosted border. Very appealing. A Starbucks and a small bar are right in the main lobby. I would be happy to stay again.
