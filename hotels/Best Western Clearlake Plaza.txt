Best Western Clearlake Plaza

Text: Not bad if you're stranded by a snowstorm. It's much better than sleeping under a bridge. I had been traveling for several days in an area devoid of Starbucks and there was a very nice one in close proximity. Also nearby was just about every flavor of fast food you could want, if that's what you wanted. Plumbing was definitely below par.

Text: Best Western at this location was awesome!
We arrived at 8pm and Mary (front desk clerk) was fast, efficient & friendly. She let us know about the pool, breakfast & check-out!
The rooms were clean and beds were comfy!
The kids enjoyed the pool until 10pm and we will return to this location!
Thank you Best Western!

Text: This hotel is very different than a traditional moderate chain hotel. Building seems old, but lobby and rooms very well maintained and up to date. Hotel theme is contemporary decor, which works nicely for the place; retro without just feeling old. Staff very friendly, lobby is warm and inviting. Room spacious and bed very comfortable. Breakfast very good, but dining area feels a little cramped. Basic fitness room in basement, no pool, small bar/lounge off lobby. Located right across street from capital building and walking distance to all downtown spots. We stayed for an event at the prairie convention center and was an easy walk. Will definitely stay here again next year.

Text: Excellent hotel!  Very pleased with the location, staff, pool, breakfast and everything else.  A perfect location for a family get together and only 10 minutes from downtown and the Lincoln sites.  Highly recommended.
