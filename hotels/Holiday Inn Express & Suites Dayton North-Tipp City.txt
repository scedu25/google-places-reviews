Text: I just checked out 5 minutes ago and I have to say, I was very pleased with my stay. The staff was very nice and my room was very clean. I don't like breakfast food personally but if I did their breakfast look really good. You guys bed are very very very very very comfortable. Those pillows are love to me. Lol if I am in town and I need a room, I will definitely be visiting again. Thanks.

Text: Nice holiday inn with large rooms, at least mine was. The pool area was clean, however the gym could use a replinshment of weights, it seemed like a few were missing.

***update***

I am staying here today and was impressed when I went to the weight room and saw a new rack it 5-50 lb dumbells, the bike and treadmill look new as well! I tossed another star up for this improvement. Also I have stayed here multiple times now and the staff is always friendly.

Text: Great stay except elevator was slow often staff using it holding to load and unload. Woman at front desk very friendly. Unfortunately their loyalty website rarely works and often stays they are having technical issues and try back.

Text: Check in was OK the man behind the desk really didn't seem in a hurry to check us in. pool was small and the water was cold, however the other staff was very polite and helpful. Bill was outstanding in stopping the noise below our window. Extra  coffee was given with a smile.  We will stay again when in the area.
