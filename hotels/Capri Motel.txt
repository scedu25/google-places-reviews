Capri Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I have been staying here for one year. The rooms have been updated with dish TV , flat screens mounted on walls, new wiring for lights, and fresh paint. There have been NO bedbugs in any of the rooms . The only downside is it seems the Elwood police like to stop every vehicle that comes to the motel.

Text: Hi have stayed here for the last few weeks. The rates are very reasonable and it is very quiet. Oh and the owners are very friendly and would recommend them to anyone that needs a place to stay.
