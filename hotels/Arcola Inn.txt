Text: If I could give 0 stars to write this I'd do that. Horrible misrepresentation the condition of this place. Reeks of body odor and urine. You won't be happy.

Text: The lights, TV, outlets, and wifi did not work. The floor looked like it had not been vacuumed in a week. I also found hair and other bodily scabs in the sheets. There were two positives to my stay: running water and my departure. Stay clear from the Arcola Inn.
