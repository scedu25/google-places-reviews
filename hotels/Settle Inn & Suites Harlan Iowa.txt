Text: The bed was comfy and it was quiet. However, the room was musty-smelling and the hot tub did not work. There were also dead bugs on the floor.

Text: You get what you pay for. I did see were the couple had a bad front deck clerk in my opinion she should be let go, but I wouldn't hurt a company with a bad review on the one bad employee the cleaning ladies do a great job and the employees we meet were very nice.

Text: August 25, 2017: Very Clean! Friendly staff, comfortable bed & good breakfast choices! Drove to Denison & choices of hotels were horribly dirty & delapated & not somewhere I would choose to stay. So we drove back to Harlan. We would come back when we are traveling this way!
