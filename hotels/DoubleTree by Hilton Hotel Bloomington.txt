DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Bloomington
Rating: 4
Text: Remodeling in progress ( daytime loud noises). Nice reception/greetings, free set of water bottles ( nice touch), free drinks one night in the attached bar ( top shelf liquors), fairly decent pool, small hot tub, fairly decent workout room. Rooms nice, bathrooms clean and well stocked. Rooms service !! In Bloomington!! Nice surprise for this primarily college town :)

Text: The hotel was nice and quiet.  Rooms were clean.  Nice amenities.  Free water, cookies, bar drink.  The heating/cooling system was inconsistent.  The room was either too hot or too cold.

Text: Entrance was very welcoming, but the mattresses were old and we woke up with sore backs:(  would NOT recommend this hotel. They're remodeling so I'm sure the place will be a lot better in the future.

Text: UPDATE (9/16): Rating updated from 1 to 3 stars, for admittedly fantastic (post-stay) customer service. When we returned home, my wife called the hotel to tell them about our horrible stay. She got in touch with Sara(h?), a manager, who was the exact antithesis of almost our entire experience: professional, courteous, and caring. She was very apologetic about our concerns, seemed upset that they weren't addressed while we were there,  urged us to give them another chance, and even went so far as to refund a generous portion of our total bill (something we never requested).

One star for the stay itself, five for the service, evens things out at 3 stars. Admittedly, I still don't think this will be our first choice of hotel when we return, but it's good to know that they stand behind their service and are willing to go the extra mile to make things right.

Text: Went to the TGI Fridays restaurant attached and enjoyed it. Have been to the conference center for events in the past too and have been pleased with the service.
