Howard Johnson Inn - Sandusky Park N. Entrance
Rating: 5
Text: Our party of 2 really enjoyed our stay here, we were greeted with kindness at the front desk during check-in, and given our room keys. We stayed in a king suite, and before even taking our belongings to the room, we did a thorough check for anything out of the ordinary. After reading the reviews, I am certain most of these guests(who rated poorly) DID NOT stay at this location. Our room was clean, bathroom was clean as well as the tub. Upon checking the bed, we found NO traces of any unwarranted animals or insects. The decor is the usual you would expect, which I have no gripes about. Property was quiet at night, other than the faint noise of a train horn. We both slept soundly, and would easily stay here again. 

Tldr; clean rooms, easy place to crash for a night

Text: The rooms were wonderful. We stayed in the king suite, and it was an enormous room with a nice Jacuzzi. The staff was also very polite and the continental breakfast was amazing. Will be going there for my anniversary.

Text: Nice older motel. Good price. Room was clean, but pretty small. Bed was comfortable. I'd stay again, especially for the price.

Text: Howard Johnson inn is great. It's the kind of motel that you can take a hooker to for 3 days and main vein as much meth as you want and you'll feel very comfortable. It's not too dirty and the water is clear though so I say give it a chance!
