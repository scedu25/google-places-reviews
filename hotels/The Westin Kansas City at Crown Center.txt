The Westin Kansas City at Crown Center
Rating: 5
Text: Nice downtown hotel. It is kept clean. Perfect for work or conventions. It is connected to a small mall with a good food court. In the winter you can literally walk to a restaurant and never step in the cold. It is also connected to Union Station in Kansas City which has some fancier restaurants. It is located close to downtown. It has a great 4 star restaurant across the street.

Text: Gave a talk in the conference center to a wonderful group. But hotel technicians could not get their power point projection system to work. We had to setup our own system after a 30 minute delay. Food was mediocre in the restaurant and service was very slow.  The cocktails were $$$ way over priced in the bar.  Finally, late night room service was surely on the phone and they were out of over half their desert menu. 

I rearely give a negative review but I am truly hopeful that the management reads this and ups their game.

Text: I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 20+ years. The hotel is known for its indoor waterfall and for direct access into the Crown Center shops. The guest rooms are comfortable, as well as attractive. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful.
