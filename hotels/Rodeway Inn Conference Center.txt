Text: Completely baffled how this could possibly pass a building inspection?!? Carpet is severely stained throughout the hotel, pillars holding the 2nd story up are crumbling, what appears to be an unaddressed plumbing issue from the room above caused the ceiling & wall to fall apart which is also unaddressed, both chairs in room are broken. Room appears to have been lightly/quickly cleaned. The claim of "remodeled" simply means the bed comforter has been updates since the 80's. Front desk staff was professional & without a doubt the only highlight of this hotel.

Text: I never got out of my car.  Sat in the parking lot to cancel reservation.  It looks unsafe to be inside.  The walls and ceiling are literally falling apart.  Was very angry about the pictures on website and what the actual condition of the hotel is in.  False advertisement at its greatest.  Don't waste your time and book some where else.

Text: The place is old and undergoing renovations, but I found it perfectly suitable as a place to overnight for a decent price.   If I wanted fancier, I  would have had to pay more elsewhere.

Text: Disgustingly filthy sheets, the room was made up to appear that it was clean but the sheets weren't changed, there was body fluid stains on the sheets, and the whole building was in disrepair. The pool had a slime ring and had building materials were floating in it.
