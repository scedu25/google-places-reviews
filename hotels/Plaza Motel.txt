Text: I came in on my bicycle traveling across country and Das, the owner, immediately made me feel welcome. He asked if I needed any help unpacking my bike which was super nice! He also gave me some state maps because I mentioned I needed them for an art project. He even printed out directions to get to the temple he recommended I visit. I felt like I was being hosted at his home. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, I would highly recommend staying here, thank you Das!
