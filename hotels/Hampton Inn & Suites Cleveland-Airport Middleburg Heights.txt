Hampton Inn & Suites Cleveland-Airport/Middleburg Heights
Rating: 5
Text: Touring musician Heather Parish recently stayed here while performing in Cleveland and had a great stay! The room was perfect and the floor was very quiet. The staff was awesome and very friendly considering the really late check-in, and even provided a late check-out so our client could take full advantage of the free breakfast, laundry room, and fitness center in the morning before hitting the road!

Text: This was our third stay at this Hampton Inn and we were very happy with our return! The staff remembered us and treated us wonderfully, we arrived with our baby and were given a room with two queen beds, when i asked for a room with more carpet space, Phil at the front desk switched us to a suite which was so thoughtful and amazing for our baby who could crawl around and sleep undisturbed while we were in the other room. When we needed a can opener Brian fetched one for us from the kitchen and brought it straight to our room. Breakfast was yummy with lots of options and a different selection on each day, bed was comfy and rooms were very clean. We're looking forward to our return!

Text: Check-in featured mound of variety of cookies in architectural masterpiece of a lobby. Facilities were clean as a hospital. Shower was perfect culmination of pressure and temperature. Impressive breakfast spread which featured a popular item - bacon -with a gracious four hour window. Staff very friendly and genuine. Massive indoor pool. Will be back next time we play Cleveland. A+.

Text: The lobby area is really nicely decorated...fireplace and all.

They checked me in quickly. I arrived late. So they suggested a few places to get something to eat. They also have a tons of snack items for sale at very reasonable prices. 

The room and bathroom were elegant. I got two queen size beds, microwave and fridge. Very nice curtains and carpet.

They have a business center and pool. The continental breakfast featured lots of tasty food.

This hotel is close to the airport and close to the freeway. If I am in the area I would definitely stay there again.
