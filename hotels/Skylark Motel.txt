Text: The people are friendly. The rooms are very basic, not much for amenities. The price is way too high for what you get.

Text: Rooms were filthy, shower "stall" had a piece of plastic wrapper in it, no phone to front desk, so manager would randomly knock on your door, bed was almost sagged to the floor. TL;DR- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
