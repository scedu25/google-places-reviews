Text: He did not give me a room number I thought it would be on the key card. So when I went n ask my room number. Which I had just given him my drivers license 10 minutes before. He wanted them back. I gave them to him. He said it did not match. Which was a lie. They were my same drivers license. And since I did not know my room number. He wasn't going to tell me. And I could not stay without knowing my room. And he would not give Mr any money back. I would not go and stay there. When I checked in. The room was 60. For 1 night. I ask him what happen to 60. He said he would give me a special 70. I said I have 65. He said okay. I should've known when he was trying to pocket money from the beginning. I should of left. And not paid for a room.

Text: Hotel room was very nice, when my group arrived, the room was clean and warm, no disturbances. Normally this would be higher than a 3 star review, but during my stay there was yelling that was audible from a closed room. This was dealt with relatively quickly by an employee which was much appreciated, but that does not detract from the fact that it happened. While this is not the fault of the establishment, this event still detracted from the enjoyment of my trip.

Text: My dad had made a reservation here for a friend and I who are birth 18, but the check in age is 21 so we were expecting a hassle right from the start. This is one instance where I was disappointed that there was no hassle at all. Guy at the desk checked our  IDs and told us we were underage then after about two seconds of hesitation let us in the room saying that we "have to be nice to me since I'm being nice to you" which was supposed to mean don't trash the room. Well turns out the room didn't have a lot left to trash. I'll let the pictures do the talking. We decided not to shower or eat breakfast after seeing other reviews of this place and just left as quick as we could

Text: Arriving at my room at this hotel, my room was absolutely filthy, not vacuumed. Bathroom toilet was not fastened to the floor, no toilet paper in bathroom, sink had debre and dust as well as the mirror hadn't been cleaned in weeks, full of dust. Trash was lying everywhere in room. The only thing that was clean were the sheets on the bed. But I lifted up the mattress and that looked very sketchy, freaked out to the thought of bed bugs so we left. The stair case outside my room is unleveled and gives way upon stepping on it, same with the upstairs guardrail. Is there any way to rate this dump with NO STARS?????
