The Inn On Broadway
Rating: 4
Text: Nice, cozy place close to downtown. Rooms could use updating, but they were large. Breakfast was acceptable with son hot selections. Front desk was very nice and helpful.

Text: Very quick check in and the room was very clean. The bed was comfy and the shower was nice and clean. Breakfast was okay, what I am used to, which is fine. A good stay for the price.

Text: Good shower, also fridge and mirrors included in room. Carpet needs replaced along with wallpaper peeling off the wall. Bed, though at first very comfortable, sinks in the middle and needs replaced. Will not stay again.

Text: Whenever we come to Lexington, we stay here. A small, vintage hotel that has everything you need! The theme is retro, vintage but it’s right near downtown and I love it!
