Text: We were visiting for a pool party. They have a very nice pool and whirlpool. The restroom was of course very wet from children running in and out. The hotel lobby has nice decor and is a pleasant place to visit. I'm not sure what it would be like to stay the night so close to the railroad tracks.

Text: Well, I'd love to give more stars, but just was unimpressed. The bathtub was broken and wouldn't hold water. And just, compared to the advertised photos on Expedia the room was much different.
