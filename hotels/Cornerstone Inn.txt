Text: I stayed at the Cornerstone Inn for two nights in January when visiting friends in Washington.  The building is interesting - an old bank. I had a room that was called something like the Glimpse of Heaven, which was very nice, cute decoration. I had my own little Christmas tree. The room was comfortable and clean. The inn does not offer coffee makers in the room, but there is a little kitchen down the hall to make coffee, cocoa, etc. The manager was very welcoming and helpful.  I had breakfast downstairs at their restaurant. We had a party of six and everyone was happy with their food. The location is also very good, being right downtown on the square. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a place to stay in Washington.

Text: Unique property that takes advantage of the history of the building. Rooms are comfortable and have lots of eye candy to look at. Breakfast was great. Gathering room was super for meeting with friends. Innkeeper, Christine, was super. We can't wait to return!
