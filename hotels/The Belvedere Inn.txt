The Belvedere Inn
Rating: 4
Text: I was blown away by this place and the friendly owners! Absolutely beautiful room and much attention paid to the small details, room decor, smart tv, free WiFi, Q-tips & cotton balls in the bathroom, and she provided an iron and ironing board. Also, delicious homemade breakfast! We will absolutely be back! I gave 4 stars because when we booked we choose a certain room but were placed in a different room.

Text: Beautiful house, we had the Belvedere room (top floor), excellent hosts, and a delicious breakfast.  Very easy walk to Main Street (3 blocks, if I recall correctly).  I'd love to stay here again next trip!
