Text: The guests stayed there for 3 weeks and they got a pretty good deal. It was better than finding a place on Airbnb where you had to share your bathroom.

Text: Nothing fancy, but what this budget, family-run motel does, they do very well. Clean, comfortable, and the price is right. I stay here every time I'm in Windsor

Text: The rooms are unclean, poor customer service, towels are stained and dirty, smells, TV's that do not work, lost of power and loud. 

The manager is an willing to help or find a solution for the concerns raised. Avoid if possible.

Text: I stayed here for 2 nights and while there were a couple of things that I didn't like, I was very impressed with the woman who checked me in as I had a problem with my T.V. and she spent 30 minutes to resolve the problem to my satisfaction.  I would definitely come back here again as it's a great location if you're going across the border to watch a game!
