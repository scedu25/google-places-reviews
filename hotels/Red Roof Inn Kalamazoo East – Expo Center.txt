Red Roof Inn Kalamazoo East – Expo Center
Rating: 5
Text: The location is great and the staff is exceptional. Craig at the front desk was so accommodating. According to a young lady at the front desk this is the oldest Red Roof in Michigan yet it is kept up very well. The room was clean and comfortable and I slept very well. Keep up the good work!

Text: I wouldn't stay here again. The smoke free policy is a complete joke! Room smelled like cigarettes. On the second night, the people next door were smoking weed. The smell came through our bathroom fan and flooded our room. I got a headache because of the smell and got nauseous from it! Towels had holes. One of our beds, we didn't even sleep in or touch because it had dog pee on it, which I'm sure of because my two dogs were sniffing it when we first came into the room. No hair dryer or safe to store our valuables. For a Red Roof Inn, i was fairly disappointed in my stay. I've had more pleasant experiences at other locations. Sad to say i won't be coming to this location again. The only positive things I have to say are the friendly staff and pet friendly policy.

Text: It was what I expected. Nothing fancy. Fairly clean but not immaculate. The room smelled like old cigarettes but it was quiet and suited our needs. And the price was right!
