Text: Great place if you have dogs.  They have a dog run, but there are great trails beyond the lakes where dogs can run off leash.  I would definitely stay here again.

Text: We were here for 2 nights so we could catch the Solar eclipse on Monday. The owners were super nice and the park had good clean amenities. The saltwater pool was great as was the older but still in good shape playground for the kids. Parking is very stacked for RVs but it's still a good stop over.

Text: Pretty nice spot.  The grounds are immaculate, pool, laundromat, reasonably priced.  Close to the interstate but we were not aware of the highway noise at all.  Easy in and easy out.  I'd definitely stay here again.  Staff was very nice.

Text: Pulled in late and leaving early.  Glad to have a large pull through site that was easy to get to and has all the hook ups we need.  Close to the highway for easy on and off .  We would stop here again.
