Super 8 Cameron
Rating: 5
Text: The Super 8 in Cameron looked like an older hotel in the halls but there were really nice rooms, a free breakfast and great service. The staff was amazing and I would have paid way more money to stay. The pool/hottub area was clean and fun!

Text: Clean hotel that could use an update. It's starting to show its age. Staff is very friendly and makes a great stay for opening weekend.

Text: Nothing fancy but got the job done. Clean, quiet but showing age. Booked a non-smoking room we thought but staff told us it was smoking when we got there.  Very helpful though in making the change. Breakfast is OK. Pretty much what you'd expect. We would stay again.

Text: Close to the highway & basic shopping/necessities. Clean, well maintained, it seemed as though they're even working on patching potholes in the parking lot. The breakfast was decent with waffle machine & biscuits & gravy. As good as any complimentary breakfast spread I've ever experienced at a hotel. The pool was small-ish, but was well maintained & had a hot tub too. Quiet environment & friendly staff. Even though we didn't have our pets with us, I appreciated that they were pet friendly. The WiFi was even easy to connect to. Overall, for the cost it is well worth it. I feel like I made a good choice considering all the options in Cameron.
