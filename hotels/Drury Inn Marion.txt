Drury Inn Marion

Text: Bed, linens and room temp were so incredibly comfortable! Front desk was friendly. 530 Kickback attendant very helpful and nice. Hot tub was just the right amount of hot and jets were about right, too (not pushing me out of my seat).

Text: We booked here by chance for the 2017 eclipse.  This was our first experience with this hotel chain and we were really amazed.  The staff was great, every contact was friendly.  The included food made the experience even better.  We will definitely use this group of hotels again.

Text: Very nice experience! Clean everywhere. Room is quiet! We stayed on a Saturday night and never heard a peep... no doors slamming, no kids running... very quiet environment. Staff is super cool and friendly. Walked in without a reservation and they were accommodating. We didn't have our dog with us this time, but we usually travel with him. We were happy to find out this is a dog-friendly hotel. We will definitely stay again and seek out other Drury Inns as we travel.

Text: Drury Inn is a very clean and wonderful place to stay. The staff is some of the friendliest I've ever seen and they would do anything you ask! They make it a priority to please every guest and help in any way possible. Drury truly is a home away from home. They also have a dinnertime meal from 530pm to 7pm! As well as breakfast in the morning and popcorn and soda in the afternoon. They have an indoor pool along with a Jacuzzi and they also offer a little laundry room, a fitness center, ice and vending. I will never stay in another hotel chain!
