Text: Always a great stay. Never stay anywhere else when we come to the lake. Been coming here since I was old enough to remember and before. Great owners, clean rooms, and 9ft pool. Coffee is at the front desk in the morning!

Text: Very clean and well kept. No refrigerator, microwave, or coffee pot, sadly. Old fashioned-dinosaur for a TV and you actually have to use a key ?? I don't necessarily mind that part, but smells very misty smelling. But overall, it's a pretty cute place with a nice pool.
