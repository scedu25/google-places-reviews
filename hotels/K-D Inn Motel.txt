Text: Wanted a room with a kitchenette.  Arrived during a rainstorm, on motorcycles.  No one available to check us in.  Did not realize we needed to check in up the street at the Sports Club Motel.  But the manager was able to get us into a key box that got us into the room.  Then she drove down to bring the papers we needed to sign.  
Very impressed with the full kitchen and full sized refrigerator!  Rooms were very clean and neat, beds comfortable.  Bathroom a bit small and only a shower.  But well worth the inconvenience.
