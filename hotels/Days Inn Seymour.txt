Text: Stay away. I have killed no less than 5 small roaches.  No way to receive hot water from sink. RM 213 is slightly better than 209. Smells very bad. Do not stay here.

Text: Wonderful place to stay owner ship has been just changed and the new onset are working on renovations on everything. I stayed in 1 room that they finish working in that room it looks great and the frontdesk people told me that they waiting for new furniture and bedding stuff to come. I think this hotel will look so much better after they get everything changed out in the rooms.

Text: Do I dare? !!!  Reasonable price. Noisy. Noisy area. Noisy air conditioner. Loose tile on bathroom floor. Leaky faucet. Very slippery tub/shower. Weak shower. Last call yet it was first call.

Text: If you want a place to stay for a quick stop...its okay at best. The room was not clean, trash in trash cans, condom on floor, broken air conditioner...The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the front desk workers were so friendly. We just needed a quick sleep to continue on the road, and it was fine. I would not stay there again, but it did suffice.
