Super 8 Muncie/Ball St. College Area
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is really cost effective but man the beds are hard as a rock and the outdated in wall ac unit is loud. But on the flip side, the desk staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and well decorated. For the price this is a great place. Just be aware the beds are extra firm and the ac unit is a little loud when you turn it on.

Text: The rooms are reasonable in decor and cleanliness. Although the bath is aging and dated, the main area is spacious and updated. The mattress was spartan and hard, but not worn out. Breakfast is very limited and the coffee is reminiscent of low quality, bitter, dinner fair. The staff were very friendly. If you are focused on value, this is place.

Text: This hotel's purpose is to give you a place to sleep for the night; it's not there to pamper you or relieve stress, the Super 8 gives you a roof over your head and a shower to wash in: that's it. The rooms are kept after, showers clean, and ac cold. The check-in process is basic enough and service was satisfactory. I didn't have any trouble with the Hotel other than the beds sucking pretty hard. Pillows that had almost no support and mattresses being much too firm will welcome you in this establishment. All in all, for the price you pay, it's alright for a few nights. Perfect for visiting parents on a budget or people coming down to the campus to move in.

Text: Nice place to stay if in town. Rooms are clean and well kept. Big parking lot for big rigs. Continental breakfast.  Free wi-fi. Small fridge in rooms. Lots of restaurants near by. Ball state university is just down the road

Text: While the hotel is clearly older, it has had some recent updates in paint, decor, and furnishings. While some of the paint and drywall repairs when not done to the best standard, the hotel was clean, looked decent and the staff were great. For a budget option, the Muncie Super 8 is a great option.
