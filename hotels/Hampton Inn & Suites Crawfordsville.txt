Text: The staff were friendly. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was big! The breakfast was also amazing. Love staying at Hamptons!

Text: Would have given it 5 stars but, when we booked a room we asked for one on the upper floors and they put us on the first floor near the pool. None of the doors has a catch so they all slam shut. We stayed at 2 other Hiltons in the past year and the beds here were not as comfortable & the hot tub is not so hot. It was nice but more like a warm whirlpool.

Text: Nice staff and clean rooms. Complementary dinner and breakfast. Good choice of workout equipment in the fitness center and a nice little cookout patio. Will definitely visit again!
