Text: This is the place to stay if you like your B&Bs to be conveniently located, have a friendly owner and helping staff, delicious breakfasts, spacious, tastefully decorated rooms, and a relaxing atmosphere. We were in town for a week and stayed here the whole time. The owner, Lisl, is a masterful baker who wowed us every morning with something special from the oven in addition to the excellent, locally sourced eggs, sausage, etc. served to us. There is also a very large, specially furnished room for bridal parties, with mirrors and places to hang garmets...everything needed to get the bride and her bridesmaids ready for the big moment. I could imagine it could also be a fun place to have a ladies' sleepover where you have someone come in to do colors or introduce you to new makeup or something like that. The big room would be perfect for it. Lisl and her on-site caretaker, Lisa, really care about your comfort and are doing a fantastic job with this place. No matter if you are from out of town, as we were, or a local, you cannot go wrong staying at this place. We'll certainly stay there again when we are back in Lee's Summit.
