Text: We stayed in room 23 last night of Aug 11th. Room was clean. Carpet looks new. The only thing i notice is the water smells sulphur. And the shower curtain has mold and towels has diff colors.  Maybe the new management can fix it. The room rate is not bad at all...TV is new and has dish network...

Text: We went to the RV spot there. The site itself was ok. They had no tables though, nor do they have bathrooms. You have to pay in cash. Would only go here for overnight stop.
