Text: Had a good experience. The hotel is a little outdated but they've been updated so they are adequate. The staff was nice and helpful. Our room ac unit seemed to have a hard time cooling the room enough for my comfort, but I like a really cold room. Hotel bar was pretty nice too. I wouldn't have a problem staying here again.

Text: I attended a scholarship luncheon in the main ballroom, and was quite pleased with the wait staff, food, and venue! Everything was delicious (especially the desserts), and the staff was exceptionally kind and accommodating, given the size of the event. I would definitely consider using this venue for a future event of my own!

Text: Attendee at a professional event. Huge property with excellent employees. The valet parking is especially appreciated. Impressive experience and I will definitely return. Lunch was the only disappointment. Chunks of iceberg lettuce with a scattering of croutons is not a salad. Overall staff is excellent and knowledgeable.

Text: I attended a professional conference. The conference rooms were clean and set up well. My only complaint was that twice the men's room was being cleaned which required a long trip to the spa or the top floor to find another public restroom.
