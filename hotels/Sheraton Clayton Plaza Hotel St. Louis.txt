Sheraton Clayton Plaza Hotel St. Louis
Rating: 3
Text: The staff is extremely nice and very helpful. The rooms are adequate but need to be updated. The breakfast buffet was $15.98 and the food was lousy. Again, the staff in the restaurant were great.
Rating: 5
Text: The conference rooms are spacious and the staff is very accommodating. The single bed rooms are the perfect size for the price. Not to mention the outstanding view of downtown Clayton.

Text: Very underimpressed and I just checked in.  The carpet in my room is worn and soiled.  The bed skirt is covered in stains, and my bathroom has hair all over it.  Judging by the looks of the shower, the grout has never been cleaned.  The only good thing about this hotel so far is a gentleman named Tim.  He was very welcoming and helped get my bags from the garage to my room.  Tim, thanks for being the light in this dark tunnel called The Sheraton.

Text: Very disappointing given the quality expectation behind the brand. Hotel is very old. Walked in and room smelled like BO. Turn on the TV and it doesn’t work. Called down for assistance and no one shows. Called again and told them to forget about it, 5 min later someone shows up. Walls are so thin I can easily hear someone coughing in the room the next door. Thankfully I’ll only be here one night, choose a different hotel in the area, I for sure will in the future.

Text: One of the better Sheraton experiences I've had. Attentive and accommodating staff. Requested ahead of time for a feather-free room which was actual ready upon arrival.
