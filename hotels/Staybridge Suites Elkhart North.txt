Staybridge Suites Elkhart North
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent facility. Helpful staff and very clean facilities. Pool was well maintained and clean. The breakfast was very good and had tons of options, hot and cold. There's a cool movie theater that anyone can use on the main floor, and outdoor basketball court etc. Tons of amenities and easy access to area restaurants. Great stay.

Text: The living room was large and wonderful. The bedroom was spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and offered many tasty options. This was by far one of the nicest places I have stayed. Highly recommend this hotel.

Text: Can't say enough good about this hotel!  King room is like an efficiency apartment (maybe even bigger), with fully stocked kitchen (dishes, pots, pans, silverware, etc), flat top stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, large coffee maker, etc.  Great free hot breakfast, basketball court, putting green, pool, etc, etc, etc.  Great staff, great service, GREAT PRICE!  Will most definitely stay at Staybridge Suites if available along our route in the future.  Thank you for providing excellent accommodations at an affordable rate.  You rule!

Text: Best hotel we've ever stayed at!  Loved the 2 room layout with a full kitchen and 2 TV's.  Slept our family of 5 and 2 dogs perfectly.  They had a nice pool for the kids & quality exercise room for myself.  Beds were very comfortable and the rooms smelled fresh.
