Benham Schoolhouse Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Over the last few years, we have always stayed at the Benham Inn when we were in Cumberland for a family reunion or other event.  During our stay on September 15 and 16, 2017, we were pleasantly surprised when we walked into a beautifully renovated building.  More surprises awaited us when we toured the large dining room (formerly the school gymnasium), the small dining room, and our room, which happened to be the only one available at the time - the Honeymoon Suite.  The service, from the front desk throughout the entire hotel, was impeccable, and the staff is well trained and friendly.  I do not normally recommend hotels to anyone, but this one is special.  If you are ever in that area, it is worthy of your consideration.  If it is available, ask for the Honeymoon Suite.  It is quite an experience.  

My thanks to the manager, Travis Warf, for his kindness and professionalism.

Text: Loved this inn so much, we came back the very next weekend! We've fallen for the Appalachian town of Benham, from the Schoolhouse Inn, Kingdom Come State Park, and the wonderfully friendly people...definitely our new go-to, non-sunny winter getaway (freezing hiking isn't for everyone...beware!)

Text: We ate at the Sunday buffet as we usually do. They provide fresh home style cooking beginning with a salad, 2 meats,vegetables, rolls and a dessert. I have never gotten any bad food. The dining area is always nicely decorated and clean. The owner and staff go out of their way to assist with whatever your needs may be. Personally, I don't think you can find a better place locally. The Inn itself is special; it is inside an actual old public school which creates an ambiance of its own.

Text: I visited Benham Inn this weekend and had a great experience. All of the staff are exceptional, the rooms are nice and have an antique charm. The history in both Benham and Lynch is apparent from just driving around, but I'm excited to learn more - and take advantage of any tour opportunities that exist in the near future.

The Sunday lunch was great - even if you're just going up for the day - it would be worth the drive - and something for you to enjoy.
