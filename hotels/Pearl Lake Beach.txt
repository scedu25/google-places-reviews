Text: Lovely place for a swim with friends! Can be crowded on weekends, but that is to be expected with weekend beach parties. Only had a chance to try the fries and a slushie as far as food goes but what I tried was nice. Nothing fancy or amazing but I wasn't coming to a beach in hopes of mind blowing food anyways. All in all, Pearl Lake is a great place to spend a day with friends and family.

Text: My favorite place for a dive! Crystal clear water for both SCUBA and beach going. No murky water here! Super warm water. Since it isn't huge, it isn't ice cold like Lake Michigan. Well taken care of and friendly staff! Pricy to get in but worth it. You can tell they put the price of admission into keeping it beautiful.

Text: Getting the bread sticks in garlic, onion and plain flavor in the little basket really brought back some memories. Should have looked to see if they still had their juke box that also showed little video clips that went with the songs! # yellow bikini! 

Fish Fry was good and the weather was a perfect evening for sitting outside and enjoying the entertainment!

Text: Picnic are really Small , it close at 5, if you are not getting in the beach you have to pay$ 15/per person (5 yrs and older) just for use the park. Not enough tables , all is cash , staff is rude. You can not bring your camp house. The view is pretty but Not going back soon .
