Text: The owners are greedy and they dont even follow their own lease contract we were therr eleven years never caused a problem then they found out someone would pay them 400.00 more for our spot and found an excuse to kick us out lied about it in a letter to us and then kept 150.00 of our yearly 900.00 lot fee for "electricity" snd clean up then rented this "dirty" location the same day for 1200.00 they do nothing about little kids in the hot tub and play favorite with their relatives in the park.
