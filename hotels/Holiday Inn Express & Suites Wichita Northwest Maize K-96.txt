Text: Before booking, I called this hotel front desk and asked about their pet policy. The employee on duty gave me incorrect information on the pet policy (said no weight limit), so I went ahead and booked. When I printed off my confirmation paperwork today, I saw a blurb about a 15 pound weight limit for dogs. I promptly called the hotel front desk again and told them about the mistake their employee made and asked that my 40# dog could stay, since their employee wasn't trained on their policies. They said, "actually it is a 20 pound weight limit" and also NO to accepting responsibility for their mistake. They cancelled the reservation that I had made a month prior. I called IHG customer service and spent over an hour on the phone trying to find another available hotel in the area that accepts pets (over Thanksgiving weekend). The IHG rep even tried to ask the hotel to do the right thing and was told the Manager said NO! I am now over an hour round trip away from the original hotel. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Where is the integrity in taking ownership for your employees mistake? I booked a month ago and did due diligence and called and asked about the pet policy! I am Platinum Elite with this group, so don't bother partnering with this hotel group as it gets you no where, even when you did nothing wrong. I will be writing a letter to their corporate office and ask they look into this further. Businesses need to be accountable when they make a mistake. Doing the right thing and honoring what the employee said would have been no big deal on their part! (management 101)

Text: We stay here every time we come to the area for work. It's clean. The staff is friendly. There is an area we can all sit and relax while being able to catch up on work or just visit. Always a great experience.
