Text: it really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be it was clean and it didn't have any bugs the room didn't have a smell at all and the sheets and everything was clean you could smell the laundry detergent on them the only problem was the bathroom it needs a little fixing up but that's really all but in the end you really got what you payed for and I know I will be going back to be honest.

Text: Room was clean and price was average $50, I had only $44 for another night because storms coming and they accepted it. Very caring and understanding.

Text: The service was terrible. Never met someone so rude in my life. It was me, my bf and my 3 month old baby trying to get out of a house full of people and get some peace and quiet. First off. The whole room smelled AWFUL, looked AWFUL. The sheets were so nasty like they had not even changed them or washed them with leaves. Even a towel had rat poop clung to it. But we had already paid. So we proceeded for then.  First my bf had went an asked for extra pillows, cause theirs were so flat and wanted one for the baby in her pack n play. They said no. Then we showered then put one towel in the floor as usual cause they didn't have a rug. And the other on the bed where the baby had peed while i was changing her diaper. So i went myself this time and asked for extra sheets and towels, so i could give my child a bath and we could shower again in the morning. And he again told me no. I told him what had happened and he still said no we should have saved them to be reusable. I said that is just crazy. And he said no its not crazy, go somewhere else. RUDE, DISCUSTING, AWFUL place. Will NOT go back. This place honestly needs to be condemned!
