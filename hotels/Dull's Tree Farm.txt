Text: Loved it! Oh my gosh it was wonderful! $10 flat fee to get in & includes all their activities. My daughter loved all the activities, good food decent price, and let’s not forget about how BEAUTIFUL it is there. We will be back for Christmas time. Best price on pumpkins I’ve found. Kind staff members. We had such a great experience there.

Text: Went to the tree farm to cut down and purchase my Christmas tree. I absolutely loved my experience there! There was a person to greet you as soon as you walked up to familiarize you with the lay of the land and what each barn offers, in addition to their tree services. They have great equipment for you to use and the people are very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the Wreath Barn, gift shop, and snack barn where there was hot chocolate. Oh, and a sweet fire pit too to breathe in all the fresh basalm. Highly recommend!

Text: Fun place all year long to see but especially in the holiday season. Worth the drive.  We have been going there for over 8 or 10 years.  I would say come early in the season the best trees go early but they do have a lot of choices and make the experience fun.  Thank you to all the staff from the tree guys to the ladies in the wreath store.

Text: Had our first experience at Dulls this year with my family and it was an awesome time. My 5 year old and 1 year old loved it ! There was so much to do that we ended up staying there for 3 hours! Entry fee is worth it for all the stuff you get to do and pumpkins were surprising cheap compared compared to other pumpkins patches I've been to over the years! We will definitely go next year

Text: More like Dull's Tree... Depot. If you're looking for a place to cut down your own tree this is becoming less and less the place. Read the reviews; most people seem to be excited about the slide on a pile of mud or the fence maze. They've become less of a farm and more of a park or something. The trees are shipped in from I don't know where. We went last year and had a great experience cutting down our tree. But as of November 2016 anyway there were several white pines and maybe 12 Canaans that were already dropping. If I wanted to buy a tree off the back of a semi I'd just go to Costco and save myself the hour and twenty minute round trip. I don't know why they have racks of saws when the trees are already leaning against a fence like Lowe's. If you want the soccer mom photo opp for Facebook or Pinterest knock yourself out here. If you're looking to actually cut down your own tree look somewhere else.
