Historic Hotel Nichols
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent place to stay in downtown South Haven. The room was cozy, neatly decorated, clean, and comfortable. Great location within walking distance to the beach, shopping, great food, everything you need. The room we chose, the Lighthouse room, had an old claw-foot bathtub with a shower. All of the employees were polite, helpful and accommodating. The only thing that was an issue is you have to use public parking, which over the holiday was difficult to find.

Text: Hotel Nichols is in an old building with lots of character. The wood trim, doors and windows seem original to the building. A much larger hotel than you would think looking from the outside. Clean rooms and comfortable. Only down side is no parking so you have to find a spot on the streets, and keep in mind you have to use stairs to get to all the rooms.

Text: This is a great place in the heart of South Haven. This historic and one of a kind hotel is simple yet elegant. The staff is amazing, the atmosphere relaxing, and a room for every budget. This is a place you come home to on your vacation, and it is a choice you won't regret.

Text: Nice quaint rooms, staff was friendly for the most part and the breakfast in the morning was pretty solid.  The rooms were definitely a little older and although it gives a nice old timey feel to the hotel it makes certain things not very practical (my connecting room with my parents didn't have a shower, and they're bathroom didn't have a sink)
