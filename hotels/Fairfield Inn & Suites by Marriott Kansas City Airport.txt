Text: My wife and I stayed 2 nights before we flew out for our honeymoon. We told them ahead of time it was our honeymoon and when we checked in we were surprised to find rose peddles on the bed and a note saying welcome, happy honeymoon and to enjoy and the tray of cheese, grapes, along with some yogurt and chocolate! It was a PERFECT stay. They also let us check out late because we had a later flight. All in all wonderful stay. The ONLY bad thing is I would say they could probably step up their breakfast a little. The eggs weren't all that great and some of the breakfast meat was so so. It wasn't terrible though!

Text: Clean and trendy. The suite I stayed in had a little 70s "bam-chicka-wow-wow" going on. Unfortunately, I could hear my neighbors loud and clear through the adjoining door. If we were all swingers, it'd be a perfect opportunity.  This is why I travel with a white noise app. Hot and healthy breakfast options and tea and coffee available around the clock. Friendly staff. Despite the neighbor noise, I'd stay here again.

Text: The room was very nice. The pillows were very comfortable. The bed was a bit softer than I like, but not so much that I didn't sleep. The bathroom was very clean with more than enough hot water. We didn't eat breakfast there because it was too crowded by the time we made it down stairs. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.

Text: I was pleased with my stay. Room was average, but had a good breakfast. Only minutes from the airport. Needed a ride to airport at 4:30, and they were waiting for me, friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel always.

Text: Great service, astounding shuttle service. My room wasn't very clean was the only issue I had. The shower curtain was still wet and quite a few hairs in the shower and on the floor.
I liked the personal note the cleaners left, but I'd rather have a clean and sanitary room!
