Text: I try to spend our money at mom n pop establishments.  I felt like this immigrant family run motel wasn't trying. When we checked in, the woman how helped us did not volunteer to tell us was internet. 
The room was depressing.
 There were no electrical outlets.
The weather stripping fell out of the door every time we used it. Access walls in bathroom were left open. There seemed to be no renovations in progress. Everything was old and worn. The bath room was cold due to the open wall.
I did not negotiate the fee in advance. $35.00 would have been about right. We were charged $70.00. 
While I encourage people to spend money in such a way that the local community is served; I would this one time recommend one of the three chain motels in the area..
