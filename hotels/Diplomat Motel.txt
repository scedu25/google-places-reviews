Text: The only reason they get 1 star is because there isn't a 0 star.  This place has bedbugs, and awful smell in rooms.  Turned the lights off and roaches came out all over the room.  It's by far the very worst motel I have ever seen.  And the owners are the rudist people I have ever met.

Text: This sweet little place really surprised me. The price was a good deal, the staff was friendly and professional, and the grounds are well kept. But I was most impressed with my room. There was new carpet and curtains, beautiful bed spreads, tasteful decorations, and a microwave and mini-fridge. Not only was it very clean but it also smelled nice, which is important to me because I have terrible allergies. No trace of mold or smoke. There was a large flat screen TV and coffee and donuts in the morning. Even the bathroom pretty! I would stay again in a heartbeat.

Text: Agree with CL.  The staf was very friendly and made us feel at home..  Rooms were clean - no frills, but, perfect for the location we needed and comfortable.  fair price.  coffee in the lobby. cable, fast-easy-2-connect Wi-Fi,  mini fridge and microwave in room.   Was refreshing after a long drive from home.  Trying to plan from 6 hours away, couldn't find much about this place.  I almost didn't stay here, but, after reading "CL"'s review, decided it was worth a try.
