CERAland Park
Rating: 5
Text: Life guards at water park seemed to pay careful attention to their jobs. All the water park activities - climbing wall, water slide, little kid's water playground - were well maintained and fun for everyone.

CERAland as a whole is a great place to enjoy a sunny summer day. Did not appear to be the best place for a more rural/thrilling outdoor experience, but definitely great for families of young kids.

Text: This is a very nice park with tons of amenities and big open spaces. However, not all of the RV sites offer full hookup and none of the streets in the campground are paved, so it is very dusty. Also, nearly every site has mature trees so it is hard to acquire satellite reception.

Text: Overall Good facility that listens to its members... 
Positives: Pool is nice size and lots of great resources and activities for kids. Snack bar is a great addition and fairly priced. Mini golf is a great feature too. 
Downsides:
**Not enough real chairs but too many wooden benches/homemade chairs
**Beware: bathroom floors are super slippery 
**Sometimes a LONG wait to get through the entrance gate. They need to have a separate lane for members only.

Text: Great place out and away from traffic and noise. Lots of trees so satellite is spotty. Wish they had cable. But still a great place to stay.

Text: Fun, clean, courteous. Plenty of RV sites including full hookups. We stay here 2-5 times a year. Lots of things to do.
