Great Wolf Lodge

Text: The rooms in the hotel are beautiful! They're very spacious, and feel really accommodating. The water park was pretty fun, however, the place was packed, and they only had one employee running all four water slides on each level! The lines would have moved so much faster if they had a few more employees working. I would have given it 5 Stars if it weren't for that.

Text: We brought our kids here all of us for the first time in January of 2016 and they loved it. Our little one who was only 2 at the time cried and did not wanna leave at all!! Our room was great and staff was excellent. Worth every bit of what we paid to stay those couple nights. So here we are back again for our secound time in November of 2017 and having yet an awesome time!! Great Wolf Lodge will definitely be our kid friendly family get away every year!!

Text: Stayed here for our usual annual conference. Our room was giant and great and had a fireplace, huge soft bed and a jacuzzi tub in the room. I like the microwave and refrigerator too. It is also nice to have a second sink outside the bathroom. The water park was great too. The only negatives are the sink water is scalding hot and can burn you. Also the gym equipment is lacking quite a bit. The hotel is nice but huge and geared towards children.

Text: The place is designed for you to stay on the premises the whole time you are there. If you aren't planning on doing that just know your room key is a bracelet. 

Rooms are clean and staff are super nice. The pools and slides have something for all. There were a good number of people but not so crowded as to be a bother. 

If you have small kids this will be a hit.

Text: Wonderful family getaway spot. Rooms are spacious and clean. The service is top notch and every employee is very friendly. The water park is clean and is big enough you could spend an entire day in it. Enough restaurants we did not have to leave the lodge for 3 days!
