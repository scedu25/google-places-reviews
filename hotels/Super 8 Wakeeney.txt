Text: This review updates my previous review from the same time last year. The property was involved, along with neighboring properties, in a bad hail storm in August of 2017. Half of the rooms are undergoing renovation. Otherwise, the property and rooms are still middle of the road for a limited service property in a rural area. Rates are reasonable versus recently built competition in this market area.

Text: This is a nice hotel for an overnight stay. It's a good price for what you get. The room was clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. There's not much to do in the area, but I imagine that most travelers are just passing through, not choosing this as a destination.

Text: We were pleasantly surprised. It was very clean and comfortable. There aren't a lot of food choices in this area and for some reason the restaurants (even the pizza) was really expensive. But nonetheless it was a good stopover.
