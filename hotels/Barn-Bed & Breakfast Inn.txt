Text: Had a wonderful weekend here celebrating our parents' 60th wedding anniversary!  Immediate family stayed two nights and we had a Saturday afternoon reception. Enjoyed massages, the pool and hot tub, disc golf and the beautiful outdoor spaces. Plenty of places to relax, play board games and enjoy family time. Breakfast and supper we're included and were absolutely delicious!
