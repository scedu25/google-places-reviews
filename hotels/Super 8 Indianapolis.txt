Text: Absolutely amazing experience. The rooms are beautiful, and the customer service is absolutely wonderful. I would highly recommend this motel to anyone that asked.

Text: The room was clean and didn't smell of smoke like most other budget hotels.  Receptionist was friendly as was the cleaning lady.  I would give five stars, but the steps to the second floor as well as the flooring on it were something to be desired.  Definite trip hazard.  Otherwise, great experience!

Text: Basic hotel room nothing fancy did have a mini fridge. Everything was freshly painted but you see the wear and the age of the place. Location right of the interstate with a few fast food restaurants and a walmart within 200 yards.

Text: It does the job, but not much more. Rooms are tidy, but fixtures are broken in many spots. Breakfast is provided, but it isn't much to make noise about. I needed to sleep and I was able to do that here.

Text: The room we stayed in was nice. Staff were more or less indifferent to us (not nice but not rude either).
