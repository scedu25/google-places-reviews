Text: Very nice hotel. Free breakfast and a indoor pool! Staff was very friendly and a smile on their face. Breakfast was really good and the breakfast worker was wonderful, food was never gone, she made the waffles, and if needed anything she would get it for you. Rooms were very clean and air-conditioning and the tv were working great. The housekeeping checked my room and made it pretty. VERY WONDERFUL HOTEL!

Text: These last two weeks I've had nothing but a positive experience at this hotel. The front desk clerk's named Marissa was super nice and always a big help on what to do in town and helping me with any issues that was going on at the hotel. She made sure to greet me every time I came in and left and when your in the military those things really help, "as we are not always around our families." Thx for a great experience.

Text: Easy to reach from the street, kept clean, nice pool. Seemed a bit dated, but given the surrounding areas, it wasn't bad. Staff was friendly and helpful.
