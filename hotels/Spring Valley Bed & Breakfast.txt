Spring Valley Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I had a family reunion in Pella and we found this bed and breakfast on the internet and booked it for the 2 night we were to be attending the reunion functions, We were so relaxed and loved it so much we stayed an extra night and I had my best fishing day EVER!!!, and we will be back many time in the future, the breakfast was amazing, Dwight and Arlene were perfect hosts, the game room was full of activity and our 8 yr old son was always busy doing something; fishing, feeding the lama grass, chasing the ducks, playing in the game room or riding on the atv with his mom and Dwight
