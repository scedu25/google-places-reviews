Text: Super 8 motel was awesome .
Got a good night's rest and hot shower then had a great complimentary breakfast this morning before heading back to tear down more greenhouses.

Text: Old motel.  Needs love and attention. Dated carpets, and appliances. Hallways smell like smoke,  and the towels are not the comfy ones. But the Wi-Fi is free, and the price for a room is cheaper than the competition. There are also spots to park your trailer/RV which is nice.

Text: The room was clean and very nice. The only complaint i have is that i rented the room at 3pm and it wasn't ready. It took the maid 15min to make one bed. But other than that it was nice.

Text: Location off US24 is great. Especially when having a birthday party for my brother. Easy to find, easy to get to. Room was clean, service (which we didn't need much of) was friendly. Really no complaints for the price.
