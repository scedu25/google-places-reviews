Text: Cheap, old motel, I understand that. A little mold on the bottom of the shower curtain, leaky sink drain. No biggie. But when it's 29 degrees out and I walk around at 6 am for continental breakfast don't come at me like I'm stealing!! 2 bananas, 2 little omelet things and were sharing a waffle! Manager comes out and says you gotta eat right here! I said here's my half laid it it on the desk and checked out!! Wth??!!

Text: Rooms are quite outdated, and the breakfast consists of pretty much toast and bananas. Never used the pool. If you're just looking for a place to crash overnight though, it's not bad for the price. Right off 35 so it's convenient to get to.

Text: Got in super late. Associate was nice. Rooms were disgusting.  It smelt like someone pees on the ac unit.  The carpet... well just don't walk bare foot. The towels looked unwashed.

Text: This place allowed dogs. So I made reservations at Days Inn in Denton Texas and I also checked online to make sure it was listed as pet friendly. The desk clerk in Denton claimed they were not pet friendly. I no longer stay at Days Inn and have taken my business to La Quinta Inn
