Text: One of the best little inns I've been at for a wile. You can tell these people take great pride in there place. Room was as clean if not more than a 5 star chain place charging 5 times the price. The room is simple no frills.  Just a comfortable quite and clean. The pool was heated and area was spotless. We will be back for sure

Text: Sweet little motel with a heated pool and very nice, upgraded facilities. Hot shower, great water pressure, VERY comfortable bed. Great little town with everything you need to get away and relax. The host of the Inn is amazing! Feels like home. We will be back.

Text: The Inn employees were very helpful with advice on food, shopping, and rental advice. The 3 Queen Cottage was pretty much exactly what I expected for the price we paid. The only recommendation I have is that a larger shower and bathroom would be nice.

Text: We stayed here this last weekend and we're very pleased. We had notified the owner(Veronica) that we would be running late because of a flat and were pleasantly surprised that she kept her beautiful new pool open so we could take a late swim.  The next morning we had breakfast at Pokeys across the street and Larry was able to fix the tire while we had breakfast.Very friendly people, nice clean rooms and right in the middle of Grand Rivers. I look forward to staying here again when we return to this beautiful area.

Text: The Inn is within walking distance of everything in the town  (restaurants, ice cream stand, pier, etc).  It's 1.3 miles from the mountain trail, so we just rode from the Inn to the trail.  The pool was clean. The price was reasonable and the Hungarian lady at the front desk was very friendly.
