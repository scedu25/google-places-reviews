Fairbury Executive Suites

Text: I traveled to Fairbury with my elderly mother in late May 2016 and struggled to find something in the small town that could accommodate an elderly person. I stumbled across the Grayson Cottage and could not have been more please! It was so wonderfully decorated, it was very clean and no one ever bothered us the entire week we stayed, we just felt like we were at home, 
The only complaint I had and it is minor... there was no screen doors and the windows don't open so you had to have the air on there was no way to get air flow in the house but each room is equipped with ceiling fans that made for great sleeping and lastly there was no railing on the front steps so it made it very difficult for my elderly mother to get up them but we made do just fine. I got in the habit of going for a walk every evening and totally enjoyed looking at the lovely town the old houses are wonderful and never did I feel uncomfortable walking by myself. 
Over all it was a wonderful stay and would gladly stay again.
