Text: We will not go back. Who ever owns this hotel now has let it go.
the place needs maintenance and a good cleaning! The food 
was awful!  This stay was nothing like it was 10 years ago!

Text: if you like old rustic look. this place is definitely your spot. It is quiet and peaceful. A nice mineral pool that you can swim in. You can get a mineral bath in the morning and a massage after. Very relaxing. Some rooms are better then others. I think the suites are the best rooms. This will be the fourth time me and my husband has come here.
