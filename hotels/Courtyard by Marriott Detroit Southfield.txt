Courtyard by Marriott Detroit Southfield
Rating: 5
Text: EXCELLENT staff, everyone I encountered from the front desk to housekeeping was super nice and made me feel very welcome (love their Detroit Loves Everybody shirts at the front desk too). I was just there to crash after a Detroit event that ran very late, but was super impressed with how easily they handled using my husband's Marriott points to let me stay, and how accommodating they were about selling me a couple of beers just before the 2am deadline! Room decor is not new, but clean and comfortable. Excellent blackout curtains for late sleepers. Pretty, welcoming lobby.

Text: My courtyard experience was great!  My husband was in the hospital in Southfield so I stayed at the Courtyard in Southfield which was convenient to the hospital.  All of the staff treated me with respect,  the staff at the check in counter,  the cleaning crew, workers at the Bistro and especially Sherri at the reservation counter,  were all very polite and kind.  They made me feel very welcome and went above and beyond the call of duty to make my stay there pleasant during a stressful time in my life.  The room was very nice and I would definitely recommend staying there!

Text: My Courtyard experience was not so great, the food was nice though. My standards going in may have been too high, as the room was not well maintained (In my opinion) and it is very small and tight regardless if you tell them you're a party of 3. My family had actually spotted mold growing under the couch seat and our rooms had been moved almost immediately to much nicer one. I believe upon moving they sent a cleaning maid to actually make sure the next room wasn't dirty. But regardless, how was the sleeping experience? You most likely won't be sleeping in silence as the walls are thin, so you will be able to hear people talking and I really heard people talking. Needs to be fixed up.
