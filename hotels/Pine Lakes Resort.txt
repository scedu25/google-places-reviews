Text: My family has spent a lot of weekends camping at Pine Lakes over the last 5 years.  I can say we keep coming back because we have not found a more family friendly and fun campground anywhere. The owners and staff are great people who always try to accommodate any need we may have and are always coming up with new ways to make our camping experience fun and relaxing!

Text: The people who run this camp ground are rude almost all of the included Beth.  This is a nazi camp. Kids aren't even aloud to pay flashlight tag they treat the seasonal camper worse then they treat each other.  Speedy is there best worker and they don't even pay him.
