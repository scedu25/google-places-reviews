Text: We were there to visit with family we have not seen IN YEARS. We were not being loud or obnoxious, just enjoying time with family that I have not seen in ten plus years. During our reunion, the woman that manages this establishment came down and argued with my father over the amount of people and cars. I calmly walked over and offered to pay more money to stay so we could continue having our family gathering and she scowled and said "I don't want your stinking money, I just want these people gone". So all of my family including my sick aunt packed up and left so all that was left was my father, my aunt and uncle, my seven year old daughter, and myself. We now believe everything is cool since we cleaned up our mess and all the people were gone. Boy was I wrong. That fat old troll called the sheriff and then came back down and proceeded to yell at my father and call him names. Mind you my dad has been cool as a cucumber this entire time. Then when he raised his voice a little, she threw me and my seven year old daughter out FOR NO REASON AT ALL. THIS CAMP GROUND CLAIMS TO BE FOR FAMILY FUN. I SUGGEST YOU CUT A WIDE BIRTH AROUND THIS PLACE, THERE ARE MUCH NICER PLACES TO CAMP THAT ARE NOT MANAGED BY A MISERABLE OLD WOMAN THAT NEEDS A HOBBY. Plus we were not permitted to use the pool or the play ground. It is only for the campers that are not by the creek? Either way this place sucked. It was our second time there and our last. The first time was much nicer.
