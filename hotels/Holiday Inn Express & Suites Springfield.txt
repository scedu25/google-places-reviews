Text: Nice hotel, but there is always a moron who likes to take advantage. Stop parking sideways right by the entrance!!!! This lot is huge. Inconsiderate SOB. Management needs to address this. Safety hazard. If there was a fire, you would have to run 5 spots up the sidewalk to bypass this idiot.

Text: All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were all clean and even had a Keurig in the room. Breakfast was nice in the morning. I didn't use all of the facilities available, but saw families heading to and from the pool area. No complaints, had a great experience.

Text: Super hot showers with strong water pressure which is a deal breaker for me :) comfy beds, didn't really hear other guests unless you were in the bathroom and the occasional door shutting.   We will definitely book here again next year for state fair

Text: The laundry room was clean & reasonably priced. I also thought the staff went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of and had everything we needed. Can't say enough how friendly everyone was, for that reason alone I will return.
