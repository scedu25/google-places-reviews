Text: This is a quiet off the road place.  The owner is so sweet and thoughtful.  Arriving, she gave me some fruit and when I left she gave me a cup of the most delicious soup I have ever had.  The bed was high quality and the room very clean.   She and I talked about her flowers, she and I love gardening.  I will always stay here any time I go thru Nebraska.

Text: What a great find! This motel totally beat our expectations. Our room was spotless and the manager couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. If you're looking for a clean, quiet, friendly atmosphere this is it and, the price can't be beat. If we're ever in the area again we will definitely stay here.

Text: The hospitality is outstanding.  They really go overboard in making you feel like family.  Sometimes the best experiences are when you get off the interstates and go further into town.  I would definitely recommend staying here.   If you are expecting a pool, hot tub and those type of high priced ammenities your looking  in the wrong place.  But if you want a relaxing, homey, small town, truly welcoming experience, the Husker is it.

Text: Amazing place, just like reviews said: little immaculately clean rooms and very friendly owner who bakes all kinds of things for the guests. Possibly the most surprisingly nice little motel I've been to.
