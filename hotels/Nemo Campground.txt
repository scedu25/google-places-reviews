Text: We have been taking our kids to Nemo since they were little. Now we take our grandkids too. We love the campground. It's a great place to make memories with your family.

Text: Not for tent campers. Good for RV camping. 

Zero privacy between camp sites (typical of RV camping I guess. I'm a tent camper)  The few tent sites have absolutely zero boundaries between sites. And there is no special spot for the tent...just right on the gravel (ouch!) 

The shower house was clean, but the water just barely trickled out (and minimal hot water
..warm maybe). 

The main office gentleman was extremely welcoming and friendly.  

Nice place; just not for casual tent camping.

Text: Campground and surrounding area were beautiful.  The water was great, the fish were biting and everything was clean.  The downside is that apparently there is no one to help enforce the noise regulations.  A neighbor, three sites down,  blasted their radio so loud that I could still hear it in my car with my windows up.  ALL NIGHT LONG! Literally.  After some conversations and some phone calls I was told the only help I could get with this was if I called 911. This seemed extreme to me. No one was injured or dying. You'd think someone in the office could help with this.  If I wanted to rock out all night, to music so loud I can't have a conversation, I would have stayed in the city.  If you have a family or are looking for a nice weekend getaway absolutely AVOID  Nemo Campgrounds. Find somewhere else.  It's not worth the trip or the 12$.
