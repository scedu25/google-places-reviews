Text: Had a wedding party and most of the family stay one,  if not two, nights.  The Front Desk and kitchen staff were very accommodating.  The rooms were clean, breakfast was plentiful, and the pool was clean and usable.  The rooms were also quiet so we were able to sleep in the  middle of our chaos.

Text: Stayed at Country Inn and Suites in Dundee, MI. June 20th. This location is Amazing! The room was meticulously clean. (Best I've ever seen.) Staff was friendly and helpful, the beds were incredibly comfortable. The only criticism I could possibly think of is the toilet in the room flushed very loudly, but that is small potatoes considering the quality of the stay overall. If you are considering booking here, I strongly recommend you do. You won't find a better hotel in the area.
