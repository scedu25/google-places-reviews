Candlewood Suites Champaign-Urbana Univ Area
Rating: 5
Text: It's a good place for a long stay. They do not offer free or paid breakfast. But there is a cupboard where you can buy some basic daily stuff. The rooms are large, spacious and clean. Please be aware that housekeeping is only carried out once a week. Great place for a business or casual trip. A number of shopping and eating places within walking distance and good connectivity with bus.

Text: The staff is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. The hotel is clean, and having essentially a full kitchen is so convenient. And they are "pet friendly."

Text: The hotel is in a quiet area closely located to many restraunts. The room was very clean. Some of the furniture was lacking quality. The hotel also had complimentary DVD's to borrow.

Text: Standard Candlewood. Newer building, everything was pretty clean, front counter was very friendly. Free movies, workout room, full size fridge and basic kitchen essentials. No pool or breakfast is standard at Candlewood. Beds could have been more compfy without the mattress pad.
