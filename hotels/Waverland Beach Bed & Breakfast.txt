Waverland Beach Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Absolutely wonderful!  Perfect little relaxing getaway. The photos on the website and TripAdvisor do not do Waverland Beach B&B justice.  This was the first visit to a B&B for my husband and me.  We were a little unsure of what to expect, but the hostess, Nancy, made us feel comfortable and welcome at every moment.  One just needs to bear in mind that they are in someone's home, and you are a guest in their home.  It's a very different experience from that of an impersonal hotel.  The home and property are beautiful, and clean.  The beach house is just brilliant.  Beautiful location to relax and watch sunsets, and Nancy makes the absolutely best breakfasts - gourmet quality.  She also builds a fire pit fire like a pro.  We cannot say enough good things about Nancy.  She is just wonderful.  We wished we could've stayed longer, but will definitely be return guests.

Text: Nancy is Amazing. She made my girlfriend's birthday weekend unforgettable by her warm open kindness, flowers, great recommendations and referrals for local dining, meditative reading materials and more. She even had spare earring backings and toothbrushes. 

Our room was immaculately clean, romantic and private. The location was perfectly close to the water, and the sounds of the mornings were tranquil. I highly recommend you call Nancy directly. The other places in wine country sounded pretentious over the phone. Nancy at Waverland Beach B&B is the real deal.

Text: This may be a little late but a story worth telling. Three years ago a special time for us and yet a sad time for Nancy and her lovely family we had the honor to be part of this beautiful retreat and the family behind it. I brought my wife and father and his wife three years ago next week. We explored the natural forest with its many trails, sandy dunes and lovely beaches. This paled to how beautiful Nancy and her family are.
