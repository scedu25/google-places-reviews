Text: Clean, dated building, but updated rooms, very friendly and reasonable rate. Everything went smoothly. For a small town, I couldn't have asked for better. Thank you.

Text: Best economy motel I have ever stayed in.   Very clean, beds surprisingly comfortable.   People very nice, super quick check in.   I am in town for a funeral and couldnt ask for a better bang for my buck.   Flat screen tv w cable, comfortable recliner and a clean bathroom.  What else could I ask for for 40$.   I will definitelt stay here again.

Text: My son and I stayed here for one night on 1-5-16 on a three day trip were on and it was nice place to stay.  The room was extremely roomy with a nice recliner and flat screen TV.   The beds were very comfortable as I slept through the night which is unusual for me.  This is a no-frills motel - no pool or fitness center but it was fine for us as we were tired from being out all day.  I would stay here again if I am ever in the area.
