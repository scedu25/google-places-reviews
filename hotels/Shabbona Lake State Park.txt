Shabbona Lake State Park

Text: I've gone here for the past 2 years to stargaze when there is no moon but this past summer I actually camped out over night. The process was easy and my campsite had a power outlet/pole. There were also showers and toilets with running water. Nice place overall

Text: A great place to escape from the city. Park is clean, fishing is great, camp ground inviting. Lots of room for tents and RVs. They have two sleeping cabins. Must make reservations. Boats available for rent, place to eat, stretch your legs by hiking around the lake. The only drawback is the 'pit toliet' by the boat launch.  It smells awful.

Text: Great lake for fishing and renting a pontoon to just cruise. Nice campgrounds with a playground and sand volleyball court. Nice walk around the lake. Overall great getaway from Chicago

Text: Campground is very nice and well kept with good spacing and greenery between many sights.  The Park's restaurant is far enough away from the campground to almost require driving to it, unless you want to work off the meal.  Sights are gravel and moderately level in most cases, but some show signs of erosion and wear.

Text: One of my FAVORITE places to camp. So much to do and see. Family friendly. Watch out for falling black walnut fruit in the fall! Lol
