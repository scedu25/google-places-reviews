Text: If you are looking for somewhere with good service and clean to sleep while you are passing through, this is the place for you. We always stay here when visiting family nearby. They are very accomodating and willing to help the best they can. They have a simple breakfast every morning. Not a ton of ammenities but we don't need a gym or anything else. Can't beat the price!

Text: Charged me for my service dog after I told them it was illegal! They wanted his paperwork which is ? percent against the law to ask for. They then proceeded to double charge me for the room and recharged my credit card. On top of that, they gave us a room with a double when we paid for a queen. It was our wedding night and we couldn't sleep because we had no room! I'm getting a lawyer and calling the cops for fraud. They double charged me on purpose and violated my rights.

Text: Room smelled a little musty, and one of the fixtures on the bathroom wall was hanging loose, but the place was clean, staff were personable. Would stay again considering the price.
