Econo Lodge & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Everything was nice and clean. It was pretty simplistic, nothing too fancy but still nice. It's family operated and the owners are very friendly. It's quiet amd comfortable. The beds, pillows and blankets are really soft and comfortable ensuring an awesome night's sleep. Stay also comes with a continental breakfast. There's not a HUGE selection of food, but they do have a waffle maker, yogurt, hot and cold cereal, danishes and bagels and some fresh fruit; regular coffee, apple juice and orange juice. There is also a pool but we didn't use it. Overall it's a nice place to stay.

Text: The staff is wonderful, friendly, and accommodating. We accidently booked the wrong weekend and they cheerfully helped us fix things. The rooms themselves are simple, as is breakfast. Don't expect anything swanky, but everything was clean and neat.

Text: Really appreciated my stay at the Economy Lodge! Very helpful staff dealing with parking my trailer. I appreciate the larger than typical fridge. Rooms were clean, and our needs were met. I appreciate the waffle iron in a continental breakfast environment. Very fair price, and we would be happy to return.

Text: My family and I come down once a year to visit family we have in Pekin. We don't get to spend a lot of time in our hotel so we don't like to spend a lot of money. This hotel provides a nice room with a good breakfast at a reasonable price. The staff is always very accommodating any time we've ever had an issue. The staff has always been very pleasant. We have nicknamed this hotel our Pekin secret because it's a great quality room for the price.

Text: The hotel was clean and the beds and pillows comfortable. The only issues we ran into were that the hairdryer in the room didnt work well and the shower creaked a lot. It sounds odd, but it was an incomfortable kind of creaking. Otherwise the stay was pleasant. Staff was friendly etc.
