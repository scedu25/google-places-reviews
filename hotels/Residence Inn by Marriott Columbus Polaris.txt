Text: The room was terrific. King studio layout was really well done. Only complaint was no USB charging ports (except one on the TV, if you know to look for it). Staff were great, breakfast was adequate.

Text: Very dirty. The carpet in my room had clearly not been cleaned in a very long time. Dishes, utensils and coffee maker had to be cleaned before use. As an elite member, I'm generally very happy with Marriott hotels and stay there because they are generally clean. No so here. Even the bedding had a slight musty smell. On the bright side, the front desk staff was very friendly and efficient.

Text: Nice place for staying in Polaris. The breakfast was not average. I stayed for a week on a business trip. They provide office pickup and drop. The room interiors are pretty nice.

Text: My family had a wonderful time here for 4th of July. Beautiful location and the staff is super friendly. The hot tub was out of order but that happens. Pool was a little dirty too but there was at least 2 different sports teams there that probably contributed to that. Would definitely still recommend for anyone though.
