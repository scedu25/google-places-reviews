Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Waterloo, IA
Rating: 4
Text: Not a bad location for accessing Waterloo and Cedar Falls, tricky to get in the parking lot. Our room was huge with the extra pull out couch, perfect for what we needed. Hotel was decent, definitely not updated but the staff make the most of what there is. It was clean and friendly. Pool area was decent as well. Breakfast did leave a bit to be desired. We actually opted to eat breakfast out the second morning since the first morning was not good eggs and no sausage or bacon. Breakfast was really our only complaint. Thanks for a great stay!

Text: Very thin walls you can hear people walking around on the same floor. The room next door woke up at 6 am each morning and it sounded like elephants walking around. Very annoying

The mattress was uncomfortable and the pillows.... smallest pillows in the world. We slept on 2 and the would flatten as soon as we laid on them. 
Very uncomfortable 

Our refrigerator didn’t work so our leftover food went bad. It wasn’t even plugged in when one of the staff tried to assist us. She plugged it in but it never worked. 

Breakfast is okay.

Text: Nice big and clean rooms. The handicapped room bathrooms are large. The handicapped room's shower has a standard tub, but it also has a bench that folds down across the tub to easily sit. Free breakfast in the morning too, and complimentary cookies all day. The only difficulty is that it can be confusing to figure out how to get into their parking lot.

Text: Most warm welcome I've ever had coming into a hotel ever. The whole place was spotless. The rooms were well above expectations. Breakfast had extra stuff and if I could, I'd give it 7 stars. Stay here. It doesn't get much better than this hotel especially for the price.
