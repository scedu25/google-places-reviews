Text: The owners of this motel are wonderful people and they take very good care of their motel.  The motel is very clean and in very good condition.  And the owners are genuinely appreciative of their customers, and they are very easy to work with.  Like many small roadside motels, if you are highly sensitive to the sounds of road traffic, this motel is on a highway that does have some truck traffic that you can hear at night, but this motel by far would be my first choice in this area.
