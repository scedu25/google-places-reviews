Text: Clean room. Standard breakfast. Friendly staff. Pizza Hut located right next door. Located in a small town. Friendly locals. The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is it is in need of some renovating.

Text: Just stayed for the night, rooms are well stocked with very comfy beds, fridge, microwave and a ironing board. Wifi worked well and thanks to the air conditioning the night was quite pleasant. Would stay again.

Text: The place is clean and looks safe. A nice place for a overnight visit. Though I don't recommend it for more than a nights stay. The breakfast of just cereal, the food options nearby aren't great . That's why it is just an overnight stop. Overall of I'm tired and near I have no problem staying here for the night. The beds are comfy enough, roomy room without being to big. The place is clean and without odors good or bad. The decors in the room isn't really my type and a tad bit dated but isn't awful. The place is close to the highway but quiet and you can't hear anything inside the room. The towels are clean and obsorb water well. They aren't thread bare. They have morning papers in the breakfast room u s a today.

Text: We were all expecting to check in at 1 because that's what was on the website. We called and they said 3. Once we got to the room the first thing we saw was a bug in the corner of the room. You also had to slam the door so it would shut. The bed comforter was also terrible and the carpet looked nasty. When we woke up the next morning we went to get breakfast. All they had was juice, yogurt,small muffins, one type of pastry,toast, and two types of cereal.The only descent thing i saw was the pool but it was on the small side. I have been to hotels way cheaper with cleaner rooms and better breakfast.
