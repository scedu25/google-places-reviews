Text: Great historic hotel with excellent staff. Excellent location close to downtown happenings. One of the staff members even sang to one of the guests during happy hour for her birthday, it was really great. The rooms are well maintained, I have no complaints at all. The bar tenders were very knowledgeable and worked hard. I will stay here again in the future.

Text: We loved our stay in the historic Drury! Beautiful hotel with so much historical value. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It is a great value considering that the hotel had an amazing, large free breakfast, 3 free adult beverages, and food free from 5:30-7 pm. It was a great value! The pool/ hot tub was very nice! I highly recommend it!

Text: Pricey, but high quality.  Room are on the small side which is to be expected with a historic building.  The furnishing and linens are very nice.  Service was excellent.  Happy hour and breakfast definitely add value.  The quality justifies the price.
