Text: Super clean hotel and very friendly staff. The beds were comfy and the rooms were very accommodating. Nice flat screen TV and great Wi-Fi allowed for entertainment when the weather was less than great and the battle grounds across the street were nice to visit when weather allowed. Would definitely stay again!

Text: We stayed here for 2 nights with 3 of our grand kids I remember this place 35 years ago. But I have to say for it binging an older hotel they have done a GREAT job of keeping it up the place was spotless, a VERY clean hotel, they have a salt water pool and it also is very well kept up. I can't brag enough on this hotel, it is one the cleanest well kept hotels I've ever stayed in.

Text: Not certain about the rooms as I didn't stay in them, however the town and the fort itself are an amazing piece of history. Highly recommend this place
