Text: Exceptional price. Very comfortable and you can't ask for a better location. We were close to everything including our train station. I really enjoyed the hosts ar the Wohlt house. I was worried about my sleep being so close to a busy road and the train. They provide ear plugs but I didn't need them.  Slept so well. It was a great old fashioned experience.

Text: This place is better than the pictures on their website show. My wife and I stayed in the Spring Garden room. The bedroom is a bit dated but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were nice. The bathroom is very large and looks like it has been updated recently. The owner's are nice and make suggestions about things to do. This place is in a great location and everything you need to do is within walking distance with the exception of a couple of the wineries that are out of town. The Trolley service is easy to use too. Breakfast was great, too!
