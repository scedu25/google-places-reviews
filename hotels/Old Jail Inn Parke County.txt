Text: Kathy Barron and I made our almost annual visit to the Drunk Tank, last time Henrietta Wright was with us, and we are never disappointed. We always leave with a smile and several bottles of wine! Hopefully we will be able to make it back soon!

Text: Beware of new policy!!!
The owner now requires a MANDATORY 2-DAY stay over the weekend if you are planning to come to the Covered Bridge Festival in 2017.  I have been to this place several times, with my mother, my husband, and with my girls.  Never have we had this policy before.
The CBF is just turning everyone in Rockville to crooks & thieves!!!  It is no longer about the beautiful fall weather & the history of the area.  What a shame.
