Holiday Inn Express & Suites Manhattan

Text: It's a nice, new looking hotel with friendly and competent staff. The rooms were clean and everything worked fine except the lock on our door wouldn't lock half the time we left the room. Bit unnerving. There's a good spread for breakfast when we were there on a Saturday. Grab a warm cinnamon roll!

Text: This is a pretty new hotel, so it's easy for it to be nice. We had a single King room, but it has plenty of room for a pack and play and a kids cot. They aren't the most luxurious, but they are nice. The staff was excellent. They kept up with replacing breakfast like champs when the we just a ton of people in the lobby. It never felt crowded, but they moved people through pretty quick and always replaced everything quickly. They were on top of it!

Text: Modern decor and furnishings. Clean room. Internet worked well. Location is within short walking distance to historic downtown restaurants and shops.  This is an above average Hi Express.
