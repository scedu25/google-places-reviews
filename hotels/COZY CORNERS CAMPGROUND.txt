COZY CORNERS CAMPGROUND

Text: I've stayed here a few times. The owner is a fantastic guy - A few people have described him as less than that, and that's prompting my review. He's friendly and very knowledgable, he's given me several tips about local places to see that have paid off huge, now my favorite spots in the area. He's built this little place by himself, it's not a 5 star RV park - and doesn't claim to be. However - it is a great spot to rely on for a quick trip down to the Starved Rock area... and Dave will help you with anything you need.

Text: Starved Rock Campground was full and we ended up stumbling upon this campground! I'm so glad we did. The owner was fantastic, very accommodating, and even built us a fire when we were gone so it was ready to light when we got back. We camped in a tent, so my only complaint would be the traffic we could hear at night. Other than that everything was fantastic.

Text: The owners are very nice and welcoming people. We're have stopped here once a year for each of the past few years, if not more often. It's a great location that is centrally located to both Starved Rock and Matteson state parks.

It's not the most secluded or tucked into the woods location, but the grounds are perfect for tent and RV setups. There is no mud to worry about, and there is just enough shade to be comfortable on hot days. Firewood available on site too which is great.

Text: We stayed last night at Cozy Corners Campground. Perfect location directly across from Matthiessen State Park. The Campground has full hook-up sites for campers as well as tent spots. You are not sandwiched on top of other campers - plenty of room for your camper and for the tents. There was a single shower which was clean and a port-a-potty for those staying in tents. We were glad we had our own bathroom "facilities" in our camper - but if we would have needed to use theirs, it would have been fine.
Upon arrival we were greeted by the owner, Dave. Dave is 83 years old and has lived on this property for his entire life. He was extremely kind and welcoming. We have a motorhome and he even offered us to borrow his truck if we wanted to go into town and not unhook the motorhome from the full hook site. Shortly after we settled in, Dave brought us a load of firewood and kindling mulch to help start a fire. He hung out for a while and we had one of the neatest conversations we've ever had. Dave is truly a genuine person, looking out for the goodwill of all of his guests. He is also extremely knowledgeable about the area.
Dogs are welcome and obviously need to be on a leash. It was also very quiet there in the evening. Not that my husband and are I super old, but we are also not into the late night party scene. We were able to sit by the fire with the only sounds being the surrounding tree frogs. 
If you are looking for a safe, clean and friendly place to stay, I would highly recommend Cozy Corners Campground!
