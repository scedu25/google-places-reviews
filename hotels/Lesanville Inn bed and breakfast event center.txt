Text: Quaint old time farm house with some modern amenities. Few minutes from town, parks, restaurants, or trails! Got to see some spectacular summer storms at night!

Text: When we decided to get married we traveled to Iowa to meet with our friend who is a pastor. She showed us around the small towns in southern Iowa looking for a venue for a small family ceremony.  When we got to Lesanville Inn at Ramsey Farm we knew we had found the place.  The farm is gorgeous!   It is comprised of two large farmhouses - one with a fire pit, a carriage house, a small event space with lodging on the ground floor, a pavilion housing a large event space, a small chapel/church and an old one-room schoolhouse all set on rolling hills under a sky filled with stars with a pond to round out the scene.  The houses are all decorated with antiques and memorabilia from around the area including a family photo scrapbook and a1930s Mt. Ayr phonebook.  They are beautiful, but could use some maintenance such as a good coat of paint. The website is outdated and still says it has horses and other animals as well as demonstrations so you can get a farm experience. They do still have one horse and quite a few barn cats, but that's it.  It is mainly just an event space, but it does a great job of this.  Deb, the manager/innkeeper is an angel!  She contributed so much time and energy weeks before the event to help us organize the space, decorate and make our champagne hayride a reality!  Her daughter even made our cake!  We could not have been happier with the farm and with the people who made our special day possible.  Thank you!
