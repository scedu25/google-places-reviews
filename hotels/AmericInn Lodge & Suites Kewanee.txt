AmericInn Lodge & Suites Kewanee
Rating: 5
Text: Very clean and modernized hotel. With a fridge / freezer, microwave and small one serve coffee pot in room.  Pool and hot tub with a small variety breakfast in the mornings. Just outside downtown Kewanee, but right across the street from Wal-Mart and a Farm King and Aldi's, which are all  walking distance if you so choose.  They also give Military discounts along with other multiple discounts as well.  Would defiantly stay here again. Oh, rooms are quite. You can't hear the guests next to you or above you. Very important to me when staying in a hotel.

Text: I slept well enough but wish the rooms were equipped with their own fans to keep me cool at night between a/c cycles.
