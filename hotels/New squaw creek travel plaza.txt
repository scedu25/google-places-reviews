Text: Super friendly staff. There is a diner inside that serves some great food at great prices. There is also pool tables and a bar down stairs and a decent amount of truck parking.

Text: 11/11/17The new management just remodeled recently, place looks good. Friendly staff. The restaurant isn't 24/7, but the c-store is. Nice size parking lot, cat scale. Food is actually not bad at all, but the menu is a bit limited.

Text: Picture is out of date! This place used to be a complete and total craphole. It has now (as of 8-12-17) been completely remodeled and revamped and is very, very nice. They will also soon have a 24 hour restaurant. Actually met the new owner when I stopped in and she's a very nice lady.
