Comfort Inn Sedalia Station
Rating: 5
Text: This place is above five star. The rooms are spotless. The wall to the floor have wall paper perfectly applied, clean, new. Comfy beds with all the pillows and white Linens is a sure way to see it's perfection. The house keepers don't knock on your door before check-out with the provided door sign. Breakfast was good. The building is rail the road theme, it was the coolest style in town. There is an indoor pool off the lobby and breakfast area, I took my coffee and felt I was sitting in a sun room. The landscape is nice. I want to thank the staff and the owners for this place. It will be my gossip lol

Text: I love the Comfort Inn in Sedalia.  Take your normal Comfort Inn, kick it up about 7 notches and here you are.  They have a pool, super clean, decent internet, wonderful breakfast, and extremely competatively priced.
