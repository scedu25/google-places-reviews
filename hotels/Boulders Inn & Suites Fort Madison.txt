Text: Loved this hotel! Great service, clean rooms, and updated decor. The hotel is under construction, but i did not feel it affected us at all. No loud noise or dust everywhere. I do wish they had pool on site and we didn't have to drive somewhere else to swim. Overall, great experience!

Text: The staff was very friendly. The front desk and check in area was very open. The rooms are clean, there is a moderate size refrigerator and a 55 inch tv. The breakfast starts at 5 am which is a plus for my early work schedule. The area and the road is very quiet.
