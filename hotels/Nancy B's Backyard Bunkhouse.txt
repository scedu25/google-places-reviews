Text: This is a fantastic, isolated diamond for lodging near Lake McConaughy. Set on a 10,000 acre ranch it is perfectly quiet.
Large firepit with seating, a huge tipi..and farm animals all around. Great environment for kids. You can let them run around without worrying about drunk party animals that surround the lake itself.

The first time you drive out there, it seems likes it out of the way. But you soon realize you are quite close to the north shore road. 

Nancy is a fantastic host, and the house is quaint and feels like a HOME instead of a "rental house". We liked it so much we have decided to make this our destination from now on.
