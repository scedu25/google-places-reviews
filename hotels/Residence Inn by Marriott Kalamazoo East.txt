Text: We have a king studio. It's very comfortable and nicely upgraded compared to another Residence Inn I visited recently. Kitchen has a bar with chairs to eat. And bathroom is good sized with mirrored closet doors. Veey nice over all. Pet friendly too!

Text: The hotel is older and the beds a bit soft.  The staff is friendly!  If you need a kitchen, then this is probably a pretty good option for long term stays. Of not look at the newer Marriott Courtyard about 3 miles away.
