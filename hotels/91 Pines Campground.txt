91 Pines Campground

Text: My family and I stayed at this campground as a home base because it was convenient to areas that were supposed to be good to watch the recent solar eclipse.  Some of the amenities in this campground are crude compared to others, and it is close to a highway like most campgrounds like this I have stayed at.  However, our stay there was excellent and I would like to stay again.  The owner of the campground, Don, was a super nice man with a wonderful twinkle in his eye when he spoke.  When a violent thunderstorm came through he came to warn us it was going to get really bad and offered to let us sleep in the basement of the house he is remodeling into a bed and breakfast, if we wanted.  We didn't take him up on the offer, but his offer was appreciated.  There were ponies for my son to pet, and lots of room for my son to run around chasing and catching toads, grasshoppers and other bugs.  I loved the underappreciated agrarian beauty of this place.  It is near to the small town of Burwell which is a little gem of a town with what you need, if you forget something and need to go to the grocery store.  I think the people of the State of Nebraska could get more tourism money into this area, if they figured out how to appeal to the right people.  Plenty of people appear to go to the nearby reservoir and river to fish and water ski, but I could only think about how fun it would be to hike and mountain bike the nearby sandhills.   Most of the land appears to be devoted to agriculture, but I wonder if agreements with landowners could be worked out that would allow tourists to hike and/or mountain bike the area.
