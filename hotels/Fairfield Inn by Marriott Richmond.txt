Text: It was pretty good. Your standard hotel. We arrived pretty late, but the lady at the front desk was incredibly nice and got us into our room right away. Everything was super clean and comfy, and the breakfast was really decent as well - they had more options than I would have expected, and everything seemed to be cooked well (where it was cooked, haha. You don't exactly want to cook yogurt and bananas)
