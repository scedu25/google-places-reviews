Super 8 Greenville

Text: The Manager on duty was very helpful and nice. I am traveling alone and had quite a few things to bring to my room. She offered me a cart so I could make one trip to my room. If I travel through Greenville again I would stay here again. The room is quite nice. Microwave, mini fridge TV and a huge bed! Me and my cat had a great visit.

Text: For the price it was a good stop for the night, the gentleman who checked us in was very kind and helpful and a pleasure to work with after 13 hours on the road. The room was fine, clean and tidy it smelled a little of smoke since they still have smoking rooms in the building luckily the windows up so we could air it out. Really my only complaint is the beding the bed was comfortable but I wish  they had better blankets, they are to thin and light in my opinion. Breakfast was fine, nothing exceptional but glad it was there, and the coffee was good.

Text: Great staff, easy on and off interstate. Room wasn't smelling too good so we opened the window and after an hour all was great. If stay again.

Text: This is one of the nicest and cleanest hotels I've been in. Everything in it looks new or at least very well kept, no stains anywhere or weird smells, all the lights work and you can tell someone actually cleans the light switch!  Very clean shower, towels are white and soft not beige and crunchy and no stains anywhere or dust caked in a corner somewhere. The lady up front was very nice and even though they didn't have a smoking room for us she put us right by the door so we don't have to walk far. Very good service here if I wasn't just passing through I would definitely come back!
