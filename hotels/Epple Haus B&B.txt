Text: Lovely place run by lovely people! It is a nice retreat in a gorgeous countryside. Be aware that there is a gravel road leading up to it.

Text: We stayed at the Epple Haus in late June for a night of much needed R&R and our stay was perfect. If you are looking for a quiet place that is nestled in the hills, this is it. We enjoyed seeing lots of wildlife and being away from the rat race.
