Holiday Inn Indianapolis Carmel

Text: The bed was one of most comfortable bed I've slept on in a hotel and maybe better than my bed at home! I'm serious! I rate this bed, comforter, and pillows up there with the Presidential suit at The Drake Hotel in Chicago, IL... They also had wonderful pillows!! The floor was very clean and everything smelled wonderful!! The ONLY thing I didn't like was if you want to eat breakfast you have to pay to go to their buffet... Other than that I wish every hotel stay was this nice!!!

Text: Staff was friendly and went above and beyond to make sure our business had everything we needed for our meeting. The hotel itself was very clean you could tell their cleaning staff works very hard. Location was easy to get to. And the public restrooms were nice and clean. Highly recommend this place for anything

Text: Clean rooms, comfortable beds, hot showers, and excellent staff! The people at the desk couldn't be any nicer and more welcoming. The bartender was super kings too! The breakfast was hot which is usually an opportuinty at hotels. I'd def stay again.

Text: Good location. Room was nice, but Jolly Ranchers pieces suck on the carpet throughout the room, along with candy wrappers from previous guests. Staff never could remember there were 4 of us in the room, so we always had to ask for towels, shampoo and conditioner. Popcorn was always empty. Place was mobbed with various kids soccer teams. The central courtyard that the hotel is built around hosted a kids birthday party, which was loud, crowded, and made it difficult to navigate through the common areas. Kids playing on the elevators and kids unattended in the pool. On Sunday, it was woefully understaffed with the one staff person running extra towels up to the rooms. Of course, no popcorn--big bummer for my kids, since the machine was always empty the night before. Overall, very average hotel--nothing special.

Text: Incredible customer service! Kristy helped me out of a situation where I needed to cancel my room. She was absolutely non confrontational, and helpful in every way. Holiday Inn should be happy to have her on their team. Thank you again!
