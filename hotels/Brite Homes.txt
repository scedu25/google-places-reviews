Text: BUYER OR RENTER BEWARE!! If you are even considering purchasing a home, READ THE CONTRACT. One of the very first thing It states is "ALL VERBAL AGREEMENTS ARE HEREBY NULL AND VOID". MEANING - YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED. I was LIED TO about not only something as basic as the MONTHLY RENT but also lied to about each and every thing that was supposedly done to my home. All that was done in my home  - carpet cleaned by Stanley Steamer and paint thrown up on the walls and ceiling. I purchased a "fully refurbished home" just over a year ago. Thus far, I have had to invest almost a thousand dollars in the bathroom alone due to BLACK MOLD - which was UNDISCLOSED. I HAVE BEEN ILL EVER SINCE PURCHASING AND MOVING INTO THIS HORROR OF A HOME. There were TWO surrounds covered with black mold under the "new one" which was horrid. I had to have a REAL CONTRACTOR come in and tear the bath down to the studs and rebuild it. Surprise! My "brand new carpet throughout" is literally comes apart when cleaning with a standard vaccume cleaner. Have found out since that this new carpet has had THREE PREVIOUS FAMILIES LIVING ON IT - Surprise! There goes another 3 grand on new carpet. So this morning as I opened the mail, I found a demand to paint my roof. Woo Hoo!  Another Surprise!!  In total, I am spending more than 5 grand on a home that was "fully refurbished" before purchase - 13 MONTHS AGO!!! BUYER BEWARE - Evidently the owners - wherever they may be will only re-purchase a home at the a fraction of the price. There really is no choice as they will not allow anyone in the park that does not rent directly from them. So I will be hauling this  thing out of here as soon as I can. BUYER BEWARE!!!! PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FUNDS. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PURCHASE A HOME IN THIS PARK - unless you plan to yank it out. Like I do. I really see no other choice.
