Rating: 5
Text: One of the best fairs that I go to.  This year they had a lumber jack display  that was really good. The food is always first rate. If you go down to the dairy 2 barn you can get an ice cream cone for a 1.00. we ate at the barn next door and had the haystack dinner it was delicious. There are all kinds of deals if you look for them.   Great fun!

Text: Awesome fair!  Spoiled me for the state fair.  Famous Food Row says it all.  Farmers and 4-H students were friendly and tolerant of our city slicker questions.  Clean, well-landscaped grounds.  Free parking and shuttle to entrance.  I'm planning to return next year.

Text: The Elkhart County 4-H Fair is in the top three biggest county fairs in the US. It is clean, well organized, and entertaining for the entire family. Home to the famous food row, you will find something tasty for sure! The 4-Hers put in a lot of hard work on projects and livestock for judging and auction. The fair board also brings in top artists for music concerts and books all varieties of talented performers throughout the fair week. The Elkhart County 4-H Fair is the absolute best!

Text: It's a nice campground. There are RR tracks nearby. No activities unless you are there for the fair. Some of the sites are gravel and others are grass both are fairly level. Nice for a night or two.
