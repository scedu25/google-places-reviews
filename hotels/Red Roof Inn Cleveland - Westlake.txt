Rating: 4
Text: The Room was clean. The air conditioner did not work well. The bed was comfortable. Several lights in the Room were convenient. The motel as a whole really needs to be updated. Pricing was good. I would stay there again.

Text: The best room service ever. I was surprised to have this great service in such a small place. It is better than a lot of hotels.
