Text: We call to make reservations they said we had a spot we get there after driving almost two hours and they didn't have us a spot so they found us a place made us move four days later we had reservations to go somewhere else they told me that if I would stay they wouldn't move us again ...Well guess what these people are nuts they don't know how to run a business ...So my warning to pipeliners or to anyone going to stay awhile don't and I mean don't go there it sucks and there nuts..... Have a great time but not there

Text: Nice playground area. Fun activities for all ages. Stocked camp store with ok prices mostly. Entrance road is rutted badly and is ruff on campers and vehicles. One entrance in and out and with heavy rains it floods trapping campers either in or out. Kids like the pond. I'm not a pond person I prefer something cleaner looking like a pool. Sites are decent size mostly. Lots of seasonal campers and golf carts. Very busy and loud on weekends, especially holiday weekends are crazy & crowded. During the week quiet an peaceful. Band nights have lots of partygoer and drinkers. If you don't like loud music and dancing don't get a site close to the band shelter area. If that's your thing there are sites close for enjoying the music. Finally, the drinking water is awful and stinks. You can sit out by the campfire and hardly any bugs bite you. I've been to much worse but also some better.

Text: They were to lazy/busy to answer the phone to make a reservation to stay. Called multiple times during the day never was answered Horrible way to do business. If in the area again I will find a different place to camp.

Text: The pond is awesome. Kids will love it. There's also a playground. The roads in and out are narrow. Most people have golf carts.
