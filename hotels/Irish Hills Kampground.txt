Text: If you want a very basic, no frills, place to get away and camp, this is the place! We always go end of the season so it's always quiet - second year staying in 47C. The cabins are great. (Maybe bring a step ladder to get to the top bunk because they don't come with a ladder.. Kinda makes it hard to get to bed!) Owners are super friendly. The place needs some updating but it's a ton of work and they are getting it done bit by bit. ?

Text: EVERYTHING about this place is run down. Nothing works properly. The office is never open and everything seems to be an inconvenience to the owners. After decades of camping this is the worst place I've stayed. Pool is okay, game room is terrible, lake access is terrible. Pond is terrible. There are feral cats that wander around the area that the owners feed so be prepared for that. With so many other options within a few mile radius do yourself a favor and go to one of those.

Text: This is the worst experience iv had at a campground in my life. I have been here when the previous owners owned it and was a finely run establishment. Now with the new owners they are rude, they feed stray cats which proceed to invade camp sites, and won't take into account for extenuating circumstances. The bathroom walls are falling apart wires exposed on the ceiling, and filthy. The porta-potties are worse. The female owner lied about the stock in the pond.  The pool is dirty and only cleaned once a day with no cover for it. This campground is obviously too much for them to handle. Campers beware of this place, go somewhere else.
