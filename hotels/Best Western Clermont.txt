Text: Our room was clean and very neat.  The only thing I can critique is the remote didn't work.  Otherwise everything was great.  Good area for our dogs to do their "business" plus poo bags.  Will definitely stay here on our next visit. Thanks

Text: Jessica has us near the lobby AS WE ASK but when the Manager came out of the office she changed our room to far away. There were maybe 6 other cars the whole time we were there. They also put a loud family with 3 small children right above us. NOISE!!!! There were lots of empty rooms!!!
The room was nice, beds comfortable and breakfast extremely good!

Text: We did not have an advance reservation and were so relieved to find that there was still a room available.  Receptionist was very friendly.  Bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked well.  Breakfast was a lovely experience in the beautiful room off the lobby - clean and bright!

Text: I give this hotel a 5 star rating because of all the little things they did to make this the best stay at any hotel I have gone to in a long time.  The whole experience far exceeded it star rating.  I would not only recommend, but I would definitely like to stay here again.  I also left a wonderful lasting impression to make me want to choose a Best Western hotel if they are all like this one. You would not be disappointed if you choose to stay at this hotel.
