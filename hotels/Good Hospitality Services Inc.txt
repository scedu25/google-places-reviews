Text: Having worked with Jeff Good and Good hospitality I found it to be a terrible experience.

Jeff is abusive, belittling, and tries to be a bully.  His favorite saying is "He who had the gold rules" and he will not pay you until he sucks ever benefit he can out of you.

Beware of this guy and his company.
