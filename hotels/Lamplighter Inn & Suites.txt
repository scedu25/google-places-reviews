Lamplighter Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: I stay here when I come in to town to visit my daughter and grandson. The rooms are always clean and the room price is competitive- with a Comfort Inn & Holiday Inn across the street usually priced much higher- they offer much of the same amenities with the exception of an indoor pool (but they do have an outdoor pool). So, you'd be wise to book here and save some money if the indoor pool isn't a requirement. I found the beds to be quite comfortable and rooms clean. Their breakfast is plentiful with lots of options and included with your stay. The staff has been consistently friendly and helpful.

Text: We had a great stay at Lamplighter Inn. The rooms are older, but they were VERY clean!! Our room even had a recliner in it. It was very comfortable. Tammy checked us in she was extremely nice and very helpful!! All of the staff were very nice and polite. The continental breakfast was very good!! The lady taking care of it kept it full and fresh. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who ask us. We would rate it 5 stars!!
