Harmony House Motel
Rating: 3
Text: The people are amazing that you will meet. The motel is working on updating its rooms slowly, the night clerk is the most awesome person I've met in years. As for the rest you get what you pay for but don't blame the employees. They work with what they are given. At the least its clean and cheap.

Text: Nice lady owner. Weekly rental with free tv and wifi is 5.00 dollars. No extras. They have weekky rentals and the price is valuable.

Text: No toiletries in room, no daily room cleaning, smells of smoke horribly, carpet in room thoroughly disgusting with stains of all sorts. The night check in person was phenomenal.

Text: Friendly staff but dirty rooms....very basic place; probably an ok option if you just need a place to crash overnight but nothing longer than a one-night stay
