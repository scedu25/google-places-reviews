Holiday Inn Express & Suites Topeka West I-70 Wanamaker

Text: We got a single king bedroom and the room I'd say was super nice. Lots of space and great  amenities. Appliances were all good looking and clean. Everything was pretty nice even the breakfast was good. Only minor issue was that there was a beer bottle cap and 2 wristbands in the room but like I said we found everything else to be good as gold.

Text: The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean, and the room was incredibly spacious. We were surprised by how much room there was including a two sink counter, a bar, and second bathroom connected to the living room area. The breakfast was good - the typical Holiday Inn fare. Overall it was easily one of the nice hotels I've stayed in, and I would definitely stay again.

Text: Clean, just like the one in Chicago.  The handles on the breakfast equipment could be cleaned once in a while and horrible on keeping the coffee filled.  However the room was nice and the staff friendly.
