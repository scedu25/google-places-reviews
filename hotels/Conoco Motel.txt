Text: Great service. The room is right next to the old office. A little loud at night being right on a main road. Great value for what it is.

Text: I don't recommend this place to stay. I highly recommend to drive to Kearney ( if heading west as I was) This is a pretty rough place and in my opinion not worth the money that they charge for a room. It is an older motel that has been abused and does not have the best cliental. I have stayed in some pretty rough areas around the country and this is one where I was worried that my vehicle would be broken into over night. Luckily that did not happen.
