Text: One star is being generous. The staff is virtually nonexistent, and if you can find one of them, they are anything but helpful. The rooms smell like rigor mortis, and the place is pretty run down. Good luck trying to get your receipt upon check out. Do yourself a huge favor and just don't check in.

Text: only stayed 1 night because I had to attend a funeral early the next day on a Saturday. If you want a basic clean bed, too tired to watch the many channels of cable, and can withstand the slow elevator for 3 floors, this is the place for you. It is located in the middle of several other fancier-better hotels; which is odd.

Text: Over all a nice hotel.  Night employees need training, and learn not to be rude to guest.  Had a couple other guest have the same experience as I did with the front desk night employee being very rude.

Text: I was unable to be refund. Hopefully I won't get murdered in my sleep. It's that kind of hotel. Added some pictures of what it really looks like here, not what the hotel added. Wish I could upload the smell of mold and BO. It nasty. Room and furniture in disrepair.  Wouldn't be so upset if they could of refunded my money. I hate it here and I'm scared.

Text: I was dropping someone off so I cannot speak for the rooms but the parking lot was accessible and the lobby was clean and well kept.
