It had pathetic slow WiFi as of this writing. I will let them know when I check out.
Also, the wood framing and metal door frames, combined with lack of insulation and rude guests, mean you here every footstep above and every door slam. God forbid you are underneath a family with kids. Or next to some idiot who does not sleep and has to go outside to smoke 5 times a night. I had both pleasures. This can't be fixed. Soooo... I will likely not be back. The HI Express next door was built at the same time and is likely to have the some noise issues.
