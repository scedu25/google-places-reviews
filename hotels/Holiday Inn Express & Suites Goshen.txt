Text: Front desk clerk was very nice and welcoming. The hotel was clean and in good condition. The beds were very comfortable. Free breakfast was great, better than most other hotels we've stayed at. They had a pancake maker and warm cinnamon rolls along with about anything else you'd want for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again!

Text: Overall, okay. The bed was comfortable and the front desk staff was friendly. They have a continental breakfast which was pretty typical. 

However, there was hair in the bathtub. They also lost our friend's reservation, but the staff definitely made up for it with a nice room for them.

Text: EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Andrea went above and beyond to ensure that I had a great stay.  

While helping me she had to assist a line full of customers and several repeated phone calls.  In addition to managing the front desk she cleaned a room (mine) when she could have easily sent me on my way.

While cleaning she would come back to the desk to check and see if any customers were waiting and then back to the room to clean.

She kept calm when most people would have been overwhelmed and probably thought "forget this, but the other f word."  I am sure she was overwhelmed but it never showed!!!  

I rarely write a review, but she needs one because provided SUPERIOR customer service .  

FYI, the hotel is great and the pictures are accurate.

Text: We booked a room and found out someone was in it. They wouldn't kick him out so we had to find another hotel. The people are really nice though but this should'nt have happened!
