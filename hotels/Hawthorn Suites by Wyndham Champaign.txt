Text: DON'T EVER STAY HERE! My sister and her family are traveling 16 hours because our father passed away last night. She has 3 kids with her. On their way, she made a reservation for 1 night. When they got there, no room available. Oh and it gets better, they ask for a refund and will just somewhere else....no big deal, right? No, the hotel tells them they can't refund the money. Ok they can't refund the money, my sister is standing there with her 3 children, we just lost our father and you are going to argue with them at 1 o'clock in the morning? Is this even legal?

Text: In door pool and in hot tub.  Although the hotel is older, but it is kept pretty clean.  Hotel should invest on replacing all faucets and carpets, although it is clean, just looks OLD.  Breakfast here is definitely a big plus.  It is included with hotel price, and have a custom omelette for you.  Breakfast buffet is not bad as well.

Text: Clean, spacious and convenient.   Things I'm looking for when traveling.  On a hot weekend I appreciate the A/C working great and housekeeping doing a great job with a slightly older property.
If I had one issue, I had hoped they would have had the full breakfast out earlier as they accepted youth sports groups that can have early leave times.  I understand weekend hours vary from weekday hours but perhaps an exception could be made based on sales dept. related business. 
I recommend this property completely.
