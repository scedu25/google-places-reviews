Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is very modern and beautiful. The staff is professional and courteous. We stayed in a suite on the top floor, the room was beautiful and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. Check out time was around noon. Has WiFi. Offers breakfast in the morning. We spent a lot of time next door gambling at the casino, was a great experience.

Text: Such a nice new hotel. Very clean and modern. Front desk staff were very kind and professional. Rooms are a good size. Bathrooms are clean and modern. Everything works as it should. Feels very safe even with it connected to the casino. We just stopped in while traveling and got a two queen bedroom on a Sunday night for $99. Such a great price for the whole package. Easy to recommend.

Text: Love this place. Always clean and the staff is amazing, especially the girl that checked us in.  Can't think of her name, but it started with an A.

Text: Very nice hotel and staff. First room I stayed in was very impressive for Hampton Inn, the second room...not so much. Just depends on how much you want to spend and how big of a room you want. Having a casino next door is a big plus as well.
