Richmond Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Best value in the Richmond area. Clean reasonably priced room. I'm from Florida and Richmond is my home town. I visit once a year and would not stay anywhere else. Joe is friendly, accommodating and always there if you need help or have questions about directions or the area. Thanks Joe
Highly recommend Richmond Inn & Suites. I'll be back.

Text: Great staff... great room for the price... very clean and in good condition... fridge, microwave, coffee maker, shampoo (big plus for me bar soap dries out my skin). The owners are very friendly.

Text: Great hotel, overall, not new, but very clean.  Management went above and beyond to return a toiletry bag, having it shipped to my home.

Text: Never saw the room. Manager was unhelpful, claimed my reserved room was not available and was charging a "pet cleaning fee" for my certified therapy animal.
