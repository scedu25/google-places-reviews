21c Museum Hotel Louisville
Rating: 5
Text: Very fun hotel that edges between boutique and fully luxury. The art gallery is a very enjoyable feature of the hotel and the rooms are also very nice and large. The only downer was that for such a large room that the bathroom had a simple tub shower and the toilet was shoved in a corner super close to the sink. The bed/mattress was very good though and it had a full sized desk area to get work done and a comfortable chair so I'm mostly willing to overlook the "miss" on bathroom design.

Text: Art defines this museum hotel, and some of the it is truly wonderful in my eyes. The overall vibe is one of... almost exhibitionism, with a creepy flair. Not my cup of tea. But I loved the dry/wet sauna in the basement!! And the bed was perfectly comfortable.

Text: The galleries they had on display this time were about pop culture and I definitely loved it, from striking cinematography to sequin portraits. The museum seemed to capture the theme, as well as having a few permanent exhibits that are always entertaining. One of the best features of the museum is it's price, free!! Would visit again when new exhibits come.

Text: One of the most interesting hotels I've stayed at. Staff were all super helpful, friendly and professional. Room was very nice, shower was great. I just wish the fitness center was larger and had some more equipment.
