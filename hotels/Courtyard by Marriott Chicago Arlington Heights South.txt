Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Arlington Heights/South
Rating: 5
Text: I was very impressed with this Courtyard. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I've never been to Chicago before and they suggested numerous places in the area to try. Rooms were very clean and updated. Lobby and restaurant area were spacious with small private nooks facing the courtyard. The carpeting in the hallways had a really fun design. I'll definitely stay again here my next trip into the area.

Text: Stayed here a few times. And I've never had any customer service like what tucker and fabion have to bring to the table always respectful and the times I've checked in were pretty late it's not easy working third shift and these guys don't let that ruin their attitude or mood love it definitely will be staying here more often!! Thanks to Tucker and fabion !
