Text: Clean! Friendly and helpful staff! Decent breakfast options including hard boiled eggs, apples, oatmeal and coffee. Only 4 stars because bathroom is not updated and shower head points at my neck (I'm 6 feet tall ). I'm here for business and will be staying here again.

Text: Have come here many times. They have clean rooms, good breakfast, and they allow dogs to accompany your stay (of course there is a fee, but very reasonable). I only rate a 4 because I have only stayed in winter. Summer service is unknown.

Text: Super Hotel!
We stayed here and found our visit very pleasant!  The staff are very friendly and the hotel was fantastic.  We took a dip in the pool, and slept comfortably!
