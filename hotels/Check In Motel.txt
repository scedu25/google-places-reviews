Text: Clean, comfortable and friendly staff, also reasonable rates. There were grills in the yard so we were able to grill and eat while we watched the eclipse. Great experience !

Text: Great price for a clean room. Service was as expected. Wifi was fast enough to stream 720p Youtube videos and never dropped. Staff was was present. No credit card was needed but did have to but a deposit down I got back in the morning. Cheapest hotel in Falls City and again clean and clean surroundings outside. Only down side check out was at 10 unlike generally every motel I have ever stayed at. I would recommended them to anyone who asked for a motel in this area.
