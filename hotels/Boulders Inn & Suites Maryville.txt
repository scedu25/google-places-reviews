Text: Very nice hotel. It was very clean, the staff was incredibly nice, and overall it was a great experience. The workout room was very small however, but that was the only issue I found. Great stop if you are wanting to play golf right there.

Text: The hotel itself was average, but since everything was brand new and in such a picturesque setting it felt much nicer.  The friendly staff are what really makes the place stand out.  They are very service oriented and even asked us what we preferred for breakfast.  Rooms have mini-fridge, microwave, and large flat screen TV.  I would highly recommend.

Text: Everything is new as the hotel just recently opened. Everything was very nice. The hotel staff was friendly and professional. There weren't a lot of hot breakfast options, but there were plenty of other breakfast choices to make up for it.

Text: Need place to eat and a pool since there is nothing close to the area it would be nice ! Also the fitness room is a closet I would say either expand it or close it down and use the space for something else ! Staff was good though
