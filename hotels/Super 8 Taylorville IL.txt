Text: The room was disgusting. Stained sheets, mold in the bathroom, garbage behind the nightstands, etc. Take your business elsewhere.

Text: I absolutely love this motel. The manager is super nice and easy to get along with. The rooms are really clean. I am so happy that they are under new management. I will definitely come back and stay next time we come to visit.

Text: This hotel recently has switched owners. I previously had a bad review up of this property due to the old management being dishonest and not refunding my pet deposit/Cash deposit. I decided to give this place another chance and I am glad I did. I was welcomed by Saban the new manager. He treated us fairly and the rooms where clean and the beds are comfortable. Housekeeping staff amazing. Would recommend to those in area.
