Martin House Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Agree with positive reviews of others. Stopped here on our way from Colorado to Illinois for just one night. You can't beat this place for clean, quiet, and inexpensive place to stop. Reminded me of the 1960's motels, friendly manager, room a bit small, but TV was up to date, plenty of hot water for shower and coffee in the lobby in the morning! Great place.

Text: Basic, clean, comfortable, not fancy, great price!! Quiet, pleasant small motel, maybe built in 1960's or 1970's,  but we'll kept and that is the charm! Medium sized room,  Large bathroom, large closet, microwave, fridge with freezer. And CLEAN!!
