Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Omaha/Old Mill
Rating: 5
Text: Off of 680 in a quiet corner with no traffic. The rooms are large, and the kitchenettes coke pretty well stocked, although you may want to pack a bottle opener just in case. Full size fridges work well. Some rooms may look a little...tired (?) But the service is topnotch- and you get dinner through the week!

Text: Theres a terrible smoke and pet odor to the building. It was a very unwelcoming smell and did not make a good impression. We were really disappointed when we were checking in and thought of staying elsewhere. It's a smell that's throughout the whole building and nothing can mask it. It should be a nonsmoking, no pet hotel. The kitchenettes were decent but it's very poorly supplied. The meals provided were not impressive. The parking lot was dirty and not well kept. The staff were welcoming and friendly.the location is close to everything and makes it convenient. Overall, we wouldn't recommend this hotel to our family or friends.

Text: As usual this hotel is comfortable, clean, and with a great staff. The midweek dinners are welcome and if you need to stay here for awhile the kitchenette in the room is handy.

Text: There was a leak next to our heating/cooling system that drenched the clothes I had laid on the floor. We were moved to another room only to find the same leak! Not a big deal and my clothes dried out quickly, but neither of the rooms were particularly clean. There were some crumbs on the floor that could have easily been cleaned up by a vacuum, the showers in both rooms were dirty, and the soda vending machine was out of order. The continental breakfast was pretty nice though.

I'm usually a bargain hunter when it comes to hotels but even for the prices here, I probably wouldn't come back to this hotel unless it came under new management.
