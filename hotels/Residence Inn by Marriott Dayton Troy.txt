Residence Inn by Marriott Dayton Troy
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms were very big and clean. Little touches like the mints and microwave popcorn were a nice touch. The hotel staff was always friendly and courteous. Free parking and wifi were great and we loved the breakfast options in the morning. I would definitely stay there again!

Text: The Troy Residence Inn, right off the main highway in little Troy, Oh, has been my home away from home for a total of 8 weeks throughout the years I've been coming here. They recently remodeled and the whole Inn has a very modern comfort type of feeling now. Of course they have the standard amenities that hotels have, such as a free breakfast bar and a social hour event with free food and drinks, but where this place shines is the service. There are no shortage of employees here that are completely willing to assist you at any hour of the day. During my last few stays, Alisha has been at the front desk. She has always helped me with any issues I have as quickly as possible, and always with a smile. All in all, this hotel is actually a great find in Troy. The rooms are clean, updated and roomy. I'll continue staying here during my visits to Troy.

Text: Great check-in staff. Unfortunately when I asked for second comforter (2 people 1 bed) later in the evening to be comfortable, they refused to get us one. 1st morning. Waited for breakfast to be ready 45 minutes past opening time.
