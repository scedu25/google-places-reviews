Text: Not at all what I expected.  Expected peace and quiet -- did NOT get that -- between dogs off leash to NOISY golf carts to the constant passing of cars -- and NO we weren't even close to the entrance. We faced a "camper" that was grand central and obvious here for more than 2 weeks.  Great location -- may be a great place if you have a carload of children and noise reduction headphones.
