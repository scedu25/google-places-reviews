Text: Loved our stay at the Red Creek Mini Lodge. Doesn't matter if you are an outdoor or indoor person, this cabin is the place for you. It has everything and is very clean. Couldn't have been more satisfied.

Text: We have been vacationing in Hocking Hills for over 15 years and have stayed at Wyrick's lodges five times between 2009-2017. Always a great experience for our family vacations. Clean cabins with all the extra touches, including a clean hot tub and stack of firewood ready to go.

Text: We stayed at the pleasant valley property 6/14 the house was so cute the property was beautiful, it was conveniently located. The down fall- There was a very rowdy mouse that kept us up most of the 2 nights we were there. We bought traps from the Walmart there but couldn't catch him.... After a day of hiking we were looking forward to sitting in the yard in the country sun but 10 min later someone came in a loud tractor to mow the yard (which was already manicured well) Even after he saw us he continued to mow for 3 more hrs. We couldn't even hear each other over the noise much less enjoy some outdoors at the property. That was very disappointing, seemed like it would be a common courtesy to wait until the cabin was vacant to do yard work.
