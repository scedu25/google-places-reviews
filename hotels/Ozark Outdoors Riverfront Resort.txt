Text: We absolutely love this place. We usually tent camp and have our favorite spot but last night we decided to stay in one of their cozy cabins.  It is very cute and cozy.   Has everything you need, a covered porch, fire pit.  Comfy bed.  Full bath.

Text: This place has so much to offer. Definitely check them out on the web. 
All of the staff we came upon were most helpful and friendly. They truly love their job. 
The owners, Bear and Tera, are the friendliest folks of all. 
Make a visit. You'll be pleased.

Text: Well laid out camp sites and very clean. The facilities, bathroom and showers are well constructed and very clean. Well stocked general store but do not sell alcohol, which is understandable. Plenty of float choices. The tube float runs the length of the camp site which is a hour float. Over all an enjoyable campers resort. Plenty of things to do other than floating. Hiking, zip lines and onadago cave is just across the river.

Text: Absolutely LOVE this place. Cheap tubing + clean campgrounds. They have a family camping section and "party" section. Pick your poison. :) Friendly staff, and the bus drivers are fun and outgoing. Everyone seems to love their job. Can't wait to see you guys again!

Text: Lower than low. The owner bought power poles from me to build a zip line. He was told the proceeds were going to a kid with cancer. I left the state. He took advantage of this fact. He got the poles and took 4 months to pay, and then only paid half the amount agreed upon. So he cheated a kid with cancer. So if you go on a zip line ride, think of the kid that this uncaring, greedy owner ripped out of much needed money. At least he got half, right? I wouldn't support such trash. I ought to call Channel 5 on his company.
