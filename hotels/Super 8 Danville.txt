Text: Teresa was the manager on duty and was so sweet and accommodating. She went out of her way to help us. We needed a room to clean a sick baby and she went above and beyond to help us clean her up. The room was lovely, updated with local photography adorning the walls. The vanity was outside the bathroom. I prefer this for ease of getting multiple people ready. Would definitely stay here.

Text: Decent price. Nothing too special to say either way. It was pretty clean and good for a quick night sleep while on the road.
