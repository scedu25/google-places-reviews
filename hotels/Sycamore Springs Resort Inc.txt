Text: This place is a hidden gem in Kansas.
Has old roller rink, miniature golf, playgrounds mineral springs Indians called healing waters, great shaded camping spots
With utilities and a Hotel built around 1920 that's like going back in time if you stay there. Church with oldest pipe organ in Kansas.

Text: If you want a great place for your family to get away from the electronics, this is it.  Fabulous place to enjoy camping and lots more with the bonus of being within 10 minutes of Sabetha in case you foever something you just can't live without.  Our family has been camping here for years and honestly we would live here full time if we could get a remote work job.  The cell signal is very weak in the campground but up on the nearby hill it works fine.  For our family this works out fantastic!  With things like putt putt, skating rink, playgrounds and hay rack rides, there's always plenty for the family here! Love this place!
