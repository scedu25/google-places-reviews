Text: Stopped here as we made our travel back. Very clean place. Lovely breakfast area. Super nice staff. Beds were comfy and rooms were a nice size. Fantastic price also! Great area near all different hotels and places to grab some food. Would recommend

Text: They allow pets. It's Not the Marriott but ya get what ya pay for.  Fridge, micro, and a teeny coffee maker. Standard breakfast. I wouldn't live here but it is fine for overnight.  Even non smoking rooms are smokey.

Text: Well got there around 430am- called the day before or so and was told whatever time we got there we can check in..--- gentleman at the counter said my reservation was marked as a no- show and my Cc has been charged..Not too happy.. Seems my room was given away. A member of my group had a service dog..There were no double queen rooms for pets available..just a smoking room...Not sure what difference was ..just needed place to sleep ...Took the smoking room anyway..Not too bad..was clean..After we were there like 1/2 hr.sounded like a large compressor kicked in. Like sleeping on top of large beer cooler...room second floor end of hall think was 226... Not the worst stay...

Text: A typical 2 star hotel, nothing fancy but a cheap nights rest. The room was decent/clean, and the front desk staff was friendly. Continental breakfast was free. Would book again.

Text: Really clean and nice rooms. Would be five stars but there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. There was a room safe and free breakfast.
