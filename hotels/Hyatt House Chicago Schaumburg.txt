Hyatt House Chicago/Schaumburg
Rating: 5
Text: We needed a place to stay for our family of 4 after a fire at our house. After looking at a number of places, we were impressed with how warm and friendly all the staff was. They went out of their way to help us as we dealt with our situation.  We stayed for 10 days until we went to rental housing. 
Outstanding staff.  Thanks for all your help.  Hope management reads this review.

Text: Convenient location for Northwest suburbs, driving or public transit to the city, or even walking to nearby restaurants and bars. Plenty of parking, which is free. Good variety of options for breakfast buffet, including my favorite, the omelet station. The bathroom spacious but provides little storage and the lighting is not very flattering. Rooms provide enough floor space to work out, which makes up for the relatively small gym. The evening socials are convenient but are not open very long. Good internet speeds. Self service coin laundry very convenient for constant travelers like ourselves.

Text: I stayed from 10-15-2017 through 10-20-2107 for Business Training and traveled in from Columbus Georgia.  I left my hair dryer in the room and called the next day and spoke with the House Keeping manager and he stated that he would over night it back to me.  I have contacted them 5 times and they have stated that my dryer was on it's way and will not give me a tracking number. Here it is November 7th and no Hair Dryer that has a $100.00 value.   What kind of Hotel are you guys running??  Never again!!

Text: The location is perfect if you are looking somewhere to stay with a lot to do. The rooms were extremely clean, and pretty awesome that they are suites and have everything you would need to cook a meal. The beds were really comfy and I didn't want to get up! I would stay here again.

Text: Excellent service! The front desk staff was absolutely amazing. Without me even requesting it she offered me a free upgrade to a suite with 2 rooms to give us more room since I was traveling with my 3 young kids. Clean, nice rooms. Clean hotel, clean pool. Great price. Staff were very helpful and friendly when we were looking to order food. Staff offered to assist with luggage and the return of the luggage cart. Very happy with my !
