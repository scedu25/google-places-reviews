Carrollton Inn

Text: The owner was very nice. I needed to do a load of laundry because of traveling on my bicycle across country, & he said they would do it for me. I was impressed with their kindness. Room is spacious and great to rest in. If your used to staying at the penthouse in the Peninsula down town Chicago, ($2300 night) , this place is not for you. If needing a place to stop, highly recommend.
