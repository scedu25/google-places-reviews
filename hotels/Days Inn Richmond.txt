Days Inn Richmond

Text: Awesome owners and a great staff. Very helpful and considerate. Will do everything in their power to make sure that your stay is smooth and easy as possible. By far best hotel on exit and probably best hotel in Richmond. That is taking price, room cleanliness, accommodations, and hospitality all in to account. You can find nice rooms and better amenities at other hotels but you will also pay for those too. If you want to lay your head down in a clean room and get up and go, then this is the place for you.

Text: I've stayed at the Days Inn Richmond Kentucky for 2 weeks August 31st through September 15th. The rooms are very clean the people are very nice and very accommodating. The  price is extremely reasonable. I read other reviews I do not agree with those whatsoever while I was here I did take the time to walk around the motel several times it's really close to different restaurants and convenience stores. The other rooms that I was able to see into we're very nice indeed they've all been recently updated nice large TVs the linens are fresh crisp and clean. overall I would have to say I will recommend this hotel and if I'm ever in the area this is where I will be staying again. Thank you to the Days Inn Richmond Kentucky

Text: My family and I were looking for a quiet place to crash for the night, we saw the Days Inn sign off the interstate. I have stayed at other Days Inns before, but this one here in Richmond Ky was superb. The customer service was exceptional, checking in was quick and easy, no waiting. The staff was very knowledgeable about their job. What really surprised me is what type of room I wanted. Being a smoker, they had one on the ground floor, #130, next to the pool which we really enjoyed. The room had been remodeled with newly updated bedding and furniture, everything was as cozy as could be. I have read past reviews of other guests who have complained of bugs, bed bugs, etc, to my surprise I had no issues and like most people would do check room before occupying it. I will clear this up with one last comment, I myself have been working in the hospitality field since 1996, so I'm to say that this Days Inn here in Richmond Ky is deserving of the 5 Star Rating that I have given and when back in the area, will definitely be my place to stay. Noteworthy to mention is checking out was a breeze and the continental breakfast was excellent.
