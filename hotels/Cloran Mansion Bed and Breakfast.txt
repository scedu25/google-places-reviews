Cloran Mansion Bed and Breakfast

Text: I want to state that I tried to deal directly with the owners privately. I am well aware that there is a large amount of good reviews.When  they charged me an additional $38.00 over the $200.00 gift certificate is when I realized they have gotten away with being mediocre and money hungry far to long.My husband and I have spent over 30 nights away from home in this last year, I have never had an experience like this. We arrived at 3pm and got out of bed, packed, and drove over 2 hours home in the dark at 1015pm. That is how bad it was, we couldn't force ourselves to "ride it out" til morning. The decorating is distasteful and uninspired with colors reflecting the 80's peach, green and rose. There is a large amount of Asian beetles flying throughout the room, a few bees as well from a nest  in apple tree outside window. The mini blinds do not operate properly, when you do get them up, they are cock eyed and a cloud of dust appears.The Jacuzzi tub is small, out dated and takes forever to fill, . because water lacks adequate  pressure and temperature.The small black hairs by faucet really freaked me out! There is a rusty mark, from the rusty non functional led candle in corner of tub and towels were musty, dusty as well. There isn't a comfortable chair in the room. The rug by the side of the bed bunches up the minute you step on it. There's some dollar store cheap popcorn available and large selection of DVDs to watch on your super small 20 inch TV. The ceiling fan makes a loud clicking sound that is sure to keep you awake as you wait for it to fall on your head.The entrance way was a cluttered mess, The dining room table you couldn't put another thing on it, but I'm certain you can write your name on several surfaces in the place.Clutter and dust everywhere, poorly maintained by the elderly couple who stated they like to go golfing.The owners act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to stay there! He was very arrogant and pompous as he wasted several minutes explaining how to use the cable service which was clearly explained on a card by TV. Which he then pointed out!! He truly enjoys the sound of his own voice. When Carmine attempted to discredit my complaints he became blaming, stating the ceiling fan was fine on low. He seemed to be gloating that he had taken my money!! I did not ask for anything in return for my dissatisfaction, good thing since they offered nothing and actually charged me more money after I complained. Stay at Alice Snyder House for around $100.00 a night! The Steamboat house is light and airy at around $150.00 a night. Stay away from this second rate B&B !!
