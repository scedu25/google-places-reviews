Text: Thanks Covered Wagon. For a clean and warm bathroom for our 2, a week apart stays. It was a quiet neighborhood but to cold to walk far.

Text: Fabulous RV park. We arrived after hours, but the owner came out and personally escorted us to our space. Then in the morning he came by the RV to let us pay as it was pouring rain. Talk about personal service!  Love it!

Text: This is a great campground.  The owner (KC) is awesome! Very friendly atmosphere, clean bathhouse, clean laundry facility, nice pool area and horseshoe pit.  Plenty of area to walk your dogs.

Text: Nice park with trees, clean, decent facilities. The management is making an effort to upgrade everything. We saw groups gathered under the shelter enjoying each other's company or sitting beside their RV talking to other campers. It is not a resort, but it is a nice stop for your trip.
