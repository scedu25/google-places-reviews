Highlander Motel
Rating: 5
Text: We love the Highlander Motel for a very bare-bones (and often last minute) stay in Athens. It is very clean, and reasonably central to uptown. The bike trail meets the road a block away for a beautiful walk or ride to campus or The Plains!

Text: Located in a convenient, but quiet part of Athens that's just a mile walk to the bars. Rooms are very clean, but dated. Bed was comfortable, although sheets are quite thin. A/C pumps out super cold air.

Text: Less than 5 mins drive, 10 mins walk from court street. Not the best hotel room I've ever stayed in, but they were only used for showering and sleeping. I'd stay there again.
