Staybridge Suites Detroit - Novi
Rating: 5
Text: Haven't been too many hotels, but this one was great! There's a dishwasher, stove, and full size fridge in case you need it, and great WiFi. In the morning there is a very good continental breakfast with many options such as eggs, sausage, bacon, different breads/bagels, coffee/juice, cereal, and more! There is also an evening food bar in case you get give at night. Hotel room and services were great, and the room is always very tidy. All in all, excellent stay.

Text: Great room. I had a suite with a king-sized bed with a kitchenette and living room. The suite was well laid out and clean. The pillows are til soft for my preference but I slept well. There was a breakfast buffet and several times each week there is a happy hour. Staff is friendly and there is a 24-hour convenience shop if you need anything.

Text: Clean and home away from home.
Real hot breakfast food.
Has a kitchen in each room.
I did not care about the matress but this is because I would rather soft mattress. Cozy seating area with fireplace in the loby, the room we stayed in this time was a queen bedroom,  it is better than a studio appartment. I love this hotel this is our forth time staying in this location( Novi, Michigan).
I would look for staying in Staybridge in any other location for our next vacation.
