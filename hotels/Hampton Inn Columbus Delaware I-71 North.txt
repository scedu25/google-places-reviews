Text: The desk consiage was so busy on the phone. So we were lined up to check in. We wanted to pay cash, she was not pleased. The checking in was the only poor experience. The room was nice, and clean. Good breakfast.

Text: Clean clean clean!!!!!    Great job with this hotel.... New rooms, beautifully decorated, easy on and off the highway, several places to eat close by...gas stations...safe location...and using the "digital key" for my room and check in and out on the Hilton app makes everything extremely convenient!!!    Oh...and the breakfast...hot and fresh...love the extra creamer flavors for my coffee!!  Thank you for a great stay!!

Text: Drove all night to because daughter was in labor. First, no one was at the desk for several minutes so went to check rate at another hotel. Came back and was told would have to pay full rate from 6:30 am until 11 am (same day) checkout and the pay full rate to stay until next day. When i told the the competator next.door would let me check in at 7:00 am and stay until 12 noon following day for a 1 day rate, i felt they thought i was making it up. Left and stayed at Holiday Inn Express.

Text: Very nice hotel/motel appears to have been recently remodeled, not worth $169.00 per night. Bath vanity higher than normalmaking it hard to use by shorter people. Shower head hiegtht great for really tall people. Towels on top shelf is also hard for short people to reach.

Text: Staff were very friendly, above and beyond what I expected. I left my inhaler and breather tube behind and they packed it in a box and sent via fed ex along with a complimentary towel (I arranged and paid for shipping). Desk clerks were helpful and responsive making a potentially stressful process easy.
Room was also great, large new TV with good channels. Fridge, microwave, comfortable bed  and large bathroom. Breakfast above average.
