Text: Quaint, quiet, friendly & clean. Restroom cleanliness was great. There was even a small basket of hotel sized soaps & shampoo. Our dogs loved walking with us on the wooded path. Stayed 2 nights & will stay again if we come this way.

Text: Fantastic place.  Only stayed 1 night as we were just passing through, but I would happily stay here again.  Everything clean, quiet and peaceful, and very nice owners.  I highly recommend this campground.
