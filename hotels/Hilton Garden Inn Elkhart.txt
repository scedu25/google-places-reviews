Hilton Garden Inn Elkhart
Rating: 4
Text: The location is close to the high way and easy to access. The rooms are fairly standard within the price point but the bed are comfortable and the pillows don't disintegrate immediately upon laying on them which is nice. The water pressure is good and the water is hot. Didn't really utilize any services while I stayed but the front desk staff were friendly and expedient.

Text: Some friends and I were staying here for a Wedding. A couple of us had to add one more night to our stay when we were supposed too check out and they made it very easy to do so. Overall, the staff was always helpful and personable. Even at 3am, the night shift at the front desk was ready to help and easy to talk to. Not as expensive as some other Hilton related hotels and not quite as fancy, but still just as comfortable.

Text: I've enjoyed my stay so far. The rooms are a bit smaller than the usual Hilton rooms, but it is Elkhart. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast is delicious. My only issue, our room had an ant problem. I told the front desk associate, and she offered to switch is rooms. Accommodating, and friendly.

Text: Had a great meeting there. The projector we had was blurry and could have improved.
