Text: While we only stayed here briefly, everything was great. The room was clean, and stylishly decorated. We were able to print our boarding passes easily from a computer in the lobby. Be warned, the bottle of water in the room costs $4 of you drink it, but it is fairly clearly marked.

Text: Overall a good stay. Quiet, clean and comfortable beds. Be warned that as of 11-16-2016 the hotel is under construction, so you may experience inconveniences related to that (I didn't experience any).
