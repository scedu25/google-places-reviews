Candlewood Suites Manhattan
Rating: 5
Text: I enjoyed our stay here. The location is great and has many food and entertainment options (from Museums, to Movies, to a Mall) all within less than a 5 minute walk. We were here for my husband's work conference and also visited family in the area. The room was nice and spacious and as in the name, suite style with extra amenities. Our room had a kitchenette with coffeemaker, stove, oven, microwave and full size fridge/freezer. There was also basic dish and cookware. All appliances were newer and seemed in good working order The bathroom was a good size and nicely had a hair dryer included. The bed was large, clean, and comfortable. The large desktop areas were great for working or eating. The TV was modern and a good size. While we didn't use the hotel amenities such as a gym, business center, laundry center and convince type store they were there if needed. Overall I'd definitely recommend Candlewood Suites if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay and like to have lots of options nearby.

Text: Room was great. Plenty of space for the toddler and dog to play. Little kitchen was perfect for making small, easy meals for our family. Great staff and located near the Discovery Center. Although the hidden gem was finding the community dollar splash pad and wadeing area right begging the hotel inn addition to a large, lush green space.
