Text: Beds not comfortable at all. Bathroom was dirty tub ect. Says continental breakfast it was a nutragrain bar. The room smelled like old cigarettes. Heat works great and lots of tv stations. I would say its worth $30-$44 stay.

Text: Room was dirty, as in clothes from previous night still under furniture, bathroom walls had what looked like blood on them, half the lights in room didn’t work. Bottom half of entrance door looked as if it had been attempted to be kicked in. Bathroom mirror looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks. 

 If I hadn’t arrived so late in the evening I would have literally walked back out and paid for  another room at a different hotel. 

Their rooms are non refundable as well. Sononce you reserve a room there’s nongetting your money back.

Wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy

Text: The breakfast "cookies and coffee" is never on time because had to ask for it. It wasn't even cookies; was hard oatmeal pie or honeybun. The doors were not able to be sealed shut so could hear outside crickets or people ordering at McDonald's or Culver's. No public jacuzzi, only have two jacuzzi rooms.

Text: Not happy with the accommodations, it said it provides a continental breakfast but there is no such thing, a coffee n a cookie. The place is older, shabby and dingy could stand to be refurbished.

Text: Terrible. There was old food in our fridge. 
As for the beds, its like sleeping on a 12 inch stack of cardboard. Absolitely terrible. Worst nights sleep we habe ever had. The chairs at the sitting table were more comfortable. Double your money and stay at a decent chain of hotels.
