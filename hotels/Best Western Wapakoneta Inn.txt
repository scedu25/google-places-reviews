Best Western Wapakoneta Inn

Text: My issues at this hotel have as much to do with BestWestern Corporate as with the hotel.  Attempted to book online through Best Western's site.  After selecting dates the site automatically changed the dates to several weeks later.  Had to correct four times before the site accepted the correct dates.  The site then offered a discount (visit the site, there is a bar at the top offering a discount for booking now) but once selected it would not proceed.  Had to start over and forget the date changing issue several more times.  Finally booked the right dates (no discount rate) after multiple tries.

Arrived at the hotel only to discover they had the dates wrong (showed my arrival and departure dates one day earlier than booked).  I explained the issue but management at the hotel could not have cared less.  The hotel charged for the day prior to my arrival and charged an extra day for the day I had planned to depart.  No discussion, no discount, no credit.... nothing.  Just "pay for an extra day and like it" attitude.

I contacted Best Western customer service where I was informed Best Western does not refund room charges for any reason.  Even though I explained the issue with the website changing dates the response from customer service was "that is your problem, not ours" and "you should not have booked the room without verifying the date".  How is a consumer supposed to verify the date when the website shows it is correct but the reservation system changes it.

Overall, neither this hotel or Best Western (the chain) seem interested in anything except finding ways to overcharge.  There are other chains and other hotels that care about customers, this one and this chain do not.  Stay somewhere else.

Text: Very nice property to stay at when traveling along I-75.  Excellent breakfast, very clean room with a great mattress.  Would definitely stay here again.  The only thing is I hate having to pay 100.00 a night for a quick overnight along the highway, but I guess that is the new normal.  At least this property I felt was really worth it.

Text: This has always been a pleasant stop every time we have stayed in this hotel. We especially appreciate the swimming pool/spa and the very good breakfast before getting back on the road

Text: We found each area of the hotel that we visited (check in area, breakfast, bathrooms, pool, double queen room, and fitness room) to be very clean, and well taken care of.  The staff was cheerful, considerate, and went out of their way to make our stay perfect.    We also enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and found it to be a nice selection, and very tasty.
