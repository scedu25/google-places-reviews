Hampton Inn Columbus-South
Rating: 5
Text: The location was ideal being so close to the highway. A number of restaurants were a short drive away and one was in walking distance. My room was clean and the breakfast was adequate. Common areas were very clean and the hotel staff was pleasant.

Text: Decent. Recently remodeled. Breakfast was good and well maintained. Room was clean, well maintained, and smelled nice (the entire property has a great smell). 

Not the best Hampton I've stayed at but by far not the worst. Solid 4-stars!

Text: Room was huge and very clean. The breakfast provided was about the best breakfast I have eaten in a hotel. Was very good and had many choices.

Text: Lauren helped us with a last minute booking. She was so caring and made sure we had everything we needed and more for our stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We stayed in the king suite with the whirlpool. It's spacious and very clean. Like I said the staff is amazing as well.

Text: Had a room with 2 qeen beds. Clean and comfortable beds but very small room, hardly any space to walk. Reception lobby also very small. Breakfast decent. Lady taking care of the breakfast buffet was nice. Front desk staff was nice.
