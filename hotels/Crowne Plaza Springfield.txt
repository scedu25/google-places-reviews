Text: Great location near interstate and shopping. Rooms are modern, clean and well furnished. Breakfast and room service are both delicious, as well as the lounge/bar. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating. Would love to go back again. Visited on a weekend getaway for my anniversary and it was a wonderful time.

Text: I started in a room that smelled like a methane gas main had cracked, but they quickly moved me to another without any qualms and said that maintenance was looking into it. The new room was nice, big and comfy with a mini-fridge and and a leather couch. No weird noises and plenty of hot water. Great stay.

Text: We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Audra and the rest of the staff at Crowne Plaza. Audra was very professional, organized, and helpful with planning our wedding venue. She went above and beyond her duties to see that every detail was in order which made our wedding a day we will never forget. We met with her several times prior to the wedding reception to have the food tasting and go over specific details and answer any questions we had. The food by the Chef at the Crowne Plaza was very good, and he even made the bride’s dinner request of homemade corndogs! Because we had multiple guests from out of town, we utilized the hotel accommodations and enjoyed a post-wedding brunch the next morning. We have heard and continue to hear nothing but great reviews from our guests related to the food, service and venue for the weekend. We would highly recommend Crowne Plaza for future brides and grooms to have and enjoy a beautiful wedding celebration.

Text: Wish I could have have taken the mattress home with me!  Beautiful hotel, very comfortable room, convenient to all major attractions.  Can't speak highly enough about the staff - from check-in to breakfast to housekeeping to a late-night call for towels - all were wonderfully friendly, hard-working, and wanted to do everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We were lucky enough to be here for the Mother's Day Brunch - we highly recommend it!
