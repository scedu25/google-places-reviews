Text: Totally awesome stay at the Hampton Inn... The front desk staff knew I had driven all day with three kids and placed a small care package with chocolate milk and popcorn in the room as a nice little surprise. My kids loved it having been stuck in the car all day. Everything was clean and the stay was great... Definitely recommend staying here.

Text: 2 big issues with the rooms - the first is that the room coffee maker is in the bathroom literally a foot away from the toilet - GROSS!!!  The other issue is that the thermostat resets to the hotel's default temperature every time you go out.  This pretty much guarantees that you always come back to a room that is a different temperature than what you wanted.  I won't be using this brand again.

Text: Clean and comfortable. Very good free breakfast each morning. Front desk staff not as friendly and outgoing as other hotels. Booked the suite room and it was nice but the whirlpool size was small and disappointing. For that reason a bit overpriced.
