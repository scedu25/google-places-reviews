Text: We came there to evacuate from the hurricane from Savannah ga and with in 2 days I was moved to 4 different rooms. First room we walked in and it was dirty put into another room it was OK till my daughter started to play with a bloody tampon that was wrapped up in the blanket. The next room both double beds was filled with bed bugs they moved us the next day the house keepers just made the beds and cleaned the room didnt take care of the bed bugs at all. Never will I stay there again.

Text: For $59 what can you expect?? Fridge doesn't work, half of lights in room didn't work, holes in sheets, 1 washcloth, 2 towels (not real bath towels, more like big handtowels) but on the upside... I didn't stink, classic artwork and the staff was ok (not great, outside smoking when we arrived and not very professional looking) All in all not an awful stay but definitely could have been better.
