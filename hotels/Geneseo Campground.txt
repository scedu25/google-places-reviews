Text: We have been visiting the Geneseo Campground for a few years! The people are very nice! The bathrooms are clean and neat! They put washcloths in the bathroom , how kind to campers! The tent sites are neat and spacious! The cost to tent camp is good!  It is close to the Hennepin Canal Parkway State Park.  My kids were amazed to see the old locks there. Thanks Geneseo Campground! It was like a Christmas gift in  summer to find you!

Text: Got to the campground somewhat late in the evening, but received clear instructions over the phone about how to handle registration. (And upon arrival, I was pleased to see that registration would have been rather obvious even if I hadn't just spoken to someone on the phone.)  While filling out the registration form, one of the hosts walked by and said hello, pointed out a few things, and asked if we needed anything.  We were just tent camping for one night while driving across country.  The tent camping area is in the back.  The spots are close to one another, but separated by thick trees.  Each tent camp spot has room for a car and tents, plus a picnic table.  There is a porta potty nearby, but the bath house isn't a far walk.  The bath house was quite nice.  Well lit, well ventilated, good size, and clean.  The campground is not massive, which means it's nice and quiet at night.  We weren't there for long, but I wouldn't have any problems going there again or recommending this place to someone else.

Text: Very nice, very clean. Does what you need a campsite to do. Staff was friendly and helpful. I recommend being careful with the firepits when it's windy outside.

Text: Quiet, inexpensive. Very clean, well managed the owners are very friendly. Camp sites we're at little tight but no problems. Firewood and fire rings available, and plenty for the kiddies to keep busy.
