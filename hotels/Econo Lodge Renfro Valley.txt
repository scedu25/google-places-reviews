Text: The name basically says it all it's an economy place to stay it's reasonably priced for what you get unfortunately this location did not have a pool, never has and guess never will. The room was nice for the price a small refrigerator and small microwave, coffee pot inside. It came with your basic essentials, shampoo, conditioner, soap. The room was clean, it had maybe a 36 inch LCD TV, the bed was firm and very comfortable. The carpet was showing its age but it was still clean. The motel sits up on a hill so in the winter time could present a problem in snowy icy conditions.
