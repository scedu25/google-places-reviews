Inn At Irish Hollow

Text: We've been here once before a few years ago, and we loved it. We've been to a few B&Bs since, but nothing has compared. They pamper the hell out of you with incredible food and atmosphere, and just a something throw from Galena; where there's a bunch fun little shops along the main Street and places to check out. I highly recommend it!

Text: Has lost some of it's flare. The quality of the service has dropped since the last time we stayed here. We will not return.

Text: I had my eye on the Irish Hollow B&B for almost a year before we finally decided to go, and I am SO GLAD we finally booked our stay! Comfortable accommodations, great service, and amazing food. We will definitely be back!!
