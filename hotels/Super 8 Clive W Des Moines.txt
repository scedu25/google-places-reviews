Text: Stayed here on September 1st 2017. When I walked in I was greeted by 2 friendly clerks.. They were very helpful on where my room was . The room was very clean , clean sheets, clean linen. Internet was reliable. Breakfast had a good amount to choose from and was typical hotel breakfast. Great location right off the highway, gas station and few restaurants well within walking distance. Felt safe there.. would stay there again..

Text: Pretty good hotel for cheap price. Recently renovated. Easy check in. Typical continental breakfast. We requested non smoking room but ours smelled like it had recently been smoked in and the non smoking sticker had been torn off the door.
