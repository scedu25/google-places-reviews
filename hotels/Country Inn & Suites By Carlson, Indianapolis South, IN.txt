Text: Loved the recent decor updates. Fresh new contemporary furnishings, flat screen TV's and high end linens. Beds were very comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean. We felt the breakfast was a step up from the usual, with the inclusion of fresh cut fruit salad and quality coffee. Easy access to the highway, take out restaurants, a local bar and gas stations. Additional features include: free parking and free WiFi. This will definitely be our hotel of choice when travelling to Indianapolis.

Text: Mixed feelings about this hotel. We have stayed here 2 years in a row when we have traveled to Indianapolis. This time you could tell they were under construction, not a big deal. Everything seemed to be put away and cleaned up. Our room on 3rd floor had already been remodeled. Loved the updates!  We did end up finding a dirty sock tucked up under the bed skirt and a cigarette butt under the entertainment center in our room. Other than that our room was great! 
Breakfast on day 1 we had to wait for more hot food to be made because it was empty. Not a big deal. We waited. Day 2 breakfast again, no hot food. There was a couple people already waiting on food. No big deal, we will wait. At front desk I was told they were making more food. We waited just shy of an hour for food. During this time, breakfast ended. We were told "get what you want, breakfast is over. Eggs will be done soon " when he woman "Teresa" that was cooking came out I asked if eggs was the only thing she was bringing out. She said "yes eggs is all, breakfast is over it is 1030 " I replied with, I know but we have been waiting for over 30 minutes for food to come out. We waited another 25 minutes for scrambled eggs. Then we had aluminum foil in our eggs. What a waste of time. We also had to listen to terms complain the whole time because the eggs take too long to cook and she needed to get this cleaned up breakfast is over and she is still cooking. Well, if food had been out, we could have eaten and left well before then. 
After we picked out the foil and ate some eggs, we were leaving eating area and she apologized that the eggs too so long to cook. I didn't even respond to her because I was upset and didn't want to say something I would regret or something out of anger. 
I do believe we will try a different hotel next year.

Text: The hotel has been remodeled and it is VERY nice. The breakfast is included and is a large selection of both hot and cold food. The pool is nice and warm. The room was very clean and well decorated after the remodel. I will be back for sure.

Text: Place itself was fair as far as hotels go, nothing elaborate but far from the worst also. I booked this place with points so it was free of charge. Upon checking my credit card statement a few days after my stay I had a charge of $33. I did not authorize the charge. it is being taken care of as we speak(refund) and when I spoke to the customer rep she said that the credit card I used for incidentals was "accidentally" used upon checkout.  Seems like a very weird reason for a charge to appear. "upon checkout," what does that mean? I am under suspicion that this charge was fraudulently charged to me by the hotel(someone at the hotel) in hopes I would not see it. Accidents happen, but this one was sketchy, buyer beware.

Text: Newly renovated rooms and lobby. Very happy with our stay. The staff went above and beyond to help us. We've stayed here previously before they renovated and we're still happy.
