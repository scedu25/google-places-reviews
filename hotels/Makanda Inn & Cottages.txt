Makanda Inn & Cottages

Text: Stellar customer service, the inn keepers were super friendly & accommodating. The whole atmosphere was very cozy and as far as cleanliness goes, spotless, nothing left to be desired. There is also pretty decent parking and amenities so that shouldn't be any problem. This would make an excellent location to stay for a honeymoon or just a great get away for couples (or singles looking for a little peace & quite!). It was always quite and the area around there had some pretty good places to eat & shop. We did not stay in one of the more expensive, private cottages they offer, but based on what we were treated too in the inn (cheapest option I believe), I can only imagine they are a serious treat for anyone looking for a get away. They also offer breakfast if you pay extra with your booking, we did not do this so I don't have much more to say on the matter. We got truly lucky finding this place amongst a somewhat scarce area for hotels, places to stay (unless you settle for one of the 1 to 2 star motels). We will definitely be making an effort to stay here again in the future!

Text: I recently stayed at the Makanda Inn and it was an amazing experiences. I stayed in one of the suites in the main building. The room was tastefully appointed with the softest, most comfortable bed linen and towels imaginable. The room had a lovely view and the deck was a very nice place to start the day with delicious coffee thoughtfully provided in the room (the only downside is that the deck is not private). The rest of the main building is decorated with fantastic art and is very inviting. The breakfasts that are provided are out of this world great. Every morning (we stayed four nights) we were treated to a large, unique breakfast carefully prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients. The waffles with peaches were my favorite.  It would be hard to imagine a better location in Southern Illinois. The village of Makanda is an easy walk and has a great lunch spot, an ice cream stand, and some lovely shops. There are great hiking trails nearby and a slew of vineyards and orchards.

Text: We stayed here for a weekend while exploring the Shawnee Hills Wine Trail and Giant City State Park. This inn's location is perfectly situated for these activities, and is only about 10 miles from Carbondale. There aren't enough good things to say about our experience here. The property is literally in the woods, and the only sounds you hear while sitting on the balcony or back deck are those that belong in nature. The property managers are very warm and friendly, and more than willing to help. The food was organic, much was locally sourced, and it was all delicious. The room's decor helped us instantly relax (I especially enjoyed the river rock shower floor) and was cozy and comfortable. It was a wonderful experience and we'll definitely return!

Text: One of the best B&B experiences my wife and I have had.  Absolutely beautiful, modern, clean and enjoyable.  Breakfasts were fantastic and filling.  The hosts were friendly and very helpful with points of local interest and suggestions.  Environmental sustainability is a big draw for this B&B as well.  From the building materials to the in-room recycling.  Bravo.  We'll be back.

My wife and I have been on several trips to southern Illinois, but this was the first stay at Makanda Inn. We were looking for a quiet place to stay off the beaten path for our 5-year anniversary. I'm glad we found this place. We had one of the rooms in the lodge, and found it perfectly adequate. Bed was amazingly comfortable, shower was hot, and it was always quiet. We also really enjoyed the morning conversations over breakfast with Malcolm, Loraine, and the other lodge guests. This was our first stay in a B&B, and while I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, we really enjoyed the social aspect.

If you want to get out and find something to do, there are plenty of beautiful hiking trails right next door in Giant City State Park, not to mention countless others within a short driving distance. You're also right in the heart of Shawnee Wine Country. So do yourself a favor, find some time, and go visit Makanda Inn!
