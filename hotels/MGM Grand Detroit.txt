Text: We stayed for two nights and we found the rooms to be very upscale. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Everything was clean and organized. If I had to nitpick anything, the website said there was free coffee in the lounge area but we couldn't find any. Other than that, we have no complaints about our stay.

Text: Top quality hotel.. Very good service. However some restaurants not so good. Namely the buffet. Wednesday night's they used to have snow crabs now they have changed to a cheaper crab, disappointing. Also Tap"s not so good also. However the Steak house very good. Can not comment on the v club.

Text: I have been going to this casino for years, but had never spent the night. I finally did last night, and I was so impressed! Everybody was so professional and friendly. From the valet guys, to the reception desk, to the doorman, the room service guy. Everyone just so professional and friendly. Somebody sure knows how to run a business!

Text: Such nice rooms.  Great entrance.  Such happy staff.  Casino had no smoking rooms(unfortunately you have to walk through the smoking).  Beds were comfortable.

Text: I was there as a vendor setting up decor for a fundraiser. The only staff at MGM I interacted with were Ebony and Todd. Ebony was very helpful and friendly and went out of her way to assist with out questions and our needs. Todd, on the other hand was not only rude but outright nasty. He is like this at every single event without exception to every vendor working the event. Too many instances to detail here. If he continues to be employed there he needs to work in the back of the house where he does not have to interact with any human beings. He makes the event day absolutely miserable. Ebony should handle all interactions as she was professional, helpful and went out of her way to be there for the vendors.
