Text: Place is situated right off the highway though the road noise isn't really noticeable. Cleanliness though... was pretty bad. There were food crumbs everywhere. Odd large stains in the carpeting. Worst of all the stains in the sheets themselves. Wouldn't have noticed it had I not inspected the sheets before I got in them. Granted it was a $60 motel you should at least expect a minimum of a clean room. Not a bad price or location but I don't think I will be going back there again. There are much cleaner options out in Mountain Grove.
