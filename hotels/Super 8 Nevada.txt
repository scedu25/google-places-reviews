Text: The room was neat and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. They were able to let us check in early and able to get us a room near my other family members. There were some minor repairs needed to the room but the staff were of them and let us know before we got into the room. Only reason I have them 4 stars is because the indoor pool was closed for the winter, which was odd and a huge let down for my kids.

Text: A clean, updated room. The bed is very comfortable. Nice flatscreen in room. It is always nice to have a fridge in the room too. No complaints regarding service here either. The clerks were both very friendly! I stayed 2 nights.

Text: King sized non smoking room on the second floor. Had a mini fridge, 32" TV and a coffee maker. The bathroom is very tiny given the amount of room in the actual room itself. The counter around the sink is very small for two people to share. The bed was ok and the AC was enough to freeze us out, which we like. The breakfast consisted of watery gravy and biscuits, waffles and cereal. No fruit was provided. I would stay there again.

Text: Safe, clean, free WiFi. The bed's comforter was a little threadbare, that's the worst thing I observed. Decent place to spend the night.
