Hotel Blackhawk, Autograph Collection

Text: Stayed in bridal suite. Room was cozy and clean. Had shutters separating the bedroom and bathroom, so I guess that's good if you're into watching your SO do bathroom things. Bed was comfy. No bedbugs. Shower head was nice and high, good for us taller people. Very nice view of the river. Centrally located in Davenport, so that was convenient. Staff was friendly. Live music in the lobby when we went down for breakfast.

Text: One of this nicest hotels around.  Great staff and amazing rooms.  The pool and hot tub are great.  There is a bowling alley at the basement level which was a lot of fun.  This historic hotel has undergone a multi-million dollar restoration and all the rooms I've stayed in have been exceptional.  My only complaint is the limited parking but they do have valet service.

Text: I went here a few times for lunch and dinner. The food is amazing and the service is spectacular. I visited in one of the deluxe King rooms and it was incredible. It was like a freshly renovated apartment in there. The whole place oozes fancy. But the lunch menu is surprisingly affordable.

Text: Was in town for my nephew's wedding. I have to save pretty amazing Hotel by far one of the best I've ever been to. Staff were very friendly and informative. I have to have personal shout-out to the Bellman chris who parked my car because it was raining, and the front desk woman Carlita accommodating  my room request  so late. The bathrooms could be a little bit cleaner if I had to say something negative and honest. I will be recommending this hotel to my friends and family for when they come in town to visit. Thank you Black Hawk hotel for my amazing stay.

Text: Very Nice accommodations. Staff friendly, clean, my room was on par with top notch Vegas room with jacuzzi tub, large glass shower. Hotel lounge relaxing and tastefully decorated, bowling alley bar, pool table in lower level provided excellent entertainment. Great location near river walk. Fabulous running trails and river routes over river and back.Looks like some interesting bicycle routes can be had along river and into the country side. Progressive town with craft breweries to high end chocolates.
