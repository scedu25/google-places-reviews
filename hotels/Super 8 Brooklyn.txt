Super 8 Brooklyn
Rating: 4
Text: The banquet hall was very nice for the wedding I attended. It was clean. I didn't talk to any employees, so I'm not able to answer to any direct contact. My daughter and I were impressed by the looks of this Super 8. Not all Super 8's look as nice as this one in Brooklyn. I would stay there as a guest if I have the chance. I will even consider renting the banquet room. Very beautiful space to have a function.

Text: Very clean and cozy rooms. The staff is phenomenal in there, kindness and willingness to help and accomodat in any way they can. The complimentary breakfast is pretty limited. But, other than that the place is magnificent.

Text: I visited the Super 8 in Brooklyn to attend a open house party located in their celebration room. The room was large and had plenty of tables. In the front there was a small stage where a DJ could perform and a small dance floor. The celebration room also included a kitchen to store or make food in that was decently large. Being this is the second time my family has used this venue, I have not heard any complaints. It's priced fairly and the staff there were great. I highly suggest using this location.

Text: I was oon the waiting list hoping to get a room close to MIS.  They called me when they had a cancellation!  The timing of the call was superb.  The price was right and the staff were great. The facilities are nice, clean and fairly spacious.
