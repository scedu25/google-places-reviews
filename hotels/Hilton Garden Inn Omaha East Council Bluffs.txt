Text: Attended a concert at the Mid America Center. Hotel was perfect location to save us from driving and parking. Also enjoyed that it was attached to the casino. Parking was tight at night due to increased vehicles from a holiday party and the casino but we were still able to park. Overall a positive experience and a nice hotel.

Text: Great place to stay! I came there with my wife and 3 kids. Front desk attendants were friendly and so very helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good there too! Though the pancakes we're at bit dense for my liking. And the pool room, it was so hot in there. But I would definitely stay there again!

Text: Decent property that has undergone some renovations but you can only polish a turd so much. 
Rooms were sacious, clean & comfortable but there were several areas throughout the room that needed attention. 
Carpet tears and stains as well as a broken lamp.
The shower knob was coming apart from the tile wall. SKETCHY 
Large meeting rooms & other public spaces but very dated and worn out.
