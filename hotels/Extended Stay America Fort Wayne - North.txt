Extended Stay America Fort Wayne - North
Rating: 5
Text: The ladies are lovely here! Always willing to help! We love the big extended stay rooms. Anytime we need our towels or kitchen soaps, they take care of us. Always fresh coffee! We make bacon and eggs every morning, since we have a stove and fridge! We even get to load the dishwasher and be done with dishes daily! Thank you Tara!

Text: Staying here for awhile about 45 days maybe longer. The rooms are neat with kitchens. And what has impressed me enough to write this is the staff. Wonderful.

Text: Well here we are, my boyfriend took a call here, long stay.  We were showed a room, and the manager Tara, said "I have a different room, with a dishwasher, and a beautiful color," as the other room was too dark, seemed like.  Anyway, the staff is friendly, and went over and above for us.  The room was outstanding, as was the service of the staff, anytime we needed something, day or night.  I needed an extra pillow too.   Maybe I am a little picky, but the staff always met our needs.  Tara, you are a wonderful manager, and have a great staff.  If we ever need to stay again, or in the area, this Extended Stay, I choose.  Thank you.

Text: Ok hotel. Decently clean but nothing special. Limited continental breakfast. WiFi is free but you can pay for faster speed, I recommend that. Room was clean but smelled a bit weird
