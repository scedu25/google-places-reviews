Text: What a find! An amazing, beautiful and relaxing B&B just an hour from Kansas City! The house is beautifully decorated and and the charm and history  of the house is wonderful. Chris and her husband are are very gracious hosts. They are more than welcoming and accommodating. The breakfast in the sun room is absolutely delicious and delightful.
I think we found a new get away from Kansas City.

Text: What a fun place to stay. The owners were very kind and loved to hear the history of the house when we checked in. We stayed in the First Lady's room and it was spacious with a really comfortable bed. If we make it back to Atchison we will stay here.
