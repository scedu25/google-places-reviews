Text: Very nice place. Clean,  nice people that run it.  Units offer everything you need to prepare a meal. In addition to basic bathroom items. Awesome parking for boats. Conveniently located, close to boat ramp and little store where you can pick up necessities and fishing license. This was our first time and we will be back! Loved it!
