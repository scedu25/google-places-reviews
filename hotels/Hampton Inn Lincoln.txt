Text: The hotel was extremely nice. Very updated or newer Hampton Inn. The room was extremely clean there were no spots on anything look very nice. The pool area the lobby was very clean as well. When I came in the front door there was a group of probably about 20 people and they were very loud which was kind of not the hotel's fault at all but a little bit bothersome. And then when I checked into the room it was already about 9 p.m. at night and when I checked in went up to my room the room was nice I am disabled and had to go all the way to the opposite end where there was no elevator which could pose a problem if there was a fire. Still just be aware that if you are disabled to make sure that you're near and elevator. Also the noise level was out of control due to several groups of younger children staying there which is not the hotel's fault. I did call to the front desk and let them know that they were running in the hall and screaming and after I called stop very quickly after. And then the actual room I was in the people in the room right next door were screaming and it sounded like jumping on the bed all kinds of extreme noise at 10:30 at night I called the front desk and she dealt with it in a very timely manner and then the noise was silent. That was a good job. There is a number of places to get food if you're hungry you can walk across to the Cracker Barrel. Overall very nice day with the exception of the noise level which the hotel itself really doesn't have a lot of control over. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.

Text: We visited family that was staying at the Hampton Inn Lincoln in the lobby and their room. The lobby was clean and comfortable despite ongoing renovations. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. It's located conveniently next to the interstate (I-55) and several gas stations, restaurants, and other conveniences.
