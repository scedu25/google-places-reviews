Text: I stayed in a pet friendly room with 2 queen sized beds. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was good value which is why this review isn't one star. Our room had an odor like urine and cleaning supplies. There was damage to the bathroom doorframe and the floor (see pictures). The most troubling part of our stay is that both my companion and I were bitten multiple times during. The night by fleas. When we informed the front desk, rather than apologize or say they would look into it, they told us that fleas are common in Kansas and it's an issue we would have anywhere.

Text: The staff was friendly but the rooms smelled bad.  We had 3 different rooms and all of them smelled like pee.  The carpets in two were very stained.  We could not stay and had to get a refund.  The price is cheap but the smell is not worth it.  Spend the extra $40 and stay at the Comfort Inn at Goodland.

Text: Best breakfast ive had at all the hotels i stayed at. Pillows weren't hard as a rock. Guy at counter was very nice and accomodating. Although its off the beaten path and we got there late. Couldn't help but notice strange individuals that were hanging out in parking lot drinking. And the ac vent units smelled when turned on.
