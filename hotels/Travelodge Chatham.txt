Travelodge Chatham

Text: Was in at least 3 different rooms here since lots of family staying at same time. Not sure what they sprayed on top of the beds (probably/hopefully some sort of febreeze), but the damp touch to them after they serviced the rooms had us all a little grossed out. 2 of three rooms had a funky smell to them. Sink in our room was clogged (not by us). Asked on 2nd day for them to fix, and they didn't get around to it...next 2 days dealing with it. Place is outdated for sure.

Text: Decent place to stay. Much better then other motels in the area. Good free high speed internet, clean rooms and good breakfast
Rating: 4
Text: Good value for money with pleasant staff and a clean, spacious room. Loses a star because thin walls led to night time noise

Text: The staff is extremely accommodating and friendly. Haven't been able to try the breakfast, as they start it at 630 and I leave before then. Room is decent, not the best but good for the price. Keurig coffee machines are always a plus. Good mattress. Everything I need for wifi. Overall would reccommend.

Text: Our room had black mold in the A/c and card lock in door wouldn't work cause us to be locked out twice. Front desk staff Barry yelled at us saying its not his problem and to "Get Out!" then stating he has the right to yell at anyone he likes.  Avoid this place.
