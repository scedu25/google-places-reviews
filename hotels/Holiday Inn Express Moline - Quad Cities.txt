Text: Hospitality was great. Everyone was very accomodating. Amber was the one who stuck out to our Bridal party the most. She was very sweet, worked and cleaned with a smile. At one point we saw her cleaning outside. Sometimes it is the smallest details that go unnoticed. Thank you Amber for being a smiling face. Your work does not go unnoticed. Everyone was great. Thank you for the 5-star stay.

Text: The room was clean. The staff was helpful and nice. With four kids, we try to get a ground floor room(jumping, and excitement about swimming). We were placed in room 213. Second floor right above the front desk. Perfect! The pool is open until 11pm. Breakfast was great. Something for everyone, even picky eaters.

Text: Staging and decor may portray one aspect,a however service exemplifies another and Bob and the entire staff at this IHG were outstanding. This 3 yr old property looks, smells like a 2 day new property. Clean,  nicely staged, large rooms, extra large walk in shower all that if a up scale Chicago "W" Hotel without the fake crystal. Tops in brand representation here in the Quad cities. Close to the airport without the noise.

Text: Very friendly staff, clean hotel and quiet. It’s rare that a hotel staff will enforce ‘quiet hours’ and ensure children are not running around the halls but I witnessed it myself, bravo!
