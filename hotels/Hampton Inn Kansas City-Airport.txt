Hampton Inn Kansas City-Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Was only there for one night but it's a good Hampton. Very nice staff. Clean modern rooms and super close to the airport. It only takes about 7 minutes to get to the airport and no highway driving to get there. I'll stay here again.

Text: Great staff very helpful.   Its an older Hampton and needing some repairs and updating. Not the cleanest, but okay.  Im used to immaculate Hamptons.  Quiet rooms.

Text: Room was dusty.  Towels were a little rough.  The elevator in the opposite side of check in was odd to me

Text: It's a older hotel so rooms feel out dated and a little gross. They were just updating to key cards in August 2017. Staff was nice just needs a face lift

Text: Nice hotel with great service and very clean rooms. Only downside is that there aren't any major restaurants within walking distance. But it is very close to the airport.
