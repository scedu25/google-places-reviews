Days Inn and Suites Cuba
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel seems to be quite clean in both the public areas and rooms. The furniture in the rooms is slightly dated and my bed wasn't the most comfortable but I've slept on much worse. The internet access isn't the fastest. Overall for a budget friendly option it's pretty nice.

Text: Arrived late in the day without a prior reservation, the staff was kind polite and professional. The room was clean and welcoming. The front desk staff was even able to help us with a few items we had forgotten.

Text: Really nice stopover.  Very quiet and fairly clean.  Halls did have a musty sour smell but it could have been the PILES of garbage outside the side door...that was gross but otherwise very good place for the money

Text: Nice basic motel right off the highway. Staff was nice, room was a little dated but fine, bed was comfy, overall pretty quiet, breakfast was basic but again just fine. I would stay here again.
