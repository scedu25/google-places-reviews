Text: We were at Lakeview Lodge a few weeks ago. It is such a lovely place, and we had a great time with you. It felt more like a home and we felt very special under your care. Our daughter and son-in-law specificly wanted to go to your beautiful house, and they made an excellent choice. Sure would love to come back some day.
