Best Inn

Text: The Best Inn is the best place to lay your head for the price. Other hotels that are in the same price range are not the same quality. This place is the best bang for your buck. I’ve stayed here regularly and won’t stay anywhere else unless they are all booked up.

Text: We stayed at a place down the street that was HORRIBLE! And left after an hour because we couldn't handle it, ended up here. So nice! Clean, simple, and did not smell like death like the Ambassador did! The bed was even comfortable, thank you Best Inn!

Text: For the price, it can't be beat! Everything was clean, comfortable bed, refrigerator, microwave. The only negative I can think of is I could hear the TV and people talking from the room next to me, but nothing too terrible.
