Text: Been staying here for the past 4 years when attending Resound Fest in Bethany, MO.  Staff is great and accommodating!  Breakfast and eating area are great!  Would definitely recommend.

Text: Our room was old and tired and really worn out. The beds were decent though. The edges of the carpeting were not vacuumed and there were some dead bugs there.  The bathroom floor had not been cleaned or washed, there were hairs and a dead bug there.  I wouldn't stay there again.

Text: The hotel rooms were clean and nicely laid out. They have a small coffeemaker, I can't remember if they had a fridge or not. The AC units were well kept too. Just be sure to book a non-smoking room if you want one (we forgot to double check). The only sub-par thing was the breakfast and coffee, I suggest you hit up a local McDonald's instead.

Text: You get what you pay for applies here.
If you are ok with old mattresses,  flat pillows, AC's partially working, spotted carpet, minimal breakfast, this place works.  Staff are courteous and helpful.
