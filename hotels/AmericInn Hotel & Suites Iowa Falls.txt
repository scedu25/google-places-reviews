Text: Hotel itself was fine and a decent value. Showers/water pressure was terrible...they save money by using water saver shower heads. You, the paying customer, get a crappy shower.

Text: The hotel was clean and everything worked as expected. The breakfast was well stocked with a standard hotel breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles, muffins, bagels, and cereal. I would definitely stay again.
