Text: My girlfriend and I stayed here four nights to attend a music festival at Legend Valley and we loved it! The hotel staff was extremely friendly. Our room was ready when we arrived at check in time. The room was remarkably clean as well! We definitely will be returning and referring this Double Tree location to our friends!

Text: Great service and lovely fresh, clean rooms! I enjoyed the warm cookies on arrival! The rooms in the back don't have great views (air-conditioning unit on the roof), but the rooms in front have a nice view of the town and a church steeple.

Text: They've renovated this and done a pretty nice job with it. The restaurants pretty good and the waitstaff and bartenders are extremely nice. As is often the case at hotels, the drink prices are unreasonable.

Text: Clean room. Friendly staff. Walking distance to lots of restaurants. Gym is nice for a hotel gym. And they give you their famous cookie when you arrive.
