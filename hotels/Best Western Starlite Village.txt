Text: We stayed in the cabin located behind the hotel.  The breakfast was nice, along with the coffee.  The outlets in our rooms were not working sufficiently to charge up our iPhones, but found out later that the top outlets work for light switches only.  Would be nice if they had made a note about this in the room.  Would definitely stay again.

Text: Two things make a motel stay exceptional. The comfort of the bed, and the service. We were happy with both! Only really needed assistance for check-in and for breakfast and we were not disappointed. Always greeted with smiles and great service!

Text: I was only there for one night after driving almost 900 miles from Texas to Fort Dodge Iowa and the experience was great. The front counter was very welcoming.and the convenience of the restaurant and bar at the hotel was a big plus for me because I didn't want to drive anywhere to go have dinner. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are in the area

Text: The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff is friendly. We attended a wedding reception and the event room was great. The hot tub and the pool were also kid-friendly. Continental breakfast is also offered and the food was decent.

Text: Very friendly and helpful service. Breakfast is always amazing and, for the first time, tried Bufords steak house. Was extremely happy with portions and quality! Gotta try the crab/asparagus soup! Our of this world!
