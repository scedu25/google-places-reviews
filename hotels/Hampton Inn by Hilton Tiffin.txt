Text: We stayed in one of the new rooms after our wedding, the room was very clean and comfortable. The only issue was there wasn't a mirror in the actual room, only in the bathroom, this also made it difficult when groomsmen were trying to get ready in a different room. The shower took a long time to warm up and there wasnt anywhere to hang your towel which I thought was odd after being a new renovation
