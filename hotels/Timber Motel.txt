Text: The room was nosy. The room also smelled of smoke. They have a shower set up I have never seem or heard of before with no instructions on how to use it unless you go to the office. The facets leaked and had rust stains and hard water deposits. When I go to a hotel I expect a clean comfortable room I don't need a masters degree in engineering to figure out that is well maintained.

Text: Best rates in town for comfortable, clean and fresh smelling room.  Plenty room for morning exercises and lovely upstairs window views.  We stay here every time we pass through Clinton.
