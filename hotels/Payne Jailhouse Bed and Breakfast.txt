Text: We were the first to stay here. It was great! They had just finished the king suit, and did a great job. The owners are very friendly! I would so recommend this b&b. It's definitely worth the money, and the breakfast was great too. Especially the fruit salad!! It has a good location too, right in the middle of everything.
