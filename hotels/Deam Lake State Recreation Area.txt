Text: We stayed at the crane cabin and absolutely loved it!  The park was so clean, the bathrooms and showers were better than some hotels.   It was quiet, peaceful and such a joy to be out there on the lake.   I felt like my spirit was rejuvenated.   We say in the porch swing,  drank our coffee and watched the sun rise over the lake.   I know it sounds corny,  but it was the best $50 I ever spent and can't  wait to go again!  

The staff were super friendly and helpful too!

Text: First time staying in cabin on the point called "Crane". Nice little cabin for my husband and I with full sized bed board frame and two bunk bed frames on main floor. Bring bedding. Would be nice for a small family, too. Nice little loft for one athletic adult or two kids. Heater and AC. Table and two benches. Several electrical outlets - all 110. No appliances for cooking inside and none allowed. Have to cook on campfire or go out. Norma Jeans in Borden is close and has delicious ice cream and lunch type food. The best for us is the porch with  swing and rocker. We spent hours watching the lake and wildlife. We've seen a bald eagle twice,  large cranes, a buck and buddies swimming by, bunnies, squirrels, chipmunks and last year there was a black bear though we didn't see him. Showers and bathrooms are clean. Love it.

Text: This place is gorgeous and very convenient for car and rv camping. It's not the wild, but it's great for being so close to the Louisville metro area. Will go again, kids loved it.

Text: My friends and I have a group that had been going here for camping once a year so far. It is a nice quiet park with nice cabins and generally clean area. The only complaint is one of the women's restrooms was vandalized earlier in the summer and by the time we went there they had not fixed the facility, it had been 2-1/2 months when we came to camp. A couple members of our group chose a specific area to camp because of the proximity to the restrooms. This lack of the women's restroom nearby made it very inconvenient for our members. Fortunately the men were very understanding and allowed some of us to use the men's at times instead of going half way across the campground to use the womens. This is a state recreation area and we will continue to come with our group, but this was quite a disappointment.

Text: Fun Place with everything you need to have fun without breaking your Wallet. We usually go to the beach area and swim there are several Grills near by that we have use to grill out and have family time. The out houses are surprisingly clean and well maintained. The price for in state vehicles is $7 where is your from Kentucky it's 9. They don't allow Alcohol  but so let you bring a cooler and other amenities. They also have concession stand for snacks.
