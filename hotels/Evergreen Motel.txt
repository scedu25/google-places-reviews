Evergreen Motel
Rating: 4
Text: My only negative comment is that the room was small and my wife and I felt a little cramped.  Everything else is a positive.  It was very clean, the bed was comfortable, TV, mini-fridge, AC and wifi all worked fine and the room had a nice shower.  Staff was very friendly and price very reasonable.  We stayed on a quick trip to Nebraska to see the eclipse in August.  We probably won't pass this way again but if we do I will stay at the Evergreen again.

Text: We were on our way back to Colorado from Oklahoma and a severe snow storm in Kansas, closed  I-70 and caused all hotels to be booked.  This motel was the only one with vacancies. We were  pleased with room.  Room is really cozy, very clean. Room comes with refrigerator, microwave, coffee and big screen TV.  Lady is very nice and a welcoming
