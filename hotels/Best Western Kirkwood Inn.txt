Best Western Kirkwood Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Went to St. Louis South county to visit family. I found a good price deal at Best Western so I booked it. The hotel was beautiful, newly remodeled, with nice associates. The breakfast was nice, they had a nice selection of foods and also three different types of fresh fruit available. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is simple because it isn't a resort type of hotel with indoor pool/hot tub amenities.

Text: From the minute I walked in the door to the time I left, it was a wonderful experience.  Everyone was friendly. You can tell the young gentleman at the front desk truly liked his job!  The hotel was recently remodeled, and well done.  My room was clean.  Very refreshing.  Great location for anyone staying in the Kirkwood area.  Vans Tavern was the perfect place to meet up with good friends.  Breakfast was well done and plentiful.  A great experience.  I look forward to staying there on my next visit.

Text: This hotel was amazing. My boyfriend and I decided we will choose this hotel every time we come to St. Louis. The room was very big and spacey, the Exterior/interior looked exactly like the pictures! And it’s in a good part of town right across the street from a Walmart, Target, Burlington and more! Not to mention the many restaurants around it. Definitely would recommend x1000!! Can’t wait to go back.

Text: We come through St. Louis twice each year, and always stay here. They do a great job preparing a room with a minimum use of scented chemicals, something we have to have to avoid migraines. The hotel is convenient to the highway and to downtown. The beds are comfortable, and the bathroom is a good size. We bring our cat as well and they are always very accommodating. We don't eat the breakfast so can't speak to that. Best of all, everyone is always friendly, courteous, and professional. For a hotel in this price range my expectations are exceeded, and we will continue to return!

Text: This is a great hotel.  The rooms are clean and a decent size.  The staff is wonderful and very helpful.  It is pet friendly.  They have a great breakfast. We loved their pancake machine.  It is an easy drive to the downtown area and all of the attractions at Forest Park. The pool is outside so only available in summer months.  The wifi was very sporadic. And if you don't want to listen to the noise from children in the pool make sure to request a room not on the side if the pool.
