Text: This place is amazing!  Rooms are beautiful, service is excellent, and the Dome/Atrium is spectacular.   Truly an architectural and engineering marvel nestled in the beautiful rolling hills of southwestern Indiana.  Beautiful golf courses, river boat casino, train rides, indoor water parks, and kart racing provide enjoyment for the entire family.  A great destination and get away!

Text: Wow.  Just... wow.  Incredibly beautiful and fancy.  The staff is absolutely outstanding.  Incredibly fast and courteous.  The hotel DOES allow pets!!! They say a limit of 75lbs on dogs, but no one said anything when we brought our 130lbs mastiff (no one told us about the weight limit when we made reservations).  Pets can even get room service!  They have special dishes!

You can easily spend the whole weekend without leaving the hotel grounds; there's a lot to do and enjoy.

Shuttles run very frequently and they even give you a number to call to come pick you up from anywhere in town.

There is good but limited eating in town that isn't fast food.  Be prepared to spend a lot on the (very) expensive room service.  It is, however, *excellent*.

Text: We stayed three nights, celebrating our 40th anniversary. Staff very friendly, service excellent, accommodations excellent. Spa (Massages) were also excellent. Sinclair Cafe and Sinclair Evening Dinning was also excellent and worthy of a 5 Star Hotel. Kind of pricey, but the Filet was the best that I ever had. Had lockers and showers for pool and hot tub area. Off season during the week is a great choice for low crowds, better deals, and no waiting for restaurant seating. We had an outside room which was recommended in some of the reviews for a quieter room. The inside rooms have a beautiful view, but were noisier from other comments. Refrigerator in room, but no microwave. Excellent beds, pillows, and huge towels.

Text: This place is a gem. Whether you've just stumbled on this spot, or known of it for years, if you have the money to take advantage of this lovely property, don't miss out. The place is enchanted. Classy, well apointed rooms. Exquisite European furniture and touches. Charming grounds. Highly recommend this property, especially in the offseason when things are quiet and relaxed.

Text: A sight to see. A magnificent structure with a great deal of history. Recently restored with all the latest amenities. Room was well accommodated. Bed was firm, but comfortable and the sheets were a high thread count. The staff were very welcoming and ready to serve. I highly recommend the historical tour. We will be visiting again in the near future.
