Kintner House Inn

Text: I loved this B&B. We only stayed one night, which was to short--my parents and i were on our way through to see the total eclipse in Kentucky. The reception we received was warm and welcoming and the accommodations were comfortable. As someone who appreciates historical architecture, I thought this place was perfect. I hope i have a chance to return to Corydon for a longer stay. I'll without a doubt choose Kintner House.

Text: Just a wonderful B & B.  The food is great and Alice is fantastic.  The inn is full of history and you can request the room you want. My husband and I always stay in the Harrison room.

Text: We had a delightful time at Kintner House. The room was very nice and the bed was fantastic.The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.The food was great, but I gained three pounds during the stay! Easy walking distance to all the historic sites and a stone's throw from a great micro-brewery!
