Text: We have really enjoyed our stay here! Everything about our room is top notch- comfort of the beds, huge tub, blackout shades, plenty of space, large tv, and perfect lighting. The staff is so friendly! Every single person we have come across. We can't hear any outside noises, in the halls or the streets. Perfect walking distance from EVERYTHING!

Text: Stayed with the family for 2 days here and it is a great base to see chicago. The staff were extremely friendly and my nieces loved the fact they had a rescue dog. The bar is great and the rooms are well appointed.

The morning breakfast setup and served in the room was exquisite and high-end. The food was exceptionally prepared and presented every day. Highly recommended luxury experience.
