Text: I had the best customer service while staying at this property than Ive had in a very long time. Every representative at the hotel was extremely nice. They tried to help with any issue that came about. Its a older property but still a great place to stay. Great Customer Service.

Text: Our room had a great view! Staff was friendly and efficient. The room was clean and housekeeping does a wonderful job. The bathroom was small and didn't have a air vent which was a nuisance but we pushed through. Comfy beds and pillows! We went to a play at the Fox Theatre it was a pleasure to come out walk to the street and hop in a cab! The ride was short and affordable. O would defintely recommend this hotel and stay here again! Thanks to the Crowne Plaza we had an amazing stay in the Motor City!

Text: The staff is very friendly and the pool is deep, along with a hot tub next to it. Both well maintained. My only really real downside is the hotel rooms are smaller than what I'm used to. (the beds feel like full beds, not queen). Highly recommend.

Text: The hotel was in a great location.  The people mover was just a short distance from the entrance.  But we were charged for 2 nights when we only stayed one.  I called the hotel they had to check with their accounting department.  They refused to return my calls after the initial call.  I would never stay again.

Text: Room was nicely appointed. Bathroom was clean. Wear earplugs. There is an electric train that runs around the hotel. My room was across from the ice machine. Very loud. Earplugs aloud me to sleep. The restaurant had great wild boar toastadas. The duck taco were also excellent. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Everyone had a smile and a kind word. The carpet in the room could stand to be replaced. It had quite a few stains.
