Lincoln Lodge Motel Clarks Hill

Text: Although it's not motel 6, it is considerably cheaper. If you don't have much money and you need a room for the night, it fits the bill. It's not the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, but it certainly isn't the worst. My 4th generation family was immigrants, and these immigrants are struggling to become better business owners and fighting for the American Dream. All in a not a bad place to stay, decent rooms, nice staff and everyone minds their own business.

Text: Absolutely love staying here.. We have stayed here many times and the customer service is absolutely amazing.. Our needs are always met right away. The remodeling they are doing is completely awesome. Big Screen TV is amazing!! Offering larger beds and tubs as well!!! Not all rooms have refrigerators and microwaves yet because of them remodeling but they do have a microwave available for use as well as laundry room... Wifi is connecting just fine!! We will definitely be coming back!!
