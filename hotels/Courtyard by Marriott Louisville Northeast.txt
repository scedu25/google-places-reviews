Text: We are from Michigan and stayed  4 nights for a national archery competition in Louisville.   The staff was wonderful!  We had a great time hanging in the lobby playing games. Last night the staff surprised us each with a single rose for Mother's Day.  They definitely went above and beyond.   The rooms are clean, the kids enjoyed the pool, and we will be staying again next year.  Thanks for making our out
of state stay a great one!

Text: Nice and clean room. Well maintained hotel. Maids made the king bed but left the pull out couch a mess. Not a big problem but would have been nice.
