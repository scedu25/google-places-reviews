Residence Inn by Marriott Wichita East at Plazzio
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean and fresh when I arrived. Bed was really springy. Morning hot breakfast was decent, but lacked some staples like bacon or sausage. They have a waffle maker if you're into that. Evening happy hour was ok. Small selection of beers, but they were good beers. Couple of IPA choices and blue moon. They have a small pool, basketball goal and a small putting green out back.

Text: It was quite exquisite. The rooms were kept in top condition and their services are beyond my own response. However, they could use a couple improvements. Aside from that, I rate this place five ? ? ? ? ?
