Reagan's Queen Anne Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The innkeepers, Judy and Norm, were amazing.  This is a classic Victorian well-appointed home.  The breakfast was elegant and delicious.  They have raised the bar as to what a B&B should be.  Clean and comfortable.  Best sleep I have gotten in a long time.
