Text: My daughter moved in here in July. The unit was to be refurbished. The unit has black mold, rotten floors, leaking shower valves....the management and realtor Jeri were to do a pre move in checklist but that did not happen. We have been forced to get the Health Department involded. Avoid dealing with these dishonest Slum Lords! It is a shame that people like this are not run out of the real estate business for their actions!
