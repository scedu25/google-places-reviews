Days Inn Blue Springs

Text: Has a computer in the lobby, nice breakfast area, a smaller pool, but very nice and clean.  Rooms were clean, air was cold.  They have luggage racks and an elevator.  Parking was well lit.  Would stay again! $82 out the door for a double in July.  Checked in at 11pm, host was very nice and efficient with check-in! And there is a big Mexican restaurant in attached parking lot!

Text: The rooms are clean, quiet, and affordable. The beds are comfortable and have full sized pillows. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are on the small size, but adequate. For double the money you can get a much larger room (and some convenient things like a dining area), but I prefer a more modest room so I can spend my money on shopping and sightseeing. I have stayed here several times and always had a pleasant time.

Text: We stayed one night. The receptionist was kind of grumpy and not very friendly but she was quick. Everything in the room was clean. The TV wasn't working correctly but they sent someone quickly and he fixed it quickly. The shower was large, the water pressure good and there were plenty of towels. We didn't have time to check out the pool. The breakfast was nice. There was a large selection of foods and it s all fresh. Overall good value.

Text: Staff was friendly. Hotel was fine, room was clean, but older...Some repairs needed in bathroom walls and floorboards. Also the elevator and stairwell smelled funny. Looked in and saw a pretty small pool. WiFi Was too slow for video during evening until 11pm. Free Breakfast of waffles, biscuits and gravy, muffins, cereal, fruit, and juice was ok, but they ran out of some stuff. Good location within 5 minutes of several restaurants
