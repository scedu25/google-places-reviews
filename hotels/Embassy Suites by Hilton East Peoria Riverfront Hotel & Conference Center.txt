Text: Managers special is an awesome touch. Some appetizers and drinks for 2 hours. Rooms are nice and clean. Free breakfast was also nice. Made to order omelets and buffet style. Close to a couple nice restaurants.

Text: Fantastic and friendly staff. After a long drive she made me feel like we were home. Got us in early to our room. Great room. Great location. Walked the river. The only downer was the young man who staffed the Happy hour time. Unfriendly and curt.

Text: My visit to Embassy Suites was for a business breakfast meeting. The breakfast was a buffet style service and the food was all hot and fresh and healthily stocked. The wait staff was excellent and greeted me and made sure our table was well tended to for the duration of the meeting. Everything was set up beautifully including the sound. Some conference meeting in big rooms have sound issues, but not here. Despite switching between different microphones and dealing with singing and a piano, there were no issues at all. It was a great meeting and the staff of Embassy Suites was clearly very prepared to make the morning run smooth!

Text: Great facility. Comfortable rooms. Improvement needed in management. Additional training and communication among staff very necessary. My family and I ate there over the weekend the food was good but we all had a virus afterwards. Tried to communicate other issues to be addressed to management but they weren’t interested in hearing my feedback to make improvements they just wanted to provide me with discounts etc. to shut me up...sad

Text: The rooms were very clean, roomy, and had all that we needed. The service was great. We arrived late and could no longer order food. The front clerk got us some snacks and pop at no charge. She was more than friendly, which added to our comfort in staying here.
