Holiday Shores
Rating: 5
Text: A great place to stay with nice views of the lake.  The units are 6 sided buildings on the hillside of The Lake of The Ozarks with a basement room, a large main level room with king size bed, and a loft with bed and half bath.

This area is generally quite in the off season and especially beautiful in early November with the change in leaf color.  The club house has a pool (closed in fall/winter).  They also have a boat dock and covered boat slips and paddle boats are for rent.

Text: Staying at Holiday Shores has been amazing. The little cabins are so nice and roomy. We have had a great experience staying here. Close to everything and a great place to swim right there in the resort. We will definitely be back.
