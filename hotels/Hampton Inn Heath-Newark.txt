Text: Our client, touring musician Sam Lewis, recently stayed here while performing nearby. The stay was perfect!  The room was very nice, clean, and quiet, and the convenience store on-site was perfect for the late night snack rush after the gig. There was also a free breakfast in the morning and a business center to get caught up on the week's contracts. Thank you so much for taking great care of our client while staying with you!

Text: Have stayed here once per year over the last decade. Typically receive good service and the staff are friendly. Conveniently close to restaurants, a grocery store and National Trail Raceway. However, the hotel has been under renovation for over a year, consuming a third of the parking lot spaces.

Text: This place is not very family friendly post-renovation. The bathrooms no longer have a bathtub. Otherwise the new rooms are beautiful thought not particularly well done like no fan in the bathroom, the shower isn't angled so the water doesn't drain well, the faucet is almost off the sink so it's hard to get your hands wet or anything else under it.

Text: Honestly. The GM is great. Really makes you feel welcome. However, the internet is intermittent. That could be a deal breaker. And it would have been a deal breaker had I known beforehand. Regardless, go say hi to the GM and get a room if internet is not important to you.
