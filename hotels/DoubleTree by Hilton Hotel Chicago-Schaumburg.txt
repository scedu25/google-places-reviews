Text: I'm staying here for work, it's a good location for be and where I'm going. Plenty of restaurants, a whole foods is close by. The staff has been great and very helpful. Real eggs instead of the powdered eggs you'll find at other hotels, all the breakfast is great, there's also an omelette bar every morning, and a bar for the night. Decent gym with dumbbells, medicine balls, and treadmills. There's a pool that looked pretty good as well.

Text: Got a room at the last minute. Everything was clean and proper. I got a delicious chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. Honestly it was the first thing I had to eat in days. The staff were really respectful. Although the pool area should have staff present when people are in there. Kid were soaking their towels an whipping each other and I got whipped to bare skin while holding my 8 month old daughter.

Text: This hotel has a great vibe and ambiance largely attributable to the bar and restaurant in the lobby level, which serve quality drinks and dinner until 11:00 pm.  Room service is also available until 11:00 pm. For guests that want to maintain their workout routines while staying here, there's a fitness center on premises open 24/7 and, at least as of August, 2017, I was offered free guest passes to the local Lifetime Fitness gym that is located within walking distance. The rooms have a great semi-luxury feel.  Cons: no exhaust fan in the bathrooms. Simply stated, this is a con at any hotel for many reasons that would require a full-length article to fully elaborate and address. Con number 2 is the cost of food and incidentals.  Room service is top-notch and classic, but the cost borders on the absurd for suburban Chicago. Cost of one kale/strawberry salad and a chicken quesadilla (including mandatory 22% gratuity plus additional service fee): approximately $34.00.  I witnessed a guest return a candy bar back to the snack stand in the lobby after learning the cost would be $4.05.  That's right: $4.05 for a single, regular sized, candy bar.  The guest's reaction was priceless. He had an astonished look on face and said a single word to the hotel employee: "why?"

Text: Wonderful. There was absolutely nothing that I could complain about. The hospitality, the cleanliness, the beds, the location: all top notch. And the TV in the room was massive. Nicely decorated too. Made me feel like a slob. All I know is I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
