Herington Inn & Suites
Rating: 2
Text: Prices are a bit steep per night. There are more affordable hotels/motels in Kansas, like nearby Junction City, Manhattan, and Abilene. I've stayed in a few in those cities, but this is the ONLY one in Herington and it's close to where I live. My only major complaint is they require you to have an automobile. I managed to stay a couple of days before without a vehicle, but now after staying a couple more times (I'm getting work done on my house so I needed a place to stay temporarily with my son), they told me that I can no longer be a guest unless I have a car, so make sure you have your own ride, or else you won't be allowed to check in. They claim it's "company policy." I never heard of such a business being run and operated that way. A couple of the front desk workers are nice and polite (I won't give names), and the rooms are comfortable. The Internet is fast, but the cable channels kinda suck.

Text: They stayed a few min late at front desk before closing waiting for us.   Rooms were modern and clean.   Fair price and very quiet.

Text: Friendly staff. Relatively nice accommodations considering the location. Parking is quite limited if you have a large vehicle or are pulling a trailer you can't park on site you must park on the road. I would probably will stay there again.

Text: My visit consisted of my family and myself going to use their facility did to a recent power outage in the city. The staff was very curious and helpful, we were not charged. They allowed us to have a cup of coffee, use the bathroom and charge our phone. Thank you very much, due to this kindness my family and I have recommended this location for visiting family and friends as a place to stay.
