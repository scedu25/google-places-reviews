Embassy Suites Chicago - Schaumburg/Woodfield
Rating: 4
Text: Even though the place was under renovations, the place was very enjoyable.  I normally speak lowly about breakfasts, but this was the best ,continental breakfast I've ever had.  Had many choices to choose from and they even had stuffed pancakes.  Very nice and enjoyable.  The 4 stars is only because did renovations... when finished, should get 5 stars

Text: The staff was helpful in booking process, helping to overcome the quirks caused by the online booking system. All items I'd requested to be in the room -- games for kids, a crib and extra towels -- were there on arrival. The front desk was nice enough, if not warm, during check-in. The place is undergoing construction, but it didn't affect us. They weren't working on weekends so we got to sleep in. The pool was still accessible. Breakfast was fine, except any bread-like item (pancakes, biscuits, French toast, English muffins, which were cold and mealy). Lines were long and juice, bacon or donuts were not quickly replaced. Overall, it was fine, but get a discount if going while under construction.

Text: The staff was extra friendly. My daughter felt like a rock star because of her free shades and bottled water. My son enjoyed the pool at every given moment. The breakfast buffet was very good. My husband loved the stuffed pancakes.

Text: Nice staff, very friendly especially at the front desk. The rooms are typically Emabssy Suites style; 2 room Suite. Very you clean and comfortable. Bathroom was a little tight but I was traveling alone on business so it was fine. The normal cook to order breakfast wasn't available as there was remodeling under way - the breakfast buffet had good variety but just wasn't the same. The manager reception was in the bar area so was a bit awkward getting drinks.

Text: I was here for a work meeting. The lunch was simple but delicious. The room was easy to find because of their signage in the lobby. They were doing construction on a room across the hall so we did hear construction noises, briefly. It's a nice venue.
