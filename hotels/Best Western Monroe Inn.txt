Text: What a great hotel at a wonderful price point. Night staff and morning staff were wonderful and friendly.  It's on a nice exit that is not overly busy. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had at a hotel.  We travel highway 75 a lot from Florida to Michigan and we will be stopping here again without question.  Thank you for a great night sleep.

Text: The staff is exceptionally welcoming and helpful.  Location is clean and comfortable.  Breakfast offered eggs, yogurt and a variety of bread/cereal items,  but surprisingly no meat.  Being gluten-free, I would have appreciated some sausage or bacon with my eggs, but managed.  All considered, I would stay here again when in the area.

Text: It was just an Interstate motel to sleep in for one night. Room was oddly arranged and there weren't enough outlets to have the refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker plugged in at the same time. Beds were comfortable and staff was super friendly and they had free hot breakfast including waffles.

Text: A nice place to stay. Close to Cincinnati Premium Outlets and a very short 13 mile drive to King's Island.
The dresser drawers in our room had not been cleaned.......and I will leave it at that. But after bringing it to the front desk attendants attention, everything was taken care of. The breakfast is wonderful!! Plenty of options to choose from. If you go away hungry it's your fault.
The only 2 downsides I have (and not deal breakers by any means) is one, breakfast is only served from 7am to 9am.....Why can't it go until 10am???
And the second, if you have a reservation and it states on the reservation that 4 people are staying in the room, why do you only provide towel service for "3"?????
Just something to think about.
But I would stay here again.
All of the staff was very nice!!!!
