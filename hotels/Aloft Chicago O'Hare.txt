Text: The hotel was fine. Feels European (small,  modern rooms). Bed was not great. Breakfast was good.

Text: "Modern" hotel featuring very small rooms, no restaurant or room service, no complementary breakfast, no hot tub in the pool area, and very limited information. Most hotels have a book that lists amenities and features (bar hours, airport shuttle info, etc.) but Aloft did not, which led to me calling the front desk multiple times with questions like, is there a pool? Where is it? What are the hours? Is there a business center where I can print my boarding pass? When does the bar open? Super frustrating.

Text: Drinks were good, really classy ambiance. Not really a lot going on, relaxed vibe. So yea, I'd definitely come back, one of cooler hotel bars I've visited. I didn't eat food here.

Text: Competitive prices, clean rooms with plenty of space to unwind. No continental breakfast included with my reservation, but breakfast items were available for purchase. 

Perfect location for anything happening at the convention center or performing arts center. Walking distance to these venues.

Text: Cute place. Lots of amenities to make our night fun. Air conditioning unit was very loud when the compressor turned on. When checking out they told us we should have called the front desk to get the engineer to look at it. That is not an appropriate solution for midnight when I am already sleeping. Bathroom doors slide closed and do not latch so I felt exposed doing my business.
