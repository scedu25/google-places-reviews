Text: Great place for people of all ages. The rooms are cozy and the owners were very welcoming. They are located within walking distance of Indiana Beach. There is plenty of playground equipment, pool, volleyball net and my favorite Cornhole!!!

Text: We only stayed here because the dog hotel was full and this was the only place that let pets stay. Bad idea. Room was musty and VERY outdated. Not to mention we found several bugs which appeared to be bed bugs. Was told the first night we were there that the pool was open 10am - 11pm. We left indiana beach at 9:30 so we could go swimming yet when we got back to the hotel at 10pm the pool was already closed. When I told the lady I had very recently had back surgery and need to swim to relieve the pressure she got very rude with me. All I wanted to know was when it opened in the morning. She said 10 am. Planned on going swimming yet by check out time (11am), pool had still not been opened. Sign clearly says CABLE AND WIFI. Cable signal was so bad it was impossible to watch anything. After I finally got the lady to give me the password for the WiFi, it was randomly shut off an hour later and was never turned back on the rest of the two says we were there.  We will definitely never be staying here again.
