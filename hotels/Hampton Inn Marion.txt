Hampton Inn Marion
Rating: 4
Text: Very clean. Staff was helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was well above the standard "Continental" offerings and an evening happy hour offering was also made available. WiFi was an extra charge for usable service.

Text: Upon arrival into the room, several large horseflies were present in the room.  Hotel was fully booked for the night.  Requested cancellation of reservation and refund; did not stay the night.  Awaiting refund.  I would normally rate one star for a hotel that presents a sanitation issue, but the front desk clerk did attempt to accommodate us at another property.  I use reviews to guide my buying decisions and this hotel seemed fine, so I was very surprised to find a swarm of flies in my room upon arrival.

Text: This location is right off the highway and surrounded by a variety of amenities, restaurants, fuel stations and more. The hotel has ample parking and easy to find. Inside it has everything, a fitness center, pool, business center and even laundry. Free hot breakfast ad even evening happy hour. My room is very nice and spacious. I have had no issues so far. If you plan to see the eclipse in Carbondale, IL in 2024, I recommend staying here in Marion.

Text: Best hotel in the Southern Illinois area. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Nice pool and gym. Good breakfast. But the biggest selling point is the staff. You won't meet nicer people. They are the absolute best!
