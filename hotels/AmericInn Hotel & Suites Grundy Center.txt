Text: When we first shows up staff was pretty nice, they had computer issues and took for ever to check in. Breakfast was a little bland. We went to go in the spa and the water was dirty so i told the lady at the desk she came and said it was foam so I asked if she had a screen I could clean it with and she made me clean it and claimed it was just foam, the screen Was almost black and had so many hairs in it. I didnt swim. When we checked out there was a little bit of garbage on the floor however they charged an extra 50$ because they said there were "poop" stains on the pillow and they also said the room smelled. I know we didn't leave the room in that condition. The lady on the phone was very mean and threatened to call my work and get us fired. I don't recommend stay at this americinn. IV stay at plenty of other americinns and never had a problem. I am very very upset at this hotel. However it was the same lady the whole time!
