Best Western Delta Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice inexpensive hotel. Friendly front desk. Clean, modern room. Comfortable bed. Able to walk across parking lot for dinner at steakhouse. Couple minute drive to Starbucks. Located right off interstate. Would stay here again if passing through.

Text: If you're spending the night in Effingham, skip the concrete desert at Exit 160 and stay at this Best Western. It's right next to the freeway but as soon as the door closes behind you it's completely quiet. The hotel is surrounded by nice landscaping, grass and trees; perfect for a little bit of pet exercise. The entire hotel was very clean: our room, the pool, the well-organized breakfast area, even the parking lot.  Pool seems well-maintained and was the perfect temperature for a long swim. Highly recommend!

Text: It was nice and clean. Pool was nice but had a few bugs in it floating around. Didn't try the workout area. Wished there was a hot tub. Matresses are very high off the floor. Hard for older people and short people to get in amd out of but very soft and comfy.
