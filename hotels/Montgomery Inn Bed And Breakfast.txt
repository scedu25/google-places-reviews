Rating: 5
Text: Very enjoyable stay. Pam was nice and made an amazing breakfast. Besides a few small maintenance issues (light bulb out) the room was very great!

Text: The bed was fine but the place needed upkeeping. Several weak areas on porch floorboards, too  many dirty cigarettes in ashtrays,  and too many cats in the house. Breakfasts were good but again the dining room needed some updating and cigarette smoke was noticible. Would not go back .Thank you

Text: We called to see about using this B&B for our wedding and the woman who spoke to us on the phone was very rude, saying that "don't you know that's right in the middle of keenland season?"

In my opinion, me filling your bed and breakfast to capacity for a full weekend would be equally as pleasing as waiting for keenland to hopefully fill it as well, regardless of where the business is coming from.  I was highly disappointed.
