Text: Great stay. Staff was friendly and rooms were updated. Bed was very comfortable and gave my fiancée and I a great nights sleep. I'll definitely stay here again in the future.

Text: Absolutely the worst hotel I have stayed at.  Very noisy hotel kids are running up and down the hallways.  Staff is very unhelpful.  To busy smoking cigarettes.  Very frustrating.  And bathroom light bulbs have been burned out and not replaced  in 3 days.    I am not a complainer. But It's bad here.   It took 1 hour just to check in because guy working couldn't figure things out.  Deadbolt broken.

Text: Very nice hotel. Convenient location. Jim? I believe his name was, was friendly and informative. Clean room, wifi worked great, breakfast was what I expected. No complaints. The walls are a little thin, but that's typical.
