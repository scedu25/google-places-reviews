Text: Older hotel. We've got the room with the tiniest bathroom, ever. And no ventilation...
Thankfully, it was possible to partially open the window . lol
Beds were very comfortable.
 Super helpful and professional staff. They are wonderful !

Text: My wife's earrings were stolen out of her travel bag the one day our room was serviced.  The only option we were given was to file a police report, a clear indication that hiring honest housekeepers at this hotel is a challenge. I recommend if you travel to the area but just be sure to keep a tight lock on your personals and lock your car doors.

Text: Love love love this place.  This is our second time here and we find it ideal.  Very good price and every single staff person we encountered was super friendly and helpful.   We love staying outside the hustle and bustle of the city but nearby an outstanding mall with great food selections.   Cannot recommend highly enough.

Text: The hotel accommodations we're great as usual for this chain. The 5:30 Kickback is always a plus when staying at the chain. Unfortunately there was a soccer tournament in town and the halls were fill with kids running up and down the halls knocking on doors at all hours of the night.

Text: Really cheerful & chatty staff & guests. The lady in charge of the breakfast room is a wonderful fixture of many years. The rooms are excellent. I only wish there was Splenda in the cute coffee tray.
