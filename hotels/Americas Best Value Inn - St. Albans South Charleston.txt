Americas Best Value Inn - St. Albans/South Charleston

Text: Absolutely filthy nasty place! Checked in with my boyfriend and as soon as we checked in to our room we were welcomed by a ton of roaches.. The bathroom was full of roaches as well.. Super gross. This place is also full of ghetto scum selling/using drugs. Not safe! We got our money back and went to the wonderful Holiday inn express.. Stay far away from this place. Not even worth 1 star!!!

Text: Absolutely hated this place. Couldn't even walk outside without feeling like someone was going to rob me. Always kept my car locked. On top of that, I walked around the motel room without shoes or socks on for just 15 mins and when I looked at the bottom of my feet they were completely black. Roaches are everywhere and it smells musty and moldy. And another thing. BED BUGS EVERYWHERE. SERVICE IS AWFUL

Text: They've cleaned up, better than I've seen in ten years, the staff is hospitable and do their jobs and then some. The location is decent, not horribly far from everything but not in the middle of Chas.
