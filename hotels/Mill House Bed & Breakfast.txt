Mill House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The Mill House is a place I could never tire of.  Located by the Maumee River, with a Canal and Tow Path right out the back door, it is surrounded by beauty.  We rode our bikes along the whole Tow Path, and also took many relaxing walks along the river. The Innkeepers at the Mill House, Kathy and Ron, are so kind and pleasant - they make you feel like family. They make a delicious breakfast (and scones) and you can just tell that they enjoy their guests very much and will go out of their way to make you comfortable. The rooms are beautiful, lots of wood and brick and oh, so cozy.  What a great place for a quiet get-away, or a wonderful gift for friends or family that need a break from everyday life. Go once, and you will see what I mean!

Text: A lovely, peaceful place. Ron and Kathy are laid back, gracious and thoughtful hosts.  Kathy made a special breakfast tailored to our dietary restrictions and it was delicious! The garden room was wonderful, clean, comfortable and cozy. Surroundings are beautiful, with a patio to sit and enjoy the view of the river. You will leave here regretfully, relaxed and refreshed.

Text: Beautiful old inn. Very gracious hosts. Clean, comfortable bed, and spotless bathroom with supplies. Snacks, drinks, and breakfast provided. The breakfast, pleasantly shared with the other guests, was so good, I asked for the recipe.

Text: I had a wonderful time staying at the Mill House!  Ron and Kathy were terrific hosts - so helpful with shopping, dining and driving directions.  My room was delightful and comfortable.  An appreciated touch was the always-available cold bottled water, snacks, and coffee/tea.  I plan to stay here again, and am recommending to my friends.
