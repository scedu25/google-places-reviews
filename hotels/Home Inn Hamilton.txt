Text: We stayed 3 nights for our first annual girls weekend. Breakfast was superb!  Dakota is very accommodating and her boys are very polite. We hope to return in 2018!  Looking forward to recommending this place to other friends who journey to Missouri Star!

Text: Discovered this lovely B&B quite by accident, and was given a warm welcome even though I had not made a reservation. Beautiful rooms, lovely grounds around the property, tasty breakfast. Large flatscreen t.v. In room, or comfortable living room downstairs with fireplace for socializing. Highly recommend this one.

Text: Had such a great weekend with our family at this cute b&b! Very comfortable accommodations for our family of 5.  Our young boys had such a fun time here and are already asking when we can go back! The hosts were great and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable and comfortable.  I highly recommend this place!
