Text: I really enjoyed my stay at the Country Hearth. The room was clean and the red theme was super pretty. We didn't get to enjoy the pool, but it looked lovely. The TV has great channels as well. My only two complaints are that the toilet had to be flushed twice in order for everything to go down and that there was no handsoap in the room. Neither of those things ruined it for me, and overall I really enjoyed my stay. I definitely plan on coming back.

Text:  if I could give this place negative Stars I would I've never been so humiliated in my life with all the crackheads and meth heads offering me drugs whoever is running that establishment has no idea or is on it. But if you're looking for a prostitute and some meth there's not a better place to look. The women who work there are hateful and i wouldnt make my worst enemy stay there.
