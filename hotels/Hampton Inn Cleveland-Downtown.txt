Hampton Inn Cleveland-Downtown
Rating: 4
Text: I enjoyed my recent stay at the Hampton Inn. The location was great for walking to events and restaurants downtown. The room was clean and modern. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Parking is at an additional cost, but is nearby. I would recommend as a place to stay downtown.

Text: I love Hampton Inn. We were there last week, and it was  an awesome experience. The hotel was clean and spacious and smelled sweet too. The bed and pillows were very soft. The breakfast was always warm, the staff were all friendly. We will definitely come back. Most if all, it is just a walking distance from all of the places we visited. This hotel ROCKS?

Text: Really great stay. Cleanliness and modern rooms exceeded my expectations, as well as the friendliness of every single staff member I encountered. Even the breakfast was good. Glad I didn't pay more for an upscale hotel when this was so close to the convention center I spent most of my time at. Highly recommended.

Text: I was lucky enough to score a great deal at this hotel on Hotwire a couple of weeks ago. There couldn't be a better location in Cleveland. The desk attendant was extremely personable and helpful. The room was funky and modern. When I find myself in Cleveland again this is where I will be staying. I must advise: there are a couple of secure parking garages around the corner that will save you a LOT of money compared to the Hotel's valet-only parking.

Text: Stayed at the Hampton for an Indians game. The hotel is a decent distance from the field, a nice walk. From the moment we got there, they made us feel welcome. The facility itself was nice and clean. The only issue we had was with the free breakfast - they had run out of many items and didn't seem like they wanted to replenish, though they ended up being very accommodating. Overall, o was very happy with our stay.
