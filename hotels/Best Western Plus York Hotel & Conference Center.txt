Best Western Plus York Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: This Best Western location has definitely earned the "Plus" in its name. Having stayed at both Plus and simple Best Westerns multiple times, the little upgrades in the Plus can make your stay more pleasant but also make it frustrating if they aren't well-taken care of. 
The rooms themselves were wonderful, with comfortable beds, clean sheets and bathrooms, and well-functioning appliances. The hallways and common areas were clean, with a well-appointed business center and fully-stocked coffee bar in the lobby for guests. The breakfast had a huge variety for a hot continental breakfast, and the kitchen staff were constantly refreshing and refilling the food; nothing was ever empty or messy for more than a few seconds. My only complaint would be that the pool needs some updating, but it was still 100% functional.

Text: The staff was very friendly. The breakfast was amazing! I've never had a better breakfast from a hotel before. The pool was nice. It wasn't too deep which is good since we had a 5 year old and he was able to touch at the shallow end. I loved that there is an Applebees right in the lobby! It made where to eat for dinner very easy.

Text: This has to be one of the nicest Best Western Pluses we have been to. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms very comfy and the breakfast outdid others! There was two kinds of waffles - one for gluten free and one regular and a LOT of items to put on your waffles, or pancakes if you preferred as there were pancakes as well. There was fruit flavor syrup (I love strawberry!) and whipped cream. YUM. The eggs were flavored with green pepper, etc. and there was a lot of bacon. And they had raisin bread for toast, which I love!. Of course there is cereals, yogurts etc. Overall I have not seen a nicer breakfast with so many wonderful items available to choose from! You really get your money's worth here.
