National House Inn
Rating: 4
Text: We stayed a long weekend there about 5 years ago. It was during a time the city was experiencing a lot of heavy truck and maintenance 24 hrs a day.  Had a room on the Michigan Ave side overlooking the Brooks Fountain Park and roundabout. It began raining in the middle of the night, and noise of tires on wet pavement below woke me and kept me awake. So those historically correct windows have their drawbacks. Also, the bathroom in that lower priced room was pretty much a tight closet and a bit spooky from low lighting. On the good side, the room was spacious, the bed cozy, the daily breakfast several notches above what I expected, and the dining room full with the other jovial guests.

Text: I was in Marshall for just one night, which included a stay at the National House Inn. What an absolutely charming place! The staff was warm and helpful, the accommodations themselves more than sufficient. I am always looking forward to my next stay!

Text: Stopped off to visit a friend. Seemed very cozy. I'm not really into BnBs, but if I was I would stay here. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.
