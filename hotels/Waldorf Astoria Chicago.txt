Waldorf Astoria Chicago

Text: Lovely space and amazingly helpful staff. Plus the patisserie attached is spectacular. One of the best eclairs in Chicago is on offer. I'm convinced they use some dark magic to fill it with pastry cream far beyond what conventional physics would allow.

Text: Asked to see a specific room to ensure it was what I needed regarding space and decor... The black puppet at the main desk was very nonchalant and would not let me see the room before 9am, even after I told him I was heading out of town then and wouldn't be back until when I actually needed the room (it was around 7am)... His reason was they don't want to disturb guests... It was just me, I didn't want to throw a party, I just wanted to take 2 minutes to see a empty room.

Text: Nice courtyard. Cool bar. Comfortable super clean rooms. No tipping is a standard practice here which is refreshing and made our stay so much easier. They even went to Walgreens to get me a phone charger and gave us a late check-out. The hotel is understated elegance. If you are looking for a super wow or awe moment you might be disappointed.

Text: World class event venue for receptions. Great atmosphere in the city. Not a fan of the cost of parking in the city in general and deters me from enjoying what Chicago has to offer.
