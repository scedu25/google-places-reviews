Text: This is a wonderful place to stay with a big group.bi regularly take my residence Hall staff here for retreats. There are ample bed spaces, large rooms for events, and natural areas to enjoy like the field, pond, and fire pits. The staff is always great to work with. We look forward to going every year!
