Couldn't sleep due to screaming kids running in the hall.
The guy at the front desk was nice and they are pet friendly

Text: Very reasonable prices - even lower at check in than on line. Fairly average rooms. The breakfast was ok; the milk was empty, for instance, but the staff was happy to get more for us.

Text: Displeased!  The hotel room was good, the bed was comfy.  I normally handle disappointment well but it was 37C and I had researched hotels before choosing this one because it had a pool and parking for a big rig.  However the pool was closed, rather than apologize the clerk half laughed at me and waited to see if we'd stay.  When we saw the pool we knew why she laughed...it looked like it hadn't been used in years and was taped over.  I was very Disappointed!

Text: Staff is friendly, accommodating and personable.  The new upgrades taking place are great.  I am traveling in a college mom budget when staying so decent safe and affordable is what is needed.
Cleanliness of room needs work though, everything found were housekeeping challenges

Text: Staff was good and polite. However, the place was struggling to deal with a serious bug problem. No live ones in our room, but I saw them crawling around the halls and lobby and we had 5 dead ones in our bathroom when we arrived.
