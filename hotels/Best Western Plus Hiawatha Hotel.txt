Best Western Plus Hiawatha Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Hiawatha was under the center of the total eclipse.  We stayed here the night before the eclipse and the hotel was full.  The staff handled the situation very well, kept their cool, were pleasant and welcoming to all.  We were checked in as though we were the only guests, in spite of the lobby being full of others waiting.  Our room was spacious, clean, and quiet.  We would definitely stay there again.  Our only problem was the WIFI, which was slow, but I am sure that was because of the high volume of users.

Text: Eclipse 2017, and Hiawatha was packed. The staff let me use the main lobby restroom when I wasn't a guest, I had to go bad. Thanks so much!
