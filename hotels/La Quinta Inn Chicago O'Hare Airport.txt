Text: I stayed one night at this location. The staff is horrible!!! They don’t treat they guest with respect! They don’t honor or respect reward members. I didn’t receive my elite bag at check in. The Suppose to be “Regional Manager” Zony Cohen is a prick. No respect. He hung up the phone in my face and talked real foul!! I recommend no one stay at this location if they want to be respected. Especially if you’re spending your hard earn money.

Text: On the positive side, we brought our dogs and they did not change a pet fee. However, Our room smelled like urine and the bathroom floors were full of hair. On the way back, I arrived at the airport and had to wait an hour for the shuttle back to my car.

Text: You guys need to work on the cleaning, we found many hair on the bathroom floor and the tub and some  bread crumbs on the carpet. They change the towels every day. Not sure if they change the sheets but no complaints about the beds. I know out there are many options and we get for what we pay but you can do better.
We ask for a room on high level and was peaceful. They offer free breakfast and is ok.
