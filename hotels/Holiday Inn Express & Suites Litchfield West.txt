Holiday Inn Express & Suites Litchfield West

Text: Our stay was amazing.  We have a family of 6 and our 4 kids loved everything about the stay.  We were right across the hallway way from the pool.  The kids thought that was so cool.  We are from Wisconsin and it was a long drive with 4 younger kids and turned out to be relaxing at the Holiday inn Express.  It's walking distance to get something to eat for your family.  The breakfast is wonderful.  They have an amazing wonderful lady named Linda who takes care of everything.  It was so clean and everything was stocked up and she was extremely helpful with our kids.  Also the lady at the front desk her name was Bre was amazing with myself on the phone and in person.  Please if you happen to notice these two ladies tell them what a wonderful job they are doing.  Also the theme is Route 66 decorations when  you  walk  in. Awesome.  Love it.  Our whole family recommends this fine place to stay at.

Text: The hotel is only two years old. Everything is sparkling new and in great shape.  The decor creates a bright and comfortable atmosphere.  The shower is hot, and the bed is comfortable with lots of pillows.  Cold beer in the canteen shop and right beside two restaurants. Keurig coffee makers in the guest rooms along with a fridge and microwave.  Perfect place for a wary traveler.
