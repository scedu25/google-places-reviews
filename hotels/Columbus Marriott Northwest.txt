Text: Best Marriott Experience I've ever had!   From check-in to check-out, everything was exceptionally nice.  The restaurant even made food for me that was off the menu.  An absolutely great hotel.  My thanks to the staff for a great stay!

Text: First time at this location and apparently it has been renovated in the last few months. Room was clean, modern and comfortable. Restaurant is passable if you're hungry and not up to driving today nearby restaurant. Good local beer selection if you'd like to have a drink and relax. Staff is friendly and clearly there are a lot of regular visitors to this hotel. Will definitely stay again.

Text: Attended a conference at this location. Conference hall was large and acoustics were good. When lunch was provided, it was decent. They served 3 types of sandwiches. The steak was good, but kind of bland. Service staff was on the ball and very courteous.

Text: We have stayed at this Marriott many, many times with the Ohio Elks Association and we have always had a wonderful experience. The recent renovation is beautiful and very updated and modern! The rooms are wonderful; we had a king room and there was plenty of room for all of our luggage, our 2-year old's luggage/toys, and the pack and play (provided by the hotel). He was able to run around and play without feeling to crowded! The staff were very accommodating when we asked for a microwave, extra towels, and a hair dryer (which was missing from our bathroom). The only complaints we had were that with the new renovation there is only one drawer for personal belongings/clothes and we would have appreciated a tub in our bathroom to make it easier to bathe our son.

Text: Seemed very nice. I didn't stay long. My wife and I visited for a drink after a friends wedding. I didn't get a room, I just saw the lobby and bar. So I don't feel comfortable giving a 5, but from what I saw it was a nice place. Also everyone I know who did stay had nothing bad to report.
