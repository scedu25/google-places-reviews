Text: Love this place! My husband and I stayed here for one night and didn't want to leave! For starters the staff/owners are amazing! Very nice and helpful. Now for our room.... Awesome! The bed was so comfortable, plenty of pillows and room for us both. Jacuzzi tub is awesome! State of the art! Built-in radio, lights, and powerful jets. Huge TV, Great picture, and lots of cannels. Very impressed with this Inn. Even though it's cost to the hiway the room was very quiet! Oh and PETS ARE ALLOWED!
