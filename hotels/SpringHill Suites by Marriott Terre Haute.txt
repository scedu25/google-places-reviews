SpringHill Suites by Marriott Terre Haute
Rating: 3
Text: Marriott is my regular go-to place and so I look specifically for their properties on the road. This particular location seemed hidden. GPS dropped me in parking lot about 300 yards away and I would have seen it had they turned on the sign on the building. After a 10 minute drive and a different navigation app I found it behind another hotel. The lobby was clean and the front desk manager was friendly. My room was clean and prepared. The 3 start treating comes from the Wall mounted HVAC system. I'm in the third floor and even though I have turned off the fan on my unit the room seems to vibrate because another unit was so loud. When I turned mine on I had to nearly double the volume on the TV and then go figure out which panel on the unit was causing all the rattles. The rate for the room was good but I would have paid more for a quieter room.

Text: A convenient location near I70. There are lots of places to eat nearby. It great to be able to walk to a restaurant after all day in the car. The hotel is nice. When traveling with kids having 2 double beds and the extra pull out sofa bed and the refigerator and microwave are very helpful.  Staff are very nice. We love any of the Marriott hotels but definitely prefer those that include breakfast.

Text: Came in without a reservation and was in my suite within 5 minutes. Brittany at the front desk was very professional and helpful. Excellent service. Price was virtually the same, except this hotel was recently redone and is excellent all around. Comfortable bed too. Will return and recommend.

Text: The location is really convenient. The staff are courteous and professional. Left too early to try the breakfast, but a great perk!
