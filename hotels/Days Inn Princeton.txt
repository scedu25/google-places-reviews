Days Inn Princeton

Text: I stayed here with my family of four for a weekend.  It's what I'd expect from an inexpensive chain hotel.  It's a bit outdated, but clean enough and the TV, bathroom and climate controls all worked well.  The attached bar has good Happy Hour prices and the free breakfast is fine.

Text: Rooms were clean and tidy. There was free WiFi. Building had an odd smell but wasn't necessarily bad, just different. No complaints, but nothing that makes it amazing, it's just a place to spend a night or two while traveling.

Text: They redid the floors, showers since our last stay. Room was clean. Hallways had a distinct odor but otherwise fine. Normal breakfast, they were out of forks however. Outdoor pool looked clean from vantage point. Right off the highway. Affordable if all you're looking for is a clean shower and bed.

Text: Was very good to us. We were traveling on motorcycles and needed a place for the night. Stopped early because tired of riding in the rain. No reservation. The room was good & clean. They're in the process of some fixing but overall all was good. Visited their lounge for a drink and a game of pool. Within walking distance of multiple food places & stores. Very accommodating to us to stay a second night due to storms. People working here are very nice.
