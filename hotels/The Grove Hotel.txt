The Grove Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: This is an absolutely remarkable hotel, with a fantastic restaurant and Brewpub next door. This is a great place to stay if you're ever in Kingsville, but this is also a great place to go in and of itself. It is definitely a destination the mark on your map.

Text: Absolutely fantastic!  The room was wonderful - we stayed in the Brew Master Suite.  Fantastic size & comfy bed!  Bathroom was clean and a shower to die for - roomy and great water pressure.  A truly unique room with the access to the Brew House via our own balcony.  Serena greeted us with such a welcoming smile and above and beyond service.  It was our 10 year wedding anniversary - a bottle of Pelee wine was in the room!  The coffee lounge room is the cutest thing I have seen.  Such a wonderful place to stay.  Highly recommend!  I want to come back!  Kingsville itself is a wonderful community, everyone was so warm and welcoming.  Thanks again!

Text: We went for dinner and drinks. The beer is really good and a great price. But the food is way overpriced for small portions and one of the burgers needed to be sent back. It's an awesome atmosphere though. A must see

Text: Beautiful decor and very friendly and helpful front desk. Huge king beds were extremely comfortable (almost didn't want to get out of bed!) And really enjoyed lounging in the fluffy robes!  Thanks for a great stay!

Text: Great craft beer and selection. Service was friendly and on the ball, my only note would be the pizza. I found the pea flour flavour overwhelming which created a dry bland flavour. However they just opened and I'm sure are testing out different recipes. The desserts were awesome (especially the s'mores marshmallow). l definitely will be back again.
