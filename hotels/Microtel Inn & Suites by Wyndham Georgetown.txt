Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Georgetown

Text: Comfortable bed. quick stay. nice checking and check out. About 15-20 minutes to Lexington but was too tired to drive anymore. No bugs and overall not bad cleaning I personally think they all need better cleaning. All for less than 100 a night. I say score. Don't expect a big breakfast.

Text: This hotel has no Internet access. Enough said. Some reviewers said they "love" the hotel. Come on, no one loves a microtel. Get therapy. Awful hotel, don't stay here.

Text: It's a great value for the price. Very clean and comfortable bed. Kinda small, so it might not work for families on vacation, but for my needs it was perfect.
