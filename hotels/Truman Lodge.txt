Truman Lodge
Rating: 1
Text: Our women's bowling team booked a room this past September at the Truman travel lodge. We found another hotel with better accommodations and called back the same day to cancel our reservation. When asked for a cancellation confirmation number, we were advised that they did not give them. The weekend of our tournament in Warsaw, we received a call from the Truman lodge inquiring about our reservation. We explained that we did not have any reservations at that hotel. The manager proceeded to call us back and was very rude to us. He would not let us even speak.  As a business owner I would want to know if my employees spoke to people this way, so I called back and spoke with Debbie Moore who was just as rude as the manager, her son. Please take this into consideration when booking your reservation with them.

Text: Stayed for a full week without a porch light. Staff was very friendly and room was relatively clean. Would stay again. Awesome rate and pet friendly. Made my own bed each night and floors got pretty crumby from the lack of service.

Text: Stayed there last night. We left at 12:30 in the evening to head home because the sheets looked like they were never changed from the last person, very outdated rooms the tv was a ancient model that had a awful picture. I kept feeling itchy on the bed just had to get out of there. Came home and washed everything we had in case of bugs. They need to redo this entire hotel. Just stay at the newest one by Walmart. I can see why it was so cheap.
