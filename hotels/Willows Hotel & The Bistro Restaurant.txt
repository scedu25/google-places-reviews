Willows Hotel & The Bistro Restaurant
Rating: 3
Text: Very close to Starved Rock, and the nicest hotel in the area. Still, overpriced with lackluster service. For example, a 2+ night stay is required if you want to stay on Saturday probably because hotel staff is only on site from 8AM-2PM Monday thru Saturday (better make sure you don't need anything before 2 or you're SOL). Their nicest rooms come stocked with a 27" TV/VCR combo. The whole place feels like it hasn't been updated in years, but they're still happy to charge near $200 a night. Granted, you're probably not coming to Starved Rock to stay in your hotel - but for the price, you would probably expect a little more effort.

Text: Breakfast was fantastic, room was great.  Hotel would be a 5 star rating if not for the exterior (entire building needs a power wash and coat of paint) and the fact we were the ONLY ones in the place (no front desk workers).  A little creepy coming in at night after fireworks.  Full kitchen, fireplace, and jacuzzi made up for exterior!

Text: Food was served super hot. Absolutely delicious. Big portions. My over medium eggs were perfectly cooked.

Text: I came here for my honeymoon with my wife and absolutely loved it. Breakfast was amazing and the staff are wonderful. The room was well maintained and looked fantastic. A great suite for the money! Will definitely be staying here again!

Text: The Pinto room is very nice.  The TV could use some updating though.  And it is right next to a lot of places you can just walk to and enjoy the day.  Plus the free wine tasting is nice to have and go relax.
