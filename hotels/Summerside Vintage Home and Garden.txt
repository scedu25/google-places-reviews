Text: This place is wonderful!!! The owners are awesome! It's a quaint and quiet place. You have access to a grill, hammock, and a fire pit. There is a really cool Creek behind the apartment that has baby fish and crawdads to catch. Richard and Rhonda (the owners) will tell you neat places to visit. There's places to eat near by and a Dollar General close by. The apartment has a kitchen area with a microwave, coffee pot, and a refrigerator. It fits 6 people comfortably. We really enjoyed our time there and we will definitely be back!!!!
