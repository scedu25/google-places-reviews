Text: I don't care what anyone say's about this hotel it is the best. My husband was on the road going to work on the pipeline and needed a place to sleep and quick. So I got on the internet and started searching this motel had the best price and the nicest people working at the front desk. He got a great room and the people was so helpful. I came into an emergancy that night and needed him and could not reach him on his cell and they went to the room and woke him up for me.

Text: Horrible, wouldnt suggest anyone to stay there. House keepers didnt clean the room, GM was drinking and drunk on the job, GM was always talking on her cellphone, clerks were rude, smelt like smoke all over the hotel, sewer was backed up with dirty needles, I wouldnt recommend anyone to stay there.
