Text: Surprisingly good room. Right where we needed to be. Very pleasant staff top to bottom. Odd arrival and they were more than happy to get us right in a room.

Text: The staff was very nice, but the room left a little bit to be desired. The floors had dirt all over them, the sinks and toilets we're dirty, and I have an inkling suspicion (although it is just a suspicion) that the beds weren't clean (they just didn't smell right). It was not worth the price I paid, but it fit the needs of a "I need a place to crash for the night and I need it now" requirement.

Text: I was I. Lexington for a one day conference and this hotel was minutes away. I was skeptical to book because of some of the reviews I had read but the location was perfect and some of the reviews were good so I have it a shot. The room was clean and very cool when I arrived. It had clean towels and the bathroom and sink were very clean. Smelled fresh as well. I have absolutely no complaints about this room or the front desk staff. She was very friendly and quick!  I would stay here again.

Text: Our room had the unique aroma of ashtray, mildew and dog's dirt. I don't know if we paid extra for that but it certainly was well worth it.  The bedcover was gross, the sheets were about 12 hours post orgy, stained and hair. So special. The bathroom was tiny and outdated but did come with an itty-bitty bar of soap, one washcloth and one small towel, enough to comfortably bathe the rat that probably lives in the air conditioning system. I wouldn't go back there again if they paid me.  Instead I'll stay in a nice place like a sewer.   Beware.
