Text: This place has phenomenal customer service. We had a great night stay, but then when we got home we realized we forgot some items in our room. They were important documents so I called and Katie at the front desk made sure to find the missing documents, but then scanned and emailed them back over to us as well as mailed the original copies back to us. Overall the hotel was clean Smoke free and has a great pool. I recommended highly

Text: Friendly service, good continental breakfast. Rooms were nice, but had some hair in the bathroom floor and a drink left in the fridge. Otherwise, very clean.

Text: Nice property with what appears to be recently renovated rooms. The public space is also well thought out. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
