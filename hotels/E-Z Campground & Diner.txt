E-Z Campground & Diner

Text: Good food. Okay camping. Need updated toilet/shower facilities. One guy who I'm assuming is an owner was less than friendly but rest of staff was nice for the most part.

PART 2 ......
Now that I've been here for a while I'd have to say that I was never made to feel welcome here. It's as if you aren't a "regular" here then you shouldn't be here. Was made to feel very much like an outsider. What a shame because the food and coffee are very good. Moving on.
