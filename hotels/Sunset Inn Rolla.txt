Text: For the price this place isn't bad at all. I have been here for over 12 hours so far and no bugs at all. The mini fridge was leaking a little bit, went down to the front seat and they were more than happy to fix it. The bed I personally find uncomfortable but I love super soft  beds and this one is firm. Oh one more thing there needs to be more plug ins. There was only one behind the bed, one behind the TV, and one by the sink. I kinda would like to charge my phone (since its my alarm clock) next to or near the bed. Oh and you don't have to go inside to get too all of the rooms some open to the outside.
