Text: Me and my wife had the most pleasurably stay in this relaxing and quiet bed and breakfast. The room was beautiful and the view from our sliding doors to the cliffs was amazing. I highly recommend staying when traveling through without any children or pets.

Text: Had a great time during my stay.  They accommodated my every wish with a smile and I felt right at home as I was able to watch the NBA playoffs.  Thanks Carol and John for the hospitality I look forward to staying again the next time I am passing through.
