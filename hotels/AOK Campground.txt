AOK Campground

Text: I am going to try to be as nice as possible in this review. DO NOT STAY HERE! It is more like a camper junk yard than a campground (see picture attached, and believe it or not, this is NOT the worst camper there)! We also did not feel comfortable at all staying there, because of the shady people who LIVE there in there dilapidated campers all year round. We ended up staying INSIDE our entire stay. I don't know what the other positive reviews are about, because I can HONESTLY say this is the WORST campground we have ever stayed at in our lives. If you do ignore this post, know you've been warned. And yes, this was being nice!

Text: Water is terrible, but overall experience was good. A few of the neighbors were full timers, who lived there permanently - management needs to move these types to the back of the property to a more permanent locations as they tend to accumulate more "stuff" which is an eye sore. Keeping the front half for the temporary spots. This would give the park a better curb appeal.

Text: We stayed here while our dog was in the Purdue University veterinary hospital. The staff was friendly and very helpful. There are a lot of full time people but everyone was nice and courteous.
