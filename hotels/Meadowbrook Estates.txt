Text: The worst place you could move into not because of the upkeep of the park but because of the management and the other people who live there. There are cats everywhere threw out the park! Bringing flees into trailer! My family and I do not feel safe. Several times we have had adult strangers peeping threw our Windows and walking next to our cars in the middle of the night. We've seen strangers eating on our porch late at night and you will get a very expensive fine if your grass or bushes are over an inch long. We've seen very young kids at the playground smoking weed and they throw things at your car as your driving by. The management do not work with you or care about anything you disagree with once you sign that lease they turn into evil people. They have a long list of violations and The fine for those are insanely expensive and when we told the manager that we wouldn't be able to pay our grass fine she told us "Well you pay your rent on time every month so you should be fine". Rent is very exspensive with all the added on prices. The trailer we purchased had several hidden problems. We very strongly regret the decision to choose this place to live and we are counting the days until our lease is up.

Text: Do not move here you will constantly feel like you are being stalked by the park crew here. The manager drives around the park after hours looking for violations. She will claim she put a bs notice on your door for something and then you get charged for not fixing the violation you didn’t know you had but she will claim she has before and after pictures of your lot. The lot rent is ridiculous and goes up every year. Definitely not worth it.

Text: Not the best and lot rent can get quite expensive.  Water bill which you pay monthly with rent is the same as paying a 3 month bill if you own a house. Most homes are old but selling for updated prices. Depending on what section of the park you buy a home in all determines on what kind of neighbors you'll have. Not a bad place for starters but would not recommend for long term living.

Text: Feral cats every where and are bringing flees to the trailers. They do not stop people from feeding them.
