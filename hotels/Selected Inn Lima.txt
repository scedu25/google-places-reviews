Text: To start off I ended up arguing with the desk clerk. Then I get up in the room and call downstairs because I need pillows and towels and wash rags and I'm told I have to wait until tomorrow and if they don't have any pillows. Half the stuff they say they furnace is a lie there is no bar and restaurant or whatever. I wouldn't even give this Motel a corner of a star, if I could.

Text: CAUTION this is NOT a Days Inn. It's a Ray's Inn.  I don't know how old the pictures are  that are on this website, but let me tell you this motel look nothing like the pictures. This place should be torn down! The drapes were shredded, there was clothing from other rooms lying outside the doors. It looks just like the motel that was in the sitcom "My Name is Earl", yep, with the flying garbage in the parking lot, if you could call that a parking lot. Room rates are $80.00 single with a seven day advance cancellation notice. Rip-off. I was so fearful to stay there that I packed my bags up and walked to the Comfort Inn next door, which is very nice My room at the Comfort Inn was $60.00 and very clean with wow immensities and service.

Text: stayed several months while working in the area.  rates were very resonable. building is older and shows some wear and tear, but room was clean and spacious.  employees were very helpful.  laundry on the premises was a definate plus.
