Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago O'Hare Rosemont
Rating: 5
Text: Flight was cancelled going back home to Boston so when I researched the local area hotels I came across embassy suites. They had the best rate with every "bang for your buck." Free breakfast, kind staff and beautiful rooms all well accommodated. I was recommended to a deep dish pizza place as well, Giordano's, and it was amazing accompanied with many other recommendations I only wish I had the time too see. This hotel is a place I'd return too and would recommend it to anyone.

Text: I absolutely love Embassy Suites no matter what city. This time was no exception. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the curtain draw stick was not working so when the sun came up, it was hitting me directly in the face. The same for the shower curtain. It too was broken so I felt like something was in the tub with me. Also, our room was directly in front of the elevator. Heard traffic and kids the entire time. In spite of all this, I'd stay there again. Service was excellent and the suites are so beautiful and spacious. I love the Embassy!

Text: All the staff has been very courteous and helpful. We have two couples staying in a room with a queen bed and a pull out sofa bed. When we asked for an extra pillow and blanket, and they gave us 4 pillows and 2 blankets and made sure we were comfortable. Complimentary breakfast was great-included scrambled eggs, bacon, etc and not just bagel, muffin, fruit bar. There was even a made to order omelet bar. The room was very clean and stocked. Overall, very satisfied.

Text: This was a very nice hotel and the staff is GREAT. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I dropped my notebook stylus pen on the free hotel shuttle to the airport so I called the front desk and Stacy tracked it down for me. It was at my house in Colorado the next day! Thanks again!

Text: We both had fish I had the Chilean sea bass and wife had the Salmon both fish were excellent. The potatoes on the other hand were terrible we had to chock them down. They tasted like they had been under a warmer for 3 days and so dry. The mashed had a similar feel an taste but not as bad. Service was great.
