Text: Had a fantastic time here.  Wonderful hosts and meals.  The house is gorgeous and full of history.  Totally enjoyed the backyard with the fireplace as well.  Easy walking distances to most of the sites around town and bike trail.  Thanks!

Text: At $130 (as of 6.5.2011), we couldn't find a better B&B value in Augusta. Friendly owners Lynn & Bob were great, and the breakfast was incredible. We started with a fresh fruit plate, fresh juices, and had a killer baked ham omelette. Of course, the entire stay was worth the towering cinnamon roll volcano. We may have been sore from a 15 mile ride on the Katy Trail (we're both pretty green cyclists), but all pain was forgotten over a buoyant chat with Lynn after breakfast. Highly recommended.
