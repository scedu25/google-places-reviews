Courtyard by Marriott St. Louis Airport/Earth City

Text: What you would expect from a Courtyard. Clean, courteous staff, nice rooms. Always good for a beer at the bistro. This isn't a mark on the courtyard, but the location doesn't really lend itself to be that entertaining. Not very close to any restaurants or entertainment. Everything is a short drive or Uber though.

Text: Excellent customer service and pleasant check-in experience.  First floor accessiblity room was spacious, quiet, and cozy.  King size bed was amazing.  Definitely would stay here again.  The Bistro is also great for drinks and an after dinner Browny Carmel Sunday.

Text: Great team working for the customer!
We had an emergent life and death situation with my Dad and needed a place to stay after his extensive surgeries. Even though it was 6am the staff ALL worked hard to give us an opportunity to check in early.  We had been up over 24 hours caring for him and meeting with physicians who were doing everything possible to save his life. The Marriott staff was also a "lifesaver" in a way because they helped us avoid booking an extra night stay.  Thank you, Marriott!! And by the way, my Dad is slowly making progress to a desirable recovery status- which for us, is the MOST important thing!!

Text: I loved the hotel! It was really clean but one thing I wish was that there was free breakfast. The pool was also nice. Overall I had a really good experience!
