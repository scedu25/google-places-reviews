Holiday Inn Sioux City
Rating: 5
Text: My family needed a room for 10 hours for a small reunion and had to have a place where there was phone service besides cell service. We also needed a 9am check in. I called several hotels around Sioux City and not one would accommodate us. When I called The Holiday Inn on Gordan Drive, they were more than happy to work with me and help us out. The room was very clean and the customer service impeccable. My husband and I stay often in Sioux City if we are attending concerts, etc. and we will definitely come here again and will also refer family and friends.

Text: The location was good. Right downtown. Rooms were nice. Only problem was that I needed a long bed but got 2 queens instead.

Text: Clean, well staffed. The elevators need some maintaining. I had to use the stairs to get to the 6th floor. Otherwise this is a nice Hotel.

Text: Good value for the location. The walls were pretty thin and the tv in my room atleast had very fuzzy picture quality but the room was clean and well maintained and the pillows were incredibly comfortable!

Text: The rooms were nice and comfortable. Price was reasonable. Food was disappointing and not at all what I've had in the past. Okay experience overall.
