Text: Quaint,  country hotel, conveniently located.    The owner is a kind and thoughtful woman. The hotel was fairly clean, but no amenities in the room other than two servings of coffee. Fridge and microwave were extra fee. No serving of breakfast and no eating in the lobby sitting area.  Otherwise, not too bad for a motor lodge in rural Iowa.

Text: I was really pleased with how clean and affordable my stay was. I was kind of surprised with how clean everything was, most of my past experiences have been less than satisfactory. Great location, right off the Interstate, and convenient!
