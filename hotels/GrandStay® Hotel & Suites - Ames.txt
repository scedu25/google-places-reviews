GrandStay® Hotel & Suites - Ames
Rating: 4
Text: Convenient location near Interstate and US Hwy. Rooms have a kitchen with stove, microwave, dishwasher (with dishes)! First room has the kitchen and den with sofabed. The second room has a comfortable bed and closet. The bathroom is modern and clean like the rest of the place. The free breakfast is great and they have at least one hot item featured each day, in addition to the waffle maker. Surprisingly, you could hear people walking in the room above you fairly easily. I would request a top floor room next time. A couple we were traveling with had a malfunctioning AC unit. Management responded appropriately with a box fan and a partial refund without any hassle. That is a mark of good customer service.

Text: Type of room: 1 Queen bed suite Amenities: Full sized fridge Two burner range Living room area with chair and love seat Bathroom: Shower-bathtub combination - showerhead and faucet were not in good condition. Large enough space in the bathroom for a 6'3" male. Overall a fine hotel room, but the shower was not convenient for someone over 5'10".

Text: In general, the hotel was very clean and had good service. My only complaint was that I wish I had more consumables such as toilet paper and tissues available in my room so I didn't have to ask the front desk. A mild inconvenience, though. Lovely staff, good breakfast options, decent little pool and hot tub. Overall I would absolutely recommend if you're in the area.
