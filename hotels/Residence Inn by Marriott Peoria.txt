Residence Inn by Marriott Peoria
Rating: 1
Text: This place is a dumpster fire on wheels. 
1) It's not in a nice part of town, folks not staying were on the property loitering and using the free internet. 
2) The rooms need to be repainted and deep cleaned. The trim and baseboards looked like they were going to fall off. 
3) The bed and bathroom were not very clean, if they were even cleaned. 
Look I like the Residence Inn and understand you get what you pay for, its not a Ritz, but at the same time this place is unacceptable. I would never stay here again, even for free.

Text: They were amazing. Clean and very comfortable. Large rooms and great breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was a busy week in Peoria a softball tournament was in town. We were there for a funeral. We had booked at the Baymont which sucked. Residents gave us their last room at a bereavement rate. Highly recommend.

Text: I would give this hotel 5 stars but I can't because of the housekeepers and the front desk worker Kenisha unprofessional. The housekeepers ask are you leaving tips and Kenisha is rude. If they can't be polite don't say nothing at all. I have been staying at this hotel all month the food is delicious and the other staff members are great. My second home.
