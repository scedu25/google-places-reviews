Hickory Grove Campground

Text: Beautifully Landscaped, clean restrooms & showers. The owner & the on-site manager were very friendly and inviting.  Many spaces for fill side travel trailer etc., however I was temp camping and I got a spot with electricity close to the bathrooms and water. If you come tent camping be sure to bring food and a way to cook or be prepared for a drive into town. The closest town, Sheffield, has a grocery store a Minute Market and a couple of Pub type bar and grills.

Text: Fantastic Campground, not too far from the highway but far enough the way to make you feel like you're camping. Large trees Waterway for great fishing that bumpers up to Park and well maintained. Also Management is great to work with. Myself and my family will return and I will recommend to friends.

Text: Hickory Grove Campground was one of the prettiest places that we stayed during our 6 week tour of the US. There are lots of trees, well kept grounds and campsites with plenty of room between campers. The new owners, Joan and Dave,  are the wonderful kind of people you would love to be friends with if you lived nearby. They were in the process of making a number of improvements to the property. My husband and I are looking forward to making Hickory Grove a stop on our next trip out west.

Text: Hickory Grove Campgroud. This Campgroud is one of our favorites to date. We have been on the road for two years now in our 34ft Class A. Seeing our beautiful USA. So needless to say we have stayed at some interesting campgrounds. This is one of the nicest. Quiet, well manicured sites. Nice spacing between neighbors. Planned activities on the weekends. Friendly, courteous owners and full timers. Everyone makes you feel like you are part of their camping family. 

Dave & Joan the owners, do all they can to make sure your stay is an enjoyable/relaxing experience. 

We would absolutely recommend a visit to this campground!

Text: As a year round camper, we are very excited about our new owners Dave and Joan. The changes here are so improved. There's nothing more exciting then hearing children out playing and having a good time, this is something that has dwindled over the years. AND THAT SOUND IS COMING BACK. They also have taken care of our mosquito problem. I understand we can be expecting more improvements..... We are one big happy camping family.......Thank you Dave and Joan
