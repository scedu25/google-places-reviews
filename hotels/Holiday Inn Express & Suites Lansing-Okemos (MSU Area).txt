Text: The hotel has the layout of a fun house maze. You will spend 15 trying to find your room. The breakfast bar is standard, no problems there. Rooms were clean and updated as well. I was there for a 3 day professional event and they served a nano bar for lunch. Want too impressed with that

Text: Went to a funeral near here. We had connecting rooms with our families. Great breakfast and great service! Only down fall is this place is so big it can get confusing. Also no hot tub. Otherwise great stay :)

Text: In three years, I’ve spent over thirty nights in this particular motel. They’ve turned me into a loyal Holiday Inn Express user. The staff is always helpful, the beds feel wonderful, and (my favorite part) the linens are sparkly white.

Text: No complaints about my stay. Their pool looked amazing but I never got around to using it. They were having some construction done so the elevators didn't work the week I was there. If that is a problem, be sure to call ahead and ask for the first floor.
