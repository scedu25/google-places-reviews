Hawkins House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I stayed at the Hawkins House in July. Patty and Stanley were wonderful hosts. Nice and clean which is most important to me. Food was very good. I highly recommend staying at the Hawkins House. Make sure that you take a trip down the Current River.  It is beautiful! That was the purpose of our trip to Eminence. Well worth the 6 hour drive.

Text: Wonderful experience!  We agree with all the positive comments given to this exceptional place.  Patty is a charming hostess without being intrusive.  Her breakfasts are definitely worth waking up for--especially the peach French toast, as several have already noted.  (She'll even give you her recipe!)  We stayed in Carrie's Suite--the jacuzzi is a relaxing way to end a day of enjoying the surrounding areas of Eminence.  Definitely a five-star stay.

Text: I had the pleasure of staying at the Hawkins house this past Monday and Tuesday.  Spent a delightful time with Patty and Stanley Frazier the proprietors and hosts. I spent a relaxing time 'just a swinging" on the porch swing located on the wrap around porch.  Don't miss an excursion and/or a fishing trip down the scenic Jacks's Fork and Current Rivers.  You will see some amazing Ozark bluffs plus some great fishing.  They both are loaded with smallmouth bass and goggle eye just waiting for a morsel to come floating by.  My third time here and it won't be my last.

Text: Just spent 4 wonderful days here.  Patty is a great host (her mom was a bonus).  The house is  a well maintained mixture of nostalgic and modern flare.  Breakfast is  standard country offerings with some unique surprises likes French toast w/ peaches. Our family groups occupied all rooms and it was a home away from home. We would not hesitate to stay there again.
