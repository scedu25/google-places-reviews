Text: Very nice hotel that was clean and nicely appointed. Perfect for a business traveler or family. They have exercise room and complimentary breakfast each morning. The room I had (single king) was quite comfortable with a desk, refrigerator, mocrowave and coffee maker. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the room had good decor.

Text: Awesome hotel. We arrived after a long 12 hour day of driving, and then staff were very friendly. We wound down by swimming in their well-kept, nicely heated indoor pool. The room was clean and spacious, but it was the breakfast that prompted me to just go ahead and write a review. Awesome breakfast! Lots of warm choices that they keep fresh and in good supply. It tastes really good, and my kids ate a perfectly hearty breakfast before we got back on the road. We are very pleased with our experience!

Text: Check in process was easy, and our room was nice. There was a space where a refrigerator would go, but we didn't have a fridge. That was a little weird, but not s big concern for us. We used the pool which was nice and warm. My kids and I had a good stay.
