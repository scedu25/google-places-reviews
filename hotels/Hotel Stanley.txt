Hotel Stanley
Rating: 1
Text: These people constantly go in your room shut off your stuff allow others to eat your foods stored in a sharing fridge. They run this motel like a jail there is a curfew for visitors and the people renting the room my advice is go to hotel on highway its more personal space there! The owners are very rude and always in your businesses.
