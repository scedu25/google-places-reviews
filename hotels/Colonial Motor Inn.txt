Text: Everyone was very friendly & helpful. The owners went above and beyond to provide us with a great room. Parking is perfect & it's located very close to everything you might want to see. It was very easy to find the convention center from the hotel. And the prices were fantastic! Thank you Colonial Motor Inn!
