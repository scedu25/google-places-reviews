Super 8 Troy
Rating: 5
Text: The nicest, cleanest, most unique Super 8 I've ever stayed at. Lodge style atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff are your first clue that this isn't your average Super 8. Great experience.

Text: Slight smell in the room. I've come to expect it in most hotels though. Room was clean and comfortable. Fixtures, appliances, tv etc all seemed new. Breakfast had a nice selection. Friendly employees. We checked in after their guest social was over. The young man at the desk asked if he could bring us some refreshments that were left over but we declined.

Text: Nice facility. We were greeted with happy hour, finger food, and comfortable rooms. My room smelled a bit strange, but everything else was in great shape.
