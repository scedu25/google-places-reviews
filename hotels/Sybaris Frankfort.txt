Text: Great room, except one of the lights was stuck permanently on, making sleep rather difficult. The front desk was quite unhelpful and did not resolve the issue until the next day. They said the manager would be in contact, but as it turned out I had to contact them. Then they offered a partial minor refund, and then a free night, but have yet to follow up on their word even after I checked up a couple times. At this point, I would be reluctant to provide any recommendation on account of the exceptionally unprofessional service as indicated by other reviews as well. 

Great venue, clean, modern; but honestly pretty sub-par, lousy service for what you pay in comparison to anywhere else in that range. If you're ok with that, try them out, otherwise steer clear. I rely on reviews a lot, so I figured I would contribute.

Text: Our experience was amazing! When you walk in you're in paradise immediately. The room was very clean, Everything was fresh and the ladies in the office were extremely helpful as well. The pool and hot tub alone are worth it,then there's the massage chair,steam room and enough mirrors to ensure you don't miss a thing!! Will definitely return. My husband and I did not want to come home.

Text: Stayed at the Sybaris Frankfort for 2 nights. The room was very clean, the staff was fabulous and the amenities were amazing. My only complaint would be that there's no housekeeping but it would have been difficult since we never left the room much so I understand why they don't provide it. They do however drop of fresh towels and toiletries at your request. Will definitely stay here again!

Text: Great couples get away. Very clean rooms and very private. Once you close the door you feel as if you have left the world behind and can focus on you and your significant other. We have been to this location several times. Staff is great and rooms are updated and very nice. You will typically find a couple minor annoyances like a light or switch not working or a bit of trim that looks slapped up in place. But, having a large space with pool and hot tub makrs this is a great place to get away together. On our most recent stay they upgraded us to a suite with an addituonal whirlpool tub! By the way, the rooms at this location feature the Liberator Esse lounges which are amazing!
