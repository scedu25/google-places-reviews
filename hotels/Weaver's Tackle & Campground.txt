Text: We are still here for one more night and I am sad to go. Stayed in a cabin and it was cozy. The pool is the best I've seen at a campground. Permanent residents are very welcoming and friendly. We will make this an annual trip. Only recommendation is more shelving for clothes and food. Not a complaint just a recommendation. Thanks for a great visit!!!!!

Text: I have been trout fishing at Bennett Springs State Park before I could walk. My parents would put me in a back pack with just my head sticking out as they would fish the stream. It has always been a tradition to stop in Weaver's Tackle to get lures and any gear we need as well as check the different lunkers caught. The customer service has been outstanding every time I visit and the employees are always happy to assist in any way possible. I will be heading down in August and can not wait to stop in Weaver's to grab lures and supplies as well as enjoy some friendly conversation.
