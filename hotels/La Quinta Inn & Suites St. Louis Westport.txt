Text: Front desk, Dave Thomas very helpful. Lobby very nice welcoming atmosphere. Room was more than we could have hopes for. Clean, well appointed. The area was so convenient to restaurants, main road.. Would stay again.

Text: We've been on a cross country trip for a few days now and we've had a pretty... interesting hotel/motel experience the past couple of nights. This hotel was definitely a breath of relief. Comfy beds, clean and spacious rooms, hooters right next door, breakfast was yummy, and it was even pet friendly! The staff was very nice and the entire hotel was newly renovated. Would definitely stay here again!

Text: My family and I stayed here while we vacayed in STL. You can see it's been recently renovated and looks very updated and clean! We did have one incident with our room, but it was resolved quickly and efficiently. Staff was so friendly and professional. Would recommend!
