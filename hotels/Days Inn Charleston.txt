Days Inn Charleston

Text: We came to this hotel on our way in to see the eclipse. Camp sites and hotels closer to totality we're booked up. We just wanted a cheap nights stay - and that's exactly what we got. Not in a bad way! For ~$50 we came into a clean, air conditioned room. Staff was very friendly. Complimentary breakfast included cereal, bagels, muffins, orange juice, coffee, etc. There was no shower liner, which kind of bothered me. Overall, I'd easily stay again.

Text: All rooms are non-smoking but the 1st room assigned smelled strongly of smoke, 2nd room was good. Breakfast is all cold food.
