Text: The owner of this hotel is super nice! Our car was out of power in the morning when we wanted to leave. We asked for help, and he was very willing to help and told us to be more careful. He saved our trip. We appreciate him!

Text: Nice, clean and quiet room. Perfectly fine for an overnight stop on the way through town. Breakfast in the morning definitely left something to be desired but the kids were happy with blueberry muffins and Froot Loops.

Text: I chose the Days Inn Ames because most of the Days Inns that I've stayed at are nice and clean, but this one is completely opposite. It smells of smoke in the hallways because people are allowed to smoke inside. When I took a shower the shower curtain was completely molded and the towels had huge stains on them. Everything was very dirty. I arrived past the cancellation time or I would've tried to find something nicer in the area.

Text: Not a good place! Stains on sheets, dirty floors, phone in room not working, front desk person was very rude. Breakfast was a joke. Cold eggs and no bacon or sausage. No milk to drink. Do not stay here!
