Tierra Linda

Text: It's taken me a while to write this, mostly due to the fact that I wanted to leave emotion out of it.

We selected Tierra Linda because of the recommendation of two friends that had stayed there previously. We were excited to be able to go on a little vacation and bring along our pup.

The Pros:
* The property is very scenic, and secluded. The area is quite private.
* The private pond is nice, with plenty of fish, with fresh water. There are canoes available for use
* The dogs have their own, large fenced in area where they can run, and play, and explore. 
* Armando and his dogs are very friendly!
* There are two hammocks set-up; they are very comfortable to sleep in.
* Amando takes very good care of the dogs; he barbeques chicken for them every night.

Cons:  
* When I called to make a reservation, Armando told me he would be living in a separate house - he did not. He stayed in the room across from us.
* There was no dining room for us to use, so we ate our meals outside at the picnic table (with all the bugs). He did mention that we can eat in the living room. (No table to use as a dining table.) The dining room was converted into an office.
* The bathroom
* The room we stayed in was very hot; the air conditioning did not seem to work well. There was a fan available for us to use.
* Overnight (around 1230am), when our dog whined by the scratched up door, Armando came out of his room and started speaking very loudly through the door that we better make sure our dog doesn't scratch the door. Armando's loud conversation through the door woke my husband, and my in-laws who were staying in the 2nd room, down the hall.
* The bathroom in the 2nd bedroom was tiny. The bathtub handle leaks, and thus I wasn't able to take a normal shower.
* The sand area, is not very beach-y. The sand is dirty, in a small heap. The "beach area" by the pond is quote small. When we asked if he has boats, he didn't mention that the only "boats" are little kayaks.
* The kitchen is not very well organized, and is quite dirty. 

The Meh:
* When I was booking out stay, Armondo mentioned that he does not cook breakfast anymore. However, he put out the coffee maker, and left us a coffee cake for breakfast.

Text: My wife and I wanted to visit Galena but wanted to take our dog with us. (Part of the family you know) Found the B and B Tierra Linda on the Internet and booked the El Sol room. Tierra Linda is outside Galena but it might as well be in another country as its lush trees, beautiful flowers and natural ponds make it a scenic wonder. Armando was a gracious and attentive host and cooked us dinner every night over a fire pit. He was very accommodating to Jimmy who can be somewhat "needy". Jimmy enjoyed the freedom of walking around the trails without a leash and interacting with Armando's dogs. And /armando even cooked him chicken every night. It's a short drive into Galena to take in all that city has to offer and then you can come back to peace and quiet. A truly wonderful time.

Text: Our stay at Tierra Linda was magical.  We spent two days with Armando and 'da puppies'.

Our dogs had a fabulous time, roaming the woods and playing with Nico and Michi, the Airedale pups.
We got a much needed rest and a chance to enjoy nature.

The farmhouse is rustic and simple. Our room was immaculate and the bed very comfortable.
Armando is a gracious, entertaining host and a very kind man.

This is not a slick B and B.  It is an experience and a chance to connect with nature.
Recommend it highly.

Text: This place is a dream come true for dog lovers and people who like nature. It is not the Ritz Carlton. The whole appeal is that you're out in the middle of nowhere, and you and your dogs can enjoy the outdoors. Armando has a huge property, and you can't see any buildings or other properties when you're there. There's a pond, wooded areas, and grassy areas. He has a fire pit and you can sit out there at night by the fire and look at the stars. The house is cute. It's an old house, and again, it's in the middle of the woods, so there are going to be bugs! They're ladybugs, they're not like killer spiders. If you can't handle ladybugs, this is not the place for you. Armando makes a great breakfast, and whatever you don't finish goes to the dogs! The dogs get chicken soup and beef ribs. Bring your camera. Your dog's eyes are going to be bugging out of his head. Armando knows dogs. He is a dog person,, through and through. The one thing he asks is that you give him a call before you get to Tierra Linda so that he can put his puppies away. Then, he can slowly introduce his puppies to your puppies so that there's less of a chance of a confrontation. If you DON'T do that, then you have nobody to blame but yourself if the dogs butt heads. His dogs are so sweet. They're not mean at all, but they ARE dogs. Armando is great to talk to. He's a really interesting person and he's a good storyteller. All in all, we had a great time at Tierra Linda. We loved the natural beauty, and our dog has never been happier!
