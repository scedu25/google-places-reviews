Campland RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We were traveling from Bryce Canyon back to Kansas. I called every place from West of Denver, through Denver, and East of Denver. I called and spoke to Lisa and she was very accommodating with openings at her pull through RV park. Very easy access right off the interstate,  great price. Not much around the area, but then again we just stopped to be able to sleep. Thanks!

Text: Just what we were looking for a quick overnight spot with full hookups and great wifi. Lisa was so nice to come out in the rain to meet us and make sure we were set up. We will be back!

Text: Full hook ups for $25.  Not a bad deal.  No facilities of any kind.  Supposed to have wi-fi but couldn't ever get in touch with "Lisa" to get details and password.   Disappointing because it was a great signal.  Just couldn't get password. It's NOT permanently closed as Google states.

Text: Great place to pull off the highway and spend the night.  Full hookups and easy to find.  Worth the $25.
