Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Galena, IL

Text: Very clean, spacious rooms with above average amenities. Pool area is amazing! Staff very friendly, and helpful. Minus one star for the disappointing breakfast (breakfast is why I usually try to stay at Country Inn & Suites). Expanded breakfast was anything but expanded. Only eggs out had green and red peppers and other vegetables in them. All I wanted was scrambled eggs. Not as much variety as I'm used to fro Country Inn & Suites. Lady attending during breakfast was a bit rude also. Everything else was an absolute delight. Would recommend to anyone

Text: Visited Galena Country Inn & Suites. We love the pool with the slide and the breakfast that's included. The free cookies at desk are a nice touch. I will say that I think they use too much chlorine in the pool. Smells strongly of it, and it actually burned my face just a little. I looked like I had a sunburn for a couple hours after swimming. But still love the pool!

Text: Really couldn't have been happier with my stay here. This was a great hotel just minutes down the street from downtown Galena. The hotel itself was very clean and quiet, with a friendly staff, delicious breakfast, and great pool area. With it's water slide inside the hotel and a Culver's and mini golf right next door, it's a great place for kids.

Text: This is my first time at a Country Inn and Suites.  My room was clean with a lot of space. The staff was friendly and the morning breakfast was very good. It was hot and there was a large variety of different foods.
