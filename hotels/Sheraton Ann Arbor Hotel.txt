Text: We booked a block of rooms through this hotel for our wedding, but had a terrible experience. Our guests were incorrectly told our block was full, the hotel did not add additional rooms to our block when it filled (which was in our contract), we had a horribly difficult time contacting someone when we had an issue, out guests were told check-in was at 3, but they were unable to check-in until 4-5, one of our guests were given the wrong style of room, and one of our guests found old food in their refrigerator. For the price of this hotel, I would HIGHLY advise you look elsewhere.

Text: Superb staff and excellent customer care

This is my favorite hotel in Ann Arbor. The rooms are nice, clean and comfy. Ray, Homer and Mary are very friendly and helpful to all guests. They always warmly welcome me by name and just make you (me) feel like a valued guest. I have the highest appreciation for their excellent hospitality and outstanding customer care. You can feel that they care about the guests, all of them. The staff will go above and beyond their duties to make sure every guest is overly satisfied. The room are very well equipped and comfortable. I could going on with how pleasing this hotel is but suffice to say that I highly recommend that you stay here if you are in Ann Arbor

Text: Was at the Sheraton for a full day meeting. Meeting space was perfect. And allowed for privacy of the group. Food was great. Everything from breakfast, snack and lunch was provided.
