Text: The aesthetics are gorgeous. Great breakfast and excellent pool and fitness center. Rooms are small, but with very modern amenities. Overall, an enjoyable stay for my family of four.

Text: Stayed here two nights. The hotel is clean and looks to be newly renovated. Staff was very friendly. The rooms are nice but there doesn't seem to be any sound/noise insulation at all. We could here through the walls completely. Our room was also directly off the elevator so we heard everyone come and go all night long. In the morning we heard the maids and people getting ice from the ice machine.. the hotel looks nice but remodel appears to have been done cheaply. The shower barely dribbled water out even though it looked brand new. Even with these complaints, it was a reasonable price and clean hotel. Had our room been in a different position it wouldn't have been as bad. We did not ask to move because they were full land we had already unpacked.

Text: Our room was very nice. It looked very modern and was pleasing to the eyes. Service was good, our rooms got messed up but we were given a free night for when we want to stay again. I would recommend staying here. It was a little pricey but definitely worth it.
