Hazlet Cottages on Carlyle Lake
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed here memorial day weekend, had a great time.  We rented a single cottage.  Large area near boat slip, parked right outside our cabin.  Kitchenette was nice to have for food preparation, along with the grill and picnic table. Cabin was clean and comfortable. Very quiet at night.  Great fishing right out back door.
