Text: I booked my bachelorette party a few months in advance and ended up having cancel since everyone wanted to go to a different city for the weekend.  Apparently her policy requires 2 weeks advanced notice for cancellation but there was an error on the website that said only 5 days in advance were required.  She was nicel and ended up giving me a refund back since there was an error on the website.

Since I went and picked up my refund in person I was able to see the location and it looked very nice.  I didn't get to stay there, but I would definitely recommend it for someone else.
