Super 8 Sioux City South

Text: Descent hotel at a descent price. Nice big room and comfortable bed. Bathroom was nice with very good water pressure. Breakfast was kind of weak for me because it had almost zero protein. Hard boiled eggs were the only thing I could eat. Coffee was pretty good though.

Text: Great experience for us. Clean, large room; clean, adequate bathroom and shower, lots of choices for bkf and gr8 coffee. Receptionist Terri is the best! She worked with staff so we could do early check-in,change and meet family from Phoenix at noon before nephew's wedding.

Text: Great Hotel!!! Friendly staff  The AC was not working properly when we arrived. The manager came quickly and replaced it with a new one. We were very comfortable both nights. I would stay again
