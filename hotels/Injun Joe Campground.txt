Text: Although people's raving reviews led us to this place, we were greatly disappointed.  It was excessively crowded, and the individual camp sites were extremely messy and unappealing.  The amenities were run down.  We were afraid to use the mini golf, batting cages, etc.  We were so disappointed, we left.

Text: Very outdated. Electric rates are stupid high. I guess that is where they make there money. Close to highway so it would work for a nights stop. Anything beyond that you will regret.

Text: Very rundown I love the pool but the amount of space you get is small and not big enough for a lot of people

Text: Worst camping experience. Everything run down. Needs many updates especially for the prices charged.
