Text: Great location, clean, and the staff was very friendly and courteous.  We were using a military rate and was very pleasantly surprised to find a nice hand written note in our room , thanking my husnand for his service.  Little things mean a lot!

Text: It was clean however they could improve on the breakfast. Coffee is weak and the shower curtain had a sour smell. For the price it was good.

Text: Curious why some la quinta have queen beds while others have doubles?  Staff was very nice, towels super soft.  Tub didn't have a working stopper so our daughter could have a bath.  Great for families with pets!

Text: Very quiet, comfortable, and most importantly very clean. We brought our cats and had no problems. There were plenty of options at the free continental breakfast.
