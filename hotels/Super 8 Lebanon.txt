Text: The staff was friendly and rooms were clean. It was a nice place to get some rest. Only 2 things I could complain about I guess, is no microwave in room and not a large choice of food for the breakfast. I still have 5 stars because price was really good (cheap) and I know I would have been paying a lot more for those amenities at hotel with them.

Text: Shower head was broken. We had to remove it to take a shower.   Tub drained sooo slow. Front desk  over night lady was rude and mean.  Rooms are so small. One positive is that the guy that checked us in was really nice.

Text: Great price for an overnight stay. I actually really like this place and we have been staying here on our way to GenCon for years. :) Great location too!

Text: Open paper clip,a hair rubber band and popcorn on the floor invited us into our "suite". Then nice to notice pee on the floor and pubic hair in front of the stool. Turn down the bed. Drool on pillow. Wait, also no pillow cases on the pillows. Disgusting. Barely slept.
