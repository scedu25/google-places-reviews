Text: LOVED our resent stay at this Best Western - very clean, tidy, over the top helpful staff, terrific breakfast.  Great place to stay with family and friends. We will definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others

Text: Thee room was ok. The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is I wasn't sure if  the bath towels and extra blanket was laundered. I found hair in them -- which for me is like finding hair in my food. There were spiderwebs in the corners of the room - which I got a broom from the janitor closet and cleaned. I fear bugs if any kind... I also checked extensively and there were NO bed bugs!! ? The hot breakfast was nice, fresh fruit on the bar for vegetarians! Check in and out was smooth.

Text: The beds are hard and the pillows are flat. The toilets are not ADA complient. There are cheap barn doors for bathroom doors that only allows for  partial privacy when you are in the bathroom. If you don’t book using the best western web site. They are not willing to help compensate for your stay if you are not comfortable. The facility is clean and remodeled. They just missed the comfort part when they remodeled

Text: Newly updated, clean, large rooms. The bathrooms were nice, too. Breakfast was eggs, sausage and the usual waffles. I love the usual waffles, so yay! Great service. Will go back.

Text: Hotel design is very modern, with open staircases and sliding doors (to the bathroom) in the rooms. The rooms were well furnished and maintained, but with the design I had a difficult time there since I was traveling with a toddler. The breakfast was great, though and had plenty of options, which even changed out over the several mornings we were there. There was an Applebees in the lot and other restaurants and other things just down the road. Overall, I would stay here again but would prefer a lower floor (we were on the 4th).
