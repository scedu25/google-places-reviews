I-80 Lakeside Campground
Rating: 5
Text: I thought for a off the freeway type camping spot this place was great! We came down for the Eclipse and just needed somewhere convenient. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the owners were and how well kept the place was. The little pond was great for a swim and some kayaking...kept the kids entertained. And they even delivered your firewood for you. Also, we really appreciated that they didn't gouge us for the Eclipse...that says a lot to me!

Text: What a perfect campground for us! We were traveling to the Grand Tetons and stopped here for a quick overnight! They had a catch and release pond for fishing that each one of us caught a fish on! So fun! Sight was level and so affordable!  Camp store was reasonably priced and had all the things you hoped for in one. The owners were so sweet and nice and very accommodating! It was next to I 80 but we weren't bothered by any of the highway noise! Perfect place!

Text: The campgrounds are clean, the people friendly.  They have put in a new dog area, of course some people don't think that they have to pick up after their dog. If your up early enough, you will see a beautiful sun rise and at night sunsets that are awesome.

Text: Right off of I-80, this older park has seen it's better days. The park does have fishing on private 10 acre pond along with kayaking. The office is opened from until 9pm and the staff is very friendly. They did lead us to our site. It is big rig friendly and easy to maneuver. The roads and sites are dirt with some gravel. It rained while we were there and it did become muddy. My pad was unlevel side to side and front to back. There is also little space between sites and your picnic table is next to your neighbor's sewer hose. There is no dog park or walk. There is little shade, and you can easily hear the interstate when outside your RV. The bathrooms are very rundown, dark, and smell of mold. It is was alright for an overnight stay, but not someplace I would stay for more than a night. We camped at Lakeside Camping in a Fifth Wheel.

Text: Had an amazing time. Very clean and quiet.  Brenda was so nice, very polite and helpful. Prices are great. We will absolutely stay again when we come back home next summer.   Told all my North Platte family it's a great place even if you only go for the day. Easy off and on to I80.  Don't let the Google Earth picture scare you away!! It is nothing like that. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Brenda and family for being so accommodating to our needs. See you next summer for sure!
