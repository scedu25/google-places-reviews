Roxalana Hills Apartments

Text: This is a great place to live! Nice, clean, quiet and safe! Everyone here is wonderful, from other residents, to the office staff, maintenance crew, housekeeping. Any concerns I've had, maintenance issues or otherwise, have been addressed timely. I can't say enough about the availability of activities and other things to do here...or, if you want to keep to yourself, nobody bothers you! You will however, get a smiling face and a "hello" should you encounter someone outside!

Text: My husband and I moved to Roxalana Hills Apartments right after we got married last year and I couldn't imagine a better first home for us! The apartment is so cute, we have the most beautiful view, the staff is so nice and helpful, and the amenities are wonderful. We especially love the pool and Tennis Court. I have the privilege of getting to teach the weekly Zumba classes and it is such a great way to meet other residents! We also love the monthly events for residents. Our favorite so far has been the painting class last winter! It is a great place to live!

Text: Moving to a new place where you know absolutely no one can be a scary thing. Moving here though completely calmed so many of those fears. Everyone in the office management is the sweetest and the maintenance guys are top notch! The free zumba class and the pool in the summer are my favorites. Best of all my fur babies are welcome here.
