Hampton Inn Ann Arbor-North
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed at this location to visit the University of Michigan and attend a football game. It's a great location, close to the school and shuttle bus to the game. The hotel has very friendly and helpful staff. The room was great and overall my stay was great. If you plan to see a Michigan game or are visiting Ann Arbor, this is a great location to stay at.

Text: Rooms were clean. Staff was nice. 

I think the building needs a bit of renovation. It's an old building. Air conditioning was quite loud in our room. 
Bulb was flickering in the washroom. 

Breakfast needs improvement!

Beds were comfy. 
There was ample parking available.

Text: Not quite up to standard Hampton I've seen. No bottled water and breakfast was not so good. Customer service was great though. Above average in that respect.

Text: Aaron at the Front desk was very friendly and helpful . The location is great next to a major highway . Beds were extremely comfy. This hotel deserve 5 stars. The only issue I had was I asked for a late check out and housekeep was knocking on my door 20 after 10. I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Other than that had a great stay and will return.
