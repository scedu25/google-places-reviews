Text: The over the phone was pleasant and fast. The location is extremely easy to find, the entryways, rooms, and hallways we're extremely clean with no funny smells. If I'm ever in the area I would look up to stay there again. Front desk staff was amazing especially Melissa who took my reservation, checked me in, and checked me out

Text: To much money for the stay. Rooms weren't very clean especially the bathroom. Beds were comfortable. Drapes didn't shut so sun shown in your eyes until it went down, and the indoor pool was really small.
