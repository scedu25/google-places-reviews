Text: Wonderful set up . Underground parking as well with additional lots north and south . When you need to stretch your legs , head out an east exit onto the patio, enjoy the beautiful river walk .

Text: The Grand River Center Event Coordinators are unbelievably helpful and professional.  They made our jobs so easy in securing, scheduling, and hosting our 2017 Iowa Rural Letter Carriers' Association Convention.  When we were overwhelmed, Sue and Tasha reassured us that everything would go well...and it did!  We received countless compliments on the facilities, food, and weather--we're quite sure Sue and Tasha made that happen too!  Thank you Grand River Center Staff.  We could not be more pleased.
