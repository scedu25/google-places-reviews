Text: This hotel smelled like strong cigarette smoke. The hallway was very dark and scary. The beds were comfortable but the smoky smell was just too much.

Text: Decent hotel. Rate was a little high but given there was an Eclipse going on it's understandable. They really need some vending machines

Text: My friend got two nights at this hotel for 140 bucks. We were busy that night so she checked in and went to go do our stuff. We came back checked out the room and there were roaches in the room, When we spoke to the guy at the counter, we politely spoke about the problems of the room and he just stared at us, obviously didnt understand very much english so we finally said we wanted a refund and he said 'no refunds'. I honestly think thats the only thing he knew in english.  and then i just got a call from my friend saying they got bit in the middle of the night so there was probably bed bugs as well... DO NOT BOOK AT THIS HOTEL!!! You will get your money taken and get bed bug bites instead plus you might bring some 'friends' home..
