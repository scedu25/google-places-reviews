Regency Inn & Conference Center

Text: Only reason I give a 2 is the woman at front desk was nice. Rooms stank hallways stank and air conditioner would only work on fan option. By far worse hotel I've stayed in.

Text: Great price, but I got what I paid for.  Check-in took much longer than other on-line reservations I have made.  Hallways and rooms look battered with gouges in walls, doors that do not close completely and have a larger than usual gap at the bottom, and plumbing repairs that look temporary, and there was no coffee pot in the room.  Electric outlets are either inaccessible unless furniture is moved or in unusual locations on the wall.  On the positive side, our room had a new HAVC unit, but the old unit had been left in the room.

Text: From what I found out this place used to be something in the past , but now its turned into a dump. New owners are slowly trying to bring it around. You will find some decent rooms, clean with fridge, a/c, cable, wifi, but you'll find all sorts of people here good and bad.

Text: I had booked my nonsmoking double room months in advance of the event I was attending, but when I got to the hotel, they couldn't find my reservation, even with my confirmation number and e-mail in hand. They then said they only had a smoking room, but it hadn't been used in months, so it should be fine. It was not. All of my clothes and luggage reek, even after I bought Febreze and used it liberally in the room. In addition, the level of dilapidation of the entire hotel was surprising, even for a cheap 1-star hotel.

Text: No hot water ever, remodeling place so a lot of things out of place, a/c unit drians into a bucket in the room, tv needs to scan channels to be able to watch everytime i turned it on. Never going back.
