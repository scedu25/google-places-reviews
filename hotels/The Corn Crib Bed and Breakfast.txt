Text: Fantastic little B&B. We were in the area for a wedding and this suited us very well as a location to stay for a couple nights. It is run by a wonderful couple and was very comfortable.

Text: We stayed at the Corn Crib the night before my daughter's wedding.  It was the perfect place to stay!  We were able to have the wedding party and some family hang out around the fire pit, and have a relaxing evening before the big day.  It also worked perfectly as our place to get the bride and her bridesmaids ready, the day of the wedding.  And the country setting was perfect for getting some pictures before the ceremony.  It was very clean and comfortable, and the refrigerator was stocked with food.  I had also booked a second night for the bride and groom to stay after the wedding, before they flew out for their honeymoon.  I'm hoping to go back sometime soon, just to relax in the country.

Text: We had a meeting there and it worked perfectly. It is so convenient, but private. I was impressed with how clean and comfortable it was. The combination of rustic ambiance and modern conveniences is very well thought out. I highly recommend this as a B & B!
