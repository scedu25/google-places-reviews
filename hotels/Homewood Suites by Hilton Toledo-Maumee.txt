Homewood Suites by Hilton Toledo-Maumee
Rating: 4
Text: Good hotel for families, having a separate bedroom helps for getting young kids to sleep. For being nearly full when we were there, it was very quiet. Good breakfast options, kids love the pool.

Text: All of the Staff from the front desk, preparing breakfast, and the cleaning staff were wonderful and super friendly.  Everyone always had a smile on their face and were happy to help in anyway they could.  The rooms were very clean and a nice size. When I travel I will always look to see if there is  a Homewood Suites in the area before I book anywhere else from now.

Text: Stayed for almost two weeks with a large group of coworkers. Patio was never cleaned or maintained until it was out of control, to the point of patrons tripping over garbage trying to use the grill area. That did not stop the housekeeping staff from noticing, they simply complained about it loudly while they enjoyed numerous cigarettes. Also if you like to do laundry while staying in a hotel, seek shelter elsewhere. The hotel "offers" coin operated washers and dryers but is not responsible for making change to people needing to use them. I was refused the use of the machines multiple times because they simply could not spare it. All in all, a better maintained and managed hotel awaits you elsewhere traveler.

Text: The location is great, near several stores and restaurants. The staff is very accommodating and the breakfast was much better than your typical hotel breakfast. The room is very nice as well.

Text: Great overnight stay. We arrived late at night but were still met with a smile from the front desk. Clean, spacious suite with some extra free treats included too. We'd definitely stay there again.
