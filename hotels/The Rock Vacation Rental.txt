Text: Amazing! Super clean! The cleanest place I have ever rented. Everything that you need is there. The owners have done a great job and we would return over and over. Truly just amazing! A must stay, hidden gem!

Text: The views are absolutely beautiful. Plenty of trails to explore. I loved the Rock formations and fire pit. The kids loved scooping tadpoles from the watering hole. The owners are really great people who made sure we had an enjoyable time. This is the perfect vacation rental for groups, large and small families and even couples who are looking for a quiet, secluded, weekend. We will definitely stay here again when we return to the area. Thank you!

Text: A beautiful scene atop a mountain. That in itself is priceless. Add in that it comfortably slept the 8 of us and were pleased -to say the least. You can tell the owners care about the place and that it is an extension of their values.  

Come with the mindset of leaving the comforts behind and you'll be certainly pleased like we were with the beauty of this venue and the nature that surrounds it.
 
On a side: We rented a cabin in a different Ohio mountain location last year. It had more local attractions, but paled in comparison to The Rock Vacation Home. Upon arrival, the kids instantly wanted us to buy the place!

Ps (we were hopefully good neighbors during our stay). 5 ? ? ??? star stay!

Text: My husband Rick and I had an absolutely wonderful time at The Rock. It was my birthday weekend and I couldn't have imagined spending it anywhere else. The cabin was so cozy it almost felt better than home! The furnishings were so quaint and the little personal touches I just loved, like opening the fridge & seeing a dozen farm fresh eggs as a gift from the owners to you, which were absolutely delicious! And the view from the porch! The website described it as "Gatlinburg-like" and coming from someone who's been to Gatlinburg TN many times, the view was 10 million times better than Gatlinburg! Completely secluded, no houses in sight, all you hear at night is crickets & the frogs in the pond. The other best part of our stay was meeting the owners, Doug & Susan. They were very warm & welcoming and chatting with them was like catching up with old friends! The Rock was an absolute dream come true & I highly recommend it to anyone who loves nature, hiking and more than anything, peace & quiet. If Google would've let me rate it with 10 stars, I'd rate it 11 stars!???????????
