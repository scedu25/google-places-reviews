Text: The room we stayed in was clean.  it had just simple stuff in it.  just coffee maker two queen size bed shampoo, conditioner ,2 bars soap towels  flat screen TV  . No micowave  no dresser to put clothes .and also had a small table and two chairs and that is it. For around 70 to 80 dollars so I guess it's okay place
