The Historic Wolf Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Was finally able to stop by the Underground. Amazing! Loved the experience! Small town charm all the way. Also attended a birthday party in the room upstairs. Chris has done a fantastic job of making the entire building worth every moment you spend there. Definitely recommend to anyone!

Text: The tour of the hotel was awesome. Seeing the underground tunnels and hearing the history was very interesting. The hotel had nice rooms and a great parlor and kitchen area. Spent some time in the saloon under the hotel which was fun to relive a part of history.

Text: This little B&B and event center is a hidden gem in Kansas. The hotel is decorated in period style with an incredibly cool saloon downstairs in the underground tunnels. You really must check this out and get a tour if you live in or are visiting Ellinwood.
