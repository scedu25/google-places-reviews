Text: Wonderful stay here. Room was clean and the staff here is exceptional.  Greeting us time we came to the lobby asking if there was anything they could do for us. Very good breakfast.  Good location! Will stay here again.

Text: Nice place. Even better since they allow my 86lb dog for a small fee. The employees were pleasant to converse with. They had a personality from the front desk to guy cleaning the carpets.

Text: Excellent service, very up to date rooms, kitchens and bathrooms and a great location close to the Coral Ridge Mall, the restaurants on the Coralville strip, and just off Route 6 and I-80.  Highly recommended.

Text: Had brunch here. Location was easy to find, food was great, and the seating area was comfortable. It wasn't very private though, which would have made it much more enjoyable for our group.

Text: The rooms were clean and had a full kitchen. Close to the hotel is beautiful way to go jogging. It troubled me that the AC was set to 65°F every second or third day. That's too cold for me...
