Text: Talked with front desk night staff, Jenny.
The sweetest, most lovely person ever to converse with!
It was around 5:30 am also, and she was chipper, friendly & very customer friendly which is admirable since it was still night out, she'd been up ALL night and offered me her kindest & friendliest customer service.
She should be promoted with a substantial pay raise!
Terrific, loyal staff to the corp deserve Good care cause they make all others want to Mirror their professionalism!

Text: The service at this hotel is awesome. The staff are helpful, engaging, and just pleasant in general. The rooms, as well are the rest of the hotel, were all clean and well kept. It was our safe haven in a strange town during our weekend in Louisville.

Text: The location was convenient. Was relatively quiet. The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable. The free breakfast was okay for being free/included in the price. The meeting room was comfortable for our needs as well.
