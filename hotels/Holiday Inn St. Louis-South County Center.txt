Text: Did not stay overnight, was here for several days of meetings. Ate in restaurant however for 2 dinners.  Happened to be slow nights, was very quiet and peaceful. Eating area is separated from bar by divider which helps.
Food was surprisingly good and reasonably priced.  Menu is not extensive, but the appetizers are great as are entrees to the price.  Could be a good place for just a date.  All staff were extremely friendly and  accommodating.

Text: Bridal preparation room was great & right next to reception area. 6 hanging areas for dresses & mirrors around. Private bathroom. Only recommendation would be to add a hanger hook in the bathroom as well for the more private girls. The staff were very helpful & accomodating.
