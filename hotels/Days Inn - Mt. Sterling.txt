Text: Quiet for the most part. Staff is friendly. Women (and men with long hair), bring your own towell because the ones provided aren't that big or absorbent. Don't 'save money' by getting a smoking room of you don't smoke, the price is almost the same and the smell isn't worth that little bit of money.

Text: Came for an overnight trip with my husband. I saw the hotel had over a 3 star review on trip advisor, so I thought it would be a fairly decent hotel. Boy was I wrong! It's dirty, run down, old and filled with questionable people. I would not bring kids here. We will not be back. Bed was comfy and appeared clean, but the furniture was dusty, the floor looked disgusting and the tiny bathroom cubicle was just plain filthy. And the room  had many iffy repairs done to it.

Text: I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews.  The room was ok.  When checking in we was told we had 10 mins to look at the room, and we could change our minds.  But it was a plain room but ok for a night stay.
