Motel 6 Cloverdale In - Greencastle
Rating: 5
Text: I was very pleased with the facility and the staff.  The building is obviously kept up with maintenance and cleaning.  Very basic motel and it met our very basic needs.  Our only "gripe" was the handicap accessibility, the sidewalk has a ramp up to the entrance, but no button to open the door to the building, our room was on the second floor, no elevator, and the shower had no grab handles, We were also minorly surprised that there was no breakfast offering of any sort.  Overall still very very pleased with our stay and I'd recommend it as a nice basic clean motel for anybody to stay.

Text: After a little hesitation, due to a couple of the reviews, I stayed the night. As soon as I got my key, I inspected my room thoroughly. Everything was clean and exactly as advertised! The man at the front desk was very helpful, great attitude, joking and laughing with me! I had a wonderful experience! The next time that I am passing through, I definitely plan to stay at Motel 6 again!
