Jadwin Canoe Rental
Rating: 5
Text: I have rented rafts, canoes, and kayaks several times in small and large groups over the last few summers and have always enjoyed the beauty of the river and the quality of the service. The staff are flexible and always do their best to accommodate your needs. I have never had any complaints about how they do their job.

I always go for the 8-mile Cedar Grove to Akers trip, where you see two springs with ice-cold water. This trip will roughly cost $25 per person, no matter what boat you get.

Text: We rented kayaks for a short trip from Cedar Grove to Akers. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the kayaks were great (particularly for spots that were shallow). I would highly recommend using Jadwin if you're going on the Current River.

Text: Had a really lovely experience here last weekend.  Shuttles were prompt, price is fair, and our canoe was a google quality.  Will be using as often as possible.  Thanks!
