Town House Inn Cape Girardeau
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms were very clean and recently remodeled. New TVs with cable with local channels. They gave us a great weekly rate, even paid the difference when I haggled about the taxes! The staff was super friendly, helpful and on guard for any suspicious activity. Only bad points was only having one ice machine and no snack machines. Definitely would stay again!

Text: I absolutely love the rates and service. I have been staying at this location over the course of 16 years. A lot has changed including management. I am grateful to see such pride taken in remodeling and serving. I left a device in my room and was able to pick it up a coupledays after checking out. Honest and Great.

Text: New owners. Higher rates. Place was updated but still an old property.  Owners trying to keep place free of crime. But.in doing so make avg guests feel watched.   Also owners have a whole section used for their apt and have all sorts of junk outside on the sidewalks. While telling guests not to be outside of their rooms.  New TVs and Direct T.V were nice items.

Text: Absolutely loved this place! by far the best customer service around town as far as hotels go. They are located very close to down town so I didn't have to travel far to get a bit to eat! Awesome jacuzzi room! 5 Stars!
