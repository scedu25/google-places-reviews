Text: Great hotel! Fresh baked cooked in the lobby. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. THE ACCESSIBLE room is just that! Form the lowered closet to the fold-down bath seat. I feel very at home?

Text: Went to check in at 4 pm, an hour after check in began and our room still wasn't ready. There were no cars in the parking lot and the only staff member was the desk attendant. After waiting twenty minutes we were finally let into our room only to discover that there wasn't an adequate number of linens for our third guest. When we called to the desk, the attendant told us we would have to come downstairs and pick up the sheets as he was the only employee in the hotel. Rooms were nice and pool was enjoyable but will not stay here again.
