Text: We we're attending a youth gathering at conference center next door but didn't have enough 2 queen size bed. Front desk service was very good. Good room. Really liked the shower. The shower head was a large square which looked funny but pressure was great and spread out the water.

Text: The front desk was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, the showers had great water pressure and plenty of heat. Breakfast was nice and provided the basic items most would want. I will stay here again

Text: This is a great place to stay. The front desk people are very nice & courteous. It always smells really good & is very clean when you enter the hallways. Very easy access to shopping & eating places.  I would refer this place to someone for a nice place to stay. I give this place 5 stars.

Text: Great place to stay the night. Awesome water pressure, remodeled bathroom, clean new sheets. It's a older hotel, but was clean. Only complaint was wore out towels, but not a big deal considering the price.
