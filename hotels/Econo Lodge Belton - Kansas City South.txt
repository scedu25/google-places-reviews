Text: I had a great time at this hotel. I was just meeting some friends there too hang out and have some social time. I love the space of the room and the fact that even though there were some people outside that were a little bit loud we could not hear them inside the room. I definitely will be going back again.

Text: To be fair I couldn't tell you about our night's stay, because after walking into the room we knew we didn't want to stay there. The comforter had a huge pink stain that looked like it wasn't even attempted to be cleaned. The floor hadn't been vacuumed and it reeked of smoke despite it being a non-smoking room. The front desk didn't seemed dazed at all when we asked for our refund, so I imagine this is a common occurrence. There were also a lot of interesting characters in and around the premises. My advice is to pay the extra money and go somewhere else
