Text: Strong friendly community. They have potluck dinners at the pavilion, fishing derby , raffles (that's how I won my kindle), they have a fireworks show that rivals the surrounding towns and the lake just a hop, skip and a jump away. All trailer parks have drama at one time. One just needs know when to stay out of the "drama". I've lived here 4 yrs and love it.
