Text: Had so much fun at the drive in! The staff was great! They offer food, had the bbq pork nachos when i went! They were delicious! They do have a bar as well, alcohol and non alcoholic beverages. I would recommend buying tickets online at eventbrite. If you arrive and they are over sold on tickets, then you can opt for the walk up spots. Overall, we had a great time!

Text: We saw Nightmare Before Christmas with the girls and had a great time. The sound system was surprisingly good and the experience was extremely positive. It isn't an IMAX or anything like that but if you're looking for a fun night out then it hits the spot. Also, bring bug spray!
