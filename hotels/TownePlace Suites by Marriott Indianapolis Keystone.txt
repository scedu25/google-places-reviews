TownePlace Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Keystone
Rating: 5
Text: Best place I have ever stayed!!! The best staff I have ever encountered. Clean and friendly location with tons of easy access to food and shopping. The rooms were beautiful and comfortable. I had two kids and our dog for most of our stay and there was never a problem with space or ideas from staff as to what I could do to fill the time. I would recommend staying here for any occasion.

Text: Towne Place Suites is located not far from 465 and is easily accessible. It is close to a lot of different stores and restaurants. Their room was clean and comfortable. Everything you need to be comfortable for one night or several. A bed, a pull out couch, desk, table, kitchenette, closet and storage with ironing and a nice bathroom. Complimentary full breakfast in the morning. A pool and small workout room. And complimentary tea and fruits 24 hours a day. And if you need anything a small convenience area with snacks and toiletries. I enjoyed my one night stay. We were very comfortable.

Text: Our stay at TownePlace Suites Keystone Indianapolis has been wonderful. The front desk staff has been fantastic, the rooms are clean and the location is great. There are lots of restaurants and places to shop nearby. The breakfast items, although good, they never change. If you're staying for longer than a few days you have to be creative with the breakfast to change things up. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends or family.
