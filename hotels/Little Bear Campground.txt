Little Bear Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Clean, green, spacious. Conveniently located off of I 80. Nice clean laundry and shower room. A little difficult to enter code to get into shower room. Full hookup. Reasonable price at around $32. Quiet. Next to truck fuel station but far away enough that noise not noticeable. Nice place to park and stay for a few days. Playground for the kids. I would definitely return and would highly recommend!

Text: Overall good. They were very accommodating in providing us with the same lot we had last year . We have a very large rig and will not work in a lot of lots. The manager was very brash and offensive at the pool in telling people they couldn't have beer at the pool. A well posted sign or rule hand out would have been helpful. A little diplomacy would have went a long way.

Text: Owner was super nice. Smaller campground but cabins were great and the place was clean and friendly.  Looks a bit odd before entering grounds.but on the whole it was great.
