Best Budget Inn

Text: As other reviews have stated, the lady in the office was both friendly and informative. You could tell she was proud of her town and was more than willing to share any information she had. It was a Great experience.

The room was clean and the bed comfortable (although some of the other furnishing could have been updated). Yes it's true the bathroom is tiny and also dated, but as another reviewer noted, the hotel sits on historic route 66 and its part of the requirements for its registry on the route. Again....clean and comfortable is the dominating traits and you can't beat that for an overnight stay.

I had my dog and he was welcomed without hesitation, and with the lake right across the road it was perfect for a good walk.  With a scenic and convenient location, this place has plenty to offer for the price. Add to that the friendly staff and you've got a perfect budget friendly accommodation you'll be happy with.
