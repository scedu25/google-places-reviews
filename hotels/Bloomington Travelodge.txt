Bloomington Travelodge
Rating: 4
Text: The room was great,  especially for the price.  We experienced great service. The lobby smelled weird would be the only my only complaint.
Rating: 4
Text: Excellent location with many restaurants close by. Staff was very pleasant and nice. The rooms were updated within the past 5 years probably; for the price it's not a bad deal. The breakfast could have been better, but it was adequate.

Text: Good shower/terrible pressure. Beautiful bathroom, little small but it works if it's only one person. Nice big king size bed but not as comfy as it looks, wifi included+complimentary breakfast. Not bad for a one or two night stay, and fairly cheap for basic necessities. Includes a coffee pot and coffee w/cups and cream and sugar ????

Text: Ok, this is not a 4 star hotel.  But with consideration that it's Travelodge, it more than met expectations. Clean. Great bed.  Bathroom remodeled.  Nice staff.
