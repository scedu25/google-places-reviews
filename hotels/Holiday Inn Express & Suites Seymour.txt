Text: The room was very clean and nice. There was an electric fireplace in the room which was a nice touch. Very quiet location despite being beside the interstate and we never heard the neighbors. The only downside was despite having the privacy please sign IN THE CARD SLOT, housekeeping tried to come in twice. Once at 9 am and once again at around 11:15.

Text: Overall great service! I booked the hotel a week+  in advance. I changed the date of my stay over the phone to one day earlier with travel plan changes a couple days before the stay. Upon check in I found out about a reservation mistake showing a two day stay instead of just one. I had to wait until morning to clear it up with the manager Joe but they fixed the mistake. Wonderful breakfast in the morning. Very polite staff. Would definitely stay here again but may double check the reservation ?.

Text: I stayed here on business the room was found to be clean bed comfortable nice pillows. The breakfast had many selections and the staff was quite friendly. My only complaint is to you the public who slam doors when you're staying in the hotel you don't realize how disruptive it is I was blown away by how hard people slam doors in a hotel room first experience ever to have that happen the entire time I stayed other than that the facility was fantastic
