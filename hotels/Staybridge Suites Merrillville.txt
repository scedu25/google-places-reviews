Text: Great hotel peroid. First the staff great. Key reader was not working and they brought me up into the room then came back later with keys that worked. Rooms were awesome. Full kitchen and spacious. Had happy hour which was 2 with pizza and beer. I will definitely be back here

Text: I've stayed here a few times now and I personally haven't had any problems like I'm seeing in some of the other reviews. They have a pool, free breakfast which you don't see alot in hotels with kitchenettes, a gym, a pantry, many places to eat and shop including the mall nearby, there's also a theater nearby. The staff are usually friendly and polite. The rooms are always clean when I come here. Over all happy with my stays.
