Hampton Inn Louisville-Airport
Rating: 3
Text: Just meet colleagues for breakfast in the morning. Not much variety but pretty good quality breakfast choices. Clean dining area and decent coffee. Nothing wrong with this place but nothing special about it.

Text: Got two connecting rooms which were nice,  spacious, comfortable and clean! The facilities were nice and clean. The staff were friendly and the hot breakfast they had  was definitely a plus! Would definitely stay here when we visit Louisville again.

Text: Nicer hotel. The beds are very comfortable and rooms are cool and well decorated. Toiletries and linens are high quality. Breakfast is extensive, filling, and solid quality. Pool is outdoor and a little small. Airport shuttle is convenient

Text: Good location. Easy in and out, access to several expressways. Room is a bit smaller but sufficient, and we'll maintained. Nice pool. Breakfast is typical for a Hampton and convenient for a quick start to the day.
