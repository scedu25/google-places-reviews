Hampton Inn St. Louis/Sunset Hills

Text: Stayed here 7/28-7/31 and it was fine, but that's about all I can say. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, but the hotel is dated and ***under construction***. Not sure what renovations are being done; there were signs up saying the work had been stopped due to fire code issues. The pool was open while we were there, but if you have kids, you have to go back to your room to use the bathroom b/c the downstairs one is out of service. One of the elevators seemed to be out of service. Only the 1st floor ice machine was working. The carpet was very dirty and dingy everywhere, but as I said, the hotel seems dated. The breakfast left a lot to be desired, but was serviceable.

Text: This Hampton has a friendly staff and clean, pleasent rooms. Pretty good complimentary breakfast as well. Only downside was that the free WiFi did not allow me to stream videos or music.

Text: I stayed here with a friend of mine. We asked for two queen bed. When we got to our room it was one king bed. We were to tired to go back to the desk and ask for a different room. Other than that the room was great the bed was cozy and the staff was nice.
