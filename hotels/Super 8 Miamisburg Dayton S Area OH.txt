Text: I stay here about a week ago. My stay was amazing. The location was perfect as well. It is  on the main street but there is no thru traffic and since i am a light sleeper that is great for me because not a lot of traffic noise. The room I was in was very nice. the beds were very comfy. The staff are super nice and very sweet here. I will for sure stay here again.

Text: Room was not clean, tub was not cleaned, there was dirt on the floor in the bathroom. The beds and room smelled like an ashtray, the towels smelled disgusting like they had been left from a previous guests stay that smoked like a chimney. Wyndham needs to do better with these privately owned hotels. I do not recommend!
