Relax Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Luxurious! Super clean and tastefully decorated, these rooms are large and include everything a traveler needs: fridge, microwave, coffee pot, HBO, iron & board, hairdryer, high quality toiletries, plenty of hot water, and a most comfortable bed. The sheets are fine and soft, the towels thick cotton. The pet-friendly room was my cat's favorite on our journey from Oregon to Florida. The beds are on platforms so he couldn't hide beyond my reach.  The room was quiet and the view was serene.  Free continental breakfast includes sausage, eggs, biscuits, gravy, cereal, yogurt, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, coffee and juice, etc.  Fantastic value.
