La Quinta Inn & Suites Ft. Wayne
Rating: 4
Text: Staff is very helpful and friendly. The rooms are large and we'll maintained, no blood or unexpected stains on sheets. The bed is firmer than I'd like but I prefer a pillow top. The pool is not as heated as I'd like but that's a minor thing. Their breakfast is a great variety, many fresh options, the eggs are definitely not real but you can't expect them to have a fry cook in the back. Laundry is accessible but you have to be quick about getting in there. It's in a plaza with plenty of food options and things like nail salons and a gas station. They are very dog friendly! Bring your babies with you! Overall it's been a great extended stay (about two weeks) and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a stress free stay in a CLEAN place!

Text: Friendly staff, well maintained property, clean rooms. There are multiple restaurants within walking distance, along with a gas station. We have had some poor experiences at other LaQuinta properties during that past year, but this one restored our expectations. Recommended

Text: Clean rooms, great breakfast, really nice lobby! The front desk girls were outstanding and the entire place was extremely accommodating considering the short notice we had to find a place! Fantastic location as well. Pizza and Starbucks within walking distance!!!

Text: Having stayed with La Quinta multiple times across the country, we opted for this hotel for our overnight stay in Fort Wayne. We arrived quite late, but was still welcomed with great service. The bed was comfortable and the room wasn't too cold. We were able to take advantage of the breakfast the next morning, enjoying sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy, and a waffle. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of dogs staying at the hotel.
