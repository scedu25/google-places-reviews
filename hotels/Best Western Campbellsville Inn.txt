Text: 1st room that I was given...had people in it. Took way to long to check in. No Bible in the room. Receptionist didn't know the area any better than I do.... I really know it better. :(

Text: I needed a place to stay while moving things around in town.  My normal accommodations were under renovations.  I chose Best Western because it is the cleanest hotel in Campbellsville and has a nice outdoor pool with a gazebo that has a grill.  While I did not eat the complimentary breakfast except once; it was good, tasty, and filling.  My room was quite spacious, perfect for me to stretch my bones out after a long day.  The A/C kept up with the hot-humid southern Kentucky climate. I slept perfect in the King bed with the blackout curtains drawn.  I prefer non-smoking rooms and my room was absent of smoke smell though some rooms are smoking.  This hotel is undergoing nice updates over the past few months.  Nothing is ever in the way and they place is tidy.  It is a quick drive to the few various places for food around town.

Text: We have stayed here twice so far helping get our child settled into college. The staff was very polite and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the pool/spa area was nice. Breakfast had a good variety of food that was fresh and hot . We will be staying here again when we visit our college student.
