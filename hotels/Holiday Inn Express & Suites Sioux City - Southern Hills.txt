Holiday Inn Express & Suites Sioux City - Southern Hills
Rating: 5
Text: The front desk was able to track down a room that had no pets stay in it - a necessity for my family's health. The facility was clean, staff was helpful and kind. Anything we asked for was provided. We've stayed a few times and will definitely be back! 
Edit: We've been back twice and once again, they were more than accommodating! I look forward to spending more time there this holiday season.

Text: Had plenty of rooms available at the last minute, but charged ?more for them than the competition. Staff was nice and helpful. There's an indoor pool and hot tub, fitness center, and laundry room available. The breakfast bar was alright. This place definitely had the most comfortable beds out of anywhere we stayed on our road trip. The water pressure in the shower could have been better though.
