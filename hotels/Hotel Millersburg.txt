Hotel Millersburg

Text: We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Millersburg!  This hotel is charming and beautiful.  They have preserved the period decorating and added modern conveniences.  Leslie and her staff went out of their way to insure we had all we needed for a good time.  We enjoyed dinner and breakfast in the dining room.  They were equally delicious.  Portions were large and the meals came out fast!  We can’t wait to visit again.

Text: Visited the restaurant. I hadn't been there in a few years and was very sad to experience pathetic service and food. The waitress could care less, never checked on us, to the point we made it a game to see if she would even acknowledge us. The food was nothing short of something you'd get in a low budget cafeteria. I asked for a cheeseburger....they forgot the cheese. Waitress placed the plate in front of me and shrugged when I said the cheese was missing. She never came back except to bring the bill. I'll no longer recommend the restaurant. I can't speak for the hotel. Hopefully they run it with a little more warmth.

Text: Place was nicer than I thought for an older hotel, until we got to our room. It was very small just like the tv, they need to get new mattresses.  Some things are cool being old but not the mattress!  Check out the Millersburg Brewery  across the street it was definitely worth the trip. Gina was awesome wish I had this place closer to home.

Text: Went to the hotel to celebrate my wife and I's anniversary. It was a wonderful experience! We loved the decor, and the history behind the entire place. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. It was a great get away for a quick weekend away from the city.
