Super 8 Sweet Springs
Rating: 5
Text: Friendly staff, clean in all regards, and beds are comfortable. Internet and computer available, and a satisfactory continental breakfast is provided. Diner, Casey's, and Break Time right next door. Easy access from and to highway. Sweet Springs has pretty much what you might need and is a minute away.
Very comfortable and pleasant stay. Would/will certainly stay here again.

Text: Great price, nice clean rooms. Looks like it has been remodeled, new carpet and fresh paint. Quiet and secure.  Down side, flat screen tv very small and continental breakfast pretty slim.

Text: I would not recommend this hotel. The room was very dirty. There were ants everywhere. I had to sweep them off my bed while i slept. The room also smelled. The tv was very small and on a very low dresser. It was difficult to watch tv while laying down. There was no coffee maker in the room. I would recommend  driving a few miles down the road to find a better place to stay.
