Text: The Highland is a landmark. Big room; pool table; good pub grub.

The atmosphere has changed little in the near 40 years that I have been coming here. The same tacos that I fell in love with as a kid are still being served. This place is a must stop whenever in at the lake.

Text: Went for the fish fry. I think they were short staffed but our server tried his best to keep up. Lots of people, good drink and beer selection, food was great.

Text: Called for a to go order and was refused, but if I came in and had a drink, good to go. I don't want a drink, I don't drink. Never heard of a business refusing service but you won't see this local in there again.
