Motel 6 Kearney
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean and price was right.  Bed was comfortable for me.  Wifi worked good and they gave me a room not far from exit.  I travel with two dogs and like to be close to an exit if possible.  Room was quiet as it is off of the main highway.  Very easy to get back on I80.  Lots of food joints close by.  Casey's gas station across street had very good breakfast pizza.  Will be staying here again on my way back home.

Text: It was nice, and I would absolutely stay again. I will say that I don't mind budget hotels, which this definitely was. Other people may feel differently. The beds and pillows weren't great, and the rooms were a bit small. But the rooms were clean and well taken care of, the staff was friendly, and we had a nice stay. The rate we paid was very affordable, and we got a good value for our money.

Text: The hotel was nice to stay at. My favorite part of the stay was the area. The motel is placed right behind a few restaurants of good quality. The best part is that a short walk towards the main road and you come upon the city walking paths that go along the river. Lovely place to relax and have a good walk after a big dinner. Definitely recommend.

Text: It’s very clean, which is my biggest point. It’s renovated, water comes at a decent pressure, the price is good. Also - it’s clean. 

I took the star off because our shower has some unfinished parts, nothing big.

Text: I love this place. Perfect half way point between Idaho and Michigan. My 2 dogs and I always get the same area of rooms....clean, quiet and easily accessible. Staff is great. Heading back there next Sat.
