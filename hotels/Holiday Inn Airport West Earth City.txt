Text: No tooth brushes - ran out. I was given mouth wash and tooth paste, Nice room, we used airport shuffle- on time / sign up for shuttle the night before. One Elevator was out of order. Nice coffee in the morning- no free breakfast at hotel.

Text: Awesome place to stay at and a super nice staff. Tonya, Jack, Ray, Jill and just about everyone else are really great people that work at the Holiday Inn in Earth City, Missouri. Never had a room that the door hit the toliet. Always clean.

Text: I stayed in the Holiday in Earth City last week.  I accidentally left my hang up bag in the closet.  I called 3 times to find out if it had been found.  They did not find it and seemed less than concerned.  Either the hotel staff  didn't clean the room real well (missing a large hang up bag) or they cleaned the room and kept the contents that are accidentally left behind.  Either way, this hotel appears to have a staff issue.

Text: Terrible customer service. Rude front desk staff, especially Tanya. Door hit toilet in bathroom making it next to impossible to use. Rooms are poorly ventilated and stuffy. They lied about the availability of shuttle service. Everyone in our party agreed that breakfast was gross. Don't stay here. There are many nicer hotels in the area.

Text: We were very pleasantly surprised with both the excellent service we received (thank you, Jill!) from the front desk and the cleanliness/quality of the room. Very comfortable and well provisioned. It all made for a very good experience. We stayed post-concert.
