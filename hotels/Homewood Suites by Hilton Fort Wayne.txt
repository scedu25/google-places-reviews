Text: The staff, and the rooms are fantastic. Everything you need is close by. Social hours are 4 days a week. Some of the breakfast items are prepared ahead of time for those who work early. Highly recommended!

Text: The stay at the hotel was very nice overall. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only complaint I have was with breakfast. The food was below par. To go along with that, there were no napkins, silverware, or plates out for us to use. We had to ask and wait while someone brought some out for us. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay

Text: The rooms are nice, the kitchen isn't as big as the residence Inn, but the whole atmosphere is worth it.
