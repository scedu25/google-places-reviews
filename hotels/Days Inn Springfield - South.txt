Text: Rooms were dusty. Lamp shades were dirty and stained. The floor behind the bathroom door was dirty. Breakfast was good though.

Text: The AC at this Days Inn is great! You can get the room as cold as you like and it doesn't have an auto shutoff. The wifi was pretty good, the hotel was mostly full and we had good speeds. We streamed a movie on our laptop (the TV let's you use the HDMI port) and only had it stutter twice. The breakfast is decent, they had a waffle machine and biscuits and gravy. Plenty of food options within walking distance as well. The rooms feel a little old but they were clean and we had no problems while staying there. For the price this place is great! I'd stay again!

Text: Beds were comfy and the staff was okay too it's just there was a few roaches here and there (i only saw two) and the pool was unusually green but i could see the bottom  (it was warm and it helped relaxed my feet from walking in heels all day) i also thought i felt things crawling on me when i was trying to sleep but nothing bit me or any thankfully. Wish they served dinner and lunch though. :'(

Text: This place was horrendous. There was blood on my pillow and the sheets were black with dirt. Took 45 minutes to check in because the lady at the counter was in her late 80s and didn't know how to work the computer. Disgusting facilites. It smelled like wet dog everywhere. I hated staying at this place and I never will again.
