Text: This hotel is great for people that are looking for a solid value for the price. It was recommended to us by family that had stayed here. The walk to the beautiful downtown area is super short. The free wifi got used daily. The free breakfast was great, with lots of options. The beds are very comfortable and the staff is quite helpful. We traded out some pillows one time so we could get ones that were a little less puffy. This summer we stayed twice, once on a visit and the next time to care for a sick relative. When more family arrived, they also stayed here and were very happy. We couldn't have been more pleased with the support and kindness we were afforded. We have recommended--and will continue to recommend--Fort Scott Inn. We will definitely stay again.

Text: An ok dc Inn That's been renovated. Waited until we got there to say there was a pet fee, instead of at the time of booking. It's an emotional support animal, not just a pet. I did get the fee waived.

Text: Good value for the price charged.  Clean, modern rooms, showing some age, but in the process of modernizing.  Would stay there again.
