Twin Lakes Senior Villas
Rating: 5
Text: I have lived at Twin Lakes Senior Villas since it opened in 2013. The apartments are very nice, plenty of storage plus a one car garage. It's in a quiet area less than a block from the local County Market grocery store and a CVS Pharmacy. Our Manager here is a very nice young lady who tries to come up with lots of activities for us oldsters to do. There is a community center that can be used for family get-togethers, watching tv, playing games with friends, crafting and an exercise room equipped with an exer-cycle, treadmill, rowing machine, etc. We are a friendly group of people who like to visit with our neighbors. There are one bedroom and two bedroom units, all quite roomy and with modern facilities, including washer/dryer. I have enjoyed living here and plan to continue living here a long time. No grass mowing or snow shoveling needed here, it's taken care of for you.
