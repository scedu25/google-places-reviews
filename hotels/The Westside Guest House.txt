Text: What a wonderful place. The owner met me there and showed me all around the house and gave me directions to the grocery store. It was a quiet neighborhood with large shade trees. The house was beautifully decorated complete with soft robes to use. Being able to have a complete kitchen to fix my supper and breakfast was a perfect, along with the Keurig to make coffee. I would recommend staying here to everyone.
