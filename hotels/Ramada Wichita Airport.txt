Text: Great stay!  The gentleman that was working the front desk was very friendly and efficient!  My room was clean and I slept amazing on their bed. I came in late from my flight and the shuttle picked me up with a smile and even went through a drive threw so I could get something to eat. The location is very convenient to travel to and from.

Text: The desk attendant didn't confirm any prices with us before charging my card. She asked if we wanted one bed or two, and when we said one, she said they only had rooms with two beds. The beds were only full size, so not large enough for us to both sleep in them and we had to sleep in separate beds. She didn't tell us what time check out was, or give us any information about the hotel amenities. It just felt like she didn't much care about customer service. The AC unit was leaking, but worked well enough and ran consistently without the off-and-on-again that some units have. The bed was comfortable. The grass around the hotel is full of stickers, so beware walking your pets or wearing flip flops in it. Decent enough for a last-minute one night stay, but I wouldn't want to stay there more than that.
