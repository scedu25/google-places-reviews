Text: I've lived here for a year and a half. Nothing has been fixed in my home the toilets broke and none of the outlets in the bathroom or kitchen work I have to run extension cords. The grass is tall this is no place for kids. There are people who dig in the dumpsters, I've found drugs just laying on the ground. There were roaches and I had to pay to get  rid of them myself management didn't  do anything. Horrible. Never live here.
