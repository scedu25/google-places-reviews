Text: There was a lot of good and a lot of bad about this place but the good out ways the bad by a lot. Pros: Huge beds and they're extremely comfortable. Big rooms. Standard amenities in the room, including TV and cable, coffee maker, mini fridge and a microwave. It has gym equipment. Free breakfast, decent spread of food. Cons: The gym is tiny. The bacon was cook too crispy. Very little flavor. No pool or hot tub. The shower is weird. There's a tiny lip so water doesn't go out, and it's easy to get in, but the shower curtain is easy to push out by accident, and when you pull it back in, it sticks to your leg because it's wet and cloth. But yeah, those cons are pretty minor. Overall I enjoy this facility!

Text: Just a cozy, quaint little hotel nestled in the middle of a cozy, quaint little town. Rooms are extremely nice and the overall hotel has been remodeled, recently, but has kept its charm. Staff is welcoming and very helpful. Book early as this hotel isn't built for high capacity, which is as atypical as it is refreshing. Only con would be the price. Slightly overpriced but not enough to dissuade future guests.

Text: I was hesitant to book this hotel. However I gave it a try and found it very clean and hygiene. The only thing I wanted to convey to the hotel management is provide boiled eggs in the breakfast. Rest everything is great.
