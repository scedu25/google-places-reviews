Text: Checked in late. Front door was locked which was because the front desk had stepped away from the desk, good security measure. Room was clean, lots of room I the one King room.

Text: Stayed here for a long weekend as a part of a wedding party. The bride and groom had reserved a block of rooms for guests, but everyone who called to book with the wedding discount was told the block was full. It was apparent that no one had actually set aside rooms for us, and they even gave us a higher rate than Expedia. We ended up booking anyway, and the stay was nice enough - spacious, clean rooms, free hot breakfast, comfy beds. Giving this hotel 3 stars though for poor customer service and logistics.

Text: Pretty satisfied with our stay here. We had a large group of people and they did a great job getting us all accommodated. Rooms were clean and toiletries in bathroom were all provided. Room service was quick. Overall, happy with our stay for the price.

Text: Good sized room. Clean, good internet, friendly staff. The breakfast buffet was pretty severely lacking, though, even for a hotel buffet.

Text: Nice hotel, with clean rooms. Decor is starting to look older but not run down. Overall, a good room at a good rate.
