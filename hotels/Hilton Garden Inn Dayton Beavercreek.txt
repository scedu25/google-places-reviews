Hilton Garden Inn Dayton Beavercreek
Rating: 5
Text: Nice, newer, spacious hotel with great staff. Breakfast is good (roughly $10, but free if you have Hilton gold status or better). Great location to shopping and eats as well as Wright State U. and the Air Force Base. My favorite hotel in the area!

Text: The hotel is nice. Restaurant, bar, fruit infused water and complimentary cookies in the lobby. The pool is small but there is also a hot tub. The room is a good size, clean, and comfortable with a king bed with an assistant mattress, a sleeper sofa and a desk to work at. Standard wifi is complimentary. Room has a mini fridge, microwave, and a kurig. However there was no safe in the room for valuables.
