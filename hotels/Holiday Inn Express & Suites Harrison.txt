Holiday Inn Express & Suites Harrison

Text: The location is a bit strange, the street not defined by a sign. The hotel is under construction, but while our room was complete the light in the entry way flickered and the door handle to the bathroom door was broken. They fixed the door promptly. That being said, the room was spatious, very clean, and comfortable. The service is great and very attentive.

Text: Great value. Reserved Suite with 2 queen, pullout couch for $129. Decent breakfast, clean rooms. Easy to get to off of highway.

Text: Mediocre Holliday Inn Express. The smell is a little off and the "good smells" seem a little strong like they are covering up some other smells. Some small details weren't considered: the hallway seemed a little warm and muggy, the TV wasn't centered on the back splash, a light bulb was flickering, the toilet paper holder is behind you and not secured so it falls off and rolls away from you. Nothing was really worthy to actually complain about. Staff was OK. This isn't meant to be a negative review, but to explain how it fell short of more stars.

Text: The rooms were very clean and the mattresses are very comfortable. Parking can be an issue especially if there is a high number of guests. I would stay here again.
