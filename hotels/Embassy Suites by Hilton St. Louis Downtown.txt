Text: Wonderful place to stay. Here for a work conference and stayed overnight as well. The rooms are clean and very nice. There is a small refrigerator and microwave in each room. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They will bend over backwards to help you in any way they can. I would highly recommend this hotel and would gladly stay here again.

Text: About what you expect from an Embassy Suites. A good place to stay when traveling for business. Pretty good breakfast spread, free alcohol for happy hour, and passably clean rooms. The only real problem I had was with the city of Saint Louis, which thought it was okay to have people rip up the road in the front of a hotel at 2:00 in the morning!

Text: Location pretty easy to find with close parking options. I parked in a open lot with an electronic prepay walk up machine. The cost was $1.00 per half hour. Hotel staff all seemed nice and friendly and the area I saw was nice and clean and looked upscale. I was only there for a career event so I didn't get to experience much else, however before I hit the road I did use the ladies room which was also nice and clean!
