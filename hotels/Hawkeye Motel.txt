Hawkeye Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Our company is working on a job in Washington. We have been staying at the Hawkeye motel on and off for a couple months now. Can't say enough about the great service. The owners are always checking to make sure we have everything we need. You don't find service like this very often. I highly recommend this motel. Rooms are clean, they have a nice picnic area out front, price is very good.  If in the area, don't pass this place up, it's definitely a nice place to stay.

Text: A nice motel, friendly staff. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is that I wasn't allowed to leave my dog in the room unless I was there also, despite the fact that I brought a kennel to keep her locked up. This meant that I had to bring her everywhere and she had to sit in the car every time I went to a restaurant or store. Other than this is was a pretty clean room, though I reccomend bringing your own pillows (the ones in the room are the size of a small throw pillow), and some air spray to combat the musty smell. Really the only reason I may not come back is the dog issue; I really would have been happier to leave my dog locked up in a safe place instead of having to run out to my car constantly to check on her.

Text: Clean and friendly. Has decent outdoor spaces as well. For being an older roadside motel, I was pleasantly surprised and would stay again if in the area.
