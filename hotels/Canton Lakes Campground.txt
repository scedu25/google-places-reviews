Canton Lakes Campground

Text: If you keep your site clean it's not too bad. You're very close to one another at each site but people usually stay on their own and don't tend to bother each other much. Some tent sites are unlevel but for the most part if you get here before dinner there are usually a few decent spots left. Bathrooms are cleaned daily now, big change from last year. Another big change is the lack of partying all night going on during weekends. It has been fairly quiet every time we have camped this year. It's been mostly pleasant!

Text: They need to do maintenance on the campground docks and allow for boat slips, so tax payers can enjoy the lake!  The worst is the lack of upkeep at the swimming area by just posting a few signs and not providing any guards.  We do not swim there, but it is always filled with people even though the facilities are not maintained and there are no lifeguards. I believe they need to either make repairs, hire some lifeguards or enforce it being closed by having security at least during the hot season!  As a family that bought a boat to use the lake and pay the fees we assumed the restrooms would be maintained and open by the loading dock.

Text: This place gets worse every year!  Do not bring your family here unless you want your kids waking on broken glass through out the campground.   Also the road through the campground has lots of traffic with people driving fast.   It's has white trash as it gets and the only reason we come here (which is once a year)is i have a dirt bike race close by and is the only place to camp.   I would rather camp in someone's corn field than this place.

Text: The bathrooms don't get cleaned like they should, they were supposed to level sites last year and didn't, and the host is just mean...
