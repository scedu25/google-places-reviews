Text: called the hotel directly to book a handicapped room with a walk in shower.  when I arrived they gave me a handicapped room with a tub that I couldn't use.  took a non handicapped room on the first floor so they put me right next to the laundry room. If that wasn't bad enough there was a dead roach in the bathroom. have stayed at lots of holiday inns, but this one is terrible. will not stsy there again.
