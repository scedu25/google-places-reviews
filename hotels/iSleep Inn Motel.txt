iSleep Inn Motel
Rating: 3
Text: If you're looking for a cheap motel, it doesn't get cheaper than the isleepinn. Not recommended for families with small children. Lots of colorful characters hang around the isleepinn. It would be nice if they had flat screen TVs and take a little more time when cleaning rooms.

Text: This is by far the most sketchy place I have stayed. I didn't sleep well thinking my car or room would be broken into. This might be a satisfactory place for adults to spend one night but I would not bring young kids here.

Text: I feel like my room may have been on an episode of forensic files. The African gif working there had the worst BO I may have smelled in my entire life.

Text: The front desk lady was very helpful when we arrived and the building was fairly clean. The room was a little dated but well taken care of which was the more important of the two aspects. No one bothered us, probably because we tried not to bother anyone else. Enjoyable stay for sure though.

Text: Even though the building is dated, it's kept clean and smells fresh. I'll take that over anything else. Great area. Friendly staff...I'll come back. For the restaurant, the food was good! friendly environment. Even though it was super busy, the food came fast.
