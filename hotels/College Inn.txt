Text: The room was really small, but it was mostly clean. The TV was Modern and had a decent cable selection. The bed was a bit stiff, but I slept well enough on it. The shower worked well, but one of my towels had sharpie drawings on it, lol. There isn't a breakfast or pool, but I don't count that against them, it's just a side note. The woman at the front desk was friendly. My only real complaint is that the traffic on the nearby road can be pretty loud. The reasonable price makes up for that though. There's a decent pizza place right across the street too.
