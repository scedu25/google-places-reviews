Text: Paid the manager Donna to move in # 44 on January 12, 2017.  Paid to have electric put in my name. Was given my keys and was told I could start moving in. On the following Monday I arrived home from work to find a handwritten note on my door saying she had decided to sell my unit and I had 2 DAYS TO BE OUT!!!! I am now fighting with her over my money and she shut the power off to our home that is in my name. I am now homeless!!! Please, please, don't rent from this awful woman!

Text: i hope a meteor hits this park. The park manager straight up stole from me.  siphoned my power, and claimed enough was broken when I left to give no refund on the security deposit.  also somehow kept the power in my name and I got billed for a month after I moved out.
