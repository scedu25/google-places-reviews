Holiday Inn Express Hocking Hills-Logan
Rating: 5
Text: The place is very clean and close to tons of fun in the Hocking Hills area. They have decided to take it to the next level with their complimentary breakfast. Scrambled eggs, vegetable omlett, pancakes, both turkey & pork sausage, biscuits & gravy, juices, milk, cereals, pastries & fruit. I can't remember having so many choices on the breakfast buffet. It's close to several good restaurants, the BBQ place within walking distance was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The employees  were  very  friendly  and helpful.  Our  room  was what you  would  expect  from  a  Holiday  Inn  Express.  The only complaint  I had was the  toilet  would not  quit  running  even after  the maintenance  man "fixed  " it. Although  you could not hear   it  if you shut  the  door. They  also  have  a very  nice free breakfast , much  better  than I  expected .
