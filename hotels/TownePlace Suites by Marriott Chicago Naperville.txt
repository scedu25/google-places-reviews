Text: Convenient location for our fall sprinkler work. It's close to the tollway and there are many resturaunt and shopping choices around. The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful. It's tidy with a really nice, modern lobby area with a couple of computers and lots of seating. I also like the hot breakfast which is refreshed frequently so everyone gets a tasty start to their day. The hot tub, pool and fitness room are a really nice finishing touch to our stay. I feel like I'm on vacation and definitely would stay again.

Modern kitchens with all stainless steel appliances. The studio suite has one nice flat screen and the bedroom suites has two. The full service breakfast is always clean and stocked every morning. The shower water gets super hot. Nice size workout room and indoor pool. Spacious lobby area with computer. Each room has an abundance of fresh cleans trowels and rags. And the windows in each room opens. Wow!!!

Text: The toilet clogged and the staff simply applologized. They handed my dad a plunger and told him to fix it. They claimed that a plumber could be reached until the morning.
