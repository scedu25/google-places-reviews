Lake Woods Log Cabin
Rating: 5
Text: Took a family vacation with 17 of us which includes 10 kids. We rented both the top and bottom floors. The cabin was very clean. It was well stocked with just about anything we would need. There weren't enough beds for everyone, which we knew before going in, but there was plenty of room for the kids to camp out on the floor. There is plenty of seating inside and outside. Lots of room to play outside, and minutes from the lake. There are cigarette buckets here and there so that any smokers wouldn't have to throw there butts on the ground. There are coded bolt locks on the outside doors, so you don't have to worry about anyone disturbing you, and made it harder for any little ones to get out, and no keeping track of the keys.
