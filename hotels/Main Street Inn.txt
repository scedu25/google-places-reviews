Main Street Inn

Text: The room was clean and came at a great price. The woman that we booked with was really nice and accommodating. I also liked that there was complimentary coffee to make, fruit, and granola bars. My suggestions for improvement would be to have hangers in the wardrobe and more tables upon which to put items, like may be a desk. Also, larger garbage cans would be helpful, too.

Text: We were traveling to Galena to check out the town before we move and happened across this place on Main Street. Not only is the location perfect, the place is spotless. Cute, clean, and friendly staff both on the phone and in person. We were very happy with the Inn. The beds are super comfortable and they were even one step ahead and provided makeup remover wipes! Really what beats that? You can park in front of the Inn, there are snacks, teas, coffee, and hot coco in the lobby in case you are hungry, or use up your coffee in your room. I mean really, check this place out. It IS all that and a bag of chips.
