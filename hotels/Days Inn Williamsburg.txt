Days Inn Williamsburg
Rating: 4
Text: We are having a very nice time here. Rooms are very clean and the help is well spoken, quite friendly and very helpful. Originally we were told there were no available rooms but after telling the desk personnel that we were displaced from our Williamsburg home due to a house fire, he immediately gave us one of the three rooms he keeps permanently vacant for just such an emergency. Pet friendly, strong a.c. Very helpful staff. Highly recommended.

Text: This hotel is rather sketchy. The outside looks creepy and the halls and rooms smell of smoke even in the nonsmoking rooms.
