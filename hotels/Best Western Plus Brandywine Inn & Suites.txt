Text: We gathered for a family reunion in Delphi.  The Brandywine was the closest hotel for our group of about 15.  It was convenient & very satisfactory for all.

Text: I have always loved this place but the last 3 times I have been here... the Jacuzzi is too low on water... today temp was way to low. And the shower in the locker room has been out of soap in the dispenser in the handicap shower for 2 weeks at least. I been coming here since the place opened & recommend it to alot of people. So these slips bothered me ?
