Indianapolis Marriott East
Rating: 5
Text: Lobby is beautiful.  Outdoor courtyard was inviting. Check in easy, staff was friendly, and rooms clean. Parking is free and easily accessible. It was hard to regulate air in the suite bedroom but the suite was spacious and comfortable.

Text: When we walked in were immediately greeted and shown the front desk. I felt so welcomed and comfortable. The lobby was open and airy. The check in process was fast and efficient. Once in our double bed room it was a little cramped and the bathroom was quite small but nice. I would stay here again.

Text: Excellent customer service. My companion and I were greeted immediately as we stepped inside the clean, nicely decorated lobby. The check in process was smooth and quick, with no issues. Nice amenities, especially the fitness room. Our room was spotless and exactly what we paid for, so no issues there as well. Overall, a definite 5-star experience and about the nicest thing Indianapolis has to offer. Would definitely stay here again during a future visit and will recommend to friends, family, and colleagues.

Text: The room was very nice and clean. The bathroom was a bit weird because it had a sliding door that didn't latch instead of a regular one but it was okay. The people at the front desk though, so amazingly helpful and willing to do whatever they could. Each person I talked to was also very knowledgeable. Everyone was very friendly and that helped make it a great stay.

Text: I did not stay at this hotel but we did spend some time in the lobby area with my young son and I was extremely impressed by the politeness and warmth we experienced while there.  Our presence was acknowledged various times by the very helpful staff - concierge, reception desk, and even a gentleman from the housekeeping staff who took the time to stop and ask if my son would like a cookie with some milk. This Marriott goes above and beyond!
