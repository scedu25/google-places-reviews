Text: It was a visit for a wedding. The facilities were top notch. I usually start with the bathrooms. They were excellent as can be expected. The service was good, and the decor was good. I did not have a room so no idea about them.

Text: A very solid Marriott that was built in the 70s or 80s. Has the gray motif. That means it is one generation back in renovation (post gold and red) prior to. Lost modern minimal motif. Rooms have tubs and I love the heat lamps in the bathroom (northern us cold weather thing). Parking is free in a ramp so you can avoid snow. Nice park with trails just north for running. Pretty standard and nice staff
