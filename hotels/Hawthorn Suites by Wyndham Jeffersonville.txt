Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Jeffersonville
Rating: 4
Text: It's a decent place close to Louisville. It has a scenic view near by where you can go for a walk and enjoy the view of the bridge and the river Ohio. This hotel has a kitchen and all other facilities which I felt is great for a hotel room. The bed was comfortable and the price is very reasonable.

Text: Very nice room with ample space, comfortable bed, clean, fully stocked kitchen with dishwasher. It could have brighter lights. The room did have a slight and unusual odor. The dishwasher leaked onto the floor while we were gone, but it turned out ok. Breakfast was good, but they got behind on some of the items, but did get them replenished within a few minutes. The location of the lobby was not obvious, with no outdoor sign. We had called in ahead of time to confirm they would take the coupon in the discount book, but then when we got there they wanted to charge us an extra $5 over the stated coupon price saying they were full. But when we insisted their employee had said they would take the coupon, they did honor it as stated.

Text: Nothing severely bad about our stay. A humming noise was constant but it became like white noise after a while. People smoking right in front of door ways and on entrance walk ways. I would stay here again if I got the same great deal I did this time. PS got to see Live PD in action !!!!
