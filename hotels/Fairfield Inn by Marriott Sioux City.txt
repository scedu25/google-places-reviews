Fairfield Inn by Marriott Sioux City
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is perfectly fine! The staff is exceptionally courteous and professional. I have never been to a hotel that chooses a "Guest of the Day" and was consistently surprised at their level of service, being a smaller hotel. As other reviews have stated the hotel does desperately need to be updated but we didn't let that get in the way of our stay. Breakfast was delicious and full of unexpected options. I will definitely stay again on my next trip through the area!

Text: I travel for work and am pretty loyal to the Marriott brand, while the staff is both pleasant and professional, this is not a place to stay for more than a day or two. Rooms are nice. Management needs to get it together. No fitness center.  No washer and dryer! The drop off laundry service costs more than buying new work clothes.

Text: The hotel is easy to access from the interstate with plenty of parking. The hotel itself is nice and most importantly clean. The rooms were also clean and had nice comfortable beds. A typical Fairfield breakfast was served in the main area which was satisfactory. Very nice hotel for it's class, I would visit again.
