Text: RV Park Review 08/28/2012 : Well if you just need a place to stay for the night or two, you can't beat the price. I mean it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. It's no Jelly Stone Resort. But you get the essentials, W/E/S and WiFi. Easy in and out. Only 2 or 3 pull throughs. Next to gas and food. The price will bring me back again.

Text: A disgusting excuse of a place . Cockroaches crawling everywhere , drugs being sold right in plain sight and the management joining in with them . It seems like this place is ran by a bunch of kids that party a lot and do not care about how the place looks or the decent people that happen to stop by there. I don't mean the good kind of party either . We found needles on the side walk and on the parking lot just thrown there . It was an absolute filth i recommend spending the extra $30 to $40 dollars and stay somewhere that is not owned by Sam Headly . Who which ive heard is the owner of this motel and Route 66 Motel , which is not any better . these places should be condemned  or sold to some one decent and willing to provide a decent place for visitors to spend ther money . It is us who pay for there cars and there lose spending habits on them selves . It is clear that none of these places should be allowed to operate . Oh i did spend the rest of my stay at the western inn and it was well worth it service was absolutely spectacular and so clean .
