Text: I have no complaints. Have been on a bike tour and stayed in several hotels across the country and this is probably one of the nicest. Room very large and clean. Standard breakfast but plenty of it.

Text: This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It was $80 we checked in after midnight and was out by 5am. My husband, myself and my one year old daughter couldn't even fall asleep because the smell in the room was soo horrendous. There was oats from oatmeal on the counter top in the bathroom and something stuck to the outside of the toilet bowl. It was disgusting!!! Not only that but the right side of one of the beds, next to the air conditioner was soaked. The carpeting was super wet and smelled musty. The walls are textured and looked dirty. The front desk attendants were rude and of no help. I said online your hotel charges $64 a night why is it different in person, he said all that I know is that I clock in at 11 and leave in the morning, do you want a room or not. Terrible service!!! Do not go there!!

Text: Accused me of smoking in room
 I do not smoke they charged me 150 . It's just a rip.off. They said ashes in bath egg oil when the dirt was off my purse I dropped outside and cleaned off. I have proof I do not smoke from all my health officials.

Text: I checked in right before my 3rd shift and just went to work. Came back to the room and the smell was horrific. I found stink bugs in the window. The front desk acted like it was no big deal. After getting gloves from the front desk to remove the bugs, I saw all the bed skirts had "bodily fluid" on them as well as boogers. The smell was too much and gave me a headache. I checked out and found a new hotel.
