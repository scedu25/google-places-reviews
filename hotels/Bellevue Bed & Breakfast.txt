Bellevue Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: I would recommend this bed and breakfast to anyone.  It is beautiful, very clean, and located close to many delicious restaurants. Brian and Linda were very welcoming and we enjoyed visiting with them as well.  In the evening, Linda left us some delicious treats to be enjoyed after dinner.  The three course breakfast the next morning was outstanding.  Wonderful experience and I highly recommend this B & B.

Text: This was the first B&B we have ever visited.  My wife and I visited for our anniversary last weekend and we enjoyed.   The room was nice and cozy.  They turned down our bed for the night and left us some goodies.  The next morning was met with a nice breakfast.  I was allergic to the food and the innkeeper whisked it away without complaint and made me something else which was above and beyond what they needed to do.  Though we personally may not do something like that again, it truly was a once in a life time opportunity.

Text: We enjoyed our stay so much.  Brian and Linda are wonderful hosts.  The three course breakfasts were excellent.  I'm still dreaming of the blueberry muffin with Linda's homemade sauce.  The roasted tomatoes from their garden were out of this world.  Our room, the Yorkshire, was cozy, clean, comfortable and quiet.  We walked through the downtown area and the two day experience was a world away from our typical hectic lives.  We left feeling refreshed and well fed!

Text: The Bellvue Bed and Breakfast was our first stay at a B&B and it could not have been a better experience.  The home was lovely, the furniture beautiful, the breakfast delicious, and the hosts wonderfully pleasant.  Though four or five star accommodations are not available in Cape Girardeau, their quality can be found in this little place.
