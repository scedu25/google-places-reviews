Text: The room was clean. The hallway had dead bugs in the stairs. There were only 2 towels for the four of us, and when I asked for more there was no one at the desk. The beds were uncomfortable and the air conditioner was loud. The price was reasonable at only $80. So I guess you get what you pay for.
