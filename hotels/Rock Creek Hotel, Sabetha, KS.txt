Rock Creek Hotel, Sabetha, KS

Text: This place is phenomenal! The place has been recently renovated. The accommodates are always nice and clean and the staff is very very friendly. I travel a lot for work and once I caught wind of this place I make it a frequent stay for me. Breakfast provided includes breakfast sandwiches and are hardy for a continental breakfast. The hotel offers a nice comfortable, clean, quiet environment that you can't beat for the price! Just wonderful. I would strongly recommend Rock Creek if you are passing through. I often go out of my way to stay here because the accommodates in a 60+ miles radius just don't meet my needs like this place does.

Text: A nice place to stay in a small town. Mattresses could be better.

Text: Traveled to Sabetha for the solar eclipse. The hotel and RV lot were full. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was clean and contained a coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave. We were in a pet designated room in the back, which was very quiet. We prepared a steak dinner on one of their two bbq grills and ate it on the deck, which contained an ample amount of chairs and tables. Overall, the hotel is very basic but quite pleasant. Would certainly book again.

Text: We were there for the eclipse and the staff obviously was not used to full bookings. There is a single roll away mattress, no elevator, physical keys and they wouldn't let us check out 2 hours late even though there's no possibility someone needed that room
