Text: Great prices for such nice rooms! The internet is great, the pool was well taken care of. I had to switch from a Queen sized room to a King and the employees were great. Would 10/10 reccomend

Text: Charging me a hefty amount of money for a week but it's the cheapest around close to work. Two days in a row I have asked front desk for a microwave and a fridge they keep telling me they will have it there this evening and both times I have bought sandwich meats and both times they have been a waste of money because I cannot keep them cold without a fridge. The shower tub doesn't drain and the toilet is not anchored to the floor, I tell you it's a wild ride at 3 in the morning! 

    Over priced for bad service and junk rooms.

Text: Will not stay here again . staff was very nice but room was not. It needs repainted badly. Back of door had been decorated by scribbles from markers and also on chair seats.  Curtains need washed. Pillows had an odor. No extra toilet paper and we ran out 2nd day. Refrigerator broken 1st day but staff had it replaced by 2nd evening.. Phone did not work. Bed spread had burn holes in it making the non smoking room questionable plus they smelled of smoke. No pencil or paper in desk for our convenience. We booked room for 4 women but had to request 2 more sets of towels after arriving to accommodate all of us. One of our drinks left a bit of water on table, grabbed a tissue to wipe up and found the table top filthy.  Had to wash before we could play cards. We each brought our own bars of soap, good thing because there was only one bar provided for both bath and sink.  All in all we would definitely not return or recommend .
