Candy Cane RV Park & Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Loved this place. Travelling from Illinois to Arizona and couldn't drive anymore, stopped in Cuba, MO and looked up local campgrounds. This is literally a hidden gem in the Ozarks, the owner Bill was so nice and accommodating, the bathroom was EXTREMELY well kept, prices were cheap for tent camping and it's small and secluded enough that you don't have any noise from other campers. I also felt safe here and for a tent camper that's always something in the back of your mind. Wish I could give this place and the owner more stars.

This little campgrounds is located well off the beaten path in the Ozark mountains beautiful scenery piece and quiet and local hiking trails make this one of my favorite little camp grounds I will definitely stay again if I get the chance

Text: New store, bathrooms and shower house! They offer mini golf (small fee), yard checkers, swimming pool and a play area for the kids. Plenty of shady camping spots to choose from and great prices! Bill and Shirley are very helpful and sweet, they make you feel at home while visiting Candy Cane Rv Park! I would  highly recommend to anyone.
