Text: This is an older motel. I am guessing it was in really bad shape and the owners have done a lot to fix it up. Still some things to do but they are trying. The rooms were clean which is very important. New AC units. The manager was awesome and very helpful in telling us where to eat in town, which places close early, etc. The downside to this place is the rooms are tiny. I spend about 150 nights a year in motels and this was quite possibly  the smallest room I have ever been in. It had a king size bed and there was maybe a foot or two from the wall on one side and the end. No table in the room. No closet. Tiny counter top in restroom. I am not a really picky person but I felt really cramped here. If I was in the area I would stay here again because there are not many options in the area - it isn't bad - just small.

Text: I remember what it was like before it was remodeled, and it wasn't great. Now its clean, comfortable, and convenient. The manager was extremely friendly and helpful. The one thing that I saw that I would fix is the doors to the rooms. They are a little old and beat up. All in all I will be staying here next time I'm in town visiting!
