Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park™ Camp Resort at Barton Lake - Fremont, IN

Text: Site we were given was very nice.  If you want a nice quiet peaceful camping experience, this is not the place for you.  Kids are literally everywhere.  For families with young kids, this is a good place to go.  The camping store is great, fair prices, and you can get a huge bowl of ice cream for a reasonable price.  Cost to camp is very expensive compared to other local campgrounds.

Text: My family loved this place. Our stay was our 1st (ever) camping trip. We recently purchased a travel trailer and decided to try this jellystone. We found our family tradition summer vacation spot. The staff was great and very helpful. 

The gift shop was not over priced like other gift shops. The water park was clean and the kids enjoyed every pool, slide, and water bucket.  The beach/lagoon was awesome. The kids had so much to do here. The scheduled activities were awesome as well. 

I can't wait to bring the kids next summer.

Text: Kids had a great time.  Very family oriented.  We stayed in the 6 person cabin.  It was small, but very clean.  My daughter and I were both free of allergy/asthma symptoms.  We both have problems with cigarette smoke, dust and mildew.  Not an odor in sight.  We were able to get a cabin at the last minute, but price was significantly more expensive than advertised on website. Bring your own bedding.   Would use camper in future for better accommodations.

Text: This is a wonderful place for little ones.  There is so much for them to do.  Water Splash area, water slides, pool, arcade, golf, jump area, bike rental, playgrounds , fishing.... the list is endless. There is a great hall that has activities for kids and families.  This is a really great park for families that have younger ones.  As a mom of teenagers there is still plenty for them to do, if they enjoy the outdoors.  Great family memories here. Costly, but nice park.
