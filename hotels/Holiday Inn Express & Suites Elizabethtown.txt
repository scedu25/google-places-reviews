Holiday Inn Express & Suites Elizabethtown
Rating: 4
Text: Our stay at the hotel was very nice. The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean. Our room was comfortable but the blankets felt kind of rough. Breakfast in the morning was good. The location was good based right off the highway and near gas stations and restaurants. If I had to make suggestions, the pool felt a little slimy on the bottom and the water just felt gross. Also there appears to be no outlet on the road the hotel is located and for the 2017 Solar Eclipse only having one way in and out of the main entrance of the hotel made coming and going hard. But both of these are very minor and our stay was enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a comfortable stay at a fair price.

Text: We stopped here on the way to Florida for a night and was pleasantly surprised! It's an older place, but is being updated and is clean and has a nice breakfast. There's not a hot tub, but there is an indoor pool. I'd definitely stay here again!

Text: Almost every Holiday Inn Express I've seen has been great, but this one is excellent. It's clean, has friendly employees, and a yummy breakfast. Oh, and don't forget the cinnamon rolls.

I choose to stay here every year regardless of which hotel is used for the block discount for the Kentucky Christian Writer's Conference. It's hard to find rooms at this time of year because of events at the Elizabethtown sport complex, so if you read this and plan to attend KCWC, reserve your room as soon as you are able.
