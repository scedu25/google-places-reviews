Parsonian Apartments
Rating: 4
Text: They were redecorated into beautiful apartments that looks like a home atmosphere, for low income people. It's the tallest building in downtown Parsons. It has several floor levels. It's right close to down town main street. Convenient with people that don't have their own vehicles. The whole Parsonian Hotel was totally remodeled from New owners, which took several months to remodeled each apartment that actually looks like a home.
