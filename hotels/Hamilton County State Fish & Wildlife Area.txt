Text: Excellent place to stay the night. We got a cabin, and it was very clean and comfortable. There was a power outlet, AC, and a mini fridge. I was delighted to find the pond/lake very tranquil and beautiful. The bathrooms and showers were excellent, more than I expected for such a small park. This was a great find.

Text: I was surprised at how pretty this park is. There are trails & very scenic views around the park. It's very bike-friendly here too. It's very hilly, so it's a workout.
