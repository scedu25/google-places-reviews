Text: Stayed here in August. The hosts are wonderful and the breakfast they made was great. Coffee was waiting for us in the morning outside our door. The room we stayed in was the New Orleans room, it was a nice spacious room that had a balcony and sunroom with a couch and tv. Overall a very beautiful house and wonderful hosts!
