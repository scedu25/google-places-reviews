Hampton Inn & Suites Detroit/Airport-Romulus
Rating: 5
Text: Kyle at the front desk greeted us and checked us in. And he could not have been more helpful, hospitable, and kind to us. He is a great employee and ambassador for Hampton. The hotel was comfy and modern, just what we needed. But the employees here are what made this an excellent stay.

Text: I love this hotel! I have stayed in hotels for at least half the year and never slept as good as I did here at the Hampton Inn! The staff was amazing from the front desk to the breakfast crew! I will definitely stay here the next time I am in Michigan!!!!

Text: The room was very spacious, clean, and well lit. The service was efficient and friendly. As for location, the hotel is easy to find, with good parking and jusr far enough from the road where there are no sound issues. The morning breakfast was also nicely varied and well done.
