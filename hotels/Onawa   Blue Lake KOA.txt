Text: While this campground is clean and has nice shower/bathroom/laundry facilities, be aware of a few other things that are lacking. Don't be surprised of you don't get the campsite that you reserved. We arrived to discover that the more spacious site we reserved was changed to a site that gave us just enough room to open our awning with only about 3 feet to spare before touching the camper in the next site. There is no access to the water except by a dock. And the dog walk area consists of walking in the grass beside a bean field or the highway. They do provide you with poop disposal bags for your dogs waste. Overall, it's a great place to stop for a night, but I would not stay here again for any extended length of time.

Text: Nice area lots of trees. However high rates for the off season, even with a discount. Almost $50 dollars per night. At least that's my opinion.
