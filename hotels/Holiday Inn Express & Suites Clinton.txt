Text: Amazing, will definitely be back! The rooms were clean and all the staff was extremely accommodating. When walking into the hotel the smell was absolutely amazing. The complimentary breakfast had a great selection.

Text: I stay at a lot of Holiday Inns and this one is just the same as all the others. Rooms are always really clean, moderately priced too. The front desk staff wasn't as great as I usually see which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Might be subject to change the more I stay here.
