Bay Side Resort

Text: I've stayed here twice now (rooms 1 and 5) and both times I have had an amazing experience. This place has it all: pool, hot tub, sauna, boat docks, kayaks, paddle boat, nightly bon fires, grills and even fishing poles. The owners are the nicest people you'll meet and super accommodating! The rooms are modest, but the beds are comfy, the appliances work great and they even supply paper towels! The best part of this resort is its location. It is 1 minute walk from the north gate and actually closer to the park than the north gate free parking lot! My family was very impressed with everything the resort had to offer us and we booked our 3rd stay just yesterday. If you are considering this place, book it! You'll enjoy your time here and the location to Indiana Beach cannot be beat. If you have any issues during your stay, talk to the staff, they truly care about the guests and will do their best to make it right!!

Text: Hotel room was nice, but an electrical socket was hanging with loose electrical currents and wires. Also, the dock was filled with spiders, the boats were unusable, and the paddle boat was very dirty.
