Text: Great management and helpful employees. Allowed us to set up to watch college football in the eating area (8 of us). Food, bar and rooms are great. Bed was super comfy. Shower had a rainhead and plenty of power and hot water. Built in dispensing units were great. We have stayed here many times and this was the best.

Text: If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...

Lovely place with very friendly staff. They offer parking you need to get a key first though. There is check in parking in the front so you don't have to pay that. The breakfast was very good and had lots of variety. The rooms overlook the pool that is on the inside. I would definitely stay again

Text: Great location for downtown St. Louis. Walking distance of everything. Parking is plentiful but a bit strange with a garage door and all hotel parking on 4th floor. Very narrow. Was fine in rental, but would be concerned in my own car. Beds are comfortable, staff was friendly. Bathroom was a bit dated.

Text: We have stayed here multiple times. It is a nice hotel. The staff is very friendly and the perks are great. Parking is $7 a night. Overall it is a good hotel if you have something going on near the dome.
