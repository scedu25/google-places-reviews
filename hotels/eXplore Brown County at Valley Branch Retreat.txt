Text: Matt and Billy were great guides and made the whole experience fun as well as safe. The young lady in the office was also very friendly and fun to talk with. Can't wait to come back and do some more zipping with y'all

Text: My Husband and I took a zip line tour and a buggy hill climb. Both activities were some of the most fun we've ever had! I highly recommend this establishment! The staff is super friendly and also professional.

Text: We visited explore Brown County Zip Line tours on a girls trip this month.  We rented a Cabin through Hills Of Brown rentals and made it an awesome event.  The staff at the zip line tour were super fun and friendly. They were very knowledgeable yet made plenty of jokes and gave us a very personalized experience.  If you don't already know which tour you want, there are several options based on how much time you have.  I highly recommend doing any of the tours longer than the "sneak peek" which is only 3 zip lines.  The 3 zip lines are very short and if we had more time available we would have done more.  Regardless it was still a blast!  The "shuttle ride" to and from the zip line location is just as much fun as the zip lines themselves!  Highly recommended to all

Text: We went on the explorer tour with Seth and Tim as our guides. My lands you have to go! We had an absolute blast. I felt completely safe the entire time. They were an ABSOLUTE blast! They were humorous and made our tour the best! As a person afraid of heights, I still had a blast. It did not stop me and I even did the flying squirrel (no hands), went backwards, did the lean out on the bridge, and the leap of faith! Such a blast I will be back to zip on!
