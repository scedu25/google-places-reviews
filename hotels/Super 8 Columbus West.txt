Text: This was a nice hotel to stay at after spending a month in the truck doing long haul. The room and the bed was very cozy. The room also had a mini fridge and a refrigerator. The pillows and bedding were clean and soft. We were able to park the truck right up front without any issues or fear of being towed. The staff was friendly and gave me an extra pillow and blanket when I asked for them! Didn't get a chance to try their breakfast because I had slept in. Overall a very nice hotel for the weekend, the only thing I would have liked different, is fluffier towels. The hotel was also in a very nice location, stores and restaurants were a very short drive away.

Text: Clean, no frills accommodations.  Mirrors on the wall behind the bed headboard will add some spice to those traveling with a companion.  Great channel selection on the television. Continental breakfast in the morning offers coffee, juice, cereal, pastries, and the classic waffle maker option.
