Chicago Marriott Schaumburg
Rating: 2
Text: The room was dirty. My bed had a hair on it prior to me even moving the comforters down. I thought that was gross. The front desk, even though I had an issue with checking in, was very nice the second day but the day it happened they wanted to put up a fight about what was going on. I don't want to get into details but it was very stressful to say the least and I needed to do an entirely extra step when I got to my room to fix an issue they caused. Location is fine. The layout of the hotel is strange.

Text: Older, but very well maintained. Linens looked and smelled fresh instead of just refolded like other hotels. Above average toiletries. Bar is "selective" with their service, but that's Chicago right?

Text: Clean, recently renovated rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We used the hotel shuttle to go out to dinner and return. The shuttle driver was very pleasant and happy to drive us out. Overall very pleased with the hotel.

Text: Lobby is clean and inviting. Front desk staff was very nice and accommodating, especially Dreya. I requested for a crib for my room and it wasn't ready or set up. When I called for the crib, they sent it up right away. Room was a double. Kind of small with a crib. Bathroom felt a little cramped, especially with the door open. Otherwise, bed was comfy.

Text: This is a premier Marriott property. I stay at Marriotts 40 weeks out of the year, and this one is impressive. It's a beautiful hotel, very modern. Close to highways, shopping, etc. But it's the staff here that makes the place shine. Polite, enthusiastic, eager to please. They truly made this hotel guest feel welcome and they earn every one of my 5 stars.
