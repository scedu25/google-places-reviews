Marceline Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Very comfortable and luxurious place in the middle of town.  The owner is really nice and everything is quite casual, exactly the way you'd expect a small town to be.  It feels more like a condo in the middle of a city inside, but step out the front door and you're in the middle of a beautiful small town...the best of both worlds!
