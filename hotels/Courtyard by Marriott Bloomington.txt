Courtyard by Marriott Bloomington
Rating: 5
Text: We had a wonderful experience here. Check in was easy. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The business center allowed me to print out all of my necessary work documents and the restaurant was delicious. The staff was very friendly and quick to assist. The pool looked well kept even though we didn't dive in :). The area is convenient and parking is plentiful.

Text: I visited the hotel briefly, because my relatives were staying there. The furnishings looked updated and the staff were friendly. The pool was busy and so there were puddles through the hallway and in the elevators, which seemed like a hazard. The rooms seemed comfortable, but the smell of the freshening spray was a little too strong. Convenient but not-picturesque location. Affordable accommodations.

Text: We stayed one night to attend a show at the convention center. Very convenient to get to the convention center. The pool was nice but cold. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms very clean. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.

Text: Attended an event and stayed over night. Temperature in lobby was very warm. Temperature elsewhere was good. Event set up was good. Hotel room was also enjoyed. The elevator was neglected in being cleaned. Candy, candy wrappers and dried dirt were all on elevator floor. Room was comfortable. Bed and pillows were nice. In shower tub was slippery and curved on bottom which made f or less standing room when taking a shower.

Text: Staff is friendly and accommodating but for a property in the Marriott system this place is lacking. The Bistro does not have all the spirits it had on the menu and the bar attendant wasn't licensed to make and serve drinks. A person had to be dispatched to do that. There was no soap in the shower. The whirlpool was not functioning. There is a lack of attention to detail and the place seems to be operated by young inexperienced people.
