DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Cedar Rapids Convention Complex
Rating: 5
Text: As always, the Hilton Double tree in Cedar Rapids helps make our professional events something special. The facilities are clean, beautiful, and well-appointed. The food was very good, and variety was beyond what one normally finds at conference-style events. The staff was courteous, professional and went out of their way to serve us well. Overall great experience. If you're looking for a facility to host an event, definitely consider this.

Text: This is a very nice hotel. The staff is proactive and does a great job making sure guests are taken care of. It's also an extremely convenient place to stay if you're  attending a convention that is hosted downstairs. The restaurant on the 16th floor was great (they have $10 lunch deals, that includes food, drink, and tax) and their staff was also amazing. I would give 5 stars, but rooms did not come with a microwave or fridge so you are pretty much forced to buy food or get room service . Otherwise, I completely recommend.

Text: Rooms were immaculate.  Room service prompt and courteous.  Staff at the 350 very attentive, food looked and tasted great.  Best valet team.  Overall great experience at this hotel.  
Also able to run in the downtown area- felt safe and cute dining within walking distance.

Text: Beautiful hotel in downtown Cedar Rapids. The staff was great and the rooms were nice. Definitely one of the best Doubletrees I've stayed at. Plenty of great places to eat within walking distance. They only issue I had was the hotel is right next to the train yard. Lots of train horns at all hours.

Text: A quick night spent in downtown Cedar Rapids. Booked last minute and they had a good weekend rate. 

Comfortable, friendly and lovely view of the city. The hotel is located directly next to an active train line, and train horns blow late into the night and early in the morning. 

Warm cookie, friendly staff - and some train noise.
