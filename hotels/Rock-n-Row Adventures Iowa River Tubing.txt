Rock-n-Row Adventures Iowa River Tubing

Text: We have been going here for the last two years. We have not had one bad experience. We love the owner and the staff. Sandra and Wes are our favorites. I don't recall the names of the other friendly faces. The staff is so down to earth and great to us. The staff recognized us from past visit's and are just amazing people. 

I tell everyone I know about this place and consider it the adult campground. Pet's are not permitted which I love and I often do not see a lot of people under 21. 

We have made a lot of friend's here and people are so open and welcoming when camping or partying. We have such a blast here. Great band's and events. 

I do believe that you are required to tube here instead of just camping. I would just like to camp sometimes. You meet so many awesome people when you float the Iowa River. 

I really recommend Rock-n-Row for adults and those who like to drink and have a great time. This is NOT A KOA. And that is why we keep coming back. No pet's, no kid's, no pool, no non-sense. Exactly what we love.

Keep up the great work all of you. What you are doing is great and working. A truly awesome place in the middle of nowhere.
