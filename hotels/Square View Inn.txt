Text: Most cheap places to stay are just that. Cheap ... So when we arrived we weren't expecting much. For about $70 a night this place exceeded my expectations in every way. The room is kind of like a lodge but the place was massive. There's one room with a queen size bed. Upstairs has a room with a TV and three beds. Downstairs has a full stocked kitchen for people doing extended stays and four bar stools for people to sit at the counter. This place could easily sleep 7 - 8 people. Even more of a blow up mattress was brought. This is the only place I've stayed at for under $100 that I would recommend and definitely stay again if I was ever there again. There was also free reliable WiFi.

Text: Our family was camping at Lake Thunderhead and we needed a place to stay. Managed to find this place by chance and it was perfect for our needs, and then some!

Lots of room, free Wi-Fi, full kitchen with dinnerware, washer and dryer. Not sure if all the rooms had all these, but wow!

Text: This was completely as advertised. Clean, spacious, well-appointed, and useful. Person who checked me in was a substitute, but still extremely friendly. Would stay again if in the area.

Text: This was perfect lodging for our family during our stay in Unionville. It is great to see historical buildings being remodeled and used. We had wifi ,flat screens and a full kitchen, washer and dryer.  This is hard to find in such a small town, especially so affordable.
