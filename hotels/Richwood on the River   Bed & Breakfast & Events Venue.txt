Richwood on the River / Bed & Breakfast & Events Venue
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I had our wedding at Richwood on the River this past weekend and it was AMAZING. Simply put, if I could give the venue and Colleen Sutton (the owner and manager) 1,000,000 stars I would ... and even then it might not do it justice still. The location itself is like absolutely gorgeous and the attention to detail is second to none. Every location we took photos at our photographers were in awe with the backdrop. Most importantly, so many of our guests came up to us let us know how amazing they thought the venue was and how much fun they had. The words "this was the best wedding I have ever been to" were heard often. We LOVE you Colleen and cannot wait to be back for our anniversary!!!!

Text: Beautiful venue run by a fabulous team. Everything was pristine and they went out of their way to make us feel utterly comfortable. Breakfast was hearty and delicious. The main house is very rustic and carefully preserved. The grounds are simply breathtaking! I'm definitely going back! :)
