Springfield KOA
Rating: 5
Text: I have a new favorite KOA. This place reminds me of how campgrounds used to be. Remote? Maybe but it's minutes from Springfield. It feels like you're going down KOA road forever when you go in but you realize on the way out it's not so long. Did not hear a thing all night. The wonderful sounds of silence. They have a nice clean camp. There's a lot of clean, level sites for however you're camping. RV, tent, or cabin everything was nicely appointed. Premium sites had nice patio and furniture. Nearby lake with many little parks, zoo, and nature center. We really enjoyed our stay.

Text: Had a great time getting to know Springfield and it's history.  We stood in a cabin at camp KOA. Truly more then what I was expecting in the cabin. The camp is a bit small but overall it's great for people looking to stay for one or two nights and enjoy the city of Springfield together. Staff is very friendly!

Text: Very clean and very quiet KoA. About the only detraction is probably its best quality in that it is about 10 min off the highway. It's very peaceful and well-manicured. We will definitely be visiting here again.

Text: Overall Not a bad place to camp. Owners were nice, bathrooms were clean, location was quite. My only complaint is that I woke up covered in bites. I have no idea what the bites are, but when I showed the worker, she kind of just made a face. Not sure if they are bed bugs, but I don't know what else they could be.

Text: Was nice setting. But the woman was not very friendly or helpful.  Closed up too early, the electric went off and it was 98* outside. There was no one in the office. Extra charges I have never seen on a KOA Bill before either. Was dissatisfied to say the least.
