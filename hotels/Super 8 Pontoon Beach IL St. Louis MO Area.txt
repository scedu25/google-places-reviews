Text: The building was pretty dingy. I stayed from Friday to Sunday. On Saturday the housekeeper came in took the dirty towels & that was it. She grabbed my daughters friends bathing suit top with the towels & we had to go ask for it. They knew they had it & weren't going to say anything. Didn't empty the trash, clean the bathroom or make the beds. They said we have to request that! I have never had to request for the garbage to be emptied. I called to ask about the trash removal & they said I had to bag it up & put it outside the door. I was told they had a hot tub & an iron & ironing board, they had none of these. Their policies on check in was ridiculous. We had the room reserved & they said if we weren't there by 4 it would be cancelled. When my friend tried to pay for the room on her card the lady argued with her because it wasn't in her name it was in mine & I had just talked to the lady & told her that she was going to call & pay for it so that they wouldn't get rid of it even though I was on my way there& would be there by 5. They said if they didnt hear from me by 4 then they would cancel it, never said a word about having to be there by 4. Also told her that they didn't know if we had it for 2 nights because she couldn't look that up. The beds were a bit uncomfortable. The breakfast they offer is not the best either. The decor is very outdated & everything just looks old, dirty & worn out. The pool isn't the best either. Overall it was probably the worst experience I had with a motel. I would not stay there again unless it was an absolute emergency! If it wasn't for the fact that everything else was booked up we wouldn't have stayed there.

Text: My hotel of choice when I come to see the drag races in Madison Convenient location to the race track, friendly employees and clean rooms. Comfy beds and pillows. The Dennys in the parking lot is a plus too!

Text: It was a good night there with no issues. People are nice ... the only issue was that I was going to leave a tip for the hard working housekeepers until I put the toilet seat down and found old dry pee! Alot too. I couldn't believe it. It was super obvious too. I had to clean the toilet myself so I decided not to leave a tip due to the fact that they were not so hard working after all. ?

Text: I travel to the area weekly. The staff is always friendly and the rooms are always clean. Its not a 5 star hotel, but it is a clean safe place to lay your head at night. Reccomended highly. Great value.

Text: I stayed in couple times before and had no problems. But the last time they give me room with fridge not working. After my complaints I get room 306. 
First, it wasn't cleaned. But it had 2 beds so I didn't care, one wasn't touched, an I needed it just for couple hours. Then I noticed that it was smoking one, that's OK, not big deal. From 4 night lights only 1 was working. After 1 hour of sleep I woke up with big itching on my back. Found and kill 2 bedbugs. Just sit down on the corner of another bed, I was bitten again in my leg.
