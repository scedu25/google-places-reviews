Residence Inn by Marriott Lexington South/Hamburg Place
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was courteous and attentive. We enjoyed the continental breakfast, at which staff frequently checked to see if my family had everything it needed - even though it was a buffet style breakfast. The hotel was close to lots of sjopping and restaurants.

Text: Newly renovated. Super clean. The only noise we heard came through the doors when people went by in the hall. Otherwise, super happy with our experience.
