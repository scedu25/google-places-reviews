Baymont Inn & Suites Champaign
Rating: 3
Text: Friendly staff and a solid value.
Decent room for a budget priced hotel.  Nice breakfast as well.  Third floor is where the smoking rooms are.  If you get a third floor non-smoking room, the smell will meet you as you get off the elevator.
Nice 42" LG TV in our room.
I would describe the bathroom as 'tight'.

Text: Upon check-in, was given a room that not only still had DO NOT DISTURB placard on door but was also skipped completely by housekeeping. Took them 50 minutes to provide me with another room in with A.C. unit was not functioning. At least temps were cool enough for window to open and cool room. I travel for work and will be recommending that this hotel not be used by my employers.

Text: Good rates, nothing spectacular but you really don't expect it going in. Great staff, good parking, nothing of interest close to the hotel and the highway can be loud at times, but I would still recommend.
