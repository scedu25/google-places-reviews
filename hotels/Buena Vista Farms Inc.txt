Text: I stayed here a couple different times while working in the area. I first stayed in the small cabin on the north side of the park, I was sharing it with another guy so it was cramped but if it’s just one person or a parent and kids it would be fine. Then I moved over to one of the bigger cabins which was really nice and well kept with a great view. Then I moved into town to a motel for a while, after I got tired of that I bought a camper and moved back to the park. They gladly welcomed me back. I set my camper up in December, which isnt a good idea for first time camper owners. They were a lot of help if I ran into any kind of issue. Once it finally warmed up I walked all the trails out in the woods and fished the ponds. I stayed in my camper at the park for 9 months and got to know the people that own it pretty well and I would regularly offer help around the park, and they would offer anything I might be able to use. It’s a nice quiet place with great people as owners and operators. If I’m ever back in the area I will have to go back just to visit. Nestor and Terri are great people and I recommend this place to anybody.

Text: It was a nice camp ground with full hook up & a bath house plus laundry. They have a pond u can fish out of & use their canoes. Plus a spa that cuts hair & does manicures & pedicures on the weekend. I only gave it4 stars cause jacksonville doesn't have Verizon services which I have.
