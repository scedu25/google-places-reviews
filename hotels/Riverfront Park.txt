Riverfront Park

Text: Had the most wonderful time this past weekend!  Camping area was clean, well lit, and secluded enough that you forget that you're in town at all.  The caretaker Charlie was outstanding and we would completely recommend this campground to anyone.  Can't wait to come back!

Text: Charlie is a great caretaker and made sure we were well settled into a spot. Yes the trains run right along the campground but don't let that overshadow your stay. This really is a nice campground and very reasonably priced.

Text: Scenery is great.  Charlie (host) is helpful.  There is an active train track, but not a problem for us.

Text: Bad thing first, it's no surprise, the train goes right through the campground. It's loud. Everything else about this campground is great. It's small, it's cheap, it has great facilities, and it has a fantastic host!
