Andrea's Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Our first night as a married couple was blessed beyond measure by the amazing hospitality, gorgeous home and delicious breakfast!
This place is stunning and so homey!
We arrived very late (after midnight), but were still greeted with a smile and the warmest welcome!
We stayed in the Windsor room.
Our room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was SO comfy.
The breakfast was fantastic!
We loved our stay at Andrea's so much that we've decided to make it a new tradition, so we'll be back soon.   :)

Text: I would recommend making reservations elsewhere. We left several messages for over (1) week with no return phone call. Specifically mentioned looking to have a question or two answered and looking to make reservation for an upcoming weekend. After another final attempt at phone call..got machine again left message and finally got a call back..we weren’t comfortable with response we were given. We ending up making a reservation very easily at Deer Creek State Park Lodge.

Text: This is absolutely the best bed and Breakfast I've ever stayed at. Susan was a wonderful host and very accommodating, the room was super clean and the bed was comfortable. There was wine available in the evening and snacks and also the breakfast was very homemade and wonderful. This is the best place to stay if you ever go to London Ohio.
