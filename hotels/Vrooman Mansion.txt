Text: We had our wedding reception at the mansion and the bridal party stayed upstairs after the event. The venue is gorgeous and the rooms were beautiful. The best part of having our reception at the Vrooman was the staff. Tricia and the entire staff were so helpful! They were accommodating and so on top of everything! The staff took care of all setup and clean. Our leftover food  and cake was boxed up and ready to go the next day at checkout. They more than exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be back! Thank you!

Text: If you are looking for a wedding venue that has charm, character and elegance you should stop now and call the Vrooman Mansion.  We held my daughter’s wedding there over Memorial Day weekend and it was phenomenal.

The Grounds:  The landscaping is lush and well-manicured.  We had an outdoor wedding for about 90 people so the ceremony was on the grass.  The grounds are large enough that we could also erect a 40x40 foot tent.  Even after that there was room enough so guests could just wander.  There is an outdoor fireplace and a small garden as well.  All beautifully done and picture perfect.

The Mansion:  Historic with great character.  Our family stayed in the mansion for the weekend which was great so we could all be together.  There are five rooms in the mansion and they are all very nice.  It is an old house so it creaks and there are not plugs every few feet etc. but again if charm and character are important to you then you can’t go wrong.  Picture claw foot tubs and gorgeous poster beds.  Their maximum capacity for a wedding is about 100 and there is room in the main house to hold the ceremony indoors – it would be lovely as the bride could enter by descending down an absolutely stunning staircase.

The Carriage House:  This is a separate building on the grounds with a downstairs sitting room and half bath as well as a small kitchen (fridge, sink, and microwave – no stove).  Beautifully appointed and cozy.  The Carriage House suites are the equivalent of a Five Star hotel – gorgeous (and I mean gorgeous) bathrooms in each suite and lovely antiques throughout.

The Staff:  The owners Pam and Dana are amazing and the inn keeper Trish is fantastic.  Every staff member we encountered was wonderful – they truly cared about you having a great experience.  Trish also acted as a wedding coordinator on the wedding day and things ran beautifully.  Breakfast is included with your stay and the food is incredible.  

Conclusion:  Five Stars – location, charm and character, incredible staff, beautiful grounds.  A charming and wonderful place for an intimate wedding.

Text: We celebrated our first wedding anniversary at this gorgeous bed and breakfast. We got a tour of the mansion and the carriage house and every room is beautiful  and wonderfully restored. We stayed in the carriage house - very private and well-appointed. Breakfast was delicious in a lovely room. Thank you for a comfortable and memorable stay!
