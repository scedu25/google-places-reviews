Text: The 2 stars are for the amazing bed and the nice pool. Check in was at 3, we arrived at 4 only to be told our room wasn't cleaned yet. So we waited 40 minutes in the hallway for our room. The air condition wouldn't go to cold, and I checked the filter - which was clean. So until about 3am we ran the air with the window open. My son dropped my phone behind the bed and it took us forever to get it because the bed wasn't able to move much. We moved yhe mattress and found a huge amount of white powder behind the bed which made my hands tingle when I tried getting my phone. At check in, the desk clerk was rather rude when I tried to joke with him about football teams, and it wasn't until he checked us in that he said the room wouldn't be ready. The breakfast was actually amazing! Waffles, biscuits and gravy, sausage, eggs, toast, muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt, bagels and more! This desk clerk who checked us out was SUPER nice. My advice is don't expect to check in on a Saturday on time, because I think there are only 2 housekeepers and they work together in the rooms so it takes forever to clean all the rooms!
