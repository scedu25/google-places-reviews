Text: My stay was more than I expected. I always worry these days about foreign ownership of hotels. My experience has been foreign owned are dirty. I was pleasantly surprised! Clean, every room I entered was clean. The pool and hot tub was a sweet treat after a long day. Than you Crwon Point!

Text: This was a horrible experience. Room 109. King "suite". Has leaks all along the exterior wall above the windows. The mud tape is peeling from the walls, ac hardly worked, humidity was atrocious. Room smelt like a hamster cage. Carpets need to be changed, hard bed, old pillows, and the curtains look like a cat shredded them. 

We paid an incredible price for this "suite". It is disgusting. Also, warn people when they book a room how loud the stairs, doors, and hallways are. There's no elevator. I literally heard someone fart in the hallway and someone above my bathroom peeing. Hotel made of the toilet paper they serve you. I also would appreciate if ANYONE at the desk would get up off their ass and tell children/adults not to scream in the halls from 12pm-4am.

Farmington sucks.

Text: Well worth the drive from St. Louis. Great layout, no two holes alike. You will hit every club in your bag. Always in tremendous condition, greens roll true. My favorite course in Missouri.
