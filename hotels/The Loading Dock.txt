The Loading Dock
Rating: 5
Text: Good simple menu. We all walked out stuffed. The lemonade is good. There is nice bike parking but you have to ride through a small grain gravel lot to get to it. Fantastic view and a great stop along the river road. It was crazy packed on the third of July with zero spots open.

Text: Everything about the loading dock is just right. Tasty food, music, and crowd. Excellent service. Great atmosphere. But nothing can top the location, right on the river. Beautiful!!! You get a lovely outdoor experience, guaranteed to lift your spirit. I really appreciate that they've designing their establishment to withstand floods, and they're always the first to open back up, as if nothing happened.

So we moved closer to the main stage and Mandy was fantastic never let my glass stay empty.. Great atmosphere and great subdue type of crowd for a Live band... Will be going back

Text: Fun spot on the river. Typical bar food. Wait staff is good. The day I was there, there was a live trio playing retro rock and roll. Check the hours before you go as they may change for the season.
