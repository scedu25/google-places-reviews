Text: This is a great little place for your family. Nice little pool for the kid. Beautiful lake with white sand beaches. We come back year after year.

Text: We found this hidden gem 3 years ago. Been every year since. Have no idea why a lot of the reviews talk about the road. Most is paved now. A little out of the way but well worth the drive. Only 3 miles from Van's campground but a lot better. The restaurant is charming and the staff is amazing.

Text: Not sure, did you know you were suppose to call for reservations between may and September, long drive out and back for nothing.  Looked like an excellent locales only hang out?
