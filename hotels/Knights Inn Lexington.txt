Text: This was terrible. Rooms are dirty. The bathroom sink was falling out. Carpets are gross. It is the end of May and the pool is not open. Also there was no breakfast as advertised. I do not recommend this place at all.

Text: This place is terrible. The sheets had burn holes in them, the tub was dirty and the wallpaper peeling. There was mold in the bathroom. The place looked nothing like what was advertised on the website.

Text: Comfy place clean couple cigarette burns in the blanket but I did ask for a smoke room. Sprayed my hot tub down and the whole room with Lysol just to be on the safe side.
