Text: Large, clean rooms. Front desk was very nice when I checked in. Fresh coffee and a sweet treat COOKIES. Travel a lot and sometimes the hotel don't have fresh coffee and fresh cookie. But ok really clean.

Text: Right off I-70. Night manager was nice & welcoming. Room was clean. Pool looked clean & did not smell strongly of chlorine despite being in the middle of the building. Shower pressure was awesome! Soaps were nice & did not dry out my sensitive skin. Lots of clean towels. Fridge & microwave in the room. Beds were very comfortable. Breakfast buffet was well stocked, hot breakfast & waffle maker; coffee was good but the carafe was not very efficient. Would recommend!

Text: Ambience makes one feel comfortable. Stairway at entrance makes one feel at home - like just going upstairs.  Kid friendly.  Indoor pool. Offers breakfast. Beds are firm with clean linens. Pillows are small and  need updating. Bathrooms are clean with no chipped or broken tiles, etc. Staff are professional.

Text: Great hotel. Right off 70/470 with lots of restaurants nearby. Pool and hot tub was great after a long day on the road. Room was big and beds were comfortable. Lots of choices for the free breakfast. Only issue - fire alarm went off twice at three in the morning which wasn't their fault, but a little annoying. Nice to know that it woke me up though. Would recommend.
