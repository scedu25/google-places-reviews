Text: Can't have three cars despite big lot. Can't have unapproved curtains in windows. Can't have kids play outside by rock everyone else plays at. Can't have kids be "loud", can't walk dog, can't have a certain amount of guests... what can you have?

So many tiny idiotic rules about this dumpy trailer park. Neighbors are EXTREMELY nosey and just about everything you do they twist it around into something bad and tell the manager of the park. Glad I'm only here a month... I would not and would never recommend this Cabrini green of trailer parks to anyone! Trashy people, trashy park, trashy trailers. Only the trashiest of jackson live here. That is why its located outside town. lol

Text: It's a crappy place and you can't do anything here, and your lucky that you can ride your bike.The creppy workers always watch you and there a bunch of kids who are trouble makers. The rules are a joke and they yell at you if your grass is a centimeter higher than what they want it to be. Most of the trailers here are dumpy so there's no point in making it nice. All the snitches are watching and ready to call the park manager.

Text: Lived here for three years never have heard of rent being raised under a lease anyway no way for them to raise rent can charge you for late payment but other words nice peaceful place besides annoying small dogs barking. Very strict on the things you can have in your yard but that makes it nice not to live next to nasty people.
