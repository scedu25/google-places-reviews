Text: We had a great stay in the efficiency cabins at Little Farm on the River. I was hesitant based on the reviews but knew this establishment was under new ownership this summer and decided to give it a try. I am very glad we gave this place a try.

Upon arrival, the cabins were clean. 2 out of the 3 efficiency cabins were beside the pond and one large cabin located next to it. Our visit was during the week but it was very quiet and the people whom were talked to were very pleasant. 

Amenities:
*Clean, Olympic-sized Pool
*Camp Store
*Club House
*Pond for fishing (and releasing)
*Miniature Golf
*Basketball Court

Efficiency Cabins Included:
*Running Water
*Toilet & Shower in the Bathroom
*Futon Bed
*Set of Bunk Beds
*Microwave
*Refrigerator
*Toaster
*Dishes
*Small Television
*Towels for the Bathroom & Wash Towels
*Bed Linens
*Small, outdoor charcoal grill
*Picnic Tables
*Small fire ring made of rock at each site.

Recommendations of What to Bring:
*Pillow (pillows are supplied but own pillow for comfort)
*Hand Soap
*Outdoor Table Cloth
*Shower Supplies (soaps)
*Bug Spray & Fly Swatter

Advantages:
*Clean, Outdoor Swimming Pool (Unlike previous reviews, the pool was very clean except for a corner of one step.
*Grounds keepers pick up garage left beside the roadways.
*Friendly staff
*No parking permits
*Small playgrounds

Disadvantages:
*Limited hours for camp store (weekdays)
*Club House closed when store closes due to vandalism at the camp
*Bunk Bed mattresses are very thin.

Bottom Line: 
I would recommend Little Farm on the River to anyone who is looking to spend a few days camping. RV Rentals and personal RVs/Campers are welcome at the campground. 

The owners of the campground are working to fix it up. They still have some work to do but are making progress based on other reviews I have read.

Text: Trailer park top loop. Bottom area by ohio river private, quiet, open and somewhat similar to a state park with its scenery and solitude. Unfortunately little farm on the river campground office mgt crams the amazon camper work force night workers at the top loop where a lot of seasonal reside which inevitably leads to lots of noise while the amazon workers attempt to sleep during the day. Roads are atrocious though they attempt to fill them with gravel. Nice veterans day celebration over the weekend with fireworks. Which was neat. Per their website  I think they charge for weekend hay rides and mini golf which seems unnecessary given their abnormally high camping rates. Seems that the people that do return all know each other, so feels like a clique, but it is what it is. Verizon 4g strong. At&t weak. Wifi didn't work for me.

Text: They are under new management!  They are fixing it up. The campground were well mowed. They cleaned the pool every morning and night. The bathroom were clean except on the weekend. I would definitely recommend this campground. If you want lots with good shade you want to get a lot in the first campground not the one by the river. Hope it keeps going in the direction it is going!

Text: We camp at Little Farm all the time , we have never had a issue I did cancel a reservation once and it never got to the right person . Liz took care of it for me other than that we love it there. Never had a problem with the staff or any campers. We try to rescept the other campers , but we do not go to bed at 11oclock we have out music on haven't had a complaint yet! Roads do need some TLC and some of the sewer pipes are busted . We will continue to camp regularly close to home and very convenient.
