Best Western Annawan Inn

Text: Continental breakfast was above and beyond what we expected. Rooms were clean and comfortable but a little dated appearance wise. Staff was friendly for the most part. The outdoor pool was closed with no update as to when it would be open during our stay.

Text: The staff is fantastic, but facilities are showing their age.  Exercise room needs an upgrade and pool is closed.  

One really good diner in town.

Text: Disappointing. No one available at front desk -ever. Management never took responsibility (gave my reservation to another guest, and charged another guest for room that was prepaid are just 2 examples). When confronted about mistakes, he was argumentative and placed blame on our guests. He was caught in several discrepancies (lies) throughout the weekend. Management cannot be trusted! Be careful when booking banquet room. Keep a copy of all receipts. You will need them for when mgr calls after event to tell you that you still owe him!

Text: Nice clean hotel. Very quiet.  Could use a bit better breakfast but that's not how we pick where we stay.
