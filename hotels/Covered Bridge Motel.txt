Text: Phil and Amy are wonderful! We've stayed there the past several years for the Covered Bridge Festival. The rooms are cute and always clean. Convenient location for the festival. All around wonderful, I would recommend the Covered Bridge Motel to anyone.

Text: Highly recommend it! The staff is kind. The rooms are clean and warm. No need to eat out if you're not much on food like me with a full refrigerator freezer and microwave oven. (the Shopko has anything else you need for $19.99 ?) I could honestly live in this space with 3 additions...a very large bedroom closet, a linen closet and a dresser. There's already room for 2 of those, just need about 8' x 8'ish more space for a closet...hehe. I'll definitely concider returning to the Covered Bridge Motel if I visit Rockville in the future.
