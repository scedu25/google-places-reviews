The Gallery Inn

Text: We loved it here. 

We stayed in the Green Room. Only knock on it is that your sink is outside the bathroom. 

The owners have done a nice job of decorating throughout the inn. There's a nice deck on the side of the building that's great for sitting and watching the world go by with a glass of wine. 

The owners live off-site, but have a caretaker of sorts who lives in the basement apartment.
