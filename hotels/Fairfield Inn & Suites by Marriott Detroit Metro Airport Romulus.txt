Text: The hotel itself was very nice. But the customer service was not. We had two rooms and we needed extra towels, we called Dawn at the front desk and she was incredibly rude and told us "1. I'm the only one here I'm not leaving the desk. 2. We are out of towels in the whole hotel". How do you run out of towels? And why was she so rude? She didn't apologize or anything. Very sassy.

Text: The staff was lovely. Delicious and healthy breakfast that's steaming hot. Largw variety of selection as well. Bed was clean and comfortable. I only stayed one night but was highly satisfied. 8/10 would come again.

Text: Nice place to stay overnight given it's proximity to the airport. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Cleanliness was great. Rooms are a bit small and some of the features could use updates. Breakfast offered a nice spread of options. Beds and pillows were both comfortable.

Text: The lady at the desk in the morning was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience.  The rooms and breakfast were great.

Text: Great hotel near the airport with clean comfy beds. I like that I can walk to a few places for dinner and also get an early shuttle service to for my flight out in the morning.
