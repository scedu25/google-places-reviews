Text: The rooms were nice. There were no elevators and we were on the second floor. However, that was my fault for not asking enough questions when I booked it. My only complaint was the heater/ air conditioner wasn't working. We had to have the door open to cool too if at night when we got in. Otherwise it was good service. Free Breakfast was good.

Text: I wasn't staying at the hotel much and was really just looking for a place to sleep so this was just fine. I was able to bring my dog which was a huge plus. The gentleman that checked me in was very friendly and even made some suggestions for what to do in the area. The only downside was that the bathroom was a little small and my towels didn't get changed after the first night so I had to go to the front desk to ask for some.

Text: Had a place for us and even ran cards to find us a room. Service by staff was awesome. That said, there was a drunk trying to get into our room for the first half hour we were there. Nothing violent, but he was standing there inserting and reinserting his card every few minutes.

Text: The rooms are always great.  But this time,  my bathroom door locked me in - without locking the door!!  Thankfully enough  had family  ?  with me to open door from other room... Otherwise not sure how long i would have been there.

Text: Tge pool and lounge area was really great, fantastic live music.  The lobby was comfortable. However, air conditioning was not good, the room felt damp and smelled like mold. Location is great. The bed was not comfortable, the blankets were threadbare.  Staff were very friendly. Waffles in the morning were excellent. It wouldn't be my first choice of hotels but it is a good back up plan.
