Text: Holiday Inn-Airport South was very clean. The staff was friendly. The bed was super comfy. And the free breakfast was excellent. We would stay there again.

Text: The room was nice but the was construction going on next door at 7 in the morning. Nothing like bulldozers and backhoes beeping as they back up every 5 minutes. The server at breakfast the next day was very nice.

Text: The first room we were assigned hadn't been cleaned but the situation was corrected quickly. Our new room's hair dryer did not work but again the staff was able to fix the problem right away. The in house restaurant didn't have vegan options for me to eat but were kind enough to let me bring some food to eat while my dining companion ate dinner there. So while there were some road bumps the staff was friendly and accomodating. Plus, it's only 15 minutes to drive to the downtown area!

Text: Clean and very quiet hotel. Bar and Grill had acceptable beer selection and great service. Food could be better.
