Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Deerfield
Rating: 3
Text: Decent enough rooms. Clean. Somewhat updated. Fuzzy, snowy satellite picture on the television. Decent building, no frills. Pool and exercise room on site, also clean and decent. No morning continental breakfast. No complimentary coffee for guests in the lobby. For the price point, Holiday Inn Express and the Hilton Embassy Suites make for a far better stay and are worth an extra $10-15 per night.

Text: I really like this hotel. The staff is always nice and welcoming, the room is clean and there is real hot water in the bathrooms (some hotels miss that). Heating and AC both work perfectly. And they have delicious breakfast options. :)

Text: Word to the wise ... do not book your reservation here if using an outside website to make your reservation. Front desk staff is rude, lack any customer service skill or knowledge, and very inattentive to any customer needs. Also, not exactly the most educated when it comes to credit card bureaus and investigative services.

3 weeks later, still no follow up about credit card hacking that was traced back to this hotel, and they continue to refuse to accept any responsibility. Had to make multiple calls, and all answers appear rehearsed and calculated. Don’t use your WiFi or personal devices here, your accounts and credit cards will be hacked. Better yet, don’t bother with this hotel.
