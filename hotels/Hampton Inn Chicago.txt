Hampton Inn Chicago
Rating: 3
Text: The rooms were small, but cozy and had almost everything you need (no fridge, but seems like fridges are becoming a rarity). The front desk was very helpful and friendly when asked for some bathroom supplies. They allow their AC to get pretty cold, but the issue in our room was that the fan was pretty loud in a grinding metal type sound. I was able to fall asleep, but my partner wasn't as lucky. The water pressure in the shower also wasn't the strongest and the bathroom was probably the most dated part of the room. I'd stay again if the value is right.

Text: Our first room assignment hadn't been cleaned by house keeping. When we walked in we thought someone else was staying in the room.
I blame management for that.
The second room the heater didn't work and the room was very cold.
I don't blame management for that. 
The third room was fine but smaller than the second.
The room was quiet clean and comfortable enough.

Text: Staff were extremely accommodating, very helpful. Room was clean and well laid out. Bathroom was a bit small, but seeing as I didn't spend a lot of time there, that wasn't a big deal. For a Hampton, very happy with the experience.
