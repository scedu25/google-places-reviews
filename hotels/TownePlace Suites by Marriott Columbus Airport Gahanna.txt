Text: Clean and friendly. Convenient to grocery store and restaurants. If you're staying here try kindred artisan ales around the corner for great beer and food. Very convenient and friendly there!

Text: We were on a trip to see my son and we were bringing the family dog with us. TownePlace was very accommodating. The rooms were the perfect size and very clean. I did however, need to request sheets for the pullout sofa sleeper as there were none provided.

Text: Waited for 58 minutes for the hotel shuttle service from the airport. Rude front desk staff Latoya. She needs to be learn how to handle customer service issues. She was not helpful, truthful, and down right rude. I even tried to speak to her in person about my frustration and explained why I was upset. I even told her I was sorry if I was upset. Funny I was telling her I was sorry and she still didn't know how to handle it. I never heard that she was sorry for the delay or did she thank me for trying to reach out to her on the matter. The hotel itself is average at best. Shady people staying there. The smell of pot in the hallway is very classy. The dishes in the room were in need of cleaning before I used them. I would do my best to avoid this property if at all possible.

Text: Nice place, friendly people. Remote control was missing from one of the bedrooms. Toilet paper that was on the roll was practically empty with about 3 pieces left. Other roll was in the dressing area. Nice place, but I've had better for the price.
