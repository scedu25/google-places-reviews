Whittington Woods Campground

Text: Beautiful and clean Campground! Very well maintained. Only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is the bathhouse needs to be updated. No heat in the building, lukewarm water at best and timed push button to get the water going. Thumbs down on that experience.

Text: One of our favorite RV campgrounds. Good sized sites, many with full hookups and lots of pull-thru sites. There is a nice, strongly fenced dog exercise area. And the chickens and ducks that are often wandering in the front of the park give the place a whimsical feel.

Text: The park was very clean and seems to attract campers that are very respectful. However since they do not take deposits on their spots people will reserve a spot then not come and use it. It was sad to see so many open spots on a holiday weekend. We had some friends that wanted to camp but when they called for a reservation they said they were completely full. There were 4 spots directly beside that ended up vacant.

Text: Incredibly kind owners!   We stayed during eclipse weekend when everything in whole area was packed, but they were still accommodating and so hospitable!  They didn't jack up prices like most places, their little store had low prices and was well-stocked.  Pool was great, the campground was beautiful, and guests here were quiet and pleasant. 

Great place to stay!!!!

Text: This place is fantastic! For the holiday weekend they had a lunch served on Saturday and then handed out ice cream on Sunday afternoon to camp guests! Super clean, well maintained, clean pool,  and very nice people. Very children friendly, our kids loved the playground and pool! Beautiful scenery, cool wooden carved statues, fun chickens, and incredible flowers.  They have a awesome little shop set up if you need anything.  This place is set up perfect. The only note to other campers to be aware of is you have to request a fire ring and it must be on rocks so it makes space a little tight to enjoy camp fired, ( fire ring was a necessity for us since we have a pop up camper) however you do know this in advance so you can set up camp accordingly. This place is a hidden GEM! Can't wait to come back.
