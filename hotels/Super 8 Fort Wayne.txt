Text: Clean room. Extremely courteous staff. Nice shower. This is an old building with flaws but I'm not the type who thinks I'm better than anyone else. Pool was nice for a lil swim. Chinese place within walking distance was delicious with friendly staff. I was very satisfied with my stay.

Text: Visited my husband who was staying here while working. Rooms were a very good price, but had a musty smell. Staff was very friendly. Good breakfast. Great location.
