Text: They accommodated my family and I at every turn. Anytime I had an issue they had a resolution. I even made a horrible booking issue and booked it for the wrong date. An employee named Joshua made it right for us, even though it was my mistake and he absolutely did not have to. I am so grateful, it made our trip. There are also great Pokemon at this hotel.

Text: I checked in, sat my things in the room then went down to the restaurant.  Upon walking in the restaurant i revieved a phone call that tragedy had struck my immediate family. I notified the front desk who assured me they would refund my money. Once out of the hotel they refused to refund.  I will never stay at ANY RAMADA again!

Text: Blood stains plus hair on the bed sheets makes you question cleanliness here. I agree with past reviews about street/airplane noise. Thankfully only here 1 night. The staff was friendly enough so 2 stars instead of 1.

Text: The hotel offers good value for the price. The king rooms are large and have a seating area where I read a new book while looking out my window at the big tree in back
