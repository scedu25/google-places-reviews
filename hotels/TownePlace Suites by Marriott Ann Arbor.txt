TownePlace Suites by Marriott Ann Arbor
Rating: 5
Text: Great, friendly staff. Rooms are newly remodeled, modern and clean. Comfy beds, cute polka dot shower curtain. Complimentary breakfast was ok- eggs were rubbery and bland. Waffles were yummy and lots of baked goods. Lots of parking and nearby shuttle service to the football game.

Text: We used points to stay in a suite with a king size bed. The run was clean and very comfortable. Housekeeping was flexible and accommodated our request that they come back later. Staff was very friendly. Location was nice, near the highway but quiet. With a mall across the street, it was easy to pickup up the shirt I forgot to bring for the wedding we were attending.

Text: This property was amazing! Super clean inside and out. Staff was also extremely courteous. I thought from the look and smell that ut was brand new, but it was 5 years old. Will stay here again on my next trip to Ann Arbor!

Text: We recently stayed at Towne Place because it was very close to a family reunion we were attending and they allowed dogs. The room was very clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. We would stay there again if we are ever in that part of MI again.
