Text: We booked a two full bed smoking room over two months out. When we arrive they tell us they have a single king size bed no smoking. Three grown men so they offer a pull out bed at no charge like they we're doing us a favor for not charging us for it.  They booked our room and continued to hassle us about it. Couldn't cancel the room without an $87 fee.  Look elsewhere if you can. Breakfast was decent

Text: I liked the location. It's very convenient. It's by plenty of restaurants and gas stations. We had a king suite. Which I wasn't very impressed with. We cane here to have a nice getaway without getting away. So we got a room with a Jacuzzi. The cold water was a trickle, so the water was too hot to really enjoy. Our sink was clogged so we had to get someone to fix it. They left the carpet wet with no warning. There was a small selection at breakfast, which also wasn't very good.

Text: Dump, this place is a dump. The prices for rooms reflects this. We stayed here a year ago and it was nice.  This hotel has went downhill quick in that year. Not a place to bring your family and that's all I'm going to say about that.

Text: Cancelled my booked reservation well in advance of stay.  Hotel charged me anyway. Contacted them and they said management would contact me in a week.  Almost three weeks and still no call.  Contacted management company.  They indicated I would get a call within a week.  Still no call. Still on my card. This is not a reputable company and if this is the way you all do business I would not suggest anyone book or stay here.  They have had plenty of time to resolve this and have not.  Looking into an attorney now.

Text: I absolutely fell in love with the staff. Especially the man who drives the shuttle and everything else he does. They made my stay so comfortable with my broken ankle. I would love to come back.
