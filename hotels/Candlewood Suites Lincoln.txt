Candlewood Suites Lincoln
Rating: 4
Text: Union arrival late evening the bathroom was flooding. Front desk was helpful during my two week stay. During my stay the lobby and laundry area was being renovated. Rooms were being repainted. No breakfast but kitchenette made it easy to buy local and prepare it yourself. Dishwasher, microwave and refrigerator made it feel like it was home away from home. Living area and bedroom was adequate. Small TV's and wifi were well below par. Overall staff was friendly and very helpful. Would stay again with corporate rate.

Text: Nice hotel, friendly staff. Room was clean but needed several cosmetic repairs that detracted from the overall look. The recliner in our room was broken (wouldn't close) and was never repaired while we were there.

We did like the Candlewood Cupboard! Great idea and we used it several times. Overall, a good hotel and we will stay again next time we're in the area.

Text: We stayed there for my brothers wedding. We had several rooms. They were doing construction while we stayed there.  Not very convenient for wheel chairs and walkers. Also some chairs and irons did not work in all rooms.  I have stayed at other Suites and they had free breakfast, this place does not. This was close to things we needed.
