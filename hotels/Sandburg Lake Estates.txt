Text: Landlords are terrible along with the people who actually own the lots. They refuse to sell lots to you, and do not enforce rules (even themselves break them) that are outlined in the contract you sign to live out here. Lot rent has skyrocketed since we've moved out here to near triple. Paying in excess of near $300 in lot rent, which is now lump summed with water due to some dumb new contract with the city. The lake never gets cleaned so near impossible to fish in it.

Residents had large dogs that attacked a woman, some lots are too close to each other, water gets shut off (to nearly all lots) without warning to fix a single lot's water issue, regardless they all have their own mains that can be controlled. The landlord is a drunk along with her boyfriend that drives around here intoxicated and without a legally issued driver's license. Phone and cable lines are buried so no maintenance could have been done on them in 10+ years. The actual owners have no clue of state property values, or laws.

There is zero redeeming factor to live, or continuing to live out here. You can buy a house for nearly the same amount rent is out here, and you actually own your land, and not be forced to pay lot rent the rest of your life...

Text: The landlord is an alcoholic. She drives the trailer park roads intoxicated. So if you have kids I would not recommend moving out here.
