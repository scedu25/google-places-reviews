Fire Lake Camper Park

Text: My favorite place to go 5 seasons and counting. The owners keep the place in A-1 condition, are there to help, approachable, easy going, and have passion for the people and facilities. The owners bring in live music, DJ, coordinate cookouts, activites for the kids-young and old, customer parties....... I recommend this place all the time. You have a greater opportunity enjoying your camper every day, every weekend, every month...

Text: Very nice family oriented campground. We had out camper there in a permanent site for 7 years. Only reason we left was because we didn't have time to enjoy it anymore.

Text: Couldn't get a spot after staying for years of tractor pulls...what gives?!  Was told all the spots were given to a highway crew? I hope the road crew comes back year after year, cause I won't come back!
