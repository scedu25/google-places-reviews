Travelodge-Florence/Cincinnati South
Rating: 3
Text: Friendly staff. Breakfast not kept stocked. Building needs maintenance. Room was decent. Bed very hard not comfortable at all only had a sheet and very thin decorative throw on bed. No blanket. Could use a deep clean. Bathroom ceiling starting to mildew needs better ventilation. Hairdryer sparked and quit working. Oddly toilet paper holder is about five inches from floor. Bathrooms definitely need updated but water pressure was good and temperature stayed hot. All linens were nice and clean. Prices are too high for the quality in my opinion.

Text: Basic accomodations for fair price. Clean but smells like smoke. Decent location. The evening desk clerk was very friendly and helpful.

Text: We stayed in room 203. Ac didn't work at first...handy husband was able to get it working...not very clean in hallways and room. Our peephole was broken so people could see into our room! Would not recommend.

Text: My first impression was dingy.  The outside and the interior corridor are certainly past their prime.  But the room itself was clean and up to date, so don't give up on first appearance. It was worth the money I saved. The staff was friendly.
