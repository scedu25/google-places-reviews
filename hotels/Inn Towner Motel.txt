Text: I love coming here. Its not very often, about once a year, but every time we do stay here its always clean. The staff is very friendly, especially the nice lady at the front desk. She is always willing to help you and is very courteous. The hotel is also in a great location in town. I always enjoy coming here and hope this place has many, many more wonderful years to come. It is definitely worth the stay. Its a cheap price per night.

Text: People were nice, price was cheapest in the area. Rooms were out of date (which was expected and fine) and a little smelly and quite dusty (not expected and not enjoyable). Good place if you just need as cheap as place as possible for the area, but don't expect much.

Text: We stayed there this past weekend. If you are looking for an affordable clean place to stay near all the parks then this is perfect. Nothing fancy by any means but it served us perfect for a couple of nights

Text: We came down from Toledo for a friend's college graduation party and wanted a place to stay in town. For $55 a night, this was a good place to stay with clean rooms and friendly service. Only complaint would be that there are only two pillows per bed and showerhead is a bit low. Not fancy in the least and no wifi,  but what do you expect for that price?

Text: If you want to pay to stay in a jail cell come here. Where do I start. No phone,fridge,shampoo,alarm clock. I seriously don't see how this place is open it's just so badly run down.
