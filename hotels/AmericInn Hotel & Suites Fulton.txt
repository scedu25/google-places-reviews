Text: This place was amazing! First making the reservation the lady on the phone suggested that I do a deal that brings in a can of food for a cheaper room so I did that. Then I get there we go in the room it's gorgeous it's nice and clean and I own a cleaning business so I checked everything. Then my husband our one year old son and I go down to the pool the hot tub was closed and then so will like whatever no big deal so we went into the pool and it was cold. My husband went to the front desk which happened to be the general manager of the hotel and told him that it was cold and ask them to turn up the pool heat he came in and reset everything so that way it would turn it up a little bit and without even asking he volunteered to refund our hotel room stay. Then we went back to our room we ordered some food with the list at the hotel front desk had sitting right there along with the list of attractions around the area we didn't have to ask for the list. We ordered a pizza from  one of the suggestions on the list  we realize that are portable high chair that we bought for our child would not fit on the chair in the room  to secure him safely in  so my husband went down to the front desk and asked if we could borrow one of their high chairs from The Breakfast area  and the manager said go ahead  just bring it back when you come down for breakfast in the morning . The bed was comfortable the pillows were comfortable everything in the room worked we needed a microwave to warm up our baby's bottles our room did not have a microwave so the general manager himself carried a microwave from another room to ours. We also needed an extra blanket to put in my son's pack and play so it was softer for him to go to sleep there was no hassle we got that right away as well. The next morning went to went to breakfast there was eggs, burritos, sausage, yogurt with fresh fruit, cereal, individually cart and packaged milk, the breakfast area was perfectly clean the lady doing the breakfast was amazing. And everything was delicious. This was by far our best hotel stay in the any hotel and we travel a lot. All the staff was wonderful the room was beautiful and clean and even the manager went out of his way to make our stay great. I will most definitely be coming back here we weren't in the area for anything specific just to have a day away and I will most definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.

Text: After spending two nights there going outside in the cold to smoke, they charged us $50 extra and claim we smoked in the room. I tried explaining to the rude man at the front desk some smell could have come in on our clothes or something but he insisted that we smoked in he room. We’re not stupid, we didn’t, but I guess they just charge anyone with no proof at all. Basically calling me a liar over the phone, just kept repeating “you smoked in the room” “no we didn’t?” “Yes you did”
We will never stay at any AmericInn again if this is how they treat people.

Edit: I don’t know how to delete a review but I just got a call from the very nice front desk manager. She apologized and they’re removing the charge from our account. Changing the stars from 1 to a 5 because honestly everything else about the place was just fine.

Text: Michelle is amazing.  I'm not sure what her title is, but she did everything for me including check in, recommend local businesses whos services I was looking for, and even toss me a smoke that she personally paid for.  Above and beyond customer satisfaction.  If I'm ever in need of a hotel in these parts, will definitely come back here.

Text: Nice clean hotel, courteous staff too. In my opinion the best hotel in the Fulton area. Close to Clinton Iowa, and savanna Illinois too.

Text: Stayed 2 months with my family of 5 due to water damage. Very kind people. Great housekeeping. Very understanding of 3 young children stuck in a small area for such a long time. Would definitely recommend.
