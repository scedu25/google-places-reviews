Text: A great place for family and children can be a little rowdy on weekends. Most people very friendly and nice. Clicky with some but if that isn't important lots of great people.

Text: I get blame for stuff I did not do like last night I went fishing and we where a little loud and Shay said we where in one place but we only stay at one lot. And another one was for blaming me because I help a friend out and I get blame for it. ( I don't like it anymore) I been there since I was 2 or 3 I'm 14 now. So don't go there if you have a 13 or 14 year old boy or daughter
