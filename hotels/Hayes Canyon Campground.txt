Text: Outstanding Campground!  Even with the Eclipse, called on Sunday, he had opened up overflow tent campsites and was very accomodating, even delivered the load of firewood!  Wow, can't say enough nice things about the facility and the staff!  Wonderful time seeing the Eclipse without being crowded!  Would have loved to stay longer!  Highly recommend!!!

Text: Wonderful people,campground and trails. Shower house very clean. Laundry available. Flushable bathroom by campers also extremely clean. Office has ice cream treats plus a selection of RV and horse needs. Don't worry about firewood they can supply that also. As close as I could count approximately 35 or more pieces for 15.00. You can't get that at a convenience store. Guides available on request 15.00 per trip per person. Trails are very scenic and beautiful. We will return again.

Text: This has been our Go-to campground in Shawnee for the last 10 years or so,  VERY well run, VERY well kept. Great if you have a Living Quarters, as you have sewer hook up on the site.  Great if you don't have Living Quarter too: Bathrooms and showers are always clean.  Picnic tables, level parking pads, all sites have horse opens, some have covered stalls.  Ben and Patti are great folks and the Perminent campers are nice and friendly.  Wifi at the office: large deck with ample seating to relax while checking email and posting pics of the day's ride on Facebook.  

Great trails - some really pretty riding just a short ride from camp.  Access to Lusk Creek Wilderness area, Indian Kitchen, Peters cave and more
