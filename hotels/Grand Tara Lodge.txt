Text: Great place but they treat you like children.  Notes and rules everywhere.  Great for a large group...with kids, but they don't have to treat you like one.

Text: This place has everything you can think of and then some! Lots of stuff to do and lots of stuff for the kids. Very very clean and we'll kept. Located on a quiet road and not too far from town so everything is easy to get to. Grab food you will need from the store before you get there, because once your there, you won't want to leave! I have never been to a lodge that is so much fun and has so much entertainment, and I have stayed places from Maine to Florida. This is an amazing place for my family and im sure any other reasonable person would enjoy just the same.

Text: The photos of this lodge were deceiving. It is not nestled in the country. It is on a busy county road. From the minute you arrive, you are greeted with your first of MANY signs. It was the single most uncomfortable stay I have experienced. Not because it wasn't clean or stocked, but because there was a sign for everything. There is literally a sign telling you where you can poop! No lie.  I get that the owners may have experienced negative renters in the past, but why make our stay suffer? You have septic issues? Fix them. Had people ruin furniture? Keep their deposit. I counted over 30 signs - not including the multi page "welcome" book. I never felt welcome and will never return.  It also wasn't that clean with multiple beds and other furniture needing replaced.  And don't get me started on the "surveillance" equipment. Creepy.

Text: The person who posted the one star post hast to be a joke. I've been to the Tara lodge several times and have never experienced even one of the things that where mentioned. This is a VERY well kept lodge and I enjoy my stay every time.?
