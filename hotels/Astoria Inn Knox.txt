Text: I do not recommend!!
My husband and one friend was there for 3 nights. In the morning they noticed that the
friend had some red marks on the body. In the evening they found bed bugs under the box and matress. The third night they left, even though they had already paid.
They called and show to the owner and he sad that they brought it. Good way to apologize.

Text: If you like black mold and bed bugs in a filthy environment that stinks the moment you walk into the place then this rat traps is for you. It's a dilapidated over priced repugnant place.

Text: No frills, basic room. Comfortable & clean yet not a lot of attention to details.   Older but sturdy furnishings & decor.

Text: Needed a Hotel near Knox Indiana for 4th July weekend. Slept there Saturday. On Monday my wife and I noticed that are kids had red marks on their body. We found out that they were bed bug bites. I called to let the Hotel know and all I got from them was. "Sorry and Thank You for letting us know" I expected more for a $104 Room.
