Text: Great hotel! We stayed here the night before We ran the huff ultra marathon. We checked out and went to the race. Afterward we sorely needed a shower and they let us come back and shower for free. Such kind people!

Text: Out of date, mold in shower, they dont keep the heat on at all when room not in use, freezing. Took forever to heat the room! they placed a family with three kids directly above...sounded like they were playing dance revolution above me! We were the only two families in the hotel.

Text: I've stayed here no fewer than 15 times over two and a half years, always on purpose. I've never had a bad room, a bad time, lousy service, filth, or anything lacking that matters whatsoever. Through 3 changes of management, this remains a class act at affordable rates. An uncommonly safe neighborhood, modern construction, decent views, natural sounds (zero noise), a fine compliment of amenities, and a variety of businesses with walking distance await you. Poor reviews of this place seem absolutely absurd to me.  -Frequent Indiana (Salamonie) Traveller from Toledo, Ohio

Text: Everything looks alright when you first get into this hotel, then you lay down in the bed. Wallpaper peeling off the walls, flat brick pillows and a horrible mattress. I found dead bugs in my sheets and in the middle of the night had to go to housekeeping and get my own replacements and put them on. The towels are not plentiful or even nice, the shower drain was clogged and I will reiterate that the beds are uncomfortable. I will not stay here again, and I'd recommend that no one else does either.
