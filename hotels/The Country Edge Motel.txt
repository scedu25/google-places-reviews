Text: Stace Holford the "manager" is a THIEF & a CROOK!! I stayed there for a month in December, left it spotless- now it is JUNE and I'm still waiting for my security deposit that she says she credited & is the banks fault they have no record of it??  You certainly took the money off the debit card without any problem.  Stealing is illegal why does she keep getting away with this?  POLICE HELP US!

Text: Nice quiet country motel. Even has a outside grill for guests to use. Great rate on rooms. One of the few that actually offer a monthly rate

Text: Nice and quite. Rooms are clean.  Pizza shop is great and affordable.  Our only suggestion would be to up date the beds. And replace the flat flat pillows.

Text: This is a quiet and perfect place to sit back and relax. The rooms were small, but clean. It's not often you can sit outside your room with your door open and have a quiet relaxing evening. We even ate at the pizza king there, Indiana pizza is great! We will be back and often. Don't change a thing!

Text: Do not waste your time at this abomination they call a motel. If those rooms are remodeled, then I'd hate to see what they were before! Musty smell, water barely worked in my room, no cable, barely, if any, antenna signal. Internet DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, much less "perfectly." Don't let them feed you lies.  Bugs all through the rooms, and my bedframe was so shaky I took it off. Not to mention the disgusting way the owners acted towards me. Also really interesting they dont allow Facebook reviews...almost like they don't want people to know how they operate! I recommend Manor Motel :) oh and go ahead and call my review a lie, I guess every bad review is a lie right ? sad when you have to have your neighboring restaurant employees put a fake review to make your Google ratings halfway decent.
