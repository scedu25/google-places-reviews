Hampton Inn Kansas City-Liberty
Rating: 5
Text: This is my favorite place stay every year!! We host an adult Girl Scout conference at a local church but when we stay overnight this is the place stay. Friendly staff greet you,  comfortable bed, clean room, and yes breakfast-looking forward to making my Belgium waffle. Forgot great price, lots of restaurants and stores located near by. Try it out!!!

Text: Got a jacuzzi suite for 2 nights, the staff was friendly, they had fresh hot coffee and fruit infused water in the main lobby. Our room exceeded our expectations and was very comfortable and very clean. Free continental breakfast in the morning and the location is convenient. I would stay here again in the future.

Text: This is a nice, clean hotel. We stayed on the 4th floor by the elevators and I was concerned about the noise but it was quiet. The breakfast was decent with eggs both mornings but no other proteins. The hotel is right off the highway and within walking distance to multiple places to eat. I would stay here again.

Text: Overall clean hotel. For the cost I would have expected something nicer. The breakfast was not the greatest.
