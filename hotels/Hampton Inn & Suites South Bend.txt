Hampton Inn & Suites South Bend

Text: Overall, this is an excellent hotel when you can get the rooms at a reasonable price. Clean, comfortable, great breakfast, and even a pool! My only complaint is about the design/layout of the building itself. Honestly, what were they thinking when they placed the elevators at one end of the building, instead of centrally located? It's a crazy long walk (for being such a small hotel) if you get stuck in a room at the opposite end of the building from the elevators.

Text: Overall, the hotel was spacious and clean.  Please be aware of the posted breakfast hours.  The first morning I was a couple minutes late and ended-up in line with blue shirted hotel employees in front of me.  The hot food was gone when it was my turn. Frustrating.  The next morning, about 2 minutes after 10 the same thing happened.  The blue shirted employees line up and clean-up the remaining food as they quickly tear-down the breakfast bar, despite a full dining room.   
Seems like they could give the guests a little more time to finish up.

Text: For those of us who travel for a living, especially traveling entertainers, hotels like the Hampton Inn & Suites South Bend, IN is a welcome night's sleep. The staff is very accommodating to late hours check-ins and the room is very quiet and comfortable. There's a breakfast in the morning as well as a swimming pool and laundry room to utilize if you have the time to spend!

Text: It was nice. Room was clean and the bed was comfy. Didn't spend much time there so i can't say how the breakfast or pool was, but the room was good and I'd stay there again.
