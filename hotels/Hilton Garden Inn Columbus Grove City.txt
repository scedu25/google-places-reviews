Text: Good room. Everything clean and well equipped. Mine just had a weird smell to it, from a perfume from the previous guest maybe. Kind of intense but I did not complain since I was staying only one night. Otherwise great stay.

Text: This hotel was at the far end of a street with many hotels and a little hard to find but a very nice rest stop on the way. Ample parking with pull through space for a trailer. Small but nice indoor pool and gym. They even have a meeting area. Quick to get in and out for registration and this place was very close to some quick restaurants and gas. My only issues were that the food, while good, is over priced considering the Panera around the corner, and the air intake for the hallway is next to the smoking area, meaning the hall smells of smoke when someone is smoking outside.

Text: I like that the pool is open until Midnight! They have a 24 hour computer room here if you need to use the internet and didn't bring your laptop. I stayed here because they have a 12pm check out time which is perfect.
