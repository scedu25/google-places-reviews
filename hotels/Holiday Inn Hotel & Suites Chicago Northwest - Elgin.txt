Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Chicago Northwest - Elgin

Text: Worst experience ever! The hotel itself is nice enough, nothing over the top, but nice. The staff ,however, are the rudest people I've ever met! For people in the hospitality business, they made a few mistakes with billing, and other details, which is understandable. However, their attitude and arrogance was inexcusable. I'm not one to think if someone messes up their should be fired at all, but no one, including management would even apologize, let alone claim responsibility or try to correct any wrong doings. I literally had the owner of my Company who reserved the room for me for a conference all week call and ask what he could do to help! Maybe I just gave off a bad vibe, or had the crew who was about to quit, but I would rather sleep in my car than give that establishment any of my money. No the picture of the rat was not on their grounds..I wish it was though..

Text: The room was very nice and clean. Very spacious. Also loved the size and amenities of the bathroom. Really large clean tub, perfect for a long soak at the end of a long day. The breakfast here is ok so far, but nothing too amazing. That would be the thing that kept me from a 5 star rating. But the people are very nice and helpful. Even went out if the way to move my room closer to the elevator when they saw I was on crutches. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The beds were wonderful! The rooms are spacious, but each with independent temperature control through an ac/heater. If you stay there, you get a free breakfast in the morning, and it's actually not bad, with a selection of eggs, bacon, dumplings, muffins, cinnamon rolls, bread, and cereals. There's also a Bennigan's built into the hotel for lunch. The staff is polite, other than one of the cleaning staff.

Text: This is a great hotel that is conveniently located. The restaurant attached is okay but there are better options within walking distance. My room was clean and updated. I would stay here again.

Text: This is a surprisingly nice Holiday Inn. It was recently renovated so the carpet and rooms are in great shape. Also, the pool area is pretty fun for the little ones.

Parking is ample and the breakfast buffet is a pretty good value.

It definitely feels more upscale than your typical Holiday Inn and I'd be happy to come back here again.
