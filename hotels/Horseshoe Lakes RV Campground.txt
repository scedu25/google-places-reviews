Horseshoe Lakes RV Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Wonderful place for kids to roam.  Been coming for 3 years and have never felt unsafe.  Lots of trails to walk or golf cart on. Many lakes to fish on.

Text: This park has great potential, although the grounds are less than maintenanced because the maintenance man is retiring. The staff is non-existent, just don't care, or lie just to get you to stay until after you pay then they tell you nothing is working..  The mini golf court is falling apart, pool was not open and wifi had been down for 3 weeks,  Tennis courts are a disaster, the horseshoe pits are pathetic, was thinking about buying a pass or seasonal but after visiting the park don't think so.  It is a shame that these grounds are not taken care of, this could be an absolutely beautiful place.  Need golf cart rentals as everything is driving distance away unless you want to walk a lot. Gave a 1 star because of their lack of care of the park and the staff's less than acceptable level of care about their guests.

Text: We enjoyed our stay in this park.  We chose Loop B since it is the quiet side and has sites big enough to accommodate our 45' 5th wheel.  The A loop is supposedly "louder" and the sites and road are more suited to 36' or less RV's. There are multiple ponds and lots of green space here at the park.  We did notice that most of the park and the nicest sites are taken  by long term renters so that is why it loses 1 star.

Text: Very disappointed in this Thousand Trail campground. Over 70% of the campground is permanent folks. No 50 amp service for short time campers. Camp needs TLC. Would not come back.
