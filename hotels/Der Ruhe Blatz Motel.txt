Text: Clean Room that's about it. Continental Breakfast is a joke at best. Make sure you are charged correctly when you check in. My reservation clearly stated we had our pet with us. Got a call from the front desk about our pet.Charged $25 per night for our pet fee. Their website states $15 per night. Not run by Amish anymore. Rude Management. We would have been better off sleeping in our car. I will be staying at the Super 8 moving forward.

Text: Disappointed.  This is not an Amish hotel.  Manager was rude to my husband upon check in.  Breakfast to be served at 7 am.  We tried from 7 to 8 then finally the door was unlocked. No one to be found to assist at this hotel. An older man came in and kept ringing the bell and no one came to help him.  I went up and explained that no one had been out to help us since we had arrived.  We could have stayed at the Van Buren for $10 more.  :  (

Text: In laws stayed here a month to 6 weeks ago and brought home BED BUGS. I cannot begin to tell you the nightmare this has caused for our family. Not to mention over $2000 spent to get rid of them. Please beware! If I could give zero stars at this point I would!

Text: Th e people at the desk was very rude. They missed our check in date and had us down for Friday instead of Thursday as it was made very clear on the phone. We had to hunt for another room that night to stay in. Next day checked in there was a man camped just outside our door in a chair wouldn't move to allow us in our room so we had to go around him. Full size bed in room sucked not a queen as told. Upon check out had to leave early due to a family emergency. The guy at the desk was extremely rude. We will NEVER be back here ever again.  This place just plain sucks!
