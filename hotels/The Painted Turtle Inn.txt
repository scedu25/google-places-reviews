The Painted Turtle Inn

Text: My wife and I spent the 1st 2 days of our honeymoon here. Great place. Great food. Rooms are very nice. Felt as though they didn't like bikers very much although there were plenty all around the area for the holiday weekend, and we are very clean, quiet, respectful people. Only for that reason will we probably not return for our anniversary.

Text: This is our second time here and it's better than the first! Rooms are nicely appointed and very clean! Decorated nicely and plenty of amenities. Breakfast is served from 900 to 1000 AM and are creative and quite good. I highly recommend this place!

Text: This is as good as it gets regarding a B&B stay. The beautifully remodeled two story home is spotless clean & beautifully decorated. The food is magnificent. You can walk across the street to watch the sun set on beautiful Lake Michigan or hop in the car and be in downtown St. Joseph and/or Silver Beach in less than five minutes. Many renowned wineries and vineyards are a short drive away and ready for you to tour.

The proprietors are true professionals who are warm and engaging and yet perfectly sensitive to your desire for privacy. They accommodated our every need.

My wife and I enjoyed a weekend here with four other couples. We arrived in the early evening on a Friday and enjoyed a wonderful happy hour in the kitchen and living room. We decided to stay off the streets and enjoyed some great pizza from Silver Beach Pizza. The next evening we took advantage of the beautiful back porch by grilling steaks and sitting down to an engaging evening of great food and lots of laughing.

The breakfasts were stunning - worthy of a spread in a food magazine. The service was exceptional.

I could not have felt more at home and relaxed. This place is a gem. I highly recommend anyone give it a try. Perfect for a group of friends or for a nice romantic getaway with your sweetheart.

I can't wait to go back!

Text: Excellent accommodations. We typically stay at luxury hotels, but this was just as nice, only more personable. Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and served in the solarium--lovely view of the wildlife!

Text: I grew up with a fascination for turtles, so the recurring turtle placement - from the soap in the bathroom to the fixtures in the dining room and kitchen - was quite amusing.  The "Griffon" room was great.  Comfortable bed, large shower, and fancy tub.

The quality of the breakfast, and morning service, is what especially impressed me.  I suspect it may significantly change from day to day, but we enjoyed fresh fruit, multi-berry coffee cake, egg & ham cups, and English muffins with cappuccinos.  You'll be offered a wide variety of cold and hot beverages, while dining in front of a pleasant, wide-window view of trees, flowers, birds, and a fountain.
