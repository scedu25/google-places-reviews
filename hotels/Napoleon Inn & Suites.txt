Text: I had an incredible experience. The front desk employee went above and beyond for me. I attended a wedding about 4 miles away and was shuttled back to the hotel. Well in the morning I didn't realize there was no shuttle back and that there are no ubers or taxis. Well the employee, whose name sadly I don't remember, offered to give me a ride to my car. It was the best customer experience I have ever had.

Text: Nice clean room and facilities. Desk clerks were friendly and efficient, both at check in and check out. Continental breakfast left a lot to be desired. Scrambled eggs were awful and the sausage links were worse. Switched to bagels and cereal which were fine. Would stay here again but would make other plans for breakfast.

Text: One reason I hated it was the hotel instantly smelled like smoke and mold. There were stains on the hotel room carpet and the mini refrigerator had some sort of dried up orange liquid in the freezer. The only upside was the hotel staff was extremely nice and they tried to give me a room that was nice but unfortunately none of the rooms are nice.
I think if the hotel rooms get new carpet and fresh paint and new mattresses then the rooms would look a whole lot better.

Text: There was a cockroach stuck in the clock part of the microwave in our room. We told the front desk and they handled it extremely well. They were very apologetic and got us a new room on a new floor. Besides this incident, it was very clean (so I don't think that it's a systemic problem), the pool and hot tub were the perfect temperatures, and the staff was extremely friendly.
