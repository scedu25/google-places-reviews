Alexis Park Inn & Suites - Extended Stay
Rating: 5
Text: Hands down the best extended stay hotel I have ever stayed at! I travel for work so I stay at a lot of hotels. I stayed here for 6 months and have nothing but good things to say. The staff is excellent and goes above and beyond especially the assistant manager Austin. The rooms are clean and large, feels more like an apartment then hotel. As I write this I am in another extended stay hotel and missing my clean and much larger room in Iowa City as well as the great friendly staff. If I ever end up in Iowa City again I will defenitly stay here.

Text: This place was great! It was so clean! I have never stayed at a hotel this clean. The staff were amazing and accomidating to what we needed when we stayed there. If you are looking for a place in Iowa city to stay that's nice, clean, fairly renovated, and don't want to break the bank then choose this place!

Text: This is a basic hotel/extended stay place.  Staff are courteous. Rooms are comfortable but not fancy. Continental breakfast is instant oatmeal, dry cereal, sweet rolls/muffins, coffee, green tea, instant hot cocoa, milk. Rates are reasonable. Not  far from downtown or Hancher Auditorium.  Not sure whether it is on a bus route.

Text: We really loved this place. We stayed for an event that was happening in town, and saw this place online. I decided to reserve there. It was quite, and clean. We felt very comfortable. The rates were good for the area.
