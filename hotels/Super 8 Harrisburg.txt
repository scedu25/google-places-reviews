Text: if i could give it zero stars i would. DISGUSTING. my husband and i stayed here 2 years ago and we had no issues. we booked rooms here this past year and it was nothing like before. There was a cat meowing down by the front desk, toe nails on the bed, door handles broken, mold growing on the ceilings. we kept asking for a room to be moved and each room we went to got worse and worse.

Text: Smoking and non-smoking rooms arent segregated, so all public areas smell like smoke. If you're over 6ft tall, you'll see black mold growing on the top ledge of the shower. There was no outlet cover on the outlet right next to my bed - the lamp and alarm clock were plugged into this outlet. Friendly staff. Won't be staying here again.

Text: Seeing how there is only two hotels in Harrisburg it was okay for last-minute family emergency type thing. Just remember it's a 2-star hotel and you're basically getting what you pay for. I did not see no bed bugs or anything like that. My room was clean. However when I asked for extra pillows at the front desk they told me they don't have extra pillows so make sure you bring your own extra pillows if you need anymore then what is already on the bed. There is no air conditioning in the hallways were hot and human since it's like 90 degrees outside and has a little bit of a weird smell. Frigerator didn't work well. However they do get the Plus for having newer TVs in here so you can hook up your own Roku stick and the internet works okay. Not the most comfortable night's sleep but it definitely wasn't the worst place I've stayed in.
