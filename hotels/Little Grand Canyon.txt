Little Grand Canyon
Rating: 4
Text: Very cool place to go hiking. The lookout was a letdown, but if you keep going, you'll come to The Little Grand Canyon. Let me first state that this is an EXTREME hike. You'll want to take gear and water. There are very slippery rocks and a lot of places to fall and get hurt. I think there should have been a warning about it, but maybe I missed it while I was reading the signs. I do recommend doing it if you are capable. There was a lot of cool scenery and there aren't a lot of places like this to hike.

Text: Been here multiple times and love it! With a few off paths this is about a 3.5 mile loop hike. Somewhat difficult. Proper shoes are required to climb safely up/down the rocks. Can get very slick. Did find a water moccasin snake one time so be on the look out for those. Be sure to take the marked off trail for one heck of a view! The total trail with minimal gauking takes about 1.5 hours.

Text: The hiking trail was awesome. This is not your beginner’s hiking trail. You will need to be prepared. The rocks are slippery! A person in our group fell and slid 20 feet before stopping.

Text: This hike was very mediocre. The overall hike was steep with not much to look at until you reach the end with the creek. The trail itself was also very muddy and not maintained very well. We wanted to stop here on our way from St. Louis to Nashville as a fun stop in between, but it turned out to be a bit disappointing. The one highlight from the hike was that we saw lots of wildlife! We saw a snake, some sort of lizard, two frogs, beetles and more. The kids did enjoy that.
