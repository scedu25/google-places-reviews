Guest House Motel
Rating: 3
Text: Bed was nice, microwave and mini fridge, cable TV with new TV screen. Newly renovated. The gentleman at the desk for checkout and checkin was nice. 

Found a lot of bugs, even a few cockroaches inside the fridge. Lots of very strict rules (no visitors without a $10 fee, no refunds for any reason). Staff started knocking on our door at 10 to remind us that checkout was at 11. 

Not a bad hotel for the value, but you definitely get what you pay for. If you're looking for cheap shelter from a storm and don't mind sharing a room with a few 6-legged guests, this is an OK place. If you're not strapped for time and have the money to go somewhere else, look elsewhere.
