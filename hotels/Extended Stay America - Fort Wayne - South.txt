Extended Stay America - Fort Wayne - South
Rating: 5
Text: As they say "Straightforward studios with kitchens". Reasonable price and got all I need to stay for 8 days. Bought some groceries from a nearby store and cooked my own food. Don't know what other guests were expecting, but everything were written down in their brochures. Great staff by the way!

Text: WHOA 5 STARS??!! Yep I actually gave 5 stars. This place is amazing! The staff is very nice and accommodating. Very clean building. Room was exceptionally clean and the whole place smelled lovely. No nasty smoking smell. I had everything I needed and even brought my doggie with me. It was an extra fee ?BUT if I have to pay that to make sure he doesn't pick up fleas then okay. There is a dog waste area out back which to be honest didn't look like it was even used so that means people actually cleaned up. The interstate wasn't an issue I couldn't hear it at all. Very close to everything, went to Jefferson Pointe for a movie. I highly recommend this hotel and I'm picky.

Text: The staff is very easy to work with and accommodating. This is a home away from home. Being a contractor and living in hotel rooms the amenities are perfect.
