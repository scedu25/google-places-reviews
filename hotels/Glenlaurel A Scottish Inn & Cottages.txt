Glenlaurel A Scottish Inn & Cottages

Text: This isn't just a place to stay, it is an experience. Amazing food, romantic ambiance, cozy, and friendly staff. The full dinner option is some of the best food I have ever tasted. The staff, chef, and innkeeper are amazingly friendly and polite. Last visit my wife and I got a couples massage in our cabin and were not disappointed. The private gorge for hiking is beautiful but without the crowds of other hikes in the area. We always get a cabin with a hot tub- with that and a fireplace in each room it makes for a perfect winter retreat. The rooms are clean and well kept, the bedding very soft. My wife and I anticipate or annual visit months in advance- we can't wait to come back! Best place to stay in Hocking Hills!

Text: Had the best romantic getaway experience for our anniversary! The food is delicious- we did both the 7 course dinner and breakfast. The staff is friendly and helpful. The lodging is super clean despite being pretty much in the middle of the forest. We enjoyed the private cottage and hot tub after hiking throughout the region and the inn's property all day. They also offer discounts for military and returning customers. We will definitely be returning one day!

Text: I've been going to Glenlaurel since 2005 at least once every year. A great place for an anniversary! Truly a retreat where I can really forget about the daily grind I'm leaving behind. The cottages with hot tubs never disappoint, and the view of the stars at night is one of the best in Ohio. They go out of their way to attend to every detail, including accommodating dietary restrictions in the dining room. The 7-course, formal Saturday evening dinner with bagpipes is a memorable treat. Their private gorge is a wonderful area for hiking, birding and being immersed into nature without the crowds.
