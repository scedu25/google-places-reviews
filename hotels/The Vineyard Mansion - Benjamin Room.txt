The Vineyard Mansion - Benjamin Room
Rating: 3
Text: This is a nice place with comfortable beds. We rented the carriage house for our 3 night stay. It is a fully furnished apartment next to the mansion. There are a few things to consider before booking. 1. You will need to park your vehicle on the city street. This is due to a vehicle that is  currently broken down parked in the driveway. We are not from this area so we do not know if this is a safe area. 2. You will have quite a few stairs to climb. This is due to the apartment is located over the garage. 3. No available WiFi. Overall it is a great place to stay and when we are in the area next year will return.
