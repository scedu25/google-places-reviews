Text: I attended a wedding there. Service was great as far as the food and bar. They even opened an extra space so we could buy and watch a boxing match. After midnight we set-up tailgate style out in the parking lot and ordered pizzas. The Inn was perfect for the event.

Text: The Inn at 835 is a very nice B&B. Rooms are very good sized and comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was delicious. I've been to 2 receptiosn in their hall and both have been a lot of fun, with amazing food. Would definitely suggest it to others.
