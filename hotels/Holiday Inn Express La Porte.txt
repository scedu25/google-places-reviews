Just biscuits and gravy, bacon and cinnamon rolls for me.

Text: What a great pleasant surprise!  The hotel is new and it shows.  The rooms are spacious and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Free breakfast was good as well.

We were in town for a youth baseball tournament and would recommend it to everyone.  Vs. the other hotel i town where our team was staying, this felt like a 5-star resort.

Text: The rooms were great. Nice, clean, large and the bathroom felt equally as big and roomy. Good size TV on a full motion wall mount so you could sit on the couch and watch tv or lay in bed. A.c. ran super cold. Mini fridge and microwave in each room is a bonus!
