Text: We had a great time here with a group of friends. Friendly staff and great prices. Full hookups. I will say that this is a family atmosphere so if you plan on partying it up, you may want to look at other options. Super nice and clean restrooms and showers.

Text: Absolutely love this place. Showed up at almost midnight and was still greeted and welcomed. Phenomenal showers, cleaner than most people's homes. Pool area was spotless. Well kept and will definitely be back.

Text: This is a nice place. The owners are friendly and helpful. I went there with a group June 23-25 after a massive flood that hit the river and them end of April. they were up and running and provided without flaw every thing they said they would when reserving sites and floats. I feel they provided good value for the group and myself.

Text: I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends. The owners and employees could not be more friendly or accommodating, the facilities are well maintained and the areas they float are fun stretches of river.
