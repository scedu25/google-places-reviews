Text: Really a nice place. Great beds. Clean modern bathrooms. Breakfast has everything you can ask for a breakfast. Great small swimming pool. Across the street, there is a supermarket and places to eat. Quiet. Plenty of parking. Coffee and tea are available 24 hours. Microwaves and small refrigerators are in every room.

Text: The rooms were great the beds were soft. The shower was awesome although it did lack an exhaust fan so things got a bit foggy. We were located in the first floor by the pool but it was super quiet.

Text: Not impressed at all. Stayed in a "suite" that is smaller than most other hotels regular sized room. We come to Beavercreek for a soccer tournament and usually stay elsewhere but this hotel was the only one with vacancies. Go figure. Never again.
