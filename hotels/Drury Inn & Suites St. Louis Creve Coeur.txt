Text: Front desk staff who checked me in was amazing. Great people skills and service. Every employee I encountered from breakfast, front desk, housekeeping were awesome. Highly recommend this hotel. Restaurant attached to you “Applebee’s” can learn a few things on customer service from Drury.

Text: Love this hotel. Great accommodations for the price. Easy access from the highway. Wonderful complementary breakfast. Great pool and exercise room. Nice conference rooms and very accommodating parking structure and lot. Lots of simple extras, such as the fountain in the entry way and the rooftop garden. Whatever your needs, they can cover them.

Text: My room was clean and comfortable. Housekeeping threw away some of the food I brought with me for my stay. I'll assume it was an honest mistake. Included meals and drinks was a nice perk. I would stay again.
