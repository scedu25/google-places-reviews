Best Western Oglesby Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We had a group of 14. Check in was at 3 but we arrived early for a Vine Festival going on and we were able to get into all four rooms before heading out the the festival.  Front desk was very friendly and the free breakfast was good.  Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Even the cleaning crew that next morning were very friendly, making sure to tell  you good morning and have a nice day.

Text: The location was perfect for us since we where visiting the state parks with our 2 year old son. They have gas station, restaurant and fast food within walking distance from the hotel. We also enjoyed the pool and hot tub. The room was very nice, clean and comfy. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The breakfast was decent. Offering biscuits and gravy, sausage and scrambled eggs for warm food. And the in general bread, pastries, bagels, cereal, etc... overall very satisfied with our stay.

Text: I usually stay at best westerns/ plus hotels, and this one is a bit below the standard. It has a good pool and hot tub though shallow, and small. It is the smallest best western I've dtayed at, but not very busy. One of the pulleys on the exercise equipment was broken, but they still have a treadmill, elliptical and stationary bike. I got the feeling the lower standards are a result of the small town location. The rates where very reasonable though for a 2 bed room. I only paid $65. I would say it was good value, very clean, with average customer service. Hope that helps.
