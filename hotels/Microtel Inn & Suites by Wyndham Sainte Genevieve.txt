Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Sainte Genevieve

Text: Most hotels have juice bars, so the presence in of itself was not unusual. However, the quality was exquisite. The grape was rich and earthy, not overly sweet but it left a lingering sugar on the palate. The apple was more sweet than I personally would have liked but it was still wonderful. Light and fruity, it was a great palate cleanser between bites of bagel and boiled egg. My personal favorite was the cranberry. Perfectly tart with that undertone of sweetness that made it a perfect breakfast or late night drink. The orange I did not have a chance to sample and I cannot in good faith review. Also, everything else was great or whatever. 5/5 Services, with comfy beds and a great staff. Rooms were clean upon check in.

Text: The hotel smelled old and dingy. The hotel was outdated. It was cheap and the beds were nice. The breakfast was poor. This is your average 3 star hotel.

Text: It was a good stay at the hotel. The room was clean. It was quiet. We only stayed one night for a wedding but I would recommend it to anyone staying in Ste. Genevieve.

Text: Straight out of the 90's! There weren't a lot of places to stay in this area. The Inn was clean, but very dated. I don't have any complaints about the place.
