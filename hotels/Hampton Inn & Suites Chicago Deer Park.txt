Text: We enjoyed our stay, the staff was friendly and it was quiet. The prices were reasonable. Rio is amazing! Would definitely recommend. The only thing that seemed to be overlooked about room 431 was an empty package of almonds behind the nightstand.

Text: Pretty much everything you would expect from a Hampton. The room TVs were small and the remotes sucked. Breakfast was above average. Make sure to check out the forest reserve close by but you need to drive there.
