The Baronette Renaissance Detroit-Novi Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Very comfortable beds, very clean, with a personalized touch.  The staff is extremely accommodating and friendly.  I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and although this is technically a 4 star, overall It feels like a 5 star hotel experience.  Love this place. I've stayed here three times. Never been disappointed!

Text: Elegant hotel in the Novi area. The banquet hall was big and the staff there was always available to help with the setup and operations.

The sound and lighting in the banquet hall were adequate to hold a wedding celebration.

At the last minute - their staff accommodated our request to approve an external caterer for meals for our program.

Text: The hotel is located within the outer perimeter of 12 Oaks Mall, with easy access to Novi Road, 12 Mile Road, and I-96. The rooms were very nice and clean. Staff was very courteous. There was live music in the lobby of the hotel during our stay lasting through the early evening. The hotel has a clean and modern decor throughout. The hotel has an attached restaurant which is rated very well, but I found the food a little disappointing. Perhaps it was my unsophisticated palate, but I thought the food was too fancy. Like maybe they were trying too hard to bring a wide variety of flavors together. There are other restaurants nearby if the one in the hotel doesn't suit you.

Text: I attended a banquet dinner celebration has part of a social event. The staff are extremely friendly they helped us with setting up the audio for the banquet room. They also worked with a new unapproved caterer a day before and helped us get through that process so that we could get the cuisine we wanted.
