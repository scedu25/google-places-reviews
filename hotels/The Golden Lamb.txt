The Golden Lamb
Rating: 5
Text: The Golden Lamb is an iconic staple of Lebanon for a good reason.  Our latest trip
 was a perfect example of extremely friendly and quick wait staff, great food, and a homey but elegant interior design.  We went for breakfast and was not disappointed.  Their coffee was excellent and hot, a nice bonus is they they also give you the carafe for as much as you want.  Their pancakes were delicious and fluffy and their homemade sausage is amazing.  Always worth our time to go.

Text: The hotel and restaurant were very nice.  The fried chicken is absolutely fantastic.  The vegetarian casserole was delicious.  The historic rooms are all unique.  This is a very nice place to stay and eat.

I highly recommend the Golden Lamb.

Text: A classic! The staff are very friendly and we loved exploring the antiques! The food service was a little slow but that allowed time to socialize and take in the surroundings. The food was very good and this will be a "must visit" for when we have company come into town.

Text: I love The Golden Lamb for various reasons. 1. The food is great for a reasonable price. 2.  The atmosphere both in the restaurant and in the town is very comfortable with an old home feel, everything has been kept preserved as it was over 100 plus years ago.  3. The service is always very courteous and caring. If you ever visit Lebanon Ohio (which you should!) This should be your first choice

Text: The food was great. They have handicap entrance. It's a bit darker than I'd like. It wasn't really busy when we went but it took an hour to get our food. I'll go again another time and hopefully it will a little quicker for food.
