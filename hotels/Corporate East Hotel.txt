Text: Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Nice size rooms. Good mattress. Breakfast pretty standard for these days, but not great. Small workout room but there was never anybody else in it anyway. We needed to lay low for another day and extended our stay another night.

Text: We used the conference room and another room for family get togethers. It is spacious and has tables and chairs already set up. The price was reasonable. It was better than some other places- we could rent almost any time of day or night and they let us use it around the holidays.
