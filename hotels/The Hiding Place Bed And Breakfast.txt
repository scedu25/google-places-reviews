Text: My wife and I stayed at The Hiding Place for our 3 year anniversary.  I really can't say enough good things about it.  I didn't know it was possible for rooms and bathrooms to be that clean.  We stayed upstairs in Lyn Suite which was great.  With the room came access to an additional sitting/living room.  That was a great touch allowing us to have a place to sit and unwind that wasn't the bedroom.  The Inn Keepers were extremely friendly and breakfast was unbelievably good.  The weather was a little chilly for the pool, but the hot tub was great.  I would give them 6 stars if I could.  We will stay there again if we are in the area.  Thanks!
