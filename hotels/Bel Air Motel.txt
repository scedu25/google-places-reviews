Bel Air Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Due to a business trip I needed someplace to stay and didn't want to spend a fortune staying at something in Grand Island. Room cost under $50!!! I was extremely pleased with the customer service checking in and the room was fantastic. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in, in a hotel/motel and the pillows were great as well. The bathroom was spectacular as it had new brown tile and was up to date. I chose to stay here from reading reviews of this one and the other motel in town. If you need someplace to stay then definitely choose this one, you won't be let down!

Text: It was very clean.  It has been updated and we were surprised how much room was in both the room and bathroom.   We will always stay there when we are near there again.

Text: Nice, clean, reasonable motel. They lose a star for not having coffee available. We were 50/50 on the firm mattress, but I'll round it up to 4.
