Text: I needed a place to stay for a couple nights while I worked in Carrollton. This place was just right. This place as the story goes was "just right". The inn keepers have been nothing but friendly and accommodating, and the house is beautiful - especially if you appreciate older homes. You walk in, and there is a small coffee bar as well as a seating area. There is plenty of charm and personal touch from the keepers. My room was upstairs in a quiet section of the house set apart. My bed was comfortable (no back pain in the morning), the room clean, and I felt very much at home. In the morning I ordered a vanilla latte with almond milk-and it was fantastic-just what I needed to wake up. I also had a lemon rosemary scone- which was wonderful. 
This is an old home-I appreciate old homes as I live in one built in the 1930s- it is wonderful for just that reason. Also this is an Inn/coffeehouse-not a b&b. You will not receive an elaborate breakfast-but that should not detour you whatsoever. The coffee is fantastic and the scone beat out many breakfasts I have had at many b&b stays. If you want a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay with plenty of character and charm-this is a great choice. As a business traveler this was a fantastic choice. If I were  traveling for pleasure- this location would also be my pick.
