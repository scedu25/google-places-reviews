Text: We booked a room for the solar eclipse. The rooms were clean and absolutely fine especially for the price. Staff was friendly and kind and extra helpful. It should also be noted that this was pretty much the only place that didn't charge outrageous rates for the event. We paid $57. Across the street and downtown places no better than this were gouging eclipse tourists over $400 and even $600+ for a single night. For their ethics alone this place gets 5 stars and everything else was basic, clean and perfectly acceptable. I'd recommend them on all levels.

Text: This  is the last place I would refer anyone  to.  The stAff  was preoccupied and un attentive I had to call and wait for some one to come from another room for me to check in and again to check out.  The rooms were clean but very outdated.

Text: I stayed here overwhelming weekend and the new management they have in there was really good people very polite made sure I was comfortable and had everything I need.. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, clean bedding and clean towels. Even though the resturant wasn't open they did at least had coffee and donuts which my kids were happy with donuts which was nice.. I give it a high rating for the simply fact of it was iffy on staying after seeing reviews but it looked nice from pictures on website and not costly and for it being under new management  for the short period it has been it was a good place to stay they are doing a great job..
