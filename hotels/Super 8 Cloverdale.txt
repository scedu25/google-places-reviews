Text: Excellent hotel. Well organized and laid out room. Clean facility, friendly staff, and large, spacious bathroom. The only drawback was the Continental breakfast. Limited options. Sadly, there was no fruit or considerable protein like eggs or meat. Overall, I would visit again.

Text: We checked in late. Room was nice and ready to go. Service was good and friendly. Location was a little hard to find as it is tucked back off the road after you exit the interstate. We didn't use the pool nor did we have the breakfast.

Text: It's a super 8 so, the expectations were not high. The room was clean, staff was cheerful and they had a decent continental breakfast selection. The sink in the room was a slow drainer but that's my biggest complaint.
