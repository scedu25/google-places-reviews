Text: Clean rooms. The staff is very nice and helpful, honestly the nicest staff of any hotel I've been to. The pool and hot tub was clean and very enjoyable. The soda machines are only $1 for a bottle size. Breakfast was very good with several hot food and meat choices. Definitely recommend!

Text: Nice place ..nice staff.. clean rooms... Comfortable beds nice pool... Hot tub.
Walmart near... 
Manager Paul was fantastic.
It's funny how things work out... This afternoon a gentleman knocks on my hotel room door... Wendell had already left for work. The man said... That the front desk... Gave him the same room... We already had. I called front desk... It was an accident on their behalf... And indeed they had given that same man... The same room... We had already been in. Soooo... They felt so terrible and so bad about the mix up... Not only did we get 10000 free bonus points onto our reward card..... We got moved to the BEST room of the entire hotel!! A living room... Jacuzzi suite... Private patio with sliding glass doors... Over looking the pool and hot tub. This was truly incredible. Now that is complete courteous customer care!! Thank you Best Western.

Text: There was amazing places to eat everywhere within 20 minutes, the rooms were quite and comfortable. The morning breakfast was honestly the best I have ever had at a hotel (and that's alot!) All of the staff was kind and helpful. Not to mention the pool and spa were perfect temperature! 5 star great job!

Text: This is the worst best western I've encountered within the last 15 states I've stayed in. It's awful. I found a towel left behind from previous person. Not a good place to stay
