Text: The owners dont really understand me and I rarely understand them. Price was right. Paid 250 for a week for 1 bed and 275 for 2 beds. It is also 50 a week extra if u have a pet.

Text: I'd give less stars if i could! It's 1:22am and I'm checking out! Demanded my money back after bed bugs started coming out and crawling on the comforter. Manager tried saying I brought them in that they don't have them there. Lies! They charged us for the night and refunded the rest of our money. Better than nothing. I ain't staying here now or ever again! Gross!!

Text: The room was horrible just like the economy. Pretty sure owned by the same people. Drawers falling apart. All very old barely working things in the rooms. The A.c. worked good that was the only good thing. The door barely locked. The bolt lock did not work however

Text: had a room away from the main road. it was cleaned well. building was older but that was to be expected. for the price it was a great room. smaller but im used to geting 2 beds and this was a one. rooms seem fairly sound proof. at least better than i expected. checking in and out was quick and painless. deffinetly recomend this to others. its not five star but its privet and well kept.
