Hampton Inn Lexington South-Keeneland/Airport

Text: Edit:
When I checked in for the stay my initial review below was based on, I booked another two nights late the same week.  Unbeknownst to me, the rate they booked me at for the room for those two nights was over twice what I payed for the first night.  I learned this at checkout.  They did work with me and did lower the overall rate, but it was still considerably higher than what I was led to expect I'd be paying.  Minus one ? and back to looking for the ideal Lexington hotel.

I can't stress enough how friendly the staff is and how nice and clean the room is. 

After booking online, I checked in and was offered a better rate than what I received online.  I booked two more nights on the spot.

See my pictures for how well the rooms are kept.  I actually had to look to see if there were any blemishes...there really weren't...just a few spots they actually touched up.

Of the 6 hotels I've stayed at in and around Lexington, this is - by far - the best.  Best staff, best room, and best value.  I'll be back and will be recommending this hotel for coworkers.

Text: Nice staff. Very basic Hampton. Good location for UK or Keenland. Close to mall and food. Will likely come back. The University Hospital Hampton is much nicer due to being new.

Text: Easy location to find, and has closed access to a lot of anementies. Very clean, very quiet comma and the staff is extremely helpful and kind. Good pool, and Jim. Plenty of parking even at a peak time at night.
