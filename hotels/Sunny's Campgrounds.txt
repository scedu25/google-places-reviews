Sunny's Campgrounds
Rating: 5
Text: We are new seasonal campers - new to campers, new to the campground - and everyone we've met has been encouraging and helpful. Our lot is a little piece of peace. We can go out and be in the middle of the busyness of the campground or we can stay on our lot and enjoy watching the fish come right to our dock. Sunny's isn't what I expected but for someone who never enjoyed camping (in a tent, sleeping on the ground) it's been a great introduction to the camp life. I definitely recommend it!

Text: Called to try to reserve 4 spots for a month. We were told we could only pay by the night & we would have to move our campers every 2 weeks so the grass would be able to grow.  She said it was set on a rotation. This makes no sense to me. I couldn't imagine setting up my spot with water & sewer just to breakdown every 2 weeks. Plus 30 nightly is a little costly. Especially since I cant even set up my site the way I would like to before having to move it all. No thanks Sunny's...
