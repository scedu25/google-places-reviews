The Metamora Inn
Rating: 5
Text: It's simple yet cozy. Tucked away at the end of town. Quiet with a view of a farm from the back. There are goats,cows,horses and other animals to enjoy. Kids love it. The animals are super friendly. The front of the Inn enters into the little town of Metamora. Feels like your walking through a movie set of the old west. The owner is the best and her smile is contagious. You will wake up to a homemade breakfast,great conversation and a hug to start the day.

Great hospitality, best breakfast in the state, and wonderful people to talk to. The small historic town is just 2 blocks away where you can find many different stores to shop in for your antique needs and restaurants that will make your mouth and heart melt with joy.
