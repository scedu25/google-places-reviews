Camden on the Lake Resort & Spa
Rating: 4
Text: I make annual and, sometimes, semi-annual 3-day trips to Camden on the Lake through my employer. The suites are well-suited for extended stays with large bedroom, cozy and classy sitting area with electric fireplace, very nice bathrooms, and fully equipped kitchenette with granite countertops. More rooms than not have a view of the lake and docks. There are a variety of choices on location and nearby for dining, shopping, and entertainment. Late Spring and Summer are the best time periods for activity. The rest of the year is quiet and cozy.

Text: Very Nice rooms,  i was on the back side of the hotel which still has some view of the lake,  but is much quieter then the 'front' which has all of the noise of the cove and bar across. rooms have a very nice kitchen area with electric stove element, small dishwasher and fridge, full size microwave.  Comfortable bedding and beautiful bathrooms,  was there for a conference but they have what looked like a nice pool area as well as spa and other amenities.  Had dinner at the hotel restaurant,  was pricey but was good food.  No lake fish though only ocean fish.

Text: The rooms and service were amazing. They catered our dinner which was creole, but turned out to be somewhat bland. Over all though everything was clean, beautiful and the bartenders were knowledgeable, kind, and did an amazing job!

Text: Really great band played all weekend, but us older folks wanted to go to bed sooner.  The loud music kept me awake until show ended every night after 1am.  And hotel staff said it would do no good to change rooms.  Otherwise, very comfortable and nice rooms

Text: The drinks were reasonably priced. It had a good atmosphere. Definitely not a bad place to stay at the lake.
