Text: My husband and I went with our son and his family four grandkids had a blast his wife loved it. There was lots to do for the kids who range from 2 to 9. All of the kids drove a tractor free. They went on a train and experienced a hold up. Our oldest granddaughter Road in the rumble seat of a car during the Cavalcade of power.

Text: The flyer online said open 6-??? But they closed at 10. We got there at 9:15. There was no direction as to what exactly was included in the wristbands, however, the price was decent at $10 for the train, trolley and carousel. I don't think we will be back again, sadly.

Text: LOTS of OLD tractors and farm-type equipment. Pretty impressive. We saw #1182 for the highest tractor display number. Good food from local churches with local Iowa cuisine  (pork tenderloin, pulled pork, pork chops, corn, etc.). Steam train ride around grounds. Trolly rides.  There's an old settlers area and an old town with jail, bank, saloon and hourly shows of old West robbery and shootouts. Country stars each year  (Tracy Lawrence this year). Lots of vendors selling all sorts of "goodies". Vendors also on the town square. Tons of people camping/RVing.
We've been going on and off for many years. It's getting bigger each year. People in the area are super nice.

Text: The prices seem to go up every year. On the square WiFi is free until Old Threshers starts. No one knows how to drive. Otherwise it's fun to look around . The food is great and they are finally getting singers that everyone can enjoy.
