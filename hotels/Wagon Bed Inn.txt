Text: The manager who runs this place is extremely rude.  For the price we were not expecting a top notch hotel but after we arrived we asked if we could see the room prior to paying for it to ensure it was clean, did not smell of smoke  and no bed bugs were present, when asked he yanked the paper from me as I was filling it out and said just find somewhere else. No excuse or anything just refused to let ua see a room after we asked or to even work with us.  He was very offended when we asked and turned into a total jerk.   He had no one else staying there so we did go somewhere else down the road paid the higher price and had a comfortable stay.  I would not recommend this place.  It looks run down from outside and inside the office.  Basically from his attitude and the appearance of it just a dump.   Don't waste your money.

Text: I mean for $45 a night you can't complain too much. It's a place to sleep for a night if you tight on money. Definitely way outdated and the shower head could use some help. I'm 5'10" and the shower head only went up to about my shoulder so I had to lean pretty far back to get my hair wet. You only get two pillows and the a/c partially works. We got here at 10pm right before the lady was leaving so hopefully you have no issues after that because we called the number and went and rang the doorbell and no answer. I never got the WiFi password so I was not able to do my work. But the lady at the front desk was very kind when we arrived thankfully.
