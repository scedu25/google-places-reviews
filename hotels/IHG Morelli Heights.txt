Text: I am currently staying here on business at the Holiday In Express on Fort Leonard Wood.  I need an extended stay hotel because I am here for 3 weeks.  This is anything but an extended stay hotel.  Basically this is just a standard room with a tiny little counter with a 2 burner stove top and a big fridge added.  There are no dishes provided, a very small counter space that is not functional at all.  The hotel also offers one bedroom suites and I bet they have no dishes either.  99% of the occupants here are students in their Advanced Individual Training for the Army...so if your looking to get a good Wifi signal, you can throw that out the window because it's constantly being used.  The bathroom is about as big as a small closet and the desk is pretty small as well.  SO if your looking for an extended stay, I would stay away from here.  At least the Candlewood Suites off post provides dishes and a dishwasher.  If you want to live off of microwave food and fast food, then this is the place for you.  Oh yeah, if you like to watch TV, you get 39 channels...most of which are not the popular ones that most people would like.
