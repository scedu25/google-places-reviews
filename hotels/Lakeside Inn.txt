Lakeside Inn
Rating: 5
Text: I love this historic inn.  Beautiful arts nd crafts furnishings,  overlooking Lake Michigan with miles of sandy beach.  Great for weddings and weekend getaways (we've done both here!)  Not super-fancy, but really nice

Text: Had a fabulous time at at the Lakeside Inn. Although it was only for one night, the experience was wonderful. The charm, history and setting make this a great destination. The staff was very cordial and friendly.
Looking forward to future stays at this gem of southwest Michigan.

Text: This place is really fantastic. It's vintage, so it may not be for everyone if you need all the modern amenities. But the location on the lake is worth the price alone. We've stayed twice now, and can't wait to come back.

Text: This Inn has a cozy cabin feel from long ago. The porch is very inviting with rockers and swings. Our room was large with a private bath and a hot tub! While there is no breakfast served during the week, there is a restaurant right around the corner that serves outstanding food. The private beach across the street was perfectly quiet and uncluttered.
