Text: Very nice place, cheapest rates in the entire area. For the price I expected a "slum" atmosphere, and was very pleasantly surprised! Courtyard with gazebo, flat screen TVs, spacious rooms. Best budget motel I've ever stayed in.

Text: Stopped for a night during a road trip. Great location off the highway, easy booking, and helpful staff. The room was large and clean for the price. Would stay again.

Text: Just got transferred to the area and needed a place to stay--looked online and reviews not bad and picked this over others without checking. I'm retired Army and not picky and am use to rough conditions. Place was overly dirty (filthy), pillows- pillow cases-sheets-blankets-towels stained and/or dirty. Bathroom looked likes it was cleaned with dirty water and stains on the walls and ceiling. Fridge didn't work and smelled like something died in it. Outside had no upkeep what-so-ever (just broken everything everywhere.
Bottom line is just don't stay here--Kansas Country Inn is much better for the same price (a little older and maybe dated some but much better)
