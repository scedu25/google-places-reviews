Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is conveniently located near the 90 toll way and many great restaurants. The hotel is very quiet and has a comfortable atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and is great about greeting guests as they come in. They are very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is very clean overall. The rooms are very nice for the price. The beds are very comfortable and very clean. The hotel has a hot breakfast and great selection of food choices. I will definitely stay here again when in the area and would recommend this to my friends.

Text: Very nice hotel for the price. Everything in Rockford was way over priced but here in Loves Park it was 1/2. Rooms are an older style and decor. Did end up with a whirlpool room. Breakfast was great and overall I will be back.

Text: No complaints means a five star review. The room was clean and functional, check-in was easy. I love the egg white and veggie omelet they added for breakfast. They even worked with me on changing a reservation that was technically not able to be changed.

Text: The room was great. I was there for a conference. Refreshments were nice. Sounded like the children staying there were having a great time too. I would recommend to stay or for meetings to all my friends and associates
