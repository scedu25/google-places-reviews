Text: My friends and family have camped here for several years.  The property did close temporarily during changes in ownership, but it's open again and doing fantastic!  Go visit Kareen and her family for some BBQ and fun times!  

They offer camping (w electric), swimming, fishing, BBQ and a beautiful view!  All very reasonably priced.

Text: Great place.  Kids loved swimming at the beach and jumping off the raft.  Barbecue was fantastic.  We wish we found this place earlier in the year.  It is a quick hour from wheaton but you feel like you are hundreds of miles away.  Hoping to go in the fall I am sure it is beautiful.

Text: we love this place. Old fashioned, nonplastic old school park with great fishing, great camping, a babbling brook near the camping sites and with a cool fishing hole that huckleberry finn would have felt at home in.  We've been coming here for years and highly recommend it to one and all
