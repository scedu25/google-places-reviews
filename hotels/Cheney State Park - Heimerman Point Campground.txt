Cheney State Park - Heimerman Point Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Camp grounds are large and private with several mature trees. I really liked how the fire pit/grill was several feet from the camper. The camping spot I chose would be perfect for families with young children or kayakers, as you can walk a short distance to the waters edge where the water is only a few feet deep with a Sandy beach area to wade in. Nice for just playing in the water. Showers are clean and available at each campground area, (there are several). Plenty of sites available. There is also a Marina to purchase forgotten items or necessities as well as fishing tackle and bait, and everything from smores to life jackets.

Text: Great family lake. Quiet spots, secluded spots and party spots. Good showers. Plenty dump spots. Lots of shade and lots of sun.

Text: It's a nice calm place and big but the bathroom and parking is kind of bad. At night it's a nice place to look at the lake and enjoy the breaze.
