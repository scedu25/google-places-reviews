Text: I enjoyed my stay at Country Hearth Inn.  It was clean and comfortable.   The breakfast selection was amazing.   The staff was very helpful.  Usually, I book in advance but I didn't this time.  I would stay here again.

Text: Bed was rock hard, room was musty and had live bed bugs on box spring!! Went to Holiday Inn for 113 dollars. Took them 2 days to issue a refund back on our card.

Text: Brian, the front desk receptionist, is amazing - not only does he work the phones and front desk, he also prepare the breakfast, clean the rooms, and helped my spouse and me locate and retrieve item we left in the room by accident

we arrived at almost 11pm and left at 8am but the whole time it was Brian working as well - he seems to be running the whole establishment by himself and we are very grateful that he called to notfiy us about our missing personal items, highly recommend 

the inn is also handicap accessible including showers and is comfortable for reasonable price
