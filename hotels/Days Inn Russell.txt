Text: Room was nice and comfortable. The bathroom, specifically the tub/shower was not cleaned as well as it should have. They provided a decent breakfast. Staff was friendly. I would probably go back because they had a great wyndham rewards price.

Text: Stopped in late at night on a solo road trip. Checked 4-5 places around but this was the only one that would let me stay (I am 19). Had a nice hot shower, free breakfast in the morning, and the place had decent wifi. No complaints from me.

Text: I am so glad I came across this motel. I showed up late in the evening with no reservation and they quickly got me settled in. The price was perfect, the room clean and cozy, and the staff was generously hospitable. Two thumbs up!  Will definitely stay here again when traveling across Kansas!

Text: The room I had was pretty clean and to my surprise, the pillows were brand new. The shower was really nice and not gross. The breakfast they have in the lobby is the usual hotel fare, but not bad either. I didn't have a bad experience overall.
