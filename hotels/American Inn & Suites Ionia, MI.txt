Text: The staff was nice but the room was sub par.. everything was falling apart... the breakfast was horrible the muffins were very old.. didn't see any bed bugs so that's a plus..would work in a pinch

Text: There's a great atmosphere about the place, and a totally reliable staff. They were knowledgeable about the local attractions and restaurants, and very polite, courteous, and accommodating. The pool area was very well kept, and the breakfast in the morning was exemplary. I'd recommend this hotel to everyone visiting the surrounding area, even my own mother. I can't report any problems, because I simply didn't have any. It was a very enjoyable experience.

Text: Pretty quiet, especially considering there was a convention, a reunion, a wedding, etc. Older and smells that way but overall very pleasant for a quick stay. Breakfast is lacking, they don't clean their waffle maker regularly and it smells like old oil and looks awful. Not many options, I chose to hit up McDonald's instead.
