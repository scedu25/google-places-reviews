Text: FULL OF BEDBUGS!!! I have bite marks all over my legs, waist, arms and back... even on the back of my neck!  Rooms stinks like crap, carpet is old, stained, and super dirty,  rooms are outdated, front desk man had a bad attitude, NOT recommended! Pay more, stay at a cleaner hotel. it's worth it
