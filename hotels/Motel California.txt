Text: Donna was very nice and the rooms are clean. They have a BBQ grill on sight for people to use and I felt the price was fair. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend them to others.

Text: We staid in the suite room, which has a small kitchen, a bedroom and a bathroom (no bathroom sink though) The place was clean, they only clean once a week though. It's a small motel, 10 rooms at the most. The manager comes by probably once or twice a week, but since it's me and my husband we don't really need a 24 hour front desk service, she was nice and friendly though. It was quite and clean and the price was fair. The only problem was the deposit charge for the linens and towels (this is the first time I ever heard of it and we stay in motels half the year every year) This place has a very strong policy about keeping the towels and linens white, NO stains are allowed (no matter what) if they are stained it will come out of your deposit. Which is ridiculous. So if you are planing on staying here, be extra careful and keep your towels and linens clean! or use your own... or you will be charged! We were anyways :)

Text: Manager is Never on Duty!!! Only one room can use the phone Line at a time.  Moldy shower and curtain, Tile falls off walls while you sleep.  My window curtain had blood on it.  Snow builds up and is not removed causing no parking.  Breakers keep tripping.  Holes in walls.  No housekeeping, trash is never removed, ran out of towels on wednesday and had to wash them myself so I could make it to cleaning day!!
