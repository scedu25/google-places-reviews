Text: Amazing Riverfront Views, from this Hotel, walk to the Marine and enjoy a refreshing drink on the outdoor deck overlooking the Illinois River. Historic location for the first Dam on the Illinois River.  Where Henry gets the Slogan, "Best Town by a Dam Site"...

Text: No one here to check us in.....all had to be done over the telephone (credit card etc.). The rooms were clean but reeked of cigarette smoke and nicotine film on most everything. If you are a smoker you might like this place but if you are a non smoker you might want to go on down the road and find something else!!

Text: I stay at this hotel frequently for work and can say that the owner and associates are all very nice people and I would highly recommend staying here. I have the opportunity to stay at "higher end" hotels in the surrounding cities and will always chose the Henry Harbor Inn. Some rooms are currently in the process of or have already been renovated and look great, but those that have not yet been are still kept clean and comfortable. 
If looking for a good place to stay, at a good price then this is it.
