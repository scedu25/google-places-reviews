Text: DO NOT STAY HERE!!! We got our room (135) as soon as we walked in my sister went to the bathroom and seen two cockroaches...when she washed her hands the sink flooded. Ignoring all that we pulled the blankets down and a bigger cockroach ran out from under the blanket! So we were gonna try and take a picture to show the manager and in the process found TWO BED BUGS...so my sisters fiance (who is an exterminator) did what he does best and flipped the mattress and found a blood stain. BTW this all happened within 20 minutes...needless to say we got our money back and are currently looking for a hotel..

Text: All previous issues have either been addressed or are false excellent place for the cost & nothing but courtesy . I'm OTR I've stayed in some rat holes not here this is comparable to a well kept motel 6. The no micro fridge no microwave is true

Text: Terrible. Talked to the lady and she said she had a room. We got there 5 min later and no one was there. Now I see the other reviews and wonder how this place is still open. Karma always wins.

Text: They advertise  35.99 nightly rate..we stopped in and was told the 35.99 rate was for truckers only. Our rate was 45.00 plus tax. Will never go there again

Text: Would not allow me to use overpriced washing machine because I was parked next door and not there. Lack of "hospitality " , and the namesake of the industry, told me these owners were all about rude cheap fast bottom line dollars. Lobby smelled of cabbage/curry / and body odor so bad u changed my clothes before renting at a cleaner friendlier place down the road.
