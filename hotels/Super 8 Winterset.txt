Text: Room was clean and staff very courteous.  We inadvertently left two of our favorite travel mugs upon departure.   Kelly went above and beyond in returning these mugs to us.  It was really appreciated.

Text: We got a fantastic rate for the hotel when in town for a wedding. The front desk worker was very courteous and friendly. The room was clean and simple, exactly what we needed. I'd recommend the Covered Bridge Inn to anyone needing to stay in Winterset.

Text: I'm only giving this 1 star because 0 was unavailable. Checked in and seemed friendly and as we were walking up to our room the owner yelled at me 3 year old boy for whimpering because he tires. He wasn't yelling, or screaming just like any other child he was whining softly not wanting to stay. I asked for a refund and told the guy he was rude and ridiculous for speaking to my kid that way. He then tried to make getting a refund extremely difficult.  So I took pictures and video taped the experience. I will absolutely never go back to this hotel again! 

An update. Upon requesting my refund he gave me a receipt that says refund for the exact amount the room cost but I have checked my account and no refund was deposited. I'll check again if it's deposited I'll update.
