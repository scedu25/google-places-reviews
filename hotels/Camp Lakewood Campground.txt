Text: Pretty lake and clean bathrooms. Tight navigation between the trees for a wide body camper. Little lounge is clean and had nice bathrooms, but there was a drunk guy right outside peeing on the propane tanks. He said hello to us shortly thereafter and told us he worked here! We have a toddler with us, very inappropriate for kids. Beautiful grounds but very Tight spaces and wonky alternating parking. Neighbors complaining about the same issue. We either have to share a picnic table with the neighbor our door faces or use the picnic table over the sewer on the other side where our other neighbor and us are hooked up to sewer. Icky. Good city water and sewer hook ups. These pictures I took are after the campers cleared out in the morning. Would be 4-5 stars if this place had 30% less sites and no drunks peeing outdoors. Older permanent campers sitting around giving it a run down feel in places. Decent playground. Bright bright orange traffic lights on all night long all over the grounds. Good if you like bright light, bad for stargazers and relaxation. Not happy with their reservations issues. We made a reservation at noon for that night with the condition we may have to push it back a day or two because our rig was in the shop. They said not a problem, BUT When we called two hours later (rig still in shop) they threatened to make us pay for changing our reservation, on the same exact day we had originally made the reservation and told them we may have to change it, which we were originally told would be no problem! Frustrating. Inconsistent, rude treatment. Made us feel unwelcome yet forced to come save getting charged. Would not have given my CC if that was their stance when I initially called. Good enough place for a night but wouldn’t plan to come back. The spaces are very very tight. If you have a large/tall pull behind rig or lots of slides don’t come here unless you are cool with lots of trees on your rig, acorns and nuts falling all night, and tight spaces where you can reach out and touch the neighbors RV.

Text: Allison, Michelle and Judy make a fabulous team that exuberates warmth and professionalism with a "can do" attitude. Showers and toilets are impeccably clean. Michelle is a delightful person with the stories she shares while you are having a nice chilled glass of wine at their small friendly bar.  The already low cost was made even lower with my military discount.  My wife and I enjoyed our whole experience at this campground.  We strongly recommend it to others.

Text: We found the campground enroute to California and all I can say is that upon check in, I was met with a welcoming smile and warm hospitality of Miss Alison Landreth. Our first experience in an RV park and can not tell you how amazing the scenic lake is, the ease of pull through sites, and the closeness of town amenities too! I would give this campground 7 stars just on the professionalism and courtesy of Miss Alison alone? It was nice to find a little home away from home along the way and dog friendly to boot!
Thank you to Camp Lakewood from myself and my wife and our 3 fuzzy 4 legged children?

Text: Stayed here Oct 19th.  A little over priced for this time of the year.  Good Sam got the price down to $36.  Two separate RV Resorts on this same trip only charged me $30.60.  First site they put me in had an open ground.  Had to pack up and move two sites over.  Pet friendly, but no fenced pet run for dogs.  You pretty much walk your dogs thru the park and clean up after them.  Lots of shade from oak trees; however, Dish had no chance of working and they had no cable.  They said they are "in between providers."  Oh yeah, acorns make quite the racket raining down on your RV all night.
