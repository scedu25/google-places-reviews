WaKeeney KOA Journey

Text: Rest/shower rooms unusually nice: clean, uncluttered, teak shower mats and shelving a nice surprise! Laundry room is 24/7 and all machines in good operational order (washer cycle very short, but drier is timed generously). Good, clear instruction is left for late arrivers. Sites are logically arranged, level and easy to pull into.

Text: Very well maintained site, with a friendly and professional staff.  I would highly recommend it.  Don't be too put off by I-70 being right there.  The traffic quiets down into the evening.

Text: This campsite did everything it promised but I would have liked to have seen a bit more grass and a little more privacy. It was the classic sardine Can kind of wedged in setup. 
Bathrooms were clean showers were clean and air power worked fine.

Text: Easy to find. Easy on and off interstate.  Friendly staff.  Our lucky day---ice cream social that night. That's what I love about KOA always thinking of something fun!!

Text: We were there Friday 9/1/2017 and were assigned Site 14.  When my husband plugged in our surge protector it told him there was an open ground and it would not transmit electricity.  My husband went to the office and reported this to them.  At first the front desk said "oh your coach is new and it's just sensitive."  He told them that no it wasn't the coach and the response was "oh well, that's all we have."  So the implication was take it or leave.  We were just too tired to leave so used our backup surge protector and just prayed we didn't fry everything in the coach.  I get it that it was a holiday weekend and they were booked but there wasn't even a "sorry" in the conversation.  We are KOA Value Kard Rewards members but we won't ever stay at this one again.
