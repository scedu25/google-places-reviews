Text: My husband and I stayed at this Bed and Breakfast during a recent trip to visit with family. We were nervous because there isn't a website to check out photos, etc but we took a chance. I am so glad we did! Now we know where to stay next time we visit family in the middle of nowhere! The rooms are clean, nicely decorated, and the breakfast was delicious. I highly recommend it.
