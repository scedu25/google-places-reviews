Text: What an amazing hotel. The rooms were great and the beds were so comfortable. The chefs did an amazing job cooking our breakfast and dinner. Overall, best hotel I've ever stayed at.

Text: Beautiful place, great customer service! Spent the night for our anniversary, the rooms are gorgeous and clean, the shower was amazing, the bed was like a cloud. Our room was across from the terrace and the workout facility, it was amazing all around!

Text: Brand new hotel. Only open 8 days when we stayed the first time. Returned 7 days later for a second visit. Awesome beds, super soft. Flashing light in the room was annoying as was the automatic bathroom light but overall a great place!

Text: The new hotel is absolutely stunning. I loved the Lodge, but this is definitely a good change.
