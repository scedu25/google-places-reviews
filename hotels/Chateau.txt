Chateau

Text: This hotel is gorgeous! Friendly staff, nice rooms. Spacious bathrooms. There's a gym, hot tub, and pool. Everything is sort-of Victorian style (could be wrong). Only downfall is their complementary breakfast is just like apples, certainly, muffins, and coffee. No actual hot meals. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel however that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Text: A beautiful hotel. I didn't expect to find this gem. The staff was friendly and attentive. The room itself, a King Bed single, was fairly standard but not disappointing in the least. Don't expect great views, but the price and proximity to Destihl cannot be beaten.

Text: Great motif,  great vibes, love the random old decor. The hallways remind me of "the shining" but in a fun/ I'm not really going to get murdered here way.

Text: Hot tub was cold. Fridge in room was warm. At least the front desk staff was friendly. Spend $20 more and stay at a nicer place.

Text: Attended a wedding reception. Food was great and the hall accommoded the number of guests well. My wife and I had a great time celebrating with the bride, groom, family, and friends!
