Text: We camp here alot. Never really had luck on the fishing. The concrete pads are nice. Plenty of room for the kids to play. You can hear trains at night. Not really much on traffic at night.

Text: Very nice camping pads. Kind of like camping in the city. Trains can be heard and highway traffic. Very busy with traffic cruising the park a lot! Water faucet water brown. No dumpster for trash.
