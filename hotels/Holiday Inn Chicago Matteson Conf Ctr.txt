Text: I have been saying at this Holiday Inn for 13 years. I have always enjoyed it. I just wanted to give a shout out to a young man on the front desk. His name is Demetrius and he is an asset to the company. A good listener, always up beat and will go far in this world. Thank you for great service Demetrius!

I really enjoyed my stay. I will use this hotel each time I come to the Chicago area. Honestly a job well done and kudos to the lovely staff. Thank you!

Text: It was alright. Food wasn't good, bed was hard, we weren't able to check out a little bit later and the elevators were awful. The elevators continuously broken, and would always have the fifth floor selected so we would always be taken to the fifth floor. The elevators took forever to come get us. It was quite the nuisance. The hotel also had a weird smell to it, it wasn't very pleasant. The staff if quite nice though, but I don't think this is a good place for someone to come.
