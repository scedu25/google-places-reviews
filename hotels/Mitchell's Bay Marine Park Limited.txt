Text: Not impressed by the cost to launch and the lack of cleanliness. The ramps are ALWAYS a mess. For the price they charge I would have expected a better experience.

Text: After paying $1700.00 in dock fees the first year. And paying $2200.00 in fees the following year to keep our boat there. We chose another marina for our own reasons the next. After breaking down on the lake and havin no other choice to limp our boat to - friends of ours at the marina let us moor in their slip till the next morning for repairs. We got a call from the marina to inform us that our boat had been impounded till the mooring fees had been paid. Including placing a big chain on a boat that limped in. Completely uncalled for. Considering we'd gladly paid about $4000 in the past - one would guess a bit of credit could be assumed.We were astounded that they felt that they needed to goto these lengths to receive $33. 
  The facilities are good - the management leaves a lot to be desired. A LOT.
