Text: Very quiet and pleasant for a business trip. The Junior Suite is the perfect size for getting work done and relaxing after long days visiting customers. The water is notably soft and moisturizing!

Text: Hotel exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a jacuzzi suite and it was huge. It even had 2 bathrooms. Pool area was nice but it didn't have the jacuzzi that was shown on the web site photos. The staff was very friendly. Would definitely stay again. I highly recommend this hotel.
