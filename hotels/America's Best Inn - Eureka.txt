America's Best Inn - Eureka

Text: Reasonable prices but not the best.  The location is great if you're looking for a room really close to Six Flags.  The beds aren't that comfortable and it took forever for the room to cool.  Staff is friendly and gave us extra pillows.  If the beds were updated to a more comfortable bed and the air cooled the room off faster it would have been better.

Text: BED BUGS!! dont stay here! then, the manager was rude because he still made me check out asap instead of being lenient with me. We found a bug and he made is sound like it was an usual thing. cob web in the corners. water pressure was good but not strong. smell of mold upon arrival. workers do not understand english that well so it took a long time to communicate things and the manager had to come up. breakfast was not worth getting up.

Text: I called and asked if there was room is open. I was told yes but they only had a few left. I asked for the rate and they told me. I said OK I'll take it. She said I'm sorry were not taking any reservations. I said so how am I supposed to get the room? She said since we only have a few rooms left it's first come first serve walk in only.  I said how on earth are people supposed to travel and know they will have a room when I get there if you want let them prepay or reserve the room? She said I don't know I just work here
