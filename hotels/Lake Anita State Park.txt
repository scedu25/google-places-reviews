Text: Very nice state park. Great amenities. Fishing is good. Camping spots are clean and week marked. I recommend this park for day trips or overnight camping.

Text: Absolutely one of our favorite campgrounds now!  In some campgrounds with a lake, unless you have a spot right by the lake you miss out on the views, but with this one, there's not really a "bad" spot.
What they don't show you is that the campground is set up like terraces.....different levels. So there is a great view of that peaceful lake wherever you set up. Love it! The only negative part is tha e camping spots are rather close together, but we went during the week, and there was no one on either side of us, so that was great.

Text: Lake Anita SP is a lovely park.  It would be nice to have a printed map.  We choose an electric only spot and had the best water front view.

Text: It's a great state park. Nice and well maintained. It has a paved bike/walking trail around the lake. The campsites are well groomed and level. The shower house is clean. It has a nice playground for the kids. The lake is clean. The beach could use some work. We had a nice time camping here last weekend.

Text: Love going to see this lake. It has changed so much over the last 25 year's since I have been able to see it. So much impovements and just a wonderful place to spend the day or weekend or even a few weeks. I often just drive around with my friends and my beloved dog.
