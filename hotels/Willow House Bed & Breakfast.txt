Text: I have stayed at the Willow House Bed and Breakfast in Perryville Missouri on more than one occasion and have never been disappointed.  Nestled in the heart of one of the quaintest towns I have visited, the Willow House Bed and Breakfast offers the comforts of home with great service. The food is great and the owners are just down the street and available to you at your request. From the antique claw-foot tub to the relaxed atmosphere of the living room, Willow House Bed and Breakfast is a great weekend get-away, especially for those who are enjoying all the wineries in the area.
