Text: Really nice place to stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was really friendly. Breakfast was small and simple but nice. Over all I would stay here again.

Text: The Adair Budget Inn is a good value for the price. The room was clean and comfortable, although we wished there were more than just 2 flat pillows. The lady at the front desk was very kind and, although we didn't stay and eat, we noticed a simple breakfast spread of cereal, pastries, etc. the following morning when we checked out. The Adair Budget Inn is definitely worth the price and a nice place for an overnight stay.

Text: There was some mold. One pillow too soft, one too hard. Would stay again.

Text: We stopped for just one night to sleep. For such a cheap price- it was better then I expected. We arrived late but had no problem checking in. The room was clean, warm and comfortable. In the morning there was coffee,juice, cereal and muffins ( nothing fancy but for 40$ we were even expecting any breakfast) The lady working was very nice and overall we can't say anything bad about this place.
