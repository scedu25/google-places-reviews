Drury Inn & Suites Kansas City Stadium

Text: Great hotel. WiFi is fast. Close to walk to Kaufman. Denny's in the parking lot is odd. It's so close so you have to park in the back of the hotel. Great food and snacks. Beds suck. If they were upgraded this would be 5 star!

Text: Clean and unassuming. Free breakfast and happy hour is good enough to keep you alive but nothing special. Plenty of parking. No restaurant or hotel bar, but there is a Denny's in the parking lot. Beds very comfortable.

Text: Location is good , with nice country drive around outskirts to downtown without using freeways. Wich we like to do.lots food choices in area. Great view of stadiums. Gas station real close & Denny's right next door. Staff friendly & gated free parking at night rounds out what we like about the location. Pool for a quick cool down makes it fine for us.

Text: We called this hotel as a last minute plan. The clerk was very friendly, and helpful (Nina). The room was clean and very nice and comfortable. Plenty of pillows and blankets. The bathroom was also very clean, and the shower had plenty of water pressure! They have a pop machine and popcorn in the lobby area. Breakfast the next morning was very delicious! There was plenty to choose from! You should not have a problem finding something to eat there. It was an extremely nice experience and if we ever need to, we will be staying here again!!!

Text: Location was great if going to football or baseball games right across the highway from stadium. Rooms a little dated but was good for price, breakfast was nice but there's a Denny's right next door so you had options.
