Best Western Mt. Vernon Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Very clean & comfortable. It's right on the interstate where many semis travel, but it's very quiet. Close to numerous restaurants and even a Wal-Mart. The staff is very friendly & helpful and their breakfast is really good! Priced perfectly! Two thumbs WAY up!!

Text: Really an impressive-looking place on outside and inside. Very close to the highway, close to gas stations, and convenient to access. Wonderfully comfortable room. Everything looked brand new and clean. Got a great nights sleep. Had everything we were looking for in an overnight stay. Good value!

Text: Clean and comfy. Friendly staff. We have been on the road for over 2 weeks and have stayed in many Best Westerns as well as other chains that offer breakfast. My grandson said the eggs here were the best of the whole trip. I did see them actually beating fresh eggs and scrambling them fresh. The only downside would be that there is no ice machine on the 2nd floor, but not a big deal.

Text: Just off the highway. My room was on the back side, so I had no road noise. Quiet stay. Slept like a baby. Staff was engaging and pleasant. Don't know about staying here for an extended time (2 or 3 days); but for one night while traveling, this place was perfect for me. All I needed was a good nights sleep, and that's what I got.

Text: Not to bad. Rooms were clean. Stains on quite a few things. Breakfast was tasty, as usual. 
Staff could be friendlier, but they got the job done. 
I would stay again.
