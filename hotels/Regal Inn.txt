Text: I really wasn't impressed with this place.  For starters it is NOT American owned and operated.  Secondly the bed is as hard as concrete. The prices are ok and pretty clean. It's better than nothing and the lady at the desk was willing to get out of bed late to rent a room. The facilities are a little run down and there's no continental breakfast offered but they are half the price of Best Western. In Coffeyville I recommend spending a little more and staying at Sleep Inn.

Text: Would not stay at Regal Inn again! Furniture is  poor quality.  Toilet would not flush! Owner said he would get plumber to fix it tomorrow after we left. Way over priced!

Text: My stay was great. Staff was courteous and professional. I left money on the bedside table every day and everything was there when I got back. Bed was comfortable and the shower was hot with good pressure. Room was clean and trash was picked up every day. 

The only complaint I had was that the mini fridge had no freezer.
