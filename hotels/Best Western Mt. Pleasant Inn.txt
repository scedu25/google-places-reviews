Text: Just arrived surprisingly very clean rooms. Rooms are small or should I say cozy. Already ordered food from pizza ranch the wings are great!

Text: For the most part I pretty much live out of hotels for work. I actually did the wifi update here. Yes, the wifi is brand new and even works by the pool, you will not be disappointed!  The staff here were great and they didn't even have to be as I was there working for another company. 

In all honesty it was one of the best Best Westerns I have stayed at.

Text: The rooms need updating.... the carpet looks like it is 30 years old and the sheets are dingy and old.  The people are nice but I just did not like the rooms.

Text: Our stay was nice. There was the free continental breakfast but we did not get a chance to eat any due to us leaving early and getting in late during our stay. Anything we asked for they made sure we had it. We were very comfortable!!!
