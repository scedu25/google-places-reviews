Text: We have used this lodging facility a number of times.  However, of late, they have become extremely unaccommodating for guests.  We travel a great number of miles to visit relatives in the area on a frequent basis.  We have a small, housebroken dog and the last few times, they indicated that we had to keep our pet out of the room while we were gone.  

This last call was made at a time when we needed to stay in Glenwood for my Mother's visitation and funeral.  The male manager was extremely unaccommodating and unprofessional.  The hotel is not even that nice of a place.  It is clean, but old, nothing fancy, and now very unaccommodating! 

We went on down the road to Percival for a cheaper, cleaner, personable, and pet-friendly Motel 6!  Bye, Bye Bluff View, you are history!

Text: Might not be a 5 star motel but it sure seems like it in ways. All the staff were very nice and helpful. The beds were extremely comfortable. Temp was just right and I slept like a baby due to not dealing with any noise from any other guests! If I ever come thru here again I will stay here!! Price is perfect!!!  And the view is beautiful!!
