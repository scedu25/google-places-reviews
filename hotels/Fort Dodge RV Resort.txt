Fort Dodge RV Resort

Text: Stayed in one of their cabins. When I told my husband I had booked a cabin at an RV park to stay in for two nights during our 8-day road trip, he was a little miffed with me. We rolled up to the Fort Dodge RV Resort he started to relax, seeing the nicely kept facilities. When we got into our cabin he told me I had made an excellent choice. The cabins are so great! Our kids were so excited to have their own room, and it was amazing to be able to put the kids to bed and stay up a bit later, which you can't do in a hotel room without disturbing the kids. It was so relaxing to be able to run to the grocery store and stock up for our meals that we could prepare and eat in our cabin's kitchen. It was clean and it was so fun and relaxing to have a space like this to come "home" to each night. The only con is that we had to move on after only two nights. I wish we had similar accommodations at each stop along our way!

Text: Nice bathroom and shower facility. Nice long, level pads, easy back- in for our R-pod. Local attractions easy walking distance. Reservations were easy to make. Negatives; only no shade, or wind breaks, and no pool open past 6pm, no on site.activities for young people.
Would stay again if arriving before water park closes at 6pm.

Text: They are really nice. We loved the place so far. The cabins are really nice and there is enough room for 3 couples per cabin. The living room can convert into a third "bedroom" because the couch turns into a bed. For this location you need to bring something to keep the flies out from the house. We went to the local Walmart and they were sold out of supplies.

Text: These cabins are beautiful and fully furnished. They're bigger than we thought and they are brand new and super clean. We just love it and it fits a good family or two.

Text: A new park - great utilities, friendly service, good location (especially the adjacent city dog park!). Sites are quite close, and the landscaping just needs some time to grow in. A bit pricey, but the amenities are all new.
