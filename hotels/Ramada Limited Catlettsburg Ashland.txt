Text: Very nice entryway, very clean throughout the motel. Pool was inviting. The hot tub jets weren't working but there was a sign to say out of order. Inside the pool area was a nice comfy setting area. Outside, were picnic tables and grill. With a great view of rolling hills. Rooms were small with  2 double beds. Beds were comfortable.  Could have used more plug ins for devices nearby.  Shower was awesome with great pressure. Drains in tub were slow. Had washer and dryer which were clean. Breakfast was typical but very organized and clean. Staff was very friendly. Would stay again....was very pleased.

Text: The hotel was right off the main road with a gas station, subway, and a waffle house next door. The room was decent for the price. They had an indoor pool which my family used both nights. We got some food from a restaurant down the road. I got a steak but did not get any kind of knife to cut it with. The front desk was nice enough to loan us a knife so I could eat my steak. Very friendly and very good hotel.

Text: Very nice staff and very helpful. Could smell the hotel was a clean place the moment you walked in. Had more than enough towel in the room. Which is very unusual. The shower was amazing.

Text: 9 out 10 for the  pool/jacuzzi. The front desk representatives are nice. The only thing that isn't right is the fact that they have one drying/washing machine to do laundry, and it does not work consistently.

Text: The swimming pool wasn't heated, so we couldn't even swim because the water was like ice. The location of the hotel was good, safe places to eat within walking distance, but I recommend saying somewhere else. The hotel was highly dated, and the key card wouldn't work to enter our room, so we had to go to the front desk twice in order to get the card activated again. I was disappointed and I will not stay here again.
