Text: Beautiful area!!  Staff is awesome!   I was there with my grand babies and was fixing breakfast for them.  I was out of pancake syrup!  The little store was also out!!  Staff member Nina actually went to her home and brought us her bottle.  Jusr one example of the Above and beyond customer service we have received for the 3 summer I have spent there.

Text: My family and I had a terrible experience with The Cove. We rented a pontoon boat, but it broke down. Their equipment is outdated! It wouldn't be so bad if it functioned properly. We used the boat for approximately 4 hours, then we were stranded on the lake for 2.5 hours because the engine broke. The Cove said that they were sorry, but tried to charge us the full price of the rental. We had to lament and argue with them to get a discount. We did finally receive a discount, but it was very obvious that The Cove is only interested in profits, not in customer satisfaction. If you want quality equipment and customer service, I highly recommend you rent elsewhere.
