The Culver Cottage B&B
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I had a perfect overnight stay at Culver Cottage and highly recommend it. While our room's walls had some small patches in prep of being repainted, we found it spacious, charmingly decorated and very clean. The queen bed and pillows were comfy. We had a nice flatscreen TV and excellent Wifi service. The whole building seemed to be very well maintained. Katie the innkeeper was delightful and helpful, answering our questions as we settled in and the next morning. Breakfast was fresh bagels, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea and juice.
