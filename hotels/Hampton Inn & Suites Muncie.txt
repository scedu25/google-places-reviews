Hampton Inn & Suites Muncie

Text: My go to spot. The staff is friendly and the rooms are nice. We were put in the handicapped accessible room which felt like a suite. Fantastic breakfast. They were under construction at the time and the pool was closed. They didn't seem to offer any reimbursement for not having this amenity available which was a downer.

Text: The staff was very friendly and quick. The room was clean and appeared recently remodeled. There is work happening in the exterior, but this did not impact my stay.

Text: It was conveniently located to pretty much everything. They were doing renovations, so it will continue to be a nice property.

Text: Room was very spacious and clean. One drawback was there is no microwave or refrigerator in the room. Breakfast was just okay. Great location.. literally minutes from Ball State and many restaurants near the hotel. Beds were very comfortable

Text: The rooms were very quiet. I didn't hear any of the other guests. Breakfast was nice. Scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, and all the usual cereal, fruit and oatmeal. Staff was very curious. They made great recommendations for local Muncie vendors.
