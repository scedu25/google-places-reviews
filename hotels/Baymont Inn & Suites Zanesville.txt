Baymont Inn & Suites Zanesville
Rating: 5
Text: I can't say enough for the staff of the Baymont Inn in Zanesville. While traveling I became very ill and they went over and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. A great group of employees. The room was very clean and in very nice condition. The location is very convenient to the highway yet provides a quiet atmosphere.

Text: Average hotel, indoor pool was a little cool, no hot tub. Many restaurants close by, literally cracker barrel across the parking lot. Only complaints we had was mattress way too soft and broke in and pillows were too thick. We didn't ask for different pillows so don't know if they would have had more or not. Complimentary breakfast available. Friendly staff, clean room.

Text: Average hotel for a one night stay during our cross country road trip. Rolled in to Zanesville around 10:30p looking for a room. Google had this as one of the lowest cost in town. A bit tricky to find up a hill and around the corner. Room was clean, TV worked, staff was nice. Breakfast room is tiny so unless you are the only one there be prepared to take your food to go.

Text: It served it's purpose. Stayed one night. The fridge was loud. Very dated hotel. Hallways smelled like decades old cigarette smoke. Bed was lumpy. The breakfast was continental and even that is giving it more credit than it deserves. They leave envelopes on the desks in the room asking for tips. As soon as someones asks me for a tip, they arent getting one. Then again, I just needed a place to sleep. So three stars.

Text: Carpets need cleaning. Furniture had rings on it. Freezer almost wouldn't open! Hotel needs better housekeeping!
