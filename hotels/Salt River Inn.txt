Text: Went to Mark Twain Lake with no reservations and walked in asking for a room for the night. A lady showed us two different rooms and was extremely kind. Rooms were clean, and didn't smell bad. Reasonable rates, and a stone throw away from the Route J Market. No fridge in the room is the only setback of my whole stay Would stay again any day!
