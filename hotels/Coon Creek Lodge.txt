Text: A hidden jewel at Lake Shelbyville.

My brother-in-law and I have been staying here for the last 17 years.  We fish in the Spring and the Fall.  We would never stay anywhere else.  It is close to the Lake and ramps.  The rooms are very clean and serviced well.  It is equipped with cooking gear, a stove and small refrigerator.  Mike and Linda are great hosts and their son Jeff is helping to carry on the tradition of great service.  There is nothing negative to say.  I have had better service here than some hotels in Chicago.

Text: Very nice accommodations near lake Shelbyville. My family have stayed at this lodge near my father in-law's camper a couple times and have had a wonderful experience in a very clean room.
