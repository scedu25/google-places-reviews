Text: What a beautiful b&b! My single was clean and spacious. The breakfast was simple but delicious; and they were very accommodating to my dairy allergy. I highly recommend this place.

Text: Absolutely the best place in Defiance to stay. My family and I have stayed there twice and we feel like we are at home. They are so welcoming and willing to do whatever it is to make you comfortable. We have 2 children and they love it as well. Highly recommend!!
