El Charro Convenience Store

Text: This is a smaller place, mom and pop operation. It is well worth the trip to pick up a soda or bierock. 32oz soda is cheaper than the big name store which is refreshing to see! Staff is nice and store is clean. Many selections of fountain and food. THANK YOU EL CHARRO!!

Text: The staff was nice but unfortunately the new owner fired everybody because they were making $0.50 more than minimum wage and that was more than he was willing to pay for good help he's a greedy jerk.  The new owner is driving the place into the ground because the shelves are almost always empty.  I won't even tell you what he does to the pop machine to make the 32 ounce drinks so cheap.  For sanitation reasons I would be aware of this place.
