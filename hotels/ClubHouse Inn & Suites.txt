Text: The evening reception (with free drinks!)  is great and Bev is so welcoming! Super comfy beds. A very generous hot breakfast. Gorgeous lobby and courtyard make it nice to relax and chat. Love staying here (been here more than a dozen times)!

Text: Great staff... very accommodating.  Evening reception is good, especially for 6 nights a week.  I have only seen them 4 nights. The outdoor area is a nice place to hang out with coworkers at the end of the day. Pool and jacuzzi were both in good working condition. For longer stays like mine, the guest laundry was also helpful.

Text: These people are the best. Whatever they may lack in any area they absolutely make up for in service. I had a leaky sink, no big deal, and they upgraded me no questions. It's the only place I stay in Topeka. I had to stay in the hotel for 10 weeks for some training. It was a home away from home. These people are amazing.

Text: Great customer service! Housekeeping could use some happy pills, and be a bit more enthusiastic! But overall great room and beautiful scenery!!
