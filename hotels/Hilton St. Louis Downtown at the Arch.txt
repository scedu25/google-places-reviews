Text: Loved it. Booked online last minute for honeymoon due to our wedding date changing. Everything was superb. Concierge services were on point. Free perks for being newlyweds and we totally didn't expect it or ask for it. In walking distance of everything we came for. Food was good, breakfast bar was great. Most definitely will be back. And the front desk clerks were friendly and very helpful.

Text: If I was designing a hotel, this would be it. You have to have a card to go up the elevator. Cool safety feature. The bathroom with jacuzzi is larger than most hotels. Separate tub and shower. Lighted mirror. Robes and plenty of plush towels provided. The bed was very comfortable. The room was quite large. They gave a great military discount. Breakfast was really tasty as well. We did use valet because we thought it was worth the extra $7. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.

Text: Great hotel to go to when you're visiting for work. The room was a little too small for me if I'd book it for vacation. But hey, it was minutes from the ARCH and the lobby food was delicious. The waitresses there are so nice. Shoutout to the Omelet guy!

All the staff along the was whose name I didn't get were pleasant and very friendly.

Text: The location was right downtown, which was great. I wish the parking was at the same location, or that there was a bridge to connect the hotel to the garage to make moving or belongings easier. Otherwise, the experience was great. Our room was right off the elevator, and everything was in working order. Unfortunately, breakfast was not included.
