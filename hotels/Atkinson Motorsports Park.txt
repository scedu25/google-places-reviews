Text: Great place. Very linear at some points, but also very open at others. Lots of scenic water. Would go again.

Text: Not a good place for an RV camping, there is no shade, no laundry, no wifi (i did not have signal on my phone there either), showers are dirty and all water smells like rotten eggs and there is only cold water.

Text: If you get stuck at this place and need help even after telling them you have tried everything to get out they will tell you to call a tow company. The owner was a complete joke! However the company next door helped out so much! WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN SO RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL!!!
