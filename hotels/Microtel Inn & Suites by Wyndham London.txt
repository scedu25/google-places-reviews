Text: We stayed here for our anniversary and It really couldn’t have been better. The staff went out of their way to help me, especially, Stacy. I had planned a surprise and they helped me pull it off. The room was amazing. Everything was neat and clean and the room we stayed in was cozy and very spacious. We went to the movie theater across the street and even got a discount because we were staying at the hotel. Breakfast was exceptional with a variety of items like gravy and biscuits, sausage, eggs, pancakes, waffles, bagels, cream cheese, a variety of cereal and oatmeal. Checkout was a breeze. Will definitely be staying here again and only here while in London

Text: My husband and I stayed here for the weekend. The room was exceptionally clean and nice. Even more importantly, the staff was as friendly as you could ever ask for. Randy, the manager, took time to respond to my email concerning a room, and gave us "his favorite" just because it was our anniversary! Breakfast was really good too, biscuits and gravy, eggs and sausage, fresh made waffles, and bagels and cream cheese. Loved the convenient location central to everything also. If you're looking for a place to stay in London, this is definitely it!!

Text: Affordable, the rooms are very nice and clean. They also offer a full breakfast that was surprisingly good. The only complaint I have is that the rooms are not soundproof. You can hear people's conversations from everywhere(inside and outside building) while in your room.
