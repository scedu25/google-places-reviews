Depot Inn & Suites

Text: This is a gem in the middle of the a lot of Super 8s and Motel 6's. We are so glad we happened by this place.  I travel 12-18 times a year and often stay in luxury hotels in big cities. But those are disappointing after staying here. The staff was top-notch - they could not have been more accommodating and friendly. The pool area is beyond reproach - no nasty smell of chlorine, the water was crystal clear, and no itchy eyes after a swim. Of course, the water was the perfect temperature.  We appreciated the little surprise of the water coming out of the pipe in the ceiling over the pool.  I believe the front desk staff had some control over that because we caught them giggling when they realized that it surprised us a few times. I LOVED that.  It gave us a fun reason to interact with the staff.  I was amazed that they have all sorts of memorabilia around the pool area and throughout the hotel.  No rust on anything from the pool area (their ventilation system must be top notch!) and I didn't see a single dusty object. There is much to see and the staff know so much about the railroad and the history of this place. The rooms are beautiful.  We stayed in a suite and it was well worth the upgrade. But being the nosy person that I am, I also went into one of the other rooms while they were cleaning the next day and talked to one of the housekeepers (again, she was so friendly and happy to show off the place to me).  The rooms are immaculate. Don't be afraid of the themes.  They are tastefully done and fun. Extra touches to spoil you everywhere. The breakfast was even good - it's continental so it wasn't something to brag about - but the coffee was good and the bagels were fresh.  We were so thrilled by this place that, although we have no reason to come back to this area of the country, we might just have to plan a special trip to stay here again.  I felt like the staff were inviting us into their own homes the entire time we were there. They truly treated us like guests in their home, and their pride in the place is evident by their happy attitudes and their willingness to talk about the place and show us around. I was also impressed how they accommodated the Amish folks that stayed there with rides to the Amtrak station and other places in town. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Text: What a great place to stay. Staff is very professional and very friendly to all of the guest. The museum is loaded with interesting items that are very rare to say the least. Rooms are 5 star with very comfortable beds and nice decor. A gem of a place in virtually the middle of nowhere.

Text: I stayed here for work and couldn't have had a better stay!  Deepak is so friendly and he definitely has the cleanest hotel in the area!  Large rooms, quiet in the evenings, and friendly staff!  I will definitely be back!

Text: Super clean.  Even the bathroom!  Luxury towels.  Super friendly staff.  Waffles for breakfast with hot coffee and oj. Never will I stay in a "chain" hotel in Kirksville again!
