Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/Oakbrook Terrace
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is located next to Drury Lane which was perfect since we're attend a wedding reception there. The hotel has "quiet house" hours that start at 10:30pm. They require signing and agreement for the quiet hours. There may have been a hotel bar but I'm not sure. The room itself was nice an clean. The air conditioning worked well. The bed was fairly comfortable. All in all nice hotel.

Text: Good location. Well maintained hotel.  Engineering came right up when we had an issue. Good a/c. Front desk could have been a bit more friendly - the only reason we gave it 4 stars instead of five.

Text: Good hotel. Comfortable beds. Really nice pillows. Ate at the restaurant for dinner and breakfast both were very good and food was reasonably priced. Very nice staff. They went above and beyond to help me gather a couple of extra items.
