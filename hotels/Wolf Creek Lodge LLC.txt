Text: I travel all over the US for work. Wolf Creek Lodge has the friendliest people working there that I have ever met. Rooms are extremely clean. Only negative I have is that the beds could use updating. Everything is old, but as previously stated, you are taken care of and you do not have to worry about cleanliness. I will stay here again when I come to town next year. The manager will even wash and fold your clothes for you (small fee). Can't beat it for the area.

Text: We stayed at this older motel for one night, on Jan. 4, 2017.   Paid by credit card....now we have an extra $250. charge on our card.  When I called to ask about it, the clerk snapped, "you  smoked in the room"!   Neither of us smoke!  When I told her that, she said she would sue us if we stopped payment.   Now I have to "dispute" this charge with Visa....and of course it will be her word against ours.  I repeat--WE DO NOT SMOKE.   

My advice to everyone is not to stay at this place or if you do, pay in cash!  We have never been treated like this before.  If a previous person had smoked in that room,  it lingers for a long time....maybe the cleaning person smokes, who knows.  We will sleep on the side of the road before we would stay there again!   Travelers beware.

Text: Very nice quaint small town motel...great staff...if ur looking for something fancy or have high standards then this probably isnt your choice...you'll have to go a bit farther away for that...this place reminds me of like a cabin in a hotel setting.

Text: My husband travels for work and I tag along. I have stayed in alot of hotels and can usually find something to complain about. The staff are wonderful. The room is cleaned every day and they don't miss nothing. The manager and staff take alot of pride in thier work. We will diffanantly stay here in the future.
