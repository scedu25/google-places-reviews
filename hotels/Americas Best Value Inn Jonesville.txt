Text: I travel for work and stay in hotels often and I have never experienced worse customer service. The owner is extremely rude. The rooms are TINY and smell of mildew and cigarettes.  Would never recommend this hotel.

Text: The management sucks! Always complaining about my dog and he is not friendly to the people that stay there! Awesome housekeeper though.

Text: Convenient location right on US-12 (the main road through jonesville, Allen, Quincy & Coldwater). Very fair price, clean room. Tv, iron, table, microwave & fridge. The breakfast is nothing to rave about but you can grab a quick bagel and coffee there or walk across the parking lot to a small local diner that has good food and very reasonable breakfast prices. Although there were many reviews suggesting otherwise I found this to be a comfortable place to stay and spent 4 nights without any complaints!

Text: Great value for the price of you're ok with an older hotel, no complaints, friendly people and service.  Couldn't ever connect to the wifi, but maybe this issue was only during my 3 day stay.
