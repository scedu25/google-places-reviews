Text: Looked very friendly and clean right from the get go! Staff was more than helpful and didn't look like they were angry to be at work, you could tell they enjoyed what they did not matter what their job was. Very clean and nice rooms. Very pleased with overall cleanliness, upkeep and care. It truly showed!

Text: Very pleasant stay here. Front desk was very nice in and out. Room was very comfortable, clean and well kept. The restaurant on a Sunday morning was extremely helpful. Myself and probably 5 other rooms came in to eat at check out time (11:00am) which is when breakfast service ends. Everyone, including the chefs, stayed to serve us with a smile on their face. It was greatly noticed and appreciated. Will highly recommend this hotel for friends and family in the future.

Text: We went there for dinner with 8 other people. No one else was in the restaurant to eat. Our service was very slow and poor. We were not offered water or refills after we finally received water. The server was slow and somehow forgot to put in the order for one person in our group. When she brought out the food she had no idea who ordered what plate so we had to tell her who each plate belonged to. It also took a long time to get our food after we ordered it and no one checked on us to refill our drinks. We had to walk up to the bar to get our own drinks. The only good part was the food tasted very good... once we finally received it.
