Text: The hotel itself was nice. My room was clean. But every time I needed help, which ended up being more than it should've been, I had to stand at the front desk for 10-15 minutes to even be noticed or acknowledged by anyone. Check in took that long. Then went to my room for the first time & the key didn't work. Had to go back & the same thing happened. Then later that night when I came back to my room the key didn't work again, had to stand for awhile waiting again. Great nice cheap hotel, but needs a bell at the desk to ding, or the door to ring when someone walks in so they know someone is there. Because there was never a time where someone was sitting there.

Text: Clean and comfortable. We stopped here on our cross-country road trip. The front desk worker that checked us in was very friendly. The room smelled clean, the bed was comfortable and felt like a newer mattress. The breakfast included was very nice with many options.

Text: Nice quiet stay with a great night sleep. Room was a little dusty. We really enjoyed the hot tub and Continental breakfast.

I have been coming here for years a couple times a year. Good location, plenty to eat and shop around.
