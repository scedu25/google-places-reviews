Text: Warm and welcoming...This was the first B & B I have ever stayed at, I booked it as a surprise for my wife to celebrate her birthday.  I can honestly say we are already planning a return trip, John and Jitka are both wonderful hosts.  The breakfast was wonderful and the room was awesome!!!  Very conveniently located right in between the wonderful wineries and downtown St. Joseph.  I highly recommend Dove Nest if you are considering visiting the area...I know we will be back!

Text: My Fiancé selected the Dove's Nest bed and breakfast for our Valentine's Day getaway! We had a great time! John and Jitka made us feel at home before we arrived by calling to check on our travels. We arrived after dark to find assorted chocolates waiting on the dining table and a lit fireplace in our quaint room! The grounds are serene and idyllic. There were guests that we dined with at breakfast who were on their fourth stay! Our hosts fixed an elegant breakfast everyday and provided us with valuable information about the wine tours. Highly recommended.

Text: I went here on my honey moon, and it was better than expected.
The house it's run in is extremely beautiful, the 3 course breakfast fills you up until dinner time, and very nice owners.
It was a blast staying here, and I wish we could have stayed longer. Would take this over a hotel any day.
