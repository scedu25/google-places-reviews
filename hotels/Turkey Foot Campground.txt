Text: Beautiful spot.  We were the only ones there.  There was a bunch of trash in one site near the creek which is depressing.  If you bring it in, bring it out!  Caught a couple trout.  Just a beautiful area.

Text: Great place to camp with good fishing. 
The only bad things are no cell service or trash dumpsters

Text: Steep hill to get in, and nobody out there on a Tuesday night. And cannot get in or out when River is high, like after a big rain
