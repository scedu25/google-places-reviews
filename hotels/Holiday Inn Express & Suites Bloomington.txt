Rating: 5
Text: I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions for work and it is always been a great stay. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The breakfast is good. And it is located really well for where I need to be. I really recommend this hotel if you were in the area and the place to stay.

Text: The facilities were clean and comfortable. They missed on prep. Tables and chairs were scattered, not prepared for the event. However, parking was ample and easy to locate the hotel.

Text: I came to stay with some friends for a big event in Bloomington and we stayed in a suite sized room. It was 2 beds and a pullout. The whole room was clean and we were able to get to our room easily. The pool and hot tub were very clean and the service was fast and helpful. They had a breakfast in the morning and it was very good. I would definitely stay there again.

Text: The internet WIFI is next to useless - Slow and unreliable. Other than that the hotel and staff are nice. Managers specials are excellent with beer included.
