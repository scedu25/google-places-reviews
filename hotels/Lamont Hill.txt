Text: This was a very pleasant place. The rooms are newly remodeled and everything is so bright! The bathrooms are beautiful with a tiled-walk-in shower and new vanities! We will definitely stay again anytime we are in the area. There is a restaurant on site that smelled delicious and had many cars parked there.(We were there for a family reunion and had food provided at our gatherings, will try the next time we are there.) There is a goldcoruse and driving range attached to the property.

Text: This motel has completely up graded the rooms. I was impressed with our last stay. The restaurant across the lot is good food and very descent prices. I would stay again.
