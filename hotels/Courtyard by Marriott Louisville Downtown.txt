Text: Great hotel with knowledgeable friendly staff. Rooms are large clean and quiet. Breakfast is free and served from 6am-10am. Hotel also has a nice swimming pool great for kids and adults. The location of the hotel is great, located downtown Louisville and only a few mins from southern Indiana. Which makes this hotel ideal for travelers visiting both Louisville and southern Indiana. Overall experience was a 10 out of 10. Would highly recommend this hotel to travlers.

Text: Great location and comfortable, quiet room. Not much of a restaurant for breakfast or dinner, but pretty good selection of dining within walking distance.
