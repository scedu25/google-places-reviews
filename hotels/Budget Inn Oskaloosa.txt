Budget Inn Oskaloosa

Text: One of the worst motel staff I have ever dealt with. I ask when the party in the parking lot will be shut down one a Tuesday none the less. I work at 5am have to be up at 430. The owner starts yelling at me and saying there is no one in the parking lot. I have heard several people and seen many more. Including someone belching past my room. I ask for a refund they give me more scolding. Pay 5 more dollars to stay somewhere else. It's worth it. 0 star rating.

Text: Our room was satisfactory, The bathroom had been remodeled recently and was very nice. The bed should be on there upgrade list, cable tv worked as expected, and the heater worked well, a little noisey but the heat felt good.

Text: Just met my sister-in-law there. She was the one staying the night. Her room looked clean and comfortable. She said it had the highest ratings of any hotel in Oskaloosa, IA. Looks a little rough on the outside, but the rooms look to have been remodeled recently.
