Text: WONDERFUL place!!!   Marie the owner is GREAT!!  The
room was very clean and cozy and decorated beautifully. A basket of assorted goodies was in the room with homemade cinnamon rolls too. Would stay here every time I come to town. Well worth the money. If I could give 10 stars I definitely would.

Text: I've stayed at the Arbor House several times and it was great except the last time I stayed there a year ago, there were dogs barking all night outside our window but I see that the owner posted that the dogs were gone. What a relief! I'm going to try to get a room there after Christmas when I stop to visit an Amish friend of mine. Great place! And the owner is a nice guy too!

Text: I have traveled a lot for my work. And this is the nicest place I've ever stayed. The owner treats you like a friend or family.
