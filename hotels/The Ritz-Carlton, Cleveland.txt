The Ritz-Carlton, Cleveland
Rating: 5
Text: The Ritz Carlton, Cleveland has very spacious rooms. They are currently doing some renovations, but we couldn't tell that from our room. The staff went out of their way to accommodate for the noise by offering earplugs,. Sound machines, and noise cancellation headphones. None of these were needed. The room decor was nice. We had a comfortable bed, which is sometimes hard to find. The updates to the room was nice. Very modern feel. My husband and I came here to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. Our room had complementary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on our arrival. We did have a couple of issues that came up with our room, but they were delt with promptly. Overall a very nice break for us. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Text: Great customer service.  I enjoy going to hotels to go to the restaurants and this is definitely on the same level experience that you get when going to Bar32. Nice time, will return. Thanks

The service was impeccable, as usual and the Mother's Day brunch was spectacular, as usual. The valet parking was outstanding, as usual however my only pain point was an undisclosed Service Fee of 23% added to the bill and highlighted. When I asked the waitress if that was the gratuity she said it wasn't. So, by the time you add 25% for gratuity and pay the service charge (like it's room service) you're actually paying an additional 48%! There are a lot of great restaurants in town with the same service, quality and you'd be saving 23%...
