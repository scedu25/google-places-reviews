Text: Good, clean older motel. Direct contact with friendly owners.  Good air conditioning during the summer. Dish T.V., refrigerator, microwave, continuous hot water. Dog friendly with a large grassed lot behind motel.  Truck stop and good restaurant directly across the street.

Text: Water is hard and there was big ass bugs in our room. My kids was actually willing to sleep in our truck after we killed the first bug. Skin been itching every since we got out the shower. Wouldnt recommend to my worst enemy. A waste of money
