Text: Really nice rooms!  Super pleasant staff.  The internet was very good, too.  The breakfast was yummy.  My only issue with the room was the pillows were pretty uncomfortable.  Other than that, I’d recommend this place to anyone.

Text: Great experience. The room was clean and nicely staged. The fridge was cold. Microwave clean. Well stocked with towels. Plenty of pillows and comfy beds. Would definitely recommend.

Text: At first I thought it was going to be just another hotel room. To my surprise you could tell they really put an effort into cleaning and taking care of their guests. I recommend this to any one who wants a fair priced and clean place to stay!

Text: Dirty hotel and rooms not clean!!! Bathtub was clogged with water and once in the room you couldn't get door open to go out! Switched rooms and then there were 4 beer cans by the bed! No good breakfast items, stink bugs all on ceiling in hallway! Needless to say I will never stay here again!!!

Text: Based off the phone call I just had with the front desk you get a big fat one star!!! My stay is Saturday i guess we will see if the service level gets any better... Ok last post above, apparently someone read the post, they were super nice at the front desk as they should be thanked me for my military service! I liked that. As far as the rooms go, they were clean but smelled old. Service 5 stars, room 0 stars. I only stayed cause of a soccer tournament and the team stayed there.
