Text: They have always been good to us. We been staying every 4 to 6 weeks for almost 2 years. They always give me a good rate! Yea it may not be the best of the best but good for your $... We have a far drive and they always let us check in early, as long as our room is ready as well and also yes when we would bring our dogs they was allowed too...So over all good place

Text: I was there in a conference room for an engagement party. Some folks from out of town stayed. The rooms were ok, nothing fancy. There was mold in the bathroom around the shower. The rooms weren't the cleanest but ok for what they were used for (sleeping only)

Text: The location was great for being such a rural area. There is a well stocked gas station with a pizza place attached right next door!! Walmart down the road and plenty of close places to eat. Rooms where clean and staff polite as well.
