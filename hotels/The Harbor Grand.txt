The Harbor Grand

Text: Wonderful place! We enjoyed out harbor view where we kept the balcony door open to hear the ducks wake us up in time to find the basket left for us by the breakfast ninjas. It was just cool enough to have the fireplace on, very cozy! We hated to leave the room, and with mimosas with breakfast and a Been and Jerry's hot line, why would you need to! The staff were very kind, we can't wait to come back!

Text: I had a town-facing room, that had a sitting room, in addition to the bedroom.  The room was clean and well appointed. I appreciated having the sitting room, because I was travelling with my parents, who had a harbor- facing room across the hall.  Their room was just a bedroom, so it was nice to have a place for us all to sit on the couch and watch TV in the evening. 

This was our second stay at the hotel
 One of the highlights is having breakfast delivered to your door, at the time of your choosing.  My father very much enjoyed the blueberry muffin bread.  

The staff was very helpful. We also liked having coffee and tea available around the clock in the lobby.  

The hotel is well located for the beach, Amtrak and the main street for shopping and dining.  Good for senior citizens as well as other travelers.

Text: The Harbor Grand is a very nice hotel.  The staff was tremendously friendly and helpful.  The room was clean, comfortable, and had a beautiful view of the marina.  The complimentary 'breakfast in bed' was a wonderful touch and quite tasty.  The food and cocktails in the restaurant were top notch.  Frankly, the Harbor Grand is a great reason to visit New Buffalo.  I would highly recommend this hotel.

Text: The suites are very spacious and beds are comfortable. I was also provided with free breakfast - the granola is homemade and delicious. I attended a retreat at the hotel and used the conference room, which was modern and spacious. The only wish I had was for a larger fitness center.
