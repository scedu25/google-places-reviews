Text: A value location with remodeled rooms.  If you are a smoker they have smoking rooms, but if you are not you will smell smoke in the hall way.  Rooms were really nice with a good morning breakfast that is complimentary.   They also have a nice pool open to guests.

Text: We woke up to ants all over the room.  We brought no luggage or anything into our room.  We were so tired we just went straight to bed.  My 7 year old had bites all over her.  Called the front desk and they came and acknowledged the bugs seen everywhere and told me I would have to talk to management. Management was extremely rude and unprofessional. Told me it was a pest problem so he could only give me 20% of my money back.  He kept telling me I was trying to get something out of nothing. I would of had no problem paying if my daughter wasn't full of ant bites.  I took videos of the ants crawling on the bed the night stand and tv stand but for some reason they will not upload.

Text: We were able to get the last room available tonight, so not sure if our Super Extra Firm mattress is characteristic of all rooms or if you're given more choice if you make reservations ahead of time. That aside, their staff was friendly and helpful, I was actually impressed by the shower accommodations having plenty of support bars and a removable shower head, and there are plenty of lights and outlets (including USB ports) and even have nifty reading lights. The breakfast isn't anything special but is appreciated, and my mother would like to point out to those who think the biscuits are too hard that there is a sign saying they need to be warmed.
