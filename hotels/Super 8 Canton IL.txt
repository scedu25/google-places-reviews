Super 8 Canton IL
Rating: 5
Text: My family headed to Canton, Illinois when we received word my aunt was nearing the end of her life.  We called the Canton Motel 6 to see if a room would be available when we arrived at 1:00 in the morning.  We were assured there would be an accommodation available for us.  We were also instructed on how to get immediate attention if no one was at the desk when we arrived.  The budget friendly room was clean and certainly met our needs.  The staff was determined to make sure we had everything we needed from the minute we arrived until the minute we left.  We will certainly stay here during any future visits!

Text: Very inexpensive so I was surprised to see a freshly remodeled room and free breakfast as well. It is out of town a bit so not walking back from any bars.

Text: Value for Money Hotel in Canton Area.
It is a beautiful hotel while we enter into the city of Canton, Illinois. We have stayed here for almost two weeks and really enjoyed this motel. 100% Non-Smoking Property in the town. Morning breakfast is tasty. Our room included a coffee maker, microwave, and small refrigerator
