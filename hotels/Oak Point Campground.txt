Oak Point Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Rustic and spacious site. Main restrooms are decent and maintained. There's a  nice look to the whole place with a few sites with good views of the lake. No mowing going on here, everything looks natural with plenty of border plants.
The hosts were friendly and easy to get along with. 22# of ice sold on the honor system for $5. Not much more than Walmart which is 20 miles away

Text: Clean, quiet, spacious, affordable, water, electric, great newer shower house, nice fire ring, picnic tables, 3 mile bike or walking trail around the pond, seasonal beach and rental boats... only $22 pr day.  Kids loved it and was entertained.  
  The bad... no sewage but they do have a nice dump station exiting the primary campground.  
  We will go back.

Text: Arrived from Texas on 20th Aug to watch the full solar eclipse tomorrow. Campgrounds are full but the site host has been creating makeshift campgrounds anywhere there is a flat plot of ground. Neighboring houses are offering campers to use their lawns. People keep arriving all day long.
Definitely will be a once in a lifetime experience.

Text: This campground is great.  The camp host was very friendly and helpful.  Bathrooms and showers were kept clean.  I only thing that could be changed, the water in the showers was little too hot.  
I would camp here again.
