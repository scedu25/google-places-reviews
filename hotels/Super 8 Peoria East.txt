Super 8 Peoria East
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed for 3nights and had no complaints. The service was friendly and ready to help me at times I needed. The morning breakfast was okay and tasty, and my room was neat and warm. For the price this was a nice experience. My choices was here at Super 8 or Motel 6. This place definitely has my vote. The staff really focused on making me happy! NO COMPLAINTS

Text: Ice box doesn't work great, but overall, a great experience for an overnight stay. Stopped at the Relax Inn in Morton and quickly left. Simply a drug runner/prostitution stop. (Imho). Enjoyed our concert to see Dream Theater at the Peoria Civic center and felt comfy here for the night ?

Text: One of the better Super 8s I've stayed in. Lots of places to eat nearby. Felt safe that National Guard folks doing weekend drills were staying there. Staff was very fun and helpful.

Text: My choices was here SUPER 8 or MOTEL 6 the peices. After seeing Motel 6 reviews. I was quick to choose this place and since I've been here for 3nights I enjoyed every bit of it. I have NO COMPLAINTS. Breakfast was okay as well definitely worth it for the price.

Text: Not happy with the managers’ company vehicle parked in the carport which was designed to assist guests of the hotel. If supplies need to be brought in, perhaps, in thinking of the guests’ needs, they could pick a weekday to do so, not a Friday. Sad to watch as guests struggled with walkers to get themselves inside, can’t imagine how they got their luggage in as well. And to think, we did at one point leave a shining review of this place.
