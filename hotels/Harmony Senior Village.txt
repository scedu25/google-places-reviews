Harmony Senior Village
Rating: 4
Text: My mother lives here. Her apartment allows her to maneuver easily from her wheelchair. There is a good amount of space for 1-2 people. I think hardwood floors throughout would be better for these compared to carpet for the simple fact that alot of the residents in the community use their chairs for mobility and are unable to clean the wheels after coming in from outdoors. The apartment could use a little updating overall, older appliances and light fixtures are currently in place. It's a very safe environment though, and there are emergency pull cords in the bedroom and bathroom for the resident.
