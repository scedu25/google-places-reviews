Text: We loved are visit to Indiana.  We stayed at 
Allen's Motel. We enjoyed are stay. We would have loved to been able to swim there but they didn't have a pool. The park close by had a pool but was way to crowded to swim.
If you had a pool and game room you would 
Draw more people in to stay at you Hotel.
                Thanks, from Marengo, Ohio:)

Text: Very affordable and comfortable.  I've been there a lot of times,  and always felt welcomed.  I appreciated all of their hospitality. Love fishing Linton.  But it's getting dangerous because of all of the vehicle break ins while out  fishing at the pits.
