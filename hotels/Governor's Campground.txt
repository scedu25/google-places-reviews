Governor's Campground
Rating: 3
Text: Quiet, peaceful, and relaxing.the grass, trees, etc were well maintained. Bathrooms need attention, and the men's showers were locked all weekend. This place has great potential if someone would spend a little money, and hire someone that cared to take care of the place
