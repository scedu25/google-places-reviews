Carriage House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: A last-minute cancelation occurred, so I was blessed to be able to stay here. Beautiful home, cozy accommodations, excellent (and filling) breakfast! Coffee available round the clock in the sitting area outside the rooms in the sleeping quarters. Abundant classic Victorian features with a bit of modern added in.
