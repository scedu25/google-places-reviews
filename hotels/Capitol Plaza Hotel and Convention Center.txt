Capitol Plaza Hotel and Convention Center

Text: The rooms were nice. The conference rooms were hot. The food was poor, do not waste your money of companies money. The Wi-Fi was slow, as well. It could have been all of the people on it, but the hotel should know the limits.

Text: Upon checkout first guy was rude. I went to him to check in and he said, "I can't help you, go to him it wasn't what he said, it was the way he said it. The check in went smoothly. The room was clean, but dark and missing light bulbs. Had to call twice for a bulb to actually arrive. Didn't look at all like the photos. Only small pillows on the bed. Called for covers for the sofa bed, lady was upset when bringing it.

Text: I attended the conference for Missouri government technology. The weight staff were very friendly and helpful. The lunch served from the kitchen at the conference was very tasty. The hotel with its very large indoor atrium was attractive and clean and well kept. Would definitely go for a conference or schedule a conference of my own there.

Text: Was able to join an old friend for a quick drink at the Capitol Plaza Hotel Bar the other day!! The atmosphere was fun and added to our meeting with out being intrusive into our conversation or time together. Prices were very reasonable and we couldn't have had a better time!!

Text: I came here for a convention. The space is nice. Rooms are fairly basic, but fine. I do wish breakfast was included, but it's extra. That said, the food is great.
