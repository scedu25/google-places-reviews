Text: This place was clean relaxing and the views from the trails was amazing. Down side loud people camping and partying. Needs to have some more sheriff?s patrolling after ten..wild life was great the racoons know when to get food..

Text: The campground itself was a pretty neat little campground I was expecting something a little more remote seeing how it is located on the map out away from hardball roads (not a bad thing). I would have liked it if the campsites sat off the actual road a little further the area is beautiful and the sites are clean and easily accessible to a small trailer but the proximity of the other sites made trying to get some sleep a little tough while kids from other sites were running all over the place throughout the night (I did the same thing as a kid so no hurt feelings from me.) All and all we really enjoyed our stay I was hoping for a little more seclusion between sites but I would go back again anytime...

Text: A great campground. No services, but if you're hiking the area or passing through it is a great stop. If coming from the North, the road has a creek to Ford (concrete).

Text: Awesome clean and organized campgrounds! The camp sites are far enough appart as to not bother your neighbors but close enough if you needed something. Super clean with no litter, locking trashcans along camp road. Vaulted toilets have TP in them. The creek is cold and super clear! Only downside is that the racoons definitely know where to find food. They will claw at your coolers and rob you of any trace of food. Best lock your food in your car. Otherwise 10/10 perfect escape from the stress of daily life!
