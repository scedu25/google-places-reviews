Text: We were very happy with our stay. The staff was so nice, always greeting you with a hello, Heather at the front desk  went out of her way to be helpful and friendly. The front lobby and breakfast area was newly remodeled, there was new carpet in the hall ways, the rooms were clean and freshly painted with newer decor. We will defiantly stay there again next year.

Text: The service was great, there was a lot more in the room than I was expecting. Only problem was, due to having few rooms open, we were put in a smoking room. Not fun for the kids. Otherwise it was pretty good

Text: If I could give negative stars I WOULD!!! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Blankets are 30 year old gold blankets with those little fuzzy balls on it because they're so old. Felt like we were going to fall through the bathroom floor. The sink in the bathroom was clogged when I brushed my teeth and had black stuff floating up out of it. The room smelled old and musty.... carpet was old and matted and crusty, chairs were stained. Beds are a cardboard box with sheets..... this was on Monday when we stayed in room 112. Paid $63 total monday... so not worth it...Wednesday when I tried to check in... i tried to use CLC, they told me they use paper and it's mailed in and we both had to have a card and it would have been $58. We then tried online it said rooms for $52 - $63 with fees.... miraculously, it wouldn't allow us to check in online.... so the guy in front of us she told the rooms were new and remodeled. Poor guy... and then she gave him the room for $61 with tax. She proceeds to tell me for me it will be $62. $72 with tax and fees.... and I told here there were 3 prices less than $63, she told me she could do none of them, it was $72. I told her we'd go somewhere else. She told me fine. We walked out. Worst customer service and hotel I've stayed at in a long time and I travel for a living. DO NOT STAY HERE!! Went to the motel 6 that was 9 minutes down the road for $55 with CLC. Great rooms. Clean, comfortable, remodeled. $17 cheaper than their rates. WORTH the drive and pleasant employees.
