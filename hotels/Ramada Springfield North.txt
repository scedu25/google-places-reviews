Text: If you want to be annoyed during the morning, afternoon, and evening, book here. The fitness center is on the second floor and the rooms next to it vibrate when they use the treadmill. You can feel and hear every weight slam down. The bed shakes and he sounds drive you crazy. The worst experience I’ve ever had in any hotel my entire life. Why would any hotel book these rooms with such a horrible experience. A ‘motel’ would probably rate better than the experience here. Stay away!

Text: This is a wonderful small hotel across from the IL Capital. It is within walking distance of many of Springfield's tourist destinations. The rooms had nice touches not found in others. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. In fact, one lady worked for the visitor center and was a font of information. Free parking and a nice breakfast are included in the very reasonable room cost.

Text: Nice, clean hotel. Comfortable beds.  They had the normal breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage etc. The best part was they had real salsa, not the little packets which put on the scrambled eggs and sausage made it better.  But no bacon. The staff was courteous and professional.
