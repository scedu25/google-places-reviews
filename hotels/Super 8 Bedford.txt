Super 8 Bedford
Rating: 2
Text: This is definitely a 2 star hotel. The staff is great, but little things that make for a nice hotel stay are few at this hotel. Bath towels are so thin and small you can barely call then bath towels. There is no elevator to the second floor and no center staircase. One must enter from either end of the building from the outside to get to the second floor rooms. The hotel is clean, but feels dirty. I think that comes from age. Overall, we were comfortable, but I would choose a 2 2/2 star over this one.

Text: Very much enjoying the stay . The staff were extremely helpful as well as the cleaning staff. Rooms are average. The location was close to several places to eat and store. The down side was the noise from upstairs

Text: Have not one single complaint. Hotel was very clean, with no smoke smell. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Rates for 2 queen beds was very reasonable. Had to be there for bereavement purposes. Super 8 made it that much simpler. Thank you so much.

Text: It is as good as I expected for the low price. We only needed a night for driving by. There is a microwave and a mini fridge in room. Clean pool, simple free breakfast. I would have rated 5 if our bathroom was not smelly.
