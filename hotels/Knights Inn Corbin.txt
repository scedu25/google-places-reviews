King bed, new reclining chair, a lot of space, micro, frig, newer tv, continental breakfast and the most friendly people!!!  See ya next travels.

Text: I had been driving since daylight and needed to sleep, I had a dog with me so it had to accept pets. I should have just slept in my car. Bed was rock hard and room was dirty. Sheets had burn holes and it was totally out of date, like I mean it looked like a room from 1970. I slept in my clothes as well as my shoes. People next door were fighting all night. I left at the crack of dawn and just left the key at the front desk. This is a very seed unsafe feeling place and reminds me of a place prostitute's would bring their clients.

Text: Come here to meet up with my bf. It's a nice, small and quiet place. Rooms are clean except for floors.

Text: Although the owner was pleasant, the room was an old, worn out, demolishable disaster. There were bugs, cigarette burns on the dingy sheets, and the smoke detector had a trail of black soot leading to the drooping ceiling. The bathroom was tiny and moldy and the toilet was about one foot from the ground and not big enough for anyone's behind. The A.C. hardly worked and smelt of expired dairy. I have never stayed in such a terrible facility in the First World.
