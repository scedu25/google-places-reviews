Text: Nice room. Fair price. No elevator to the second floor so if stairs are a problem, be sure to ask for a ground floor room.

Text: Convenient to where we were visiting.  Clean and quiet, reasonable price, no elevator though... :(   The pillows were a little flat so we asked for 2 additional and the a/c unit was off when we came in the room so it was very stuffy and warm on a 90+ degree day. It didn't take long to cool down though.

Text: Very nice people very clean sort of out of the way would not have found it unless we ask the Phillips 66 down the street where to go.

Text: Have stayed lots of places from high end to why did we stay here, out of all of the others, this stay rated very high. Room was very clean, staff was super friendly and location was great for my stay.
