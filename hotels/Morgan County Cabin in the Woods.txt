Morgan County Cabin in the Woods
Rating: 5
Text: Words can not describe this cabin in the woods. Beautifully nestled in the woods off the beaten path. A home like furnishing, warm and clean and cozy.  Has all the amenities for short or long term stay. I woke to deer on the front green space drinking from the pond and natures noises surrounding us.  Fire pit to use. Connie and Ansel were great to deal with. Warm and friendly. Very accommodating for our romantic getaway in Ohio.

Text: Beautiful and serene!  The fully-furnished cabin is beautiful on the inside, and sits in a beautiful clearing in the woods.  My wife and I spent our anniversary there, and are planning to go back soon with the family!  If you're looking for peace and renewal, this is the place to find it.
