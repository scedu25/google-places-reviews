Text: Good hotel. Nothing stood out as exceptional, but nothing was bad either. Room was clean and comfortable. Parking was sufficient. My only complaint is that upon check-in and check-out, I had to stand at the counter for a bit and wait for an employee to show up.

Text: Very nice rooms. Quiet but full service establishment. Staff and helpful and courteous. On-premise restaurant with bar is nice, food is good - especially breakfast!

Text: Good stay, nice hotel. Just wish you could plug an xbox into the tvs. This is a location that blocks HDMI input unfortunately.

Text: The room was clean & neat.  TV programing left a lot to be desired for me.  Airport near by, however, not bothered with plane noise.  Food a bit pricey l thought.  Very decent air conditioning.  Bed pass or fail; pass...
