Days Inn Paxton

Text: It gets an extra star because the air conditioner worked. A/C was very loud though. The room looked clean enough but I just got a creepy feeling here. Breakfast wasn't much. It consisted of a few factory donuts, factory eggs that could be heated in the microwave, and English muffins, not much else. I passed on breakfast. There's a convenience store attached to the motel. If you need gas, it was $.38 cheaper 20 miles down the road at Ogallala. The price was $72 plus $20 for my dog. I've had better rooms for half that.

Text: There are some non descript bugs in the rooms? They're not bed bugs, just ... dead bugs. In the carpet, on the bed sheets, in the shower. Just feels very unclean. Breakfast is cold and you can tell some of the food has been sitting out for days and is about to rot.

Text: Very pleasant owner convenience store has pretty much everything you need on property. Room very clean and comfortable. Most importantly very quiet.

Text: Room was a little high priced, got mixed stories over the phone about payment.  Basic breakfast was better than some, but outdated products and milk was a little old.

Text: I didn't know any hotels still offered rooms where smoking is allowed. This one does. We got screwed by Hotwire on this one. Not very clean, some maintenance issues (do they know how easy it is to replace a toilet flapper?).
