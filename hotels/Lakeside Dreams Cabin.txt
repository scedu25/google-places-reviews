Text: The mattresses were so terrible I couldn't sleep.  Its was like sleeping in a hammock made of hard springs pressing on your pressure points all night long.  Not to mention you couldn't move without making everyone else up from the loud squeaking coming from them.  Also, while the floors had been swept, they had not been cleaned/mopped.  After going barefoot for about 20 minutes the soles of my feet were black!  Thick layers of dust covered almost everything above arms reach.
The views were very nice and the lake was neat.  There was a canoe, but no paddles.  Sad part is, those mattresses didn't get that bad over night, nor did the dust get that bad.  Just a little upkeep would have meant the difference between terrible and fantastic.
