Text: Clean rooms, reasonably priced.  The continental breakfast could use some help, very few options.  Indoor/outdoor pool is nice, we'll kept.

Text: We stayed here for 3 nights. The room was very clean along with the hotel. We had a good time here. Stephanie, the front desk clerk was very nice and accommodated us by letting us use the patio for a family gathering along with the use of the hotel grill. We were from New York and had a very large group of children. They truly enjoyed themselves and we did also, thank you

Text: Nice enough, nothing fancy but can tell it's been remodeled fairly recent.

Text: Rooms were absolutely great. The beds are a little firm, but that's ok. The pool is indoor/ outdoor, and the water was lovely. All in all, I'd absolutely go back to this place if i needed to.
