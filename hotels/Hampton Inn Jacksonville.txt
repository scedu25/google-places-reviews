Hampton Inn Jacksonville

Text: Convenient location, comfortable room. Room had a walk-in shower, which we prefer, instead of tub and curtain. Breakfast was typical - we could find something to eat, but would have liked more.

Text: Friendly staff and a great hot breakfast. The room was clean and updated. The pool was sufficient, but could use a refresh. Probably one of the best options in town for a place to stay.

Text: Awesome experience! Best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Night manager was terrific and extremely helpful. I needed handicapped accessible bathroom. It was perfect and so helpful moving around the restroom. I will never stay at another hotel.

Text: It was an excellent stay. The room was clean, breakfast was great but the best part was Angie. Angie works the front desk at night and she went out of her way to help me fix an internet issue. She made my stay.

Text: Nice, very quiet, clean, good staff. Pool and exercise room. The internet service connectivity is below average for the whole area it seems. I knocked it down from 4 stars to 3 because of the internet issue they want you to buy 'premium' Wi-Fi at $4.99 per day which would be a free service anywhere else. Too bad because it is really a nice clean place. Beds and cleanliness are exceptionally good! Expect a great nights sleep here.
