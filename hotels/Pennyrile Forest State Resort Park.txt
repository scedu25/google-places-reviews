Text: Had a wonderful stay for a wedding, stayed in the cottages, which for a state park were great. The lodge was beautiful they had a fireplace, nice dining room in which the breakfast was delicious. The hiking trails were beautiful as well as views of the lake. The wedding setting was beautiful, the staff did an amazing job. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Wifi was not bad for the location. A hidden gem for sure.

Text: We go here all the time. Sometimes for a nice quiet hike in the woods, sometimes we go for the dinner at the lodge. They staff is very friendly and the view from the rooms is amazing. They also rent out cabins which are very nice. This is truly a hidden treasure in Western Kentucky.

Text: I can only comment on the public beach, but it is great! The bathrooms were clean. Actually the entire beach was clean. It's a family friendly place and we had a blast swimming. The water is actually very clean for lake water, and there was lots of shade to escape to if we needed it. The canoe, kayak and paddle boat rental looked fun, but we were not there for that. We will definitely be back!

Text: The campground is well kept and the bath house is clean. They do claim to have Wi-Fi but that is only at the lodge and cottages. You are cut off from the world in the campground because there is no cell service service on any carrier. We had phones with Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.

Text: I spent an afternoon at the park and it was quite lovely. I swam don't by the beach and then had dinner in the lodge up the hill. The food was quite nice. The only negative part is there is no phone service at all, and the park wifi is only accessible by those with pass codes. But besides that it was lovely.
