Best Western Greenfield Inn

Text: My mom passed away so We made reservations at this hotel on line. When we arrived to check in I was told that I selected a wrong arrival date and my card was charged as a no show. I was already upset about my mom and when I explained why Laurie spoke with the MGR Mary and they said not to worry. They carried my payment forward and up graded our room. They were very compassionate and their level of customer service was greatly appreciated. We ended up staying 5 days. I would stay at this hotel again. It was clean, comfortable, and minutes away from shopping and dining. Thank you Mary & Laurie.

Text: The Best Western Greenfield was a perfectly fine place to spend a night. The pool was nice. The beds are comfortable and the rooms were clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was no breakfast, but there is a full-service restaurant on site. If you need a place to stay for a night in the Allen Park area you can't go wrong with this hotel.

Text: The location is convenient, right off the highway and close to Henry Ford Museum. Surroundings are a bit rough, but the entire property is fenced in with only one entrance at night, so I felt safe. Public spaces were clean, well lit. The layout is a little tricky to navigate, but there is close parking for most rooms. Carpet in room was old, stained. The rest of the room was comfortable, clean, had mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker!

Text: Updated  lighting in hallways has improved the interior appeal.  Older hotel with charm.  Clean and comfortable room.  Bathroom was spacious and clean.  Restaurant served good food during breakfast hours.  Lounge was nice.  Coffee available in lobby was a plus.  Enterprise Drive needs to be resurfaced!

Text: Another wonderful stay!  Love the cozy pub with Mary the World's Greatest Bartender.  Decent food that is reasonably-priced.  Great pool and lovely courtyard with gazebos and flowers.  Windows in the rooms open so you can enjoy fresh air.  And a charming and warm atmosphere throughout the property with lovely prints of antique cars.  The best value in the Detroit area!
