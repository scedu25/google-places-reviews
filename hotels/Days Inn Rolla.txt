Days Inn Rolla

Text: Although the reservations I made online well in advance & confirmed directly with the hotel in advance turned out not to be the 2 king bed rooms but queen beds, better than sleeping in the car, I guess. There were other issues, for example, the unpainted patch in the sheetrock wall and general worn out feel of the place. Oh, and don't believe there's a pool, hasn't been there for a while, although some hotel booking sites still show it.

Text: Employees, inclung the manager (Mike Patel, I think) were not pleasant. Door did not close all the way. Bathroom fan cover was off and looked disgusting. Microwave did not work. We spent a ton of time trying to get the satellite box to work. It would work, but go out a few minutes later and kept doing this until it went out completely. Went to ask for 2 towels and 2 wash cloths at the frint desk, he only handed me one wash cloth. Couldn't correct him because he was on what sounded like a personal call. The only reason i stayed here is because my usual hotel (Super 8, I highly recommend it) was booked. I will NOT be staying here again. The only good thing is that they had a decent breakfast and the fridge worked really well (although it did freeze our drinks) and the shower was hot.
