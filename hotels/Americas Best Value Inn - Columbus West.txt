Text: Check in and check out was super easy and quick with the drive thru window. Very affordable price for an overnight stay. Free breakfast was small and had little option but I guess you get what you pay for

Text: You would think with reports of 1, 2 and 3 years running that the city of Columbus would have shut this disgusting place down!

The place seems to be cleaner than it used to be.  Haven't found any bug remains.  They now give a nice bar of soap for the shower.  It's still pretty much a dump.

If I weren't required to stay here for work....
