Text: Stayed here when my air conditioner went out when it was over 100 deg. This place was clean with a fridge and microwave. Most importantly the air was nice and cold. They are also pet friendly.

Text: Lady who checked me in was awesome and very friendly!! The Indian man who checked me out was rude and hatefull. Motel was in bad need of repair bed was broke down and uncomfortable pillows smelled of sweet and what looked like blood was all over the mattress bathroom smelled like urine if your a big person do not stay here the bathroom is so small you can not sit on the toilet and I'm not that big. Sign say breakfast until 10 am  but was already put up at 8:30 if put out at all. All in all a nice old motel that has been run down by bad management and not properly cleaned by house keeping. So sad!!

Text: Very soft and comfortable bed with nice front desk staff. Rooms are clean. We only stayed there 1 night after a concert but I slept better than I have in many hotel rooms. I would definitely recommend them.
