Days Inn Harrodsburg

Text: This place is so out dated. The hallway smell like urine. The room stinks. The towels are hard and stained. Let's not get started about the pool. The only reason someone should stay here is if you were stranded. VERY VERY NASTY OVER PRICED.

Text: Room wasnt the type I reserved, no towels in room or bedding for pull out. Thin walls. Front desk super friendly.

Text: I do not recommend this motel. There are bed bugs, there is a bad smell in the hallway & I witnessed what looked like drug deals in the parking lot!
