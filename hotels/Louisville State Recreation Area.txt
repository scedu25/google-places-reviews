Text: Great place for tent or RV/Trailer camping.  Bathrooms are handicap accessible with plumbing.  Shower facilities have a few at each area that are handicap accessible.  I take my family here quite a bit during the summer.  The only down side is a train track that runs on the west side of the campground and the first night if light sleeper you may get awoken by the noise but you get use to it quickly.  Bring your fishing gear multiple lakes and the river to fish in with nice size cat and bass.

Text: Love going camping and fishing here with my family. It not too far from Omaha. Reasonably priced, and quiet. Holidays it is difficult to find an electric plot for a camper, otherwise this is a GREAT place to get away for the weekend.

Text: Lots of great campsites. The swimming area is fun with a big sandy beach. The bathrooms have coin operated showers. There are a lot of trains that go by.

Text: Probably a nice place to visit during the day, but don't expect to sleep much at the campground: there is a railway right next to the Park with a train every 20 minutes almost all the time, day and night. And good luck finding your campsite! The layout is horrid. The place is clean though, and good facilities.
