Text: Hello. This hotel is clean and the staff were very friendly. The hotel staff asked if we needed more towels because we went for a swim. (That was very thoughtful and helpful.) The town is small and quiet. I enjoyed the peace. Thank you for the great experience. My family had a nice visit. •Emily, Logan,Cheyenne and baby Susie

Text: Brand new carpet, fresh paint and nice rustic theme. Clean lobby and room. Hotel overall had a nice, no odor (no smoke smell, no new paint smell, etc) Nice smelling complimentary soap/shampoo. Comfy bed. A/C worked great.  Small microwave and fridge in room. Two sinks. And the included simple breakfast items - including waffle machine - in the lobby were a nice perk. Definitely a nice place to get a good night's rest while traveling at a reasonable price.

Text: Arrived at 11pm. Desk clerk was okay. She seemed bored with life, wasn't pleasant or friendly but quickly checked us in/out and was polite. Owner or manager's small child was running through the place yelling while we were checking in but seemed to be headed to their private quarters. Room was mostly clean, bathroom wall needed to be scrubbed, shower was clean. Had a standard king size motel bed, nothing fancy. It had a fully zippered mattress protector (My guess, it was less than 12 months old and put in after prior reviews of bed bugs. We didn't find any during our stay.), a mattress pad, another layer of what looked like felt or wool, fitted sheet, top sheet, blanket (all clean and bright white), and green coverlet with stains. When we first entered the room it was humid and extremely warm. It took a couple of hours for it to cool down but by morning we were cold. We skipped the continental breakfast in favor of a hot meal later in the morning.

Text: Interesting hunting related decor, helpful and professional staff. Room was a good temperature and came with breakfast. Good waffle maker. They have a few maintenance issues though, like the broken lamp leaning in the corner and the water dial in the shower was broken.
