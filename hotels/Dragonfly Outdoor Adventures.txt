Dragonfly Outdoor Adventures

Text: My kids and I loved this adventure.   3 kids and the youngest is 8.  I rented 2 tandem kayaks, the two oldest in one and the youngest and I in the other.  We had a lot of fun and the staff was so helpful.  They were a whole lot better kayaks then what I rented at Greenbo lake state park

Text: Outstanding, place to be. Great place to learn how to kayak or for the more skilled adventurer. We went toward the ohio river, but you can head toward the lake as well. My husband Rick and I felt very welcomed, and can't wait to rent the cabin...make sure to see what events are planned. We were invited for a spectacular 4th of July celebration next summer. ..so looking forward to seeing everyone there ...

Text: Dragonfly Outdoor Adventures is a perfect spot to get back to the greatness of nature. You can rent a kayak or canoe and paddle the Little Sandy River all the way to the mouth of the Ohio. Afterwards, enjoy a picnic at the shelter house- they have charcoal grills you may use as well. There are basic restroom facilities on site. You also can check out the beautiful cabin they have for rent. This place is jam packed with really neat features- ask about the amusement park horn they have installed! Great place for family and friends to visit and unwind. Call the hosts Myra or Sandy and they can fix you up with whatever you desire- super nice people who go out of their way to make sure your event is spectacular!
