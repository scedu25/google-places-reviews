Text: Fantastic location and stay. Staff were friendly and the food was very good. Typical standard rooms with comfortable beds. Pool was a little smaller than expected, but still was good for young kids.

The main thing I loved about it was the customer SERVICE... not even the room the pool the food which were all very well... but customer service beats all of THAT hands down!! Keep up the GREAT SERVICE! Springfield?? We all belong to God no matter our color.
