Baymont Inn & Suites Iowa City / Coralville
Rating: 5
Text: Check-in and check-out was quick and easy. The room was overall clean, functional, and presentable with no visible wear in the furniture or carpet. The continental breakfast was very good. The only mark against it is that there was some visible dust where the carpet met the wall (which essentially amounted to what would be left behind by a vacuum without an attachment to get into corners)

Text: For the price you really can’t ask for much more. It was just average. The rooms were decent and the breakfast spread was okay. There was this one guy that I think is the manager who hovered a LOT which wasn’t cool and I kind of think they don’t care much for overweight people because he kept giving me looks and there was a notice that said dining room weight capacity which is kind of odd. Anyway I’d probably stay again because of the price but not much more than that.

Text: This hotel was great. The room we had was very clean and had a lot of room. Then we decided to eat breakfast there and they had a lot of different foods for breakfast. I've never been to a hotel that had eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, French toast, waffles, donuts, bagels, and the list goes on. Usually hotels have the normal waffles and cereal but not a lot of hot breakfast foods. I was very impressed. I would stay there again and the cost for one night was pretty cheap in my opinion. I'm surprised they didn't charge more.

Text: Decent hotel. Some renovations done but not finished. The room was ok. Kinda smelled like cleaner. The breakfast buffett was really good and the employees were helpful and nice.

Text: Room was fine for the price. Hotel seemed somewhat run down but nothing was particularly bad. Breakfast had a good selection and the food was good for hotel food. I would probably stay again.
