Quality Inn & Suites Columbus West - Hilliard
Rating: 3
Text: We've stayed here a few times now. It's reasonably clean and the staff is nice. Unfortunately, some of the non smoking rooms share a floor with smoking rooms, so the smell lingers.

Text: The quality inn in Columbus is about 15 minutes away from the ohio state university. The rooms are nice an cozy. Breakfast is your standard breakfast. The hotel service is really good

Text: Worst customer service I have ever had. Please don’t give Neal your business. He didn’t honor a month old reservation rate and charged 1 of 4 rooms higher than the rest

Text: Terrible customer service, dirty room, and NO POOL! Front desk "worker", and I use that term worker loosely, sat in the lobby at a table for a good 2 hrs reading a book. At 5:30 pm we had a large group (paying customers) in the lobby having dinner and watching a baseball game together. The "worker" told our group not to make a mess because she already cleaned. She also told us where we could throw our pizza boxes away, which was in the dumpster at the back of the hotel. When the "worker" was finished reading her book and eating her food she ordered, she decided to take the remote from us, change the channel and watch some television. I think the paying customers at this hotel don't seem to be a big priority, at all. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT COMING HERE!!!
