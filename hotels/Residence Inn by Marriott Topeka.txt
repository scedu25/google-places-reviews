Residence Inn by Marriott Topeka
Rating: 5
Text: Coming to the end of a 6 week stay. This place has made me feel more at home than any other hotel. Management is always available to help with any need. They always have a smile on their faces. Curtis has been great to all 18 of us. He is kind and educated when it comes to places to visit in Topeka. I will never stay any where that is not an establishment of Marriott. Im sad to be leaving Topeka and its mostly because I am leaving what I considered a second home.

Text: I sincerely enjoyed my stay at the Residence Inn Topeka, KS.  I am certain you will too!!  The staff was extremely kind and sincere.  Whatever you needed the staff followed through with impeccable speed!!  Every morning hot fresh eggs along with a breakfast meat. Coffee 24hr seven days a week.  The housekeeping staff were remarkable.  Rooms are large with king -size  beds and a let out couch. At least that was the type of room I was in.   Great for a family with children.  Kitchenette has all you need.  No stoves, but who needs a stove while traveling.  Monday-Thursday appetizers were served all you can eat style.  Not to mention the awesome grill that anyone can use on the patio at any time. You like swimming, relaxing in a  hot jacuzzi and need to work out while on away from home?  They have it for you.   Hotel is near everything you need, in terms of dinning, shopping and close to the highway that leads to many historic sights surrounding the city.  When you visit tell them Stevie says hi!!  You will not regret your visit.  I  rate this hotel and my visit with a 10++ 
Thanks Residence Inn Topeka

Text: Just what you would expect from Residence Inn. Beautifully furnished rooms like a small efficiency apartment. Plenty of restaurants and shopping close by. We staid on the 2nd floor on the East end and the highway noise was a little more than I like to hear. If we had asked for another room away from the highway  (my bad) I'd of given them 5 stars.

Text: Great rooms, was upgraded to a suite and was one of the nicer, cleaner properties. Went to the happy hour and an actually pretty good meal. I would stay here again if I was in Topeka, especially cause other coworkers did not have great experiences at the other Marriott properties in Topeka.

Text: Nice quiet place to stay. Friendly staff and they have a fair breakfast. The suites are roomy and nice. It could use more parking and vending machines. The location is ideal since you are close to shopping and restaurants.
