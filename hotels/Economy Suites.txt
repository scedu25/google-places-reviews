Text: First impressions: This place reminds me of a beach rental in a good way. For 1100 a month which is half the cost of value place and way better about booking a room you get a full kitchen, full living room and seperate bedroom. I love the kitchen and bathroom tiles, they put some work into them.  You can also add a 2nd bedroom for 200 more. The rooms are clean and fully furnished. The furniture is decent and plentiful. The kitchen comes with a set of silverware, plates, kitchen sink caddy, some glasses and other kitchen essentials.
   I only wish parking was plentiful and that you had your own balcony. They have a coin laundry facility on site with a cute hang out room with a small kitchenette, couches, tv, treadmill and foosball and pool table. The staff is friendly. Theres a nice farmers market near by and a DQ. As a nice bonus there are a few nice sitting areas outside and each apartment has its own ash tray bucket.

After a month of staying:
