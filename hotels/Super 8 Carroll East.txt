Text: This Super 8 has been completely remodel. Super clean, super nice and the staff is quite friendly. Indoor heated pool and hot tub! I would highly recommend this Super 8 to travelers. The nicest one I've been in so far!! ?

Text: This hotel was pretty good, clean room. My only problem was that the switches on the wall turned off the outlets to the lamps, which also have outlets for your things. I woke up to all of my stuff dead because I thought I was just turning off the lights..

Text: Nice price, clean updated room. Stay on second floor, you can hear people walking from the first floor very easily.
