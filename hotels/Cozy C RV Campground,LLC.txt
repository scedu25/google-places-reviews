Text: Cleanest restrooms on our travels. Level site,cable tv was a plus.used the laundry room and it was clean and reasonable. Water pressure was low to begin with until I removed my inlet pressure regulator,came up to normal then. Looked close and noticed supply line for water already had a regulator installed.Low point was wi-fi access, very weak if at all.
