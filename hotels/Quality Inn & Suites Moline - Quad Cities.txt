Quality Inn & Suites Moline - Quad Cities
Rating: 2
Text: Wouldn't stay more than one night.  The bathroom had a drop ceiling and no ventilation fan; which probably means there was mold in the drop ceiling. The bathroom was the worst part of the room.
The main sleeping area was fine. Newer furniture and a comfortable bed. Not bad for one night's sleep.
The main lobby looked great, and breakfast was the standard at most hotels. 
Overall, I would not stay here again unless I knew the bathrooms had been updated.
