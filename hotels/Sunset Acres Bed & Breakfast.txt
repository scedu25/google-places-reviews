Sunset Acres Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: This bed and breakfast is amazing. I was looking for a relaxing, quiet getaway for my wife's 30th birthday and this place hit it out of the park. Brenda and Bill are some of the most accommodating hosts, and Brenda's cooking is mouth watering, from the fresh Belgian waffles with homemade caramel sauce, to the fremch toast filled with cream cheese and homemade marmalade, each meal was to die for. The setting was perfect; the quiet countryside with lake/pond out front was beautiful each sunset. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.

Text: We stayed three nights.  The breakfasts were fantastic! (Waffles with cherry almond sauce, creme brulee french toast, quiche, plus meats and egg dishes)  With breakfast on the deck, we watched the hummingbirds. The pool and hot tub were very relaxing.  The setting is beautiful.
