Text: Been here a week and staying another 3 weeks. The owners are very friendly and offered lots of advise for food and shopping. Nice and quiet (aside from the wedding this last weekend but hey congrats to them!). Good pet-policy and friendly neighbors. Beautiful campground, best landscape I've seen yet!

Text: Nothing for the kids to do, we were there for a month. I had to take the kids places to do things as there were no activities. You also have to pay to fish and you can't keep them. The people that we camped next to were great and I think about them often but I'm sorry we will never be back. So sad! Go somewhere else!
