Text: Really enjoyed our stay, family get together, 3, 30 ft travel trailers, roomy sites, easy access, beautiful place. Owner and staff friendly helpful and accommodating. New owners working hard every day to bring it back to its former glory. 5 hours from home, worth the drive we will be back!!

Text: Don't rent the barn! They have had issues with the restrooms for years. We heard that they had problems, so we asked the manager about it and she denied it. We rented a portable restroom trailer for the wedding just in case, and it's a good thing we did! Toilets overflowed before 10 guests had arrived and we were told their plumber was 5 hours away. Anyone who couldn't climb the steps into the rented restroom had to be carted down the road to another restroom. The roof leaked onto the head table, no one even turned the lights on for us while we were setting up. The "manager" was deliberately unhelpful through the whole process. They rent this place out KNOWING that the sewer will overflow.
