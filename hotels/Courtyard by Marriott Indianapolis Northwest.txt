Rating: 4
Text: Not my favorite courtyard, but still nice. Bistro is good for breakfast if you don't mind paying a bit. Room was clean but the ceilings are oddly low.

Text: We came in for the Brickyard 400. Very solid Courtyard. The rooms are modern, and the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. The only issue was that our room had a musty smell to it that was very unpleasant. Other than that I was happy with this hotel.

Text: Updated public areas, but the rooms are lacking. Rooms are clean, but do not have standard amenities like refrigerator and microwave. The TV's are on the smaller size and work poorly as they are based off digital antenna signal. Workout facility was tiny and did not have sanitizer wipes for the equipment or large towels or exercise mats for the floor
