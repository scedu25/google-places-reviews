Hampton Inn Grand Island
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms are clean and very comfortable. Staff is knowledgeable, polite, and hapoy. Breakfast is above average, especially for a Continental breakfast. The only complaint is that the fridge in our room was noisy and the a/c heater unit was run down and seemed to have two temps: hot and freezing. Great stay all around. Would recommend.

Text: This hotel was a great value. We had two queen beds and a sofa and everyone slept comfortably. There's an indoor swimming pool, which was perfect after a long car ride. The room was quiet and I didn't hear any other people. Front desk was polite. I'd stay here again.

Text: It is a pretty standard Hampton Inn. The pool and hot tub were nice - the hot tub was a bit colder than usual though. The only really downside point was that the mattress was really not very comfy. We were in a whirlpool suite though, so maybe it doesnt get used very often.

Text: This review is unfair, but it is my experience. The hotel was nice enough and breakfast was perfectly reasonable... Frankly the hours for breakfast were better than many. Unfortunately, our smoke detector in our room began chirping at 530 in the morning and maintenance would "get to it". The hotel was booked so there was no other room to get to so we ended up in the room for about 6 hrs total because of the smoke detector.
