Text: Great hotel. Clean. Updated and good location.  Would have given it a 5 star if the price wasn't so high.  Not a good value at that price and no free breakfast. Weird thing about the room doors.  They only open just past half way and stop. They do not open all the way due to a installed 8" door stop on the back of the door at the top.  Hard to get your luggage in to the room when the door only opens half way!  If I had a screw driver, I would have removed that worthless and poorly installed door stop.

Text: The romance package was great. Once my wife and I got into our room, it wasn't 5-10 min that the staff delivered champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. Perfect timing. The room was near spotless and looked just as I had expected for a 4 star hotel. The romance package also allowed us to check out around 3 pm rather than 11 or 12. The late check out time was just what we needed. Lunch at their on site restaurant was rather delicious as well. All around we had a very pleasant stay.

Text: The location was great. Right next to the river and very close to downtown. I didn't stay in a room, but the front end was very impressive. The ballroom was beautiful

Text: Great staff. Fantastic place to have a large group. That have the room and the support staff to handle it. Close enough to the highway for convenience but far enough away to be quiet.

Text: Nice rooms that have recently been renovated. Nice courtyard outside area for gathering. Checked in at 4pm and had to wait 30 minutes for a room. Breakfast was on the high side at $14.95 for the buffet for adults.
