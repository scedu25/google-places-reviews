Text: Great room on first floor (handicap room) with huge bathroom and no exhaust fan.  Breakfast was between 6-9.  They told us it would be set up in the lobby and to help ourselves.  We go out to eat breakfast and they have hot & cold food waiting.  We start eating and they give us a bill for over $26.00.  I asked what this is for and they told us because we had food from the hot food bar.  All the food was in the same area with no signs saying that anything was extra.  My brother had a spoonful of eggs with 2 sausage links while I had a dry biscuit with 2 pieces of bacon.  REALLY!!!!   OVER $26!!!!  REALLY!!!!  The storeroom that held the gravy for the dry buscuits, the oatmeal, and a bunch of other stuff that they didn't have out for breakfast was locked and no one had a key.  They did take off half after alot of complaining with the bill still being almost $14.  We could have gone to Village Inn across the street for that and had alot less hassle.  They front desk asked how our stay was when leaving.  I explained.  "Have a nice day then" they said and they turned and walked away.  Great room at a great price ($94 + tax) but that's where it stopped.  BTW the bar....$9 for a jack & coke.  5 glasses to a small bottle of wine instead of the normal 4.  Didn't ask the guy next to me what he was paying for those.  I bet he got a suprise when he got his bill.  Only been open 1 week, wow.  If it hadn't been for the room at a reasonable price they would have got 1 star.
