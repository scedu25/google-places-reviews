Howell Nature Center

Text: A fine animal shelter, rehabiltation park and zoo.  Their work with raptors is remarkable and supported by large industry.  The landscaping is enjoyable and meanders between the whimsical to formal and back again.  Picnic facilities are available all around.  Enjoy the native frogs in the warmer months!
