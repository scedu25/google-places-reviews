The Inn at Felt Manor
Rating: 4
Text: The building was beautiful! From The parlor to the library to the dining room, the place was fantastic! Everything was very clean and well maintained. The evening wine and tea was a very nice touch as well. Bottles of water were always made available as well. The room was very large and very clean. The bed was a tad uncomfortable and any movement was felt. The breakfast was absolutely amazing! The meal was huge and freshly prepared. One of the best meals I ate in Galena.

Text: Cute bed and breakfast accommodations (old manor from the 1850's, renovated but with an era-specific feel), and the hosts are wonderful!   Walking to Main Street boutiques and restaurants/bars is easy (just a few long city stairways to descend the hill that give the Felt Manor it's great view).  If you want a quiet evening, enjoy their quiet porch overlooking the landscape.  Hosts are great at suggestions for things to do in the area.   And they make a stellar breakfast each morning unt 9a.  Would come back here next time I'm in Galena.
