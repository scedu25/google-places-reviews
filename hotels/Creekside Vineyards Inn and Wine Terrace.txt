Creekside Vineyards Inn and Wine Terrace
Rating: 1
Text: This review is not of the bed and breakfast - it is of the service Creekside provides in partnership with Parker Run Vineyards as their provider of alcohol and bar service.

Overall we were remarkably dissatisfied with their services and offerings.  Service was extremely slow during cocktail hour and upon attempting to discuss with the owner/ staff we were simply told they were serving as quickly as possible.  We had conversations prior to the event in which Jennider indicated that as soon as the staff saw a bus arriving they would begin pouring draft beers so that our guests could be immediately served.  This did not happen and instead some guests waited 45 minutes in line for a drink - completely unacceptable.  

Some additional points:
•Correspondence prior to the event was the majority of the time unprofessional as emails gave the perception that Jennifer was annoyed with our questions and did not really want to be bothered with serving us.  Customer service needs to be improved. 

•Overall prices are too high  particularly for mixed drinks.  I live in the Chicago area and your prices are higher than many of the wedding venues here.  

•We had to ask several time for an invoice so the amount due could be paid prior to the event and then received said invoice the day before the due date.  We again had to ask numerous times for confirmation that they had received final payment with no response for days.   Based on other business practices I am sure they would have had no problem charging a late fee despite the fact that they were not prompt on providing necessary information.  This is a definite sign of a deficient business person.

•Charging what they did for water on the tables was outrageous.  Additionally, it would have been nice to have ice in the carafes when filled so that when guests actually consumed the water it was refreshing.  We had a verbal conversation prior to the event and it was agreed that the staff would refill the carafes as the carafes were emptied - this did not happen and was very disappointing considering the cost.  $360.00 to have available for our guests what any other venue would have provided without extra charge and then what was promised did not occur - this is also unacceptable.

•In spite of the fact that their customers per contract are forced to tip regardless of the service provided they felt it necessary to put a tip jar on the bars both inside and out - this is definitely in poor taste.  

•It was obvious to our guests as I heard several comments that bartending wasn't something those serving us are accustomed to doing.  Efficient trained staff is essential for your type of business to be successful.

•The final invoice indicated that our guests consumed 43 bottles of wine.  I do not trust this to be factual and it is very unfortunate for us that we have no way to disprove the numbers.  

Please reconsider if you are planning for an event at Parker Run Vineyards as you will have no choice in a vendor if you wish to have alcohol available for your guests.

Text: First bed and breakfast experience for me and my wife. Beyond amazing! The owners keep their house in perfect condition and always go above and beyond for their guest. Wine was surpurb. The local selection of food and locations is top. Lots of activities in the area for an extended visit!
