Text: I only had dealings with Linda from the front office but I can say she was very helpful and polite. She really helped me out with an issue I had and if she is any indication of how Hideaway RV Park is run, you can expect great things.

Text: Very clean, very laid back, quiet, very friendly. Easy pull thru sites. "Lake" is more of a pond, lots of small bluegill. 
I wouldn't recommend swimming in it.
