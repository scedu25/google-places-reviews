Americas Best Value Inn Paducah

Text: Very friendly front desk servicemen and housemen. I was asked for paperwork for my service dog (though there is no federally recognised paperwork or registration, and none should be required or asked for; service dog qualifications have to do with training history and public access behaviour, not paperwork). Regardless, everyone was very friendly and accommodating and I felt welcome and relaxed. Some guests got loud around midnight, but that is no fault if the hotel. I slept well and was very happy overall.

Text: Nice area but no food around until the next exit. Rooms were nice and clean, beds were comfortable. Service was get checking in, rude when leaving.

Text: Good price for an all-around decent room. Beds, linens,etc were as expected for the price point. Included breakfast was a nice perk. The biggest con was probably that the non-smoking room smelled like it had used to be a smoking room.
