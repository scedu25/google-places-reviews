Text: The owners are very very rude hardly speak English the rooms are dirty and I'm 99 sure that I found bed bugs there are pedophiles and junkies everywhere coming and going all night it was the worst experience at a hotel that I've ever had... I would have been better off sleeping in my car at the local park then giving these people my money.
