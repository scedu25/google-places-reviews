Text: Great place to stay! The staff was awesome and we were able to get something to eat after 1 AM! Room was clean and comfortable. Not the best hotel mattress ever, but I didn't wake up too sore. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: Overall it was a nice hotel cleanly with a good continental breakfast. The pillows however were weak, I had to stack three of them just to support my head. I would stay again but probably bring my own pillow.

Text: I stayed after a wedding, the room was large and had a big tv. The beds were a bit stiff, but the fold out bed was much more comfortable than expected. There is no fan in the bathroom, which is a bit hard with multiple people showering. Breakfast as good and had a good variety. It's in a nice area and provides free parking.

Text: Great stay. Nice, clean rooms. Breakfast was very good, and parking was free! Shuttle service was helpful but hours were limited and some front desk staff not well informed. Most of the staff were excellent and were hustling at multiple tasks!
