Text: It was a very nice and clean camp. We stayed at one of the cabins they had. Very clean and well kept. I would recommend them to anyone.

Text: We stayed at the lodge. The location is fantastic and since it was mid week off season we had the place pretty much to ourselves. While that seemed like it meant we would have a very quiet stay it was anything but that. For whatever reason they put us directly under the room the cleaning crew used to get equipment or whatever. They literally were making non stop noise the entire night. My wife barely got any sleep. Also there was very little hot water which was extremely disappointing considering again we were like the only guests there. Overall it's a great spot with ton to do in season and I would highly recommend it but don't let the lodge fool you. It's still like camping.

Text: Lovely park. Great hiking, wonderful natural vistas. Lots to like. It's a shame the lake is so trashy at times.
