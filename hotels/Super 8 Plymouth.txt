Super 8 Plymouth

Text: Very rude staff and the people from the next door from us kept on blaring the music from midnight till 6 in the morning. Still remember how loud it was and how loud they were and went up desk to tell them and they obviously didn't do a thing about it.. Also NOT worth the money. Uncomfortable bedding and pillows. The only thing that was nice was the pool and the bathroom.

Text: It was a super busy weekend as I guess a lot of people were in town for the Notre dame game, but the manager Jen was very helpful making sure me and the crew I was working with had rooms for the weekend. Very clean, and staff very friendly.

Text: They jacked the rates up to $155.99 because of the Notre Dame game. Breakfast sucks. No public restrooms downstairs. Rooms were decent but will never be worth over a hundred dollars for any reason.

Text: I was pleasantly surprised for $69 I thought this was going to be a dive. Nope rooms were updated and clean! Beds were ok, service was excellent -Kim was wonderful at check in, very friendly and welcoming she explained everything and was helpful with my questions. Breakfast was limited nothing fancy but easy good items. We would stay here again if ever in the area! Thanks again!!
