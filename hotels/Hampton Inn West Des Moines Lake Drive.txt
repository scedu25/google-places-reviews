Text: Accommodations lovely. Credited My room due to heater being loud and obnoxious.  Great service and no hassle with management over complaints. Handled my issue with care and respect. Fantastic service. Recommended for a stay.

Text: Stayed 7/29/17 and it was under construction. There is only 1 elevator bank and we were at the far end away from it and it is a long walk to your room. They don't have normal baggage carts so get ready to haul your stuff. Our room was nicely refinished, very nice bathroom. Comfy bed. The AC didn't really work that well and the hallway was colder than our room. If you can get it for cheap (under $90) I would say it is worth it.

Text: Arrived at midnight and our A.C. was off. Turned it on and by 6am it was again 80 degrees in the room. Bed was not comfortable. Great amenities and food.
