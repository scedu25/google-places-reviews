Text: This place have always been great. But the breakfast part have gone south. I hope this feedback will help change that.
Wonderful staff and service as always.
Breakfast is just one of the biggest thing to start the morning right...

Text: I very much enjoyed my stay. Form a appearance look on thing it looked amazing. The rooms where not as big as some i have been to but not small either. I had slept comfortable for the night as well and the morning breakfast was fairly good with many choices to choose from.

Text: Clean, nice rooms with separate bedrooms and TV in each room. It sounded like people were trying to escape prison by climbing down the pipes whenever I took a shower. Laundry service was unavailable during my 10 day stay for work, so i had to use the in house machines that took forever to dry my clothes. Service was very good and all employees were very nice. Good location close to restaurants.
