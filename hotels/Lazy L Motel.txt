Lazy L Motel

Text: Nice little place. Rooms have been recently remodeled so they are clean and comfortable. Nothing really fancy but if youre traveling and you need a room for the night, the beds are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms are well maintained and the people are nice.....what more could you want?

Text: Name says it all. They're lazy. Not only that but rude if you ask for extra anything, unless you have a group with you. I don't recommend staying here.

Text: Nice little hotel overall.  The rooms were well kept and the furnishings were comfortable.  I've stayed here several times over the past few years and I would recommend it for those visiting Houston or the surrounding area.
