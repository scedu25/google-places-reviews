Hollywood Casino Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Staff was very friendly and helpful. They brought up a crib for my toddler and offered to put it up for me. The hotel was clean and child friendly. Thermostat for the room kept the room at a good temperature. Much better than the old air conditioner. My husband had a wonderful time playing in a poker tournament. He won first place! Would recommend and stay again.

Text: Hotel portion is fantastic.  Used to be my favorite casino but not any More.  Like to play video poker but machines are so tight that you can go through $100 in 20 minutes playing 25 cent video poker.  Used to be able to get free rooms or at least $5 promo money and not getting that anymore even though I may put through $300 in a night but my playing time is down because I can go through that in 2 hours and have to quit.  Time to find another favorite casino there are plenty to choose from.

Text: The casino part is very pretty and very clean. Not a big casino though. Not like other Hollywood casino with all of the stuff. The hotel is older and a little creepy but clean and the rooms smell like lemon.

Text: Nice hotel and very glad they brought back the breakfast. Made for a wonderful night. Only thing I would change is to make the casino non smoking. We go less and less because we don't like all the smoke and how we smell and feel the next day

Text: Love getting away overnight here! Nothing fancy but rooms are clean. I do not like that they are charging a resort fee as this hotel is far from a resort. There is no swimming pool and no fitness room. It's just an average hotel.
