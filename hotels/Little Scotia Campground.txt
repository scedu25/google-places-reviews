Text: The campground and picnic area have been closed and abandoned. But that doesn't mean you can't stay there! No facilities, but the campsites are still marked, the street is paved. A little hard to find because the signs have been removed, but if you get here, it's a great secluded spot.

I rated it three stars because I think most people would *not* like to stay here, but for people like me, this was a gem. I had the place to myself and it was serene and quiet. And free!
