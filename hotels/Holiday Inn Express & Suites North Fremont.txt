Text: This place is absolutely amazing! We hit a deer on our way home to iowa, they got us in a hotel room asap. They let me keep my car there out of the way til we are able to come back and tow it home. I will definitely be returning on our trips to Massachusetts multiple times a yr, this WILL be our pit stop for the night from now on.

Text: I have stayed at this hotel a few times on vacation. Each experience has been very positive. The staff here are super friendly and very helpful! Everything is very clean and the facility smell very fresh. This is a great option when traveling to the lake - out of the way, but still very close to pretty much everything. The free parking is very accessible and the breakfast is delicious! Overall, five stars!

Text: One of the cleanest and well-appointed rooms at its price I've ever stayed in. The king single business suite features a door separating the bathroom and sitting area from the bedroom, keeping the sleeping area extra dark and extra quiet. Housekeeping has the entire place looking spotless and the front desk attendant couldn't be more friendly. 
To nit pick, the bedroom TV does not have hdmi so I can't get Netflix from my laptop. 
Otherwise, features and amenities are up to the standard you'd expect from Holiday Inn.
