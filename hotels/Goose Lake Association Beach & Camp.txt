Text: This campground is not open to the public. This isn't indicated anywhere on their website. Why have a listing on Google if you don't want to be located by the public? I guess I must have a naive view of the Universe, but I don't understand the world-view of people who think they are separate from the rest of us. When I spoke with the nice lady on the phone who informed me they were only open to Exclusive Members, I sarcastically made the comment that, "Hmm, I guess it's a bunch of Republicans down there, huh?"

And she laughed. Well, at least they have the good sense to own up to it. All I would ask is that if you're not open to the public, please indicate that somewhere, and stop listening to Fox News. 

I am naive, I know.
