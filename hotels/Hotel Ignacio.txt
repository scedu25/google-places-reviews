Text: The room was beautiful and clean, staff was friendly and helpful. The building was beautiful,  loved all of the art. The entrance is on the side of the building, just an fyi. It's not very clear from the road. We will be back!

Text: Really comfortable rooms, friendly and helpful staff, no complaints. We stayed here 4 years ago and knew when we came back to the area we'd stay here again. Worth it.

Text: I did not stay in anybody the rooms overnight as I was visiting the hotel for a wedding event, but what I saw of the place is very nice. Interesting architecture, paintings, and a big plus if you're into motorcycles because they decorate the walls and ceilings with actual bikes. The pre fixe meals offered were delicious and the few mixed drinks I had were well made. No complaints about the place from the little time spent there.

Text: This hotel is overrated and over priced. The people were nice but they're young and have no customer service skills. The facility is an old building that has cheaply remodeled and filled with art deco furnishings. 
The hall on the floor I stayed on smelled bad When you got off the elevator. The room didn't have good lighting for doing paperwork. The tv wasn' on the wall at the foot off the bed, but on a side wall. A broken desk chair, and a plastic weird shaped plastic chair that wasn't comfortable. The baseboards in the bathroom probably haven't been wiped down since the place opened. The WiFi wasn't theirs, it was from the university next door and unprotected. The two restaurants that are in the hotel, but not owned by the hotel we're both closed on Monday when I arrived, so I had to chase to find a place to eat(although the food when they were open was top notch.) No ice buckeyes in the room, but the second day I found out they're by the ice machine. 
This hotel is not worth the money they charge($160/night).
I would NEVER stay there again, and am going to convince the company I work for to change hotels for the future.
