Super 8 Adrian
Rating: 5
Text: A fine place- room was nice, breakfast was adequate, great location, comfortable bed, and all was clean. The staff was very helpful and accommodating, especially the front desk manager (Christina?). I hope to be coming to Adrian more often in the future and will definitely consider this good, reasonably priced motel.

Text: The hotel is very clean and is in a good location. I'm not usually a Super 8 consumer but the reviews were good so I stayed. It was a good move because they were right. The hotel is clean, the rooms are good sized, the location is good, and the employees are polite. The breakfast, however, left much to be desired.
