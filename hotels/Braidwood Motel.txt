Braidwood Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Had a great stay for one night. The motel had a convenient location, the only downside was a railroad crossing nearby as you could hear the passing trains. The room was clean, well equipped, exactly what we needed. Extra thanks to the motel owner for offering some extra help we eventually didn't even need.

Text: Quiet, clean older roadside motel, owners are very friendly but not intrusive. Excellent rates. I've been here almost 3 months because of work. They've watched over me and have helped me out. Walking distance to a grocery store, laundromat, restaurants and fast food is not as close as the restaurants,maybe,.3 miles instead of,.1 miles.... That's point , 1 or 3 miles. It's very convenient.
