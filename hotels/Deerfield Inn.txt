Text: This place is awful.... horrible the second night probably the first night we got ate up by bed bugs we had moved from a previous motel in the area and have been there for a week and had no problems we let them know about the getting bit while we were at work they bombed and put powder on our floor would not move rooms said that they were full and if they had a new occupants coming in to fill the rooms... which I didn't understand why bring more people into an infested area when you know it's infested so what they told us was that they treated it came... And could do nothing more. The night ladies clerk her daughter works there as well clean rooms and her arms are ate up

Text: Basic motel. You can save money here, but you get what you pay for. The bed was fine, the room was quiet and it even had a microwave and frig. I couldn't get the WiFi to work, but perhaps their router needed a reboot. Breakfast was basic but it again it saves money.

Text: It's a little pricey for what it is, a small hotel in a small town. The rooms are pretty decent though.

Text: The rooms are nice however my first night people are standing outside my room talking loudly while I am trying to sleep. Then around 12 A.M. someone stats playing loud music in their room waking me up out of my sleep. Then at 6:30 A.M. they started playing the music again waking me up and I had to call the front desk. This is not what I paid for and I had a restless night.
