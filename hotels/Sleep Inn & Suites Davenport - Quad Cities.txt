Text: The atmosphere at this hotel is exemplary, as is the entire team.  I was at this hotel with my job in excess of two months so the friendly staff, clean room and delicious breakfasts were greatly appreciated.  Did I mention that Claudia's fresh, made to order Omlet was a delicious welcome to begin my day?   Everyone was personable, very helpful and treated me like family.  My room was cleaned and vacuumed daily.  This hotel is by far the best hotel experience I have ever had.  Thank you to the team at the Sleep Inn & Suites Davenport for making my stay away from home a great one.
