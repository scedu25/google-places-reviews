Leavenworth Lodging Services
Rating: 5
Text: We came up on a busy weekend and couldn't find lodging so the Chamber of Commerce recommended Leavenworth Lodging Services for assistance.  They offer their own vacation homes, cabins and more but were full also but they still helped us locate lodging when they didn't have to.  From what I could see they had really nice vacation lodging but unfortunately we were weren't able to check it out.  What really surprised me was their complimentary service in recommending where to stay and then even helping us find it.
