Text: This is a modern hotel in Amish country. Everything is very nice, pleasant staff and a great breakfast. A pool, workout room, indoor and outdoor lounges available to everyone as well. Great views too!

Text: Rooms are spacious, comfortable, and elegant. The bed fits my tastes for a firmer mattress as well. Service is exceptional and the breakfast spread beats any of the big chains I've stayed at like Best Western or La Quinta; it was the first time I've seen an omelet station and it turned out fantastic. The area is peaceful and scenic with plenty of nice Amish shops to browse. I'd definitely stay here again!

Text: We love this hotel. It's the second time we've stayed here and the staff are always so friendly. The rooms are very clean and we love the modern decor and big shower that's all tile. The complimentary breakfast is above average compared to other places. We highly recommend this hotel and we will always stay here anytime we visit Sugarcreek.

Text: This is not my first visit at this hotel, and I can honestly say I love my experience everytime. The staff is polite and helpful, it's location is fantastic to reach local attractions, and the place has plenty to offer. From a pool, hot tub and gym to awesome modern rooms. The only complaint I may have is some of the furniture. Both in the rooms and 2nd floor, look wise they fit in with the athletics or the he hotel, but they are not comfortable. Luckily there are other options. Outside of that I loved it, specially the breakfast buffet.

Text: Stayed in a premium suite that had a livibg area, half fridge and micro and a bedroom with 2 queen beds. Clean and comfy. Needed more sitting options and a nightstand by the bed. Beautiful hotel and rooms. Shower tiles need deep cleaned. We will definitely stay again.
