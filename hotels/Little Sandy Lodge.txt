Text: Loved this place.. Entering the place the view blew myself and my girlfriends mind.. The ladies at the front desk greeted us with open arms... The perfect definition of the ultimate relaxing get away... 
Only complaint is the rooms looking like a hotel instead of a cabin feel... But we loved it..cant wait to drive 2 1/2 hours to get away again...
