Text: Conveniently located by the highway this hotel was very accommodating to anything we needed beds were fairly comfortable and breakfast was better than most. Will definitely stay again

Text: Room appeared to be only marginally clean. Sink was outside the bathroom which is not hygenic. Sheets were threadbare. HOWEVER the staff was awesome! Courteous and professional.

Text: We arrived to our reservation to find a room that smelled like paint, due to some rennovations to the hotel and a bathroom that didn't have a light that worked. We called and were told there were no other rooms, so "Aide" needed to call her boss Rita, to see if Carlos could fix a light :). Aide, who was far from personable and made us feel like we were interrupting her music, as she had her ear buds in almost the whole time. She called and let us know they would put a lamp in the bathroom, with no shade??  which seemed pretty dangerous. After that we cancelled and I went to ask Aide why it was so difficult to fix a light bulb and was told "your no longer staying here, you need to go now!!"

Don't do it!! Stay somewhere else.

Text: We ran away from hurricane in FL. Stayed 3 days. Often stay here when we travel to E'ville. Rooms were good. Bit cramped but that was OK. Bed helped my bad back for some reason (that was good). We arrived in E-ville after a 24 hour drive early in morning before check in. Clerk found us a room that we crash in so we SLEPT the morning away. The clerks we dealt with were quite good as were the cleaning people.  They are in the middle of a remodel also.
It is next door to a Steak & Shake that we have gone to previously. It has gone down hill.

Text: Hotel is tucked away off of 41 HWY down a side street easy to miss. Service checking in was great, received a room before check-in time which was very appreciated. Room is no smoking and came standard with microwave and fridge. The sheets and everything are super clean, too! This is a good spot for the price, if you can get to it.
