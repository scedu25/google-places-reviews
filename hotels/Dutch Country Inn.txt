Rating: 5
Text: The Dutch Country Hotel is a very nice clean facility. I appreciate the scripture verses on the walls in the lobby and in each of the rooms. I appreciate the clean quiet atmosphere very much. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Kuudos to the staff and owners!

Text: Horrible.  NO one there but an insane cleaning lady on Sunday cuz "everybody was at church".  When the rude cleaner was told she was being mean (NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, I HAVE THINGS TO DO!) she literally said, "You just wait till you meet the owner, you think I'M MEAN????"  My sis and BIL were the only people in the building except for the crazy lady!  No one there to check them out!  When they checked in, there were linens on the floor and a coffee cup on the counter half full.  What is this, Bates Hotel?
