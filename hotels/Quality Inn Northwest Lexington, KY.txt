Quality Inn Northwest Lexington, KY
Rating: 1
Text: Beds were stained, had dead bugs, and clumps of hair. One room smelled like death and the light didn't work. Next room had a large white stain on the carpet and both beds had large stains on them. Third room was infested with bugs. Not to mention the third room had EXPOSED WIRES OVER THE SHOWER. All 3 rooms were not up to code in one way or the other. The WiFi is a joke, cuts out every 2 minutes. All in all a pretty good place to stay the night.... If you're a cockroach

Text: Front desk was curtious.  Bathroom and linens were clean. Get the absolute best price booking online even if you are standing in the lobby. Quiet area.  Not a luxury hotel but you cannot beat the price if you need a place to cleanup and sleep. I've stayed here several times when visiting Lexington. Always had the same experience with each visit.

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE. Whoever has had a lovely experience at this hotel has GOT to be kidding. This place is complete GARBAGE. My company has housed us here twice now and both experiences have been heinous. An unsafe, unclean location and a TOTALLY unprofessional front desk staff (the woman checking me in had on half of a shirt and was toying with her phone the whole time, eventually telling me how her brother was shot and killed a few years ago... ?!?). This place has no fitness center (as is stated online), puts you in dark, smelly, and dismal rooms with lights that don’t work, and has sketchy people lurking around the parking lot. 
Please pay more to stay elsewhere. I wish I could have.

Text: Room is clean, so are the linens & towels. Mini fridge & microwave in the room. Updated nice flat screen TV. AC nice and cold. Very satisfied with coming here. Only reason I didn't give 5 star was the price, $95.

Text: If I could give zero stars I would. This place was disgusting and totally unsafe. My room had cigarette burns in the bedding, floors were atrocious. My door had been kicked down at one point. As was my friends. This place should be shut down. It is not taken care of and do not stay here due to the sheer fact you may get extremely ill, or have someone pounding on your door. You can tell this place is a crack den.
