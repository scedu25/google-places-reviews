Text: The staff is friendly and courteous. They will help in any way they can. The lobby kind of smells like sulfur, but not enough to deter me or change my opinion of the place. The rooms are very nice. Word of advice, take anything you might need with you, the shop in the hotel is quite pricey.

Text: Ive given it 5 stars mainly for the the bed. Its like I slept on a cloud. PILLOWS were divine, blanket/comforter made me feel like Ive been cuddled by an angel... One of the best sleeps Ive had in a very long time. Other than that, everything was good too ... typical high end hotel
