Text: This place is a scam. I purchased a property from them with a promise that I would get the title within a few weeks, due to back taxes being owed from previous tenants. The trailer was in their name and when they paid off the back taxes, would get me the title. It's been over 7 months now, still no title. Also, now saying I have to pay the other people's back taxes for them to put it in my name and are filing eviction because I refuse to pay rent from the time I had a buyer. Liars, scammers, cheaters. If you have kids, stay away from this place. Cars fly up and down the streets, loud partying at all hours of the night and black mold all through the trailers that I only found AFTER I got sick. They just put another layer of wall or flooring over the top of it and move on until it happens again, then repeat the process. TERRIBLE PLACE!

Text: The quintessential trailer park trash. The place is always cluttered and nasty. all the trailers are old run-down rusted-out, old car sitting everywhere it's not a place you want to live it's a place you want to run away from.

Text: I lived here for 3 years from 2012-15. Maintanance guys will let themselves in and under your trailer without permission. There's no sense in owning property and not actually owning it. The people here are what's to be expected in any trailer park. A lot of drug activity. Two girls on my street were shot, heard everything. People constantly outside screaming in the day, don't live here if you work 3rd shift. Noisy cars with loud music speeding by. Lot rent got jacked up a few times. You have to pay rent with a money order now. I do not miss living here.

Text: It's a trailer park. Not bad for what it is I guess.
