Rose Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Fantastic little hotel!!! We called to check availability and was able to get a room for the same night! In town for a friend's viewing and funeral. Decided we'd like to stay a second night and was quickly and efficiently accommodated. Owners are so sweet and kind. Room was clean. King size beds are available. Coffee maker, fridge and microwave in our room. Was able to park our peterbilt semi on the property! We were bobtailing (no trailer). Bathroom was clean. Highly recommend staying here when your in David City! We'll definitely stay here on our next visit ?

Text: The rose Motel is a very quaint hotel. It is the only hotel in town and I have been here several times and every time it is exactly what we needed. It is not the Ritz-Carlton but it is not a roach motel, either. The staff is wonderful and I slept great in a clean room.

Text: Very nice place. Was really worried about some of the things people said so far. This place must've done some work. Because it's very nice in the room. Very clean

Text: Rooms was clean. Very uncomfortable bed. Flat pillows. Did not rest very well. Sheet kept coming off corners of bed do to being old and elastic stretched put. Rubber mattress cover sucked
