Text: My family and I camped at the Trace Branch Recreation Area this past Memorial weekend 2014 and we didn't want to leave. It was so clean, quiet, and well maintained. Terry and his wife Jessica Cornett manage this camp site and they do an awesome job! They are kindest, friendliest and helpful host I’ve seen at a campsite. Most of the campsites are right beside of Buckhorn Lake so you can fish and if you have a boat, they also have a boat dock. We had a really AWESOME time!
