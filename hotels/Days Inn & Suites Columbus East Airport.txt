Text: I’m sorry to say that I was very unhappy with my stay here. The staff was courteous and friendly. The room was definitely rough with wallpaper having holes, doors needing painted and the corners of the bathroom needed some scrubbing. Lastly, there were other patrons literally yelling in the hallways at 3 pm and even beyond. While I know that guests aren’t screened for manners, I can’t imagine that this commotion was not heard at the front desk! Also the telephone in the room did not work. We won’t be staying again.

Text: If you need a place to stay on short term it's not bad. The area has a few hotels and rooms go fast or many are rented by the month as we saw people paying at the desk when we checked in. No elevator and a bit outdated. The staff and manager was friendly and accommodating to us.

Text: Enjoy staying there. It's the biggest "bang" for your buck if you are on a budget but want clean, pleasant accommodations. The slightly acerbic but extremely professional young, blonde woman behind the checkout counter is a delightful touch and adds to the charm and sass of the place. Restaurant and bar were under renovation but they did have a Sunday Chapel.
