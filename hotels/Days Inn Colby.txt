Text: There is a piece of metal on the bottom of the room door and cut my foot, the room smells intensely of urine. And to start, they hung up on us when we tried to make the reservation in the first place. I'm not sure why we even stayed at this hotel. And the cost was over $100, but the online posted price was $75. Definitely not worth either of those prices.

Text: The staff was friendly. Breakfast was great. Beds were firm, more than I would prefer, but that is not a negative for the hotel. Just a preference.

Text: Location was convenient to the freeway. Rooms were clean and the pool was fun for our small children. Floor by the pool was extremely slippery.

Text: Nice accommodations. Friendly staff and decent breakfast. Loved the rate extremely cheap but still a nice room. It wasn't a dive. Would stay there again.

Text: The rooms were not cleaned. The breakfast in the morning had a hair in it. The walls are paper thin you can hear every door that slams. Absolutely will never stay here again
