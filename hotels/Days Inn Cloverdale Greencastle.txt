Text: My sister tried to convince me that there were bugs in the room we stayed in but I didn't believe her u til we got home. I took my own pillow to the hotel and my sister took the pillow case off and my pillow was covered with bugs from our stay last night. Talked to Tonya the person working at front desk and she said there was someone else in the room now and they  couldn't check it out  until tomorrow and they were not willing to call the people in the room and let them know that the room has been suspected to have bedbugs .  I couldn't bring anything into my house after I got home and I had to strip my clothes off put them in the washing machine and immediately take a shower just to try to take precautions that I don't carry them in my home !

Text: Rooms liked newly decorated. Warm and restful. Room was large and not crowded. 
Tv needed to be higher. We had a good stay, would come back.

Text: Well kept clean room. Breakfast is included but it is very basic, toast, coffee, orange juice, cereal, not much else. The prices are cheap and the area is quiet, a good place to relax for an hour or two and sleep but that's all there is.
