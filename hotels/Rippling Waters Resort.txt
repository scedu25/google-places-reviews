Rippling Waters Resort

Text: Great little discreet quiet place down in a valley with a beautiful drive to it where you get to enjoy seeing wildlife along the short route off the main road. Super friendly and welcoming owners. We will DEFINITELY be going back. Never felt so at home. One cabin was kinda isolated style and private parking pad in that #2 unit. Great place and again we WILL be back. I have already referred all our friends there for secluded type of getaway for Lake of the Ozarks. And you can NOT beat the prices. They dont change them just because of holidays. They are just trying to live and make a living not wipe out your entire bank account for a water fun get away. They also have a couple boats to rent and way better prices then anyone else around the entire lake. Ya just cant beat this place. Not as modern but clean and super respectable. Thanks for a relaxing stay.
