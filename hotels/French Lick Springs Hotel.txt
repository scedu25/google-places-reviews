French Lick Springs Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: As usual at the French Lick Springs Hotel did not disappoint. I came over to the hotel after taking a tour of the West Baden Springs Hotel. Walking around this place you see just how detailed and beautiful the place is. Outback there is a spring that although smells of sulfur is actually quite lovely. I recommend coming here again.

Text: We were just there for 45 minutes to look around. The shops and lobby areas were nice. The fall decorations were beautifully done. Every staff member greeted us and helped any way they could. Wish we would have had more time.

Text: This past Saturday evening we enjoyed the beautiful architecture and artwork in the French Lick lobby while enjoying an espresso. We then enjoy the cool brisk walk outside in order to pay a visit to Pluto's spring. Each and every time we visit the French Lick Resort or the West Baden Hotel our hearts are filled with happiness and love.
