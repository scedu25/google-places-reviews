La Quinta Inn & Suites Dodge City
Rating: 4
Text: We stayed in a suite and it was very nice. The extra room was great. The hotel was right on the highway through town so very easy to get to! The bed was comfortable. The continental breakfast very good. We had stayed at a La Quinta one night earlier that had a very disappointing breakfast so we were very happy to have our faith restored in La Quinta's breakfast. We will definitely stay at La Quinta again.

Text: After many hours of driving I expect a better hotel. The attendant was grumpy and didn't help. We go into our hotel missing bed sheets and with dog poop on our towels. The AC unit was barely working so we were very hot. The pool was too cold, it wasn't temperature regulated even though it's indoors. When I got into the hot tub it was the same temperature as the pool.     I asked the attendant if she could turn it on and it made no difference. Too many people at breakfast to eat comfortably. Not the same as other La Quinta hotels.

Text: The key pad was not working on back entrance. Ice machine was out of order. Breakfast wasn't hot. I do like La Quinta. Rooms are very nice. Have always had a great experience.
