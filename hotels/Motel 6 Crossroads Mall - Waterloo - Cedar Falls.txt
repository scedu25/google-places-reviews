Motel 6 Crossroads Mall - Waterloo - Cedar Falls
Rating: 1
Text: Internet was poor.  Bed/mattress was hard and stiff.  Air Conditioner didn't work well and had no labels.  Toilet didn't flush, and kept running.  They actually had a plunger next to the toilet..tacky.  Room was dusty.  Pool was also cold, and the hoyer seat was broken (as well as the ladder into the pool was broken).  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.

Text: This was an awful experience. We checked in and then left immediately. The description did not match the actual condition of the hotel. As we walked through the hallway to our room, we had to walk through a cloud of marijuana smoke that appeared to be from a hotel staff member that was smoking in an open room as he "cleaned" it. We realized that all the smoke detectors in the hallway had been removed/disabled. When we got into our room it was not clean. We didn't stay long enough to inspect the rest of the room after noticing that the towels were dirty and their was hair on them! Also, we had turned on the AC hoping it would help clear out the smell but this made it worse. It smelled as if someone had urinated on AC unit or something. We felt very unsafe staying there and decided to leave within the first few minutes of checking in. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Text: At first glance it appears that this is a decent place to stay. 

However the beds feel like a work out trampoline. The joining room door had a lock but was installed incorrectly. When I attempted to check out there was no one in sight.

Text: I have a dog I travel with, so I was quite happy to find a motel that was pet friendly.  The front desk staff was very friendly and asked what floor I would be interested in.  I requested the first floor and she suggested near the back door for easy outdoor access for my dog.  Worked perfectly!  I loved that there was no carpeting! The beds were a little on the hard side, but still a small inconvenience, far outweighed by the ability to bring my dog along.  It was a little worn in spots, but again...I wouldn’t expect to be put in a pristine room with a dog.  I would certainly recommend this motel to anyone traveling with a pet. Close by everything I needed.  My son attends college in Waterloo, so I’ll be back again!  The wi-if had issues the first night, but was working well the 2nd night.  It was actually one of the faster wi-if connections I’ve had at a motel.

Text: The front desk man was very rude when asked to change rooms do to our room being dirt. The other reason being that I broke my ankle and wanted a room on the first floor because there were no elevator. When told to contact the booking agency I went through to request a different room, they informed me to email the property our problem. My email did not receive an answer back. Our room had something sticky on the floor next to the table by the bed. It was as if the housekeeper didn't mop that far into the room. There was also, what looked to be milk spilled down the cupboard door that concealed the refrigerator that did not work. The bed had the last guest hair left in it like they didn't change the sheets after the last guest. This was supposed to be a trip for my daughter and I to spend time together. This was by far the worst overnight stay I've ever had. Will not be staying there ever again.
