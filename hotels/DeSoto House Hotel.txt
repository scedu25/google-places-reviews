DeSoto House Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is right in the heart of downtown Galena. Many historic people stayed at the hotel. The rooms are a little quirky. They have also seen ghosts in the hotel especially in the lower-level generals restaurant. The restaurants serve a variety of food and the food is very tasty and the service is excellent the hotel staff is also excellent.

Text: Although it was more expensive to stay here than a chain hotel outside of downtown, it was well worth it. The history is amazing. You feel as though you've walked back in time the moment you enter the lobby.

It was convenient staying downtown, too. After walking around all morning, we were hot and tired, so we visited the root beer store in the hotel and returned to our room to rest an hour before going back out -- all without having to move the car! 

A random thing I liked about the restaurant in the basement of the courtyard is you could get biscuits and gravy as your side with breakfast instead of toast or pancakes. I thought that was an unusual option, but was happy I got to try the biscuits and gravy and egg's Benedict. 

The Galena ghost tour starts and ends at the De Soto and provides even more hotel history.

Text: I was here for a wedding and all the staff were very friendly and made the wedding beautiful. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the room they gave us for the dinner was extremely cramped and a bit claustrophobic. Over all everything was great though.
