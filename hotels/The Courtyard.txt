The Courtyard
Rating: 4
Text: Beautifully historic in prime location. Some rooms are under renovation and after the bad weather in February the rooms were taken over by construction crews who are now finished and leaving.  Just in time for summer!

Text: My wife and I enjoyed staying & eating here. The people are friendly.  

This is a remodeled historic building & a smaller facility, so if you are looking for a newer hotel with the latest amenities & 24hr room service, this is not the place for you (likely some of the negative reviews).  Yes, the TV in our room was a small/older "tube" but we don't watch TV hardly at all, anyway (so if anything, we found it a nice change from most hotels which make the screen almost the central attraction).  

 Our room was tastefully decorated, clean & well maintained.  The bathroom was spacious and clean.  Everything worked well.  It was nice to have our own coffee maker & fridge.  And the view of the river was definitely a nice feature.

We ate in the (open air) courtyard, and enjoyed the quaint atmosphere (listening to the waterfall & smelling flowers after a recent rain shower). There wasn't a lot of variety on the menu the day we were there, but the choices were reasonable, and the food was good (pub style stuff).  

Overall, it was a pleasant stay at a quaint older place.

Text: This is an older hotel. Very neat place to stay - right on the river with a beautiful view. Felt like we were in Europe or New Orleans, not the midwest. Service was good and there was a frig and microwave in room. It is not the Holiday Inn, but in some ways it is a lot more. Go here if you want a romantic get away and don't mind a little beat up woodwork. If you want a water park with the kids, go somewhere else. Oh yeah, and the price was much better than anything else in the area.
