Red Roof Inn Kalamazoo West
Rating: 5
Text: One of the better Red Roof Inns I've stayed in. 
The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. The staff was friendly and super helpful. 
The location is fantastic, close to the freeway and close to everything. 
Really enjoyed my stay

Text: Prompt check in; booking online was a process. Friendly front staff. However, no extra towels; no hairdryer per request. Rooms not so clean, but decent given pet friendly. Check out is at 12pm but housekeeping knocks on your door starting at 8am multiple times in addition to a "friendly check out call" at 10am despite communication that we were checking put at 11am...

Text: When I went to check in the CSR rep was getting several phone calls, was having computer issues, and the lobby filled up after I got there. But the rep Stephanie was very helpful, courteous, and professional despite how busy she was. I appreciate how calm and professional she was despite how busy she was.

Text: Nice modern room, but ac didn't work in room 146. We didn't get here until 1am so we were too tired to ask for another room. It was quiet and adequate. The bathroom could have been cleaned better- shower needed wiped down. Staff was friendly

Text: Amenities aren't great and the yellow-brown liquid leaking from the bathroom light, that may or may not be the fermented remains of a body being flushed down the toilet from the upstairs room, could make an average hotel experience less that enjoyable. However, if, like me, you're one key short and you need to deliver by today or you left that organ cooler in your car for too long and need someone to pick it up ASAP, then the Red Roof is the place for you. Free back rooms for your night time exchanges are always open for those willing to put down a little more on the bill. Complementary services include no snitching. Additional charges for bedroom service, and I'm not talking about cleaning.
