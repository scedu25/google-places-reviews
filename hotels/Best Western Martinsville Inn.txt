Best Western Martinsville Inn
Rating: 5
Text: So glad we chose this Best Western.  We normally stay at other chains, but this hotel was so convenient to our destination and seemed inviting.  Even with a later than average check-in the associate at the desk was friendly and enthusiastic.  Good job Best Western!  We had a wonderful breakfast together and the check-out was late enough to allow for a little time in the exercise room.  Our room was clean and comfortable and any one of the staff that we encountered in the morning were all so friendly.  Thank you to Best Western and particularly the wonderful staff at the Martinsville location for a lovely stay.  We will come again.

Text: Quaint hotel in a familiar small town location. Clean rooms, friendly staff make for an enjoyable and comfortable stay. Close to all the mom and pop shops and convenient stores martinsville has to offer. Not far from Bloomington or the brown County shops. Great place to stay for a cheaper price if you don't mind the little extra drive to get to the sorrounding experiences. Construction on U. S. 37 and other main roads can make it a hassle to get back to the hotel from the south.
