Days Inn Rockford

Text: Unfortunately, I checked in late and left early...but what I was there for was fine. The check-in clerk was very nice and helpful. Room was comfortable, could've maybe used a couple more pillows on each bed. I volunteer for the Red Cross, and they worked with my supervisor to take his expense card for payment.

Text: Staff was very friendly, but that's about the only good part. The bed was bouncy and hard, not comfortable. The AC unit was intermittently very loud. Bathroom was cramped. Breakfast was poor, there were some spoiled oranges in the fruit basket. It's not a terrible hotel, it's simply that for the money, it was not worth it. We paid $10 more per night at a different hotel the following night and got a much much better room, cleaner, more comfortable and a huge bathroom, with a solid breakfast.

Text: My room seemed to be fine and the staff is pretty helpful. Although the first night when we arrived late one of my teammates' room was completely wrecked, not cleaned at all. They got a new room but they had plenty of time to prepare them for us, not really any excuses for that. All in all breakfast wasnt too bad and overall stay was as expected for the most part.

Text: Found a bed bug under the covers,  caught it and took it to the manager. The manager was really nice and change my room.  But still wasn't comfortable so I didn't spend the night.

Text: The hotel is a short drive from many restaurants and there are a two gas stations right next to it. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are pretty small and decent in terms of cleanliness. The hotel itself is kind of rundown because it's old and hardly ever updated. Because the cost of the hotel is so cheap some of the other tenants seemed a bit sketchy but not dangerous.
