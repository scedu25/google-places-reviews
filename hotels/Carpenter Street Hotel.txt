Carpenter Street Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is conveniently located near many of the Cities unique attractions. There are so many choices for food within walking distance or if there is something within a few miles they hotel has a shuttle that will take you anywhere. The staff was super very friendl and the GM is so nice. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. I'd definitely go back.

Text: Very nice hotel experience. Rooms are clean with a friendly staff. The breakfast in the morning is very nice with some great options. The best part is the proximity to the Lincoln Museum. Ask the front desk for discounted ticket prices ($10 instead of $15!)

Text: Great service! Excellent rates! Perfect location! Only issue we had was the stains on the rug, sheets and coverlet. All were clean but obviously stains were not removable. I felt the service, rates and comfort of the room were definitely worth some run down aspects.

Text: Excellent place to stay if you are touring Lincoln's historic sites. The hotel sells discount tickets to the Lincoln Presidential museum and also will provide a shuttle if necessary. The hotel is only 2 blocks from the museum and within easy walking distance of the Lincoln home and the Old State Capitol building.

Text: The Carpenter Street Hotel was Fantastic.  Their Free Van Service drives you within 5 miles of their hotel. They drove me and a friend to the Abraham Lincoln Museum,  Abraham Tomb,  Abraham Lincoln Springfield House, and all restaurants we wanted to go . to. Beth at the front  Reservation Desk was friendly and very helpful. I recommend you stay at this hotel when you visit Springfield Illinois.  I give the  hotel 5 Stars.
