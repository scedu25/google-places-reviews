Text: I came here for lunch. Fantastic service and great food for a price you'd expect to see at a much less presentable establishment. I'm definitely coming back soon.

Text: Comfortable, clean, and attractive place to stay when visiting ONU. Pleasant staff. Lobby bar. Comfortable, casual dining room where an above average free breakfast is served. Lunch and dinner are served there as well. Unfortunately the restaurant stops serving at seven. There is no in room dining, local restaurants close early as well. The rooms include a small fridge and microwave. If you enjoy eating after the restaurant closes, be prepared by stocking your fridge.

Text: Was relocated to The Inn after a water line break. This is a wonderful hotel. Guests seemed offput by a college student but staff was very friendly. Located in the front of campus, it's difficult to miss. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The bathroom is also amazing. It has a towel warmer and a gigantic shower. My only issue was a lack of Ethernet support for my room, but the WiFi is sufficient. Definitely worth the price.
