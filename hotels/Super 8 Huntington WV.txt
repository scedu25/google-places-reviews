Text: The hotel is fine. The staff was very accommodating on a very busy night. They could not offer any of the hotel discounts from travel magazines or AAA due to local events. The floors are mixed smoking and non-smoking if that's a concern for you. We were able to preview the room before staying to make sure it didn't smell like smoke. Sheets and comforters did have many cigarettes burn holes in them. Pool was out of towels and our toilet would not flush and the shower was slow to drain.
