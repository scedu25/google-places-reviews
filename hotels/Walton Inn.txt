Text: I just left this place and although the ammenities are up to par I was yelled at by management for leaving some spilled food they also claim I made a hole in their wall which is ridiculous as we laid in bed the 2 days we were there exhausted they charged for damages we never made and were upset that they had to clean at all. Makes you wonder if they actually clean since wiping off a table and sweeping the floors required extra charges.

Text: I also stayed here.  No hot water either.  Called front desk, no answer.  Walked to lobby and found it closed and locked.  No staff on site at all at 9AM
