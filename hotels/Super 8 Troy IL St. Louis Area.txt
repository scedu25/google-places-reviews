Super 8 Troy IL/St. Louis Area
Rating: 4
Text: Far better Super 8 property than I've ever stayed in. I get the feeling it may have been something before this. (Perhaps a La Quinta?)
Very friendly front desk staff, clean room, fridge and microwave. Well kept. Would definitely stay again.
Fire & Smoke restaurant across the parking lot a fabulous bonus!!

Text: This is our second time staying here and we've been pleased both times. The staff are polite and the rooms are clean. The Continental breakfast is okay. It consists of bagels, make your own waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, and some off the shelf cinnamon buns. The pool is average sized but great for this size hotel and has a hot tub. It's right off the highway and near a good number of restaurants and fast food places.

Text: This is my favorite place to stop on road trips across the country. It's cheap, basic, nothing fancy, but a place to rest for the night. They also have an indoor pool there, if you're into that. The free breakfast is pretty limited, but I do like the waffles. You can get a more substantial breakfast at the Cracker Barrel within walking distance.
