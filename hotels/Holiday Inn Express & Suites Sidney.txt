Holiday Inn Express & Suites Sidney
Rating: 5
Text: Our group arrived without reservations but there were plenty of rooms available. We needed two rooms and even got them next to each other. The rooms were clean and up to date. There were power outlets and USB plugs on each side of the bed for charging electronics overnight. The pool was cool and refreshing. The hot tub was just hot enough and relaxing. Although we didn't make use of it, there's a workout room and on-site laundry as well. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We needed extra blankets and pillows and they were served quickly with a smile. There was a decent selection for breakfast in the morning and ample sitting room. We did the quick checkout, signing the final document and leaving the key card in the room. If we need a hotel in the area again someone, we'll come here first.

Text: This is a relatively new hotel and the rooms are very cool. There are a bunch of restaurants in the area. If you are visiting Sidney or working in the area I recommend staying here as it is the best hotel around.

Text: Nice, clean hotel.  No issues.  Fluffy pillows. 
 Beds a little firm for my liking, but it's a nice bed.  Close to lots of restaurants in Sidney.

Text: It's a very nice hotel. It's smells good walking in, the room was very clean. The check in was easy but I had a family member arriving very late and asked for later check out which they immediately offered but the following morning our phone blew up at check out time. Minor issues to ban otherwise good stay. Would definitely stay again if in the area.
