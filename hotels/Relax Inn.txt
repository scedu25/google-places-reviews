Text: Dirty motel. Roaches in room. When told to front desk roaches were in the room they acted as if it was no big deal. Told house keeping about spots on towels, they said the towels were probably just old.

Text: BED BUGS. Traveling across the country and found this cheap place thinking it was a score. We get there and we had to call the front desk and it seemed like the guy was sleeping. I personally felt very uncomfortable with this place and it smelled like weed really bad even though the building was nonsmoking.  The bathroom looked disgusting and the bedding had stains on them. My boyfriend noticed a hole in the bed and set an alarm for 45 minutes. He woke me up showing me a bug on his pillow and took it to front desk where he found out that it was in fact a bed bug. We got our money back and got the hell out of there
