On-Ur-Wa RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice people, restrooms and showers were very clean. We were there off season, so they put us in the back. The kids had a blast chasing balls in the open area next to the trailer. The pull through site was easy to get in and out of. We would stay here again if we were in the area.

Text: Totally big rig friendly and we are 43ft with a tow. After a friendly greeting we were escorted to our site which was about 100ft., level and partially shaded by enormous trees with branches trimmed so an oversize load would have no problem getting a scratch. We have been full timing for over 4 years and these were the cleanest baths we have encountered. The office /gift shop had a delightful wine selection and we bought a bottle and it was great. Easy on and off the highway. Do not miss this one if you want a nice stay for a reasonable price.

Text: First off very nice people. Check in was easy and a good price. Close to the highway but no noise. Full hookups, nice level and long sites. Nice trees on the property. Store well stocked with RV stuff. Only negative was no hot water when my girls went to shower. They showered in the RV instead.

Text: Perfect for a night. 
Nicely kept grounds, clean bathrooms and easy on/off the highway. Great value for the money.
This is not a park for families looking for extra amenities but just right for an on ur way stop for one night at a very reasonable price.

Text: Thoroughly enjoyed our one-week stay here in a 36 foot class A. Nice owners, great amenities, and a lovely, park-like set up with spacious, level sites. Very dog friendly too, including a small, fenced off-leash area. Book ahead for your stay here.
