Cornerstone Campground and Retreat Center

Text: This is an awesome campground for this kids as well as adults.  Our kids have loved it as there are others to play with and lots of activities.  There's even planned activities for families and other stuff like fishing, kayaking, etc that you can do together.  The pizzas are always great that they make there, and we personally just love the staff! ;-)  Been there at least once a year the past few years and really enjoy the time away.  Things are always clean and everyone is so friendly.  It's located near I-70 east of Indy so it's super easy to get to.

Text: We stayed one night at Cornerstone while passing through the area on a road trip and were not disappointed. The staff is extremely friendly, the bathrooms are clean, the water is hot, and the grounds are very well-kept. You could tell that everyone camping here was genuinely enjoying their stay. I very highly recommend staying at this beautiful campground and hope to stop by again next time we pass through.
