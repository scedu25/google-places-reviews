The Townsend Hotel

Text: Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  The service from the entire staff was quick and courteous,  most learned your name within a day. The rooms are large and nicely furnished with a good sized bathroom.  My 17 year old son summed it up best "It's like being in a movie " Walking distance to great shops and restaurants is a huge plus.

Text: This is a 5 STAR+ HOTEL.  And extremely worth it.  Careful with the Beds though... I had a very hard time getting out of them.  I wanted to stay in those beds forever.  You could find yourself forgetting about business, life, stresses, everything but amazing comfort.  Oh - the rooms are amazing, the entire Hotel is great.  Someone knows how to "Hospitality" there for sure.  LOVE THIS PLACE.

Text: The Townsend is in a great location in Birmingham where it is easy to walk to a number of great restaurants. I was there to attend an event so I cannot speak to the rooms but the hotel staff are very professional and friendly. For the event I can tell you that the staff had everything well in hand for prep of the breaks and meals. The coffee was always ready and the meals were quite good.

Text: My wife and I stayed here on a Tuesday night for a romantic getaway. The room and service were top-tier. Will definitely return for future one night getaways.
