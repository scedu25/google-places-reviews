Airport Motel

Text: Haven't stayed there yet, but $53.00/nt typical seems a bit high considering the reviews.  If I stay there, I'll give an opinion and possibly revise my rating with details on my experience.

My boss stayed there this past week (1st week of Febr., 2016) and says it's just been greatly renovated and they have more improvements in the works.  He stayed 2 nights and apparently had no problems with noise, etc. and slept well, NO BED BUGS!  He recommends it!

Update: I stayed there a month or so later.  It was as he described.  My only problem was being located near the back entrance/exit door, which does not close quietly, but slams loudly.  By 5am, traffic through that door made sleeping impossible.  My alarm was set for 7am.  Maybe they've improved this door by now?

Text: Gem in a small town. Updated, clean, quiet, cozy stay. Priced right. Complimentary breakfast was also a treat. Real food, pancakes, scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon,  fresh coffee, juice cereal, yogurt. Each morning something different.  Just off the parking lot a couple yards there are several walking paths in all directions. Will definitely be back when we visit Ord family again.

Text: Take the reviews with a grain of salt. I mean, one guy left a bad review and admitted he never even stayed here. Seriously WTF? This place was great! The room was very clean and the bed was a plush pillow top and super comfy. The place appeared to be newly renovated and sported a rustic facade. Breakfast was delicious. Wi-Fi slowed down toward the evening with everyone getting online but was reasonably fast at 8 Mb. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. I'll stay here again.
