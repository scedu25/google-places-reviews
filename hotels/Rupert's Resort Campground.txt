Text: Bathrooms are horrible campsite was swampy and the other people around left alot to be desired. The view of the lake is good if you are in the front. My favorite part was the people behind us were very entertaining fighting and complaining about their fire being too loud....ok?!?! Would not waste my money there ever again!
