Text: DON'T STAY HERE!!! I stayed at this Holiday Inn for one night and  accidentally left my prized green iPad. I called and confirmed it had been found and stopped by 2 days later, but the iPad was in the GM's locked office. So the desk rep took my info and said they would send it to me. When it didn't arrive, I called the next week and the same desk rep apologized, took my info again, and assured that they would send it. This happened literally for the next 2 weeks, and eventually I spoke to the GM who promised to replace it. It's been 3 months and I haven't seen it. Not only employee held up to their word, but someone got a great music mix outta this. DON'T STAY HERE!!!
