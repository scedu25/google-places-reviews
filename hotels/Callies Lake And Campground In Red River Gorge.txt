Callies Lake And Campground In Red River Gorge
Rating: 5
Text: I've been camping a long time and at many different campgrounds but I haven't found a place this nice with the owners so friendly and amiable doing their best to make your stay at their beautiful campground relaxing and memorable. I don't think I will camp anywhere else when I visit the Red River Gorge again. Shane and Dee D are fantastic. They even bring wood to your campsite and have cool local bands. I cant wait to go back! This is the KING of campgrounds.

Text: We spent one night at Callie's and had an incredible experience! The owners are personal, warm, and lovely people. They met us at the campsite with fire wood and while they chatted with us they started our fire FOR us. The staff went above and beyond...add this to the beautiful grounds and fun activities, overall a wonderful place. Highly recommend.

Text: One of the best campgrounds I've ever stayed in. Fishing lake, paddle boats, bath house with showers (being built but almost finished), huge space for tent campers and separate areas for RVs with electric and water hookups. Will stay here again for sure.
