Saxony Motel
Rating: 3
Text: For an inexpensive motel it's not bad. Nice new deep tub in our 2 queen bed room. It has small fridge and microwave which is great if you have a kid. Tim Hortons across the road and restaurant beside. A few dings in the walls and carpet could use a soap clean but beds are nice. Housekeeping was friendly. Wifi very slow though!

Text: Newly renovated. Quiet and clean. Free WiFi. Bathrooms are very small. Price point is average, should be a bit lower for a Motel.

Text: Rooms are falling apart and the owner isn’t the best. We worked out a price then he changed it the next day then a week late raised it again. There are much better places to stay for long periods of time. If you are staying a night or two it’s not so bad.

Text: Owners charged me for 4 days. I only stayed 3 days. They said they would refund me the extra day and they never did. I've contacted them many times, they keep saying they refunded me, but I checked with my visa card provider and they definitely never reimbursed me. I would not trust the owners at all. The rooms themselves were ok.

Text: Terrible wifi connection. Might as well be non existant. Rooms are in poor shape (peices of the wall missing & bathroom fan didnt work)
