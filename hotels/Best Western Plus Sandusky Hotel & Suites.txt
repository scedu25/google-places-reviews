Text: Okay, I never do this but my recent stay there so warrants this review. Showed up without reservations on Saturday night and were given a room. Check in was easy and fast and Shawna was super. As we walked to room, we even talked about how pleasant she was. We joked around about a late check out, and she gave it to us. We inquired about the restaurant next door, and she offered to call and make sure it was open because they keep weird hours....When we first walked in the room, it appeared to be clean and in order and was very spacious. I opened the refrigerator and there was stuff in it...oh well, not that big of a deal. I got in the shower and found several pieces of hair in the shower and it was not mine...ugh. Let that slide too. While I was in the shower, my boyfriend pulled back the sheets on the bed and this did it...more hair AND toenail clippings, in the bed, between the sheets. That was more than we could let slide. Upon letting Shawna know, she offered us another room or to come and change the bedding and give us a discount. Considering we were already unpacked, we opted for a change in bedding and never really pushed the discount. Shawna came and made up the bed with fresh linens and said she would tell her boss about it. Upon checkout this morning, much to our surprise, without out our even asking, there was an envelope with our name on it. This hotel refunded us our entire nights stay.....this was a very long review I know, and the point was not the point out the fact that they had a lazy person on their housekeeping staff. The point of this review was to say how the hotel went above and beyond to make it right. Will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone else.

Text: Our room was clean. The water pressure was good. Very interesting pool. Not quite a pool, not quite a hot tub, but very relaxing after a day of walking around Cedar Point. Free breakfast is slightly above average. Staff is friendly. Smoke detector in room is super sensitive. I have set it off twice. Once with an electronic cigarette, once with the shower.

Text: Awesome staff! We stayed in the family suite and was very nice. Breakfast was very good. Only negative, was the pool was a therapeutic pool not a swimming pool.

Text: Great environment, smelled and looked very clean. Bed was comfortable and loved the therapy pool. Only problem was our room was a conjoined room which was fine but you could hear everything the people next door were talking about. Conjoined rooms should be saved for people who want them.
