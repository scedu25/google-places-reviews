Green Tree Inn of Elsah
Rating: 5
Text: Had the opportunity to experience this quaint little slice of heaven on an impromptu trip with my husband. This was our first stay in a bed and breakfast and we couldn't have picked a better place then the Green Tree Inn. Nestled in a historic town not far from the Grafton wineries, this bed and breakfast pampered us with nightly dessert and delicious homemade breakfast. The owners were very knowledge and extended down home hospitality. We look forward to escaping the hustle and bustle and renewing ourselves at the Green Tree Inn again!

Text: Connie is a fantastic and gracious hostess! She bakes homemade sweets for the guests every afternoon. The breakfast is also homemade and equally phenomenal. She and her husband are also very accommodating to guests. Upon our visit, there was another guest who was vegan. Not only did Connie make that guest a special breakfast, she asked for honest feedback so she could improve it for future vegan guests. Elsah is a beautiful quaint town; perferct for a quick getaway from the city. I will definitely stay again!
