Text: Super friendly staff.  Helpful, bent over backwards to make sure our stay was a great experience. Multiple areas, indoors and outdoors, for groups to relax. Comfortable beds. Stayed there with a large group, believe that we all would give the hotel and staff 4 to 5 star ratings.

Text: Very clean and welcoming lobby. It smelled fresh and clean. The exterior had a nice area for sitting and chatting with the family. We used a room for a business meeting and it was great. The AC worked very well. The room was spacious. The restrooms were also clean and sanitary. I didn't see a single thing to be upset about. Even the girl at the front desk was wonderful.

Text: We really enjoyed our stay here and the place is clean and updated.
My husband thought he lost his wallet when we checked in and the hostess was so nice, she told us we could go to the casino and have security look at the cameras.  We did just that, Shawn was the head of security, he was very helpful, we found the missing wallet (right where my husband left it last).....in the car.  
Thank you to all!

Text: I didn't stay at the hotel, so I can't tell you much about the rooms, but they're under renovation right now, which should only make this beautiful hotel on the river even more of a gem! Now on to the restaurant (Crave): The service was great! Drinks were always full, and the food actually isn't that expensive, and they give you generous portions. Great beer selection, and nice atmosphere both at the bar and the restaurant area.

Text: Very nice place. Had a wedding there. Prices for food we're kinda high. And would be five stars if they had a free breakfast. Cost $10 for 12yr and older, $5 for under 12
