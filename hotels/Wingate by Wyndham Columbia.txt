Text: The rooms were amazing and clean and didn't feel cheap at all they had elevators and the whole shebang. I also loved the pool area which also had a hot tub. The pool had lots of chlorine and was really clean and didn't go too deep for the youngins

Text: Very friendly service had an issue with the remote for the TV as soon as the staff was notified they sent a maintenance worker up to swap out the remote the room was very spacious great decor so many very bright and modern the lobby was very welcoming and any questions we had the staff was right there with an answer also the pool doesn't use chlorine so it doesn't burn your eyes like some hotel pools to do and the spa wow that felt so good after a long hard drive and Even Heaven a rinse off shower in the same area as the pool very few hotels that I stayed at have the option to rinse off before you get in the pool will definitely be staying at Wyndham hotel again

Text: Nice location with easy access to highways. Kinda petty but sheets on the bed were a bit loose fitting and there was a lack of overhead lighting.

Text: If I could give zero stars I would! My mom got a two free night stay from a member of my family for a hunnymoon and the day after her husband had to go to the clinic and found out he had pink eye and my mom went to the clinic after sitting in the hot tub to be told she got a ring worm from it! This is horrible and has made her hunnymoon a nightmare! Something needs to be done because that is uncalled for! We will call until something is done! ***the doctors said that they got pink eye and ring worm from the hot tub and pool!!***
