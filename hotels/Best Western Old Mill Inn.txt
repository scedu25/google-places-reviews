Best Western Old Mill Inn
Rating: 5
Text: I was only here for a night, but it was a great experience. Staff was friendly, the whole place was very clean. Pretty good location, it is a little wonky to get to, though. Also, this place had the best shower I've ever had in a hotel by far. Also had a vending machine that a credit card can be used at, always a plus. Finally, the express checkout worked super well-turned in my key and I was on my way.

Text: I was quite satisfied with my experience at the Old Mill Best Western. It was about 15 minutes from the downtown area. The price was reasonable and it had all the amenities I needed. My room was very clean and simply but nicely decorated. I appreciated the clean breakfast area and the staff was friendly and helpful. The food was a little above average for places that include free breakfast and always had hot dishes of eggs, biscuits, as well as waffles. The weight room was small but had a variety of machines. It was nice to have the pool and hot tub as well, but twice they had run out of towels when we were there - not a big deal though. For my purposes this place was great and I would recommend it.

Text: Very nice place for the price. Desk staff was very nice and helpful. Room was clean and large. Swimming pool was nice and warm. Loved the ding room. Very large to accommodate a lot if people. Clean and well kept. There were eggs and sausage as well as biscuit and gravy. A great value for your stay.

Text: Friendly staff, hard to get to from freeway, in a weird "Loop" could use more "Signage" by roads to lead people to the hotel in Omaha, 

Increase Bathroom size, Vanity sink should be in same room as the toilet, needs more horizontal areas to set down shaving kits, personal items like glasses and watches while showering, toilets need to be further from wall or tub on either side to properly to be able use it without injury to one's self in such a confined area, people are bigger, recommend that ob-longed toilets be used with at least 24 to 30 inches from any adjacent walls or other fixtures for a full grown adult! I had to go use the public restroom in order to fully and safely complete my "business" this is no joke!!! Other wise I would of given this room a higher rating. Showers need "flexihoses" with higher water pressure with settable "jet" or mist pressure. Not just for Handicapped persons(which I am one), but for normal people. If people cannot adequately clean themselves privately, safely, and comfortably , then what is the point of paying for a hotel? 

Breakfast was good, needs things like salsa, cheese,  and green onions for the eggs .

Increase area around toilets away from wall or tub!!! so people who are full sized adults can properly attend to their bodily functions without injuring themselves!!!
