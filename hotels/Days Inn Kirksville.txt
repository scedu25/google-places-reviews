Days Inn Kirksville

Text: The setup is a little strange, with the lobby, breakfast area, pool and game room all together.  I wanted to use the hot tub but not enough to do it in the lobby.  They are making improvements to the hallways, with new carpet and paint.  The room was comfortable but not anything special.  Little touches would help dramatically, like putting the fridge and microwave on a cart or enclosure, rather than stacking them against the wall.  Staff was friendly.  I could hear the people above me walking around.

Text: I was impressed when I walked in the lobby of this place. From the outside it doesn't look like much but the lobby is nice. The rooms need updating but they make up for it in hospitality.

Text: I usually stay at Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn, but this was a last minute stay and Days Inn was the in only hotel with a room available in the area... I now know why. The room was VERY dirty and I'm fairly certain that the linens hadn't been changed. The person at the front desk was new and a little lost, but that's fine. What was annoyed me was that the manager that should've been training her had zero interest in getting off of the couch he was sitting on or putting down his computer to lend any assistance. Well NEVER stay at a Days Inn again!

Text: Friendly staff, clean rooms...only problem I had was no fridge in room. Called  lobby they checked for me and didn't have one available.
Also, the room smelled like perfume/ strong deodorizer along with  towels washed in a heavy scent detergent...
