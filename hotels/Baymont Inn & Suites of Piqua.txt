Baymont Inn & Suites of Piqua

Text: At the present time this hotel rates 1 star. We arrived late at night to a clerk who did not know the answers to common questions. We asked for a king room but clerk put us in a 2 double room. It would have been more of a hassle to get it corrected than we had energy for. There are no microwaves in any rooms so it is an inconvenience to go down to the breakfast area to use that one. Our room smelled like pee. The a/c vent and the vent in the bathroom were very dirty. There was a used wash cloth hanging from the shower. And huge cobwebs hanging from the curtains. Because our company chooses the hotel and pays for our rooms, this is where we will be for the week.

Text: First of all staff was friendly. Website said there was microwaves in rooms but there wasn't- but there was one available in breakfast area. Website also said there was an exercise room at the time of my booking but there wasn't. I stayed there for 11 days & my sheets were never changed. All staff did was empty trash & leave clean towels. Continental breakfast wasn't very good. Only had eggs on it every other day. If you got there after last half of breakfast they would usually be out of yogurt & orange juice. Usually had to go next door to Cracker Barrel because there was nothing there the grandkids would eat (once they got tired of waffles). Toilet & sinks were never cleaned by staff. Was very disappointed.

Text: Bed sheets was not changed. The place was too warm for 90 degree temps outside. The pool site had dead flys in it the windows were open. If I wanted a outside pool there was plenty to choose from. Totally not satisfied. What is this establishment going to do about our stay to make it comfortable for us. And better not nothing so why do you want reviews. ????

Text: Ok for starters.....walked into a room full of STINK BUGS! Did our best to get them out the room via window. Window sill had blood on it. In one corner of the room was a huge spider web with a dead insect in it. Towels would have been suitable for a 5 year old and were rough. The trash containers outside were plum full of trash. On the flip side.....breakfast was pretty good.

Text: Disgusting place in every regard... arrived to find 15-20 people outside each entrance to the building in plastic chairs partying, smoking and drinking... 2 men hanging out of windows drinking and shouting at people... front desk clerk apologized before checking me in for the "condition of the hotel..." carpet ripped and stained in many places and had not been vacuumed in a very long time... hallway smelled like cooking fish despite no restaurant in the building... room haphazardly cleaned with items not straightened, bed poorly made, window open, ripped screen in said window... 

This is the 2nd time I have reserved a stay at a Baymont, and both experiences have been undesirable and thus canceled upon arrival.  Suffice it to say that I will never again make a reservation at a Baymont Inn.  Wyndham should be ashamed for these dives being included in their hotel group.
