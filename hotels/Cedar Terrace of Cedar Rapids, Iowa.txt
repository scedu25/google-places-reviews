Text: Horrible place. Raise the rent Every single year and never do anything to the actual appearance of the park. The Janitor's and manager are lazy. No one ever in office or answer the phone, will not return phone calls and refuse to fix safety hazards such as broken pipes sticking out of the ground from empty lots. And huge rotten dead trees hanging over homes, dead branches breaking and falling onto homes and into yards!!! MANAGEMENT refuses to do ANYTHING..
