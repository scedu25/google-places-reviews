Hampton Inn Zanesville
Rating: 2
Text: The Front Desk was very helpful and had great customer service. I arrived around 830-9pm. The room was great and very comfy. The only reason this is a two star rating is because of the breakfast selection. I've been to hotels that offer cheaper rooms with greater variety of breakfast items. Very disappointed in the breakfast selection especially for being a Hampton, go to steak n Shake next door for a better meal.

Text: The service was amazing. Everyone I ran into had a smile and was willing to go above and beyond to help. I do wish that there was a hot tub to soak in for after a workout. Other than that, no complaints.
