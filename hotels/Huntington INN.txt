Text: They need to do more research on properties they put on their websites like orbitz and google. The pictures on this website were probably 15-20 years old! The hotel even looks like the Bates motel straight out of Psycho! We pulled up and there was no one to even check us in. Also, we have a young child and refused to stay there with him! I better get my money back for this stay! I have updated pictures of the outside of this ratchet place!

Text: Would highly recommend not to stay here! We booked 2 nights but only stayed the one. Our room was disgusting, hair all over the shower walls,dead bugs in the floor, cobwebs, someone's mascara tube left  on the floor,the walls were dirty,burn holes on the sheets,smelt bad and very out dated. Employees were very rude,instead of trying to make things better for their customers,they argued with us and called us liars when we wanted a refund on our room!

Text: Internet not working, roaches and room was general filthy.  The roaches were the last straw.  Packed up in a hurry and left at 10:30 PM in my nightgown no less...
