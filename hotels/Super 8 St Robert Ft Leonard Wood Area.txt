Text: Great place to stay for the price. The customer service was excellent. The woman who checked us in went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. Rooms were clean. We traveled from Phoenix to Fort Leonardwood via car and honestly this was the best cheap hotel experience we have had on our trip. Kudos to the staff. Thank you for a great nights sleep.

Text: Very friendly and nice staff. Laid back atmosphere.  When had to leave early and was only charged late check out fee. Easy to get to Ft Leonard Wood from hotel. Wal-Mart and other gas station, stores close by, but yet location of hotel gives privacy. Cons:  WiFi was hit and miss (maybe due to surrounding hills), pool was super chlorinated (eyes burn as soon as you walk in), rooms are average clean (dust along floor boards) and blankets thin.  Beds super comfortable

Text: Nice sized room, clean with a pool & fitness room & breakfast. My only issue was the bed is a little to hard for me. Most hotels are. I recently stayed at a different one that was better though.

Text: The floors smelled and looked like regret and remorse.. I was fortunate to stay in a clean room. Beds and pillows comfortable. Housekeeping on their top game. 3 stars
