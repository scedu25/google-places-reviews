Text: Quick Friendly service, great water pressure for shower, overall clean and comfy room. The downside was that even with blackout curtains, the extremely bright lights outside still illuminated the room. The air conditioner was extremely slow in cooling the room from the set temp of 75 to 68.

Text: Pet friendly hotel.  They gave us a room right next to an exterior for so we could take the dog out easily. The room was very nice, clean and spacious.

Text: Our stay was recently, during their renovation. We asked to look at our assigned room to decide if we wanted to stay. The polite young gentleman, Alinson, took us up and showed us our room and assured us we would be completely satisfied. He was very correct and our stay was Great. First impressions are very important, and he was very professional and kind to us. Alinson is a top notch employee and a dedicated representative who made us feel comfortable staying there !!!

Text: Renovation in progress. Hot and dusty, but that's to be expected. Otherwise it's a typically good HI Express. Great breakfast! Minor room charge issue, but it was not a local problem.

Text: Very bad place to stay. Beetles really bad. No place to hang cloths to keep nice. Bathroom way to small.
