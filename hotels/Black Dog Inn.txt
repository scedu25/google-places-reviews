Black Dog Inn

Text: If I could give this B&B more than 5 stars I would. The owners of this quaint establishment make you feel right at home. We took a mini vacation with our two sons and could not have had a better experience. The kindness of our hosts is unparalleled. The grounds are adorned with beautiful flowers and mature trees. The inside is very nicely decorated and very very clean. Great water pressure and comfy beds made it easy to settle in after a day at the park or exploring the town.  The delicious homemade breakfasts helped start our mornings off on the right foot. I can't do this fantastic home away from home justice by words alone, you should definitely check it out yourself! Thank you Tom and Vicki, for becoming a part of one of our family's greatest memories.

Text: I can't say enough about this beautiful 1887 historic home & bed and breakfast! The Black Dog Inn was beyond our expectations. We stayed in room #4 (Jake's Room) with a king size bed and private attached bathroom. The room was very spacious, there was a table, couch, love seat, TV, all the amenities to make it feel like home! The bathroom and room were both very clean and well kept. We also made use of the common area, where there was a microwave and fridge. The owners were great hosts, Tom, Vicki, and of course, the black dog, Bo! They made it seem like the place was ours, they gave us plenty of space and welcomed us into their home. Bo (the black dog) was extremely friendly and loving. We didn't have to worry about him bothering us at all. The breakfast in the morning included hot coffee, homemade cinnamon bread, scrambled eggs, fruit, and cereal. Vicki and Tom were more than accommodating. The house is an amazing place to relax, unwind, and indulge in some beautiful history. I would recommend this over any hotel in Monticello. I know my family and I can't wait for our next visit!

Text: My family and I stayed at the Black Dog Inn over the 8/15/10 weekend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Tom and Vicki were exceptional hosts and we absolutely loved Bo - he made our separation from our own dog very easy.  Even if you're not a dog person, Bo is the most unassuming, non-threatening dog you'll ever encounter (minus the tail which can be painful!).
The rooms were quaint and comfortable and the Inn was a short walk from the Indiana Beach suspension bridge.
We look forward to our next stay at the Black Dog Inn!
