Holiday Inn Express Waterloo-Cedar Falls

Text: I like it, it is located on a road where you can access the highway really quick but also not to far from dinner places. It is well maintained and usually there are some free snacks on the afternoon so overall good place to stay for business travel

Text: Par for Holiday inn....nice staff and nice rooms. Looked like they were finishing up Construction to update the hotel. Most of the rooms were updated but they were still updating the downstairs (Nov 2017)

Text: Large dining room with plenty of both hot/cold choices. Even though the hot tub wasn't working, the grandkids enjoyed the large, clean pool area.  Great showerhead and water pressure.  Liked the choices of pillow firmness. My dad appreciate the military discount he was given, also.
