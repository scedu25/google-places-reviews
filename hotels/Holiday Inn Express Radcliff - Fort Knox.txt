Text: Room was really nice, after I got in and fixed some things. When I got in there the AC was off so it was very warm. The refrigerator was off so I couldn't put some food I had purchased in it. It's inside a stand that also has a microwave and a coffee machine, but there are only two power outlets, and that math doesn't add up. Once I plugged it in everything was fine. Room slept comfortably overnight and the breakfast was very nice and pretty robust.

Text: The hotel is recently renovated and it came out great. There are still some rooms that are being finished but it has been done very well. Breakfast is also really good. Automated pancake maker is a gift from the gods

Text: Checked in on August 4th for two nights and was greeted by a very friendly young women at the front desk. Also when we got to the room we found a wonderful note from a housekeeper named Mary. I got to meet her before checking out and she was even more pleasant in person. I recently lost my mother so to come to this hotel for a little get away was something I needed and for the wonderful service we was giving made our stay even more pleasant. Your staff was kind and very quick to helping our needs through our stay and I hope to come back again soon.

Text: A pretty decent stay at this hotel overall. I just stayed for the one night, but it was a good stay. The lobby was very nice and clean, and smelled fresh. The room was spacious and there's a wide verity of channels on TV.
