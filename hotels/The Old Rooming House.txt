The Old Rooming House
Rating: 5
Text: Was looking for somewhere affordable to stay while visiting New Harmony for a couple days.  This was a neat old house loaded with vintage books and decor and some sweet old-school bikes to ride around town or on the trails.  Very quirky yet peaceful place to stay that matches the quirkiness and peacefulness of the town.  I loved the Rooming House and loved visiting New Harmony.  A curious place to explore that makes you forget about the time and just take a chill pill.  I highly recommend Jim's Rooming House and visiting this neat little town!  Would definitely come back for another visit!

Text: Great, nostalgia and quiet place to go. The 4th bedroom allowed us to have or kids with us and even they loved all the neat old items.

Text: Old rooming house was wonderful!! games, books, and antiques in every room. It's like staying in a museum. Most places you want to see in New Harmony are in walking distance or you can borrow a bike.  There is no TV or Internet, but if you want to unwind. This is best place to go.
