Text: Clean, newer room, quiet place. Stayed one night on business trip. Walk distance to Outback steakhouse. A bit further walk can get you to the AMC movie theater. Hot breakfast was with quality food and descent varieties.It also offers to-go pack. Front desk staff was very friendly and was willing to show their hospitality.
