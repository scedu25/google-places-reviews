Text: Stayed just one night.  Barb is a wonderful person. Funny, polite, informative and all around peach!  She even brought me some jalapeño poppers that she had made for dinner.  They were yummy.  Nice park. Would stay again.

Text: Very nice park. Has pull thru, full hookups. Playground, swimming pool, lake, propane, public bathrooms, laundry. Barb is very friendly. If we get through there again, we will definitely stay again. Not a real large campground but it was plenty big enough for us. I think there was 88 sites with picnic tables and fire ring. Plenty of room between sites.

Text: Have camped here now many times.  The owners are obliging and nice. It is quite and cozy. We do group camping and couldn't ask for a better spot. Inexpensive, quite and  quaint, exactly what camping should be.

Text: I love Okaw Valley Kampground!!! Its clean, its peaceful, its beautiful. You can walk all of the way around the large fishing pond wonderful place. My pictures are from my earlier trip there this year, I've been here many different times of the year and in the summertime there is so much green and flowers, its a must see. 

Edit: seen a person say they give out personal information, I've never had any problems with my personal information and from the sounds of it others don't either.
