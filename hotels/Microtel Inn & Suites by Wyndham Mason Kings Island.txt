Text: I had low expectations going in, and it wasn't as bad I expected. I arrived at midnight and left at 4 am so I didn't spend much time there, but I did notice that the bathtub was dirty. The bathroom counter is remarkably tiny. The bed was acceptable as were the pillows and blankets. The interior of the building looked ramshackle and didn't appear to be well kept

Text: All I can say is that you get what you pay for. The room had a musty oder smell.  I feel that  housekeeping can do a lot better job at cleaning. This hotel has potential to be a lot better. It's in a great location and staff was nice, but the housekeeping needs work.

Text: The Wyndham reservation agent asked if I would participate in a quick survey which ended up being a pitch to get me to go to a time share by Wyndham. I have been getting phone calls and emails soliciting me ever since. I will never stay at a Wyndham owned chain ever again.

Text: Took forever to check in, keys expired after the first night and had to get them renewed. Another guest was checking in at the same time as me, and he was assigned a room that already had people in it, so he accidentally walked in on them sleeping! The best way I can describe the room is that it smelled and felt wet. Breakfast was poor. Overall not a great experience.
