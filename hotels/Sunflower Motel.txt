Text: My family stayed for one restful night. Cheerful and friendly staff. We loved the wifi, cable, and soft mattress/pillows. I recommend this place for those who needs a goodnight sleep.

Text: This is wayyy late, but I had to write this. Not at all what we were expecting, but it was well worth it. Nice, quiet, beautiful place to rest. We stayed over Labor Day Weekend and had an amazing time. Great staff, amazing cozy room and overall delight.

Text: Husband and I came into town for family and read the reviews online for this motel so we tried it. The owners work front desk and were super friendly. We got the king room. It was clean and smelt good and the decor was homey. It was quiet. The price was right in our budget. Only reason did not get 5 stars and it's little, the sink drained slow. Which is proble fixed by now. But I would still definitely stay here again and recommend them to anyone traveling thur.

Text: It was maybe the best motel I never seen. The owner was very helpful, and she advises you on the good place to eat in town.
I would return soon.
