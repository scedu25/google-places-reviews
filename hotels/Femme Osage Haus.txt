Text: I went with my sisters to have a girls weekend.  We had a fantastic time.  Mary is a wonderful host.  She was not able to be there for part of our stay and so we also met her sister Kay, who was great.  The house is comfortable,  The breakfast was good. The setting of the house is beautiful.  The price was very reasonable.  I left my jewelry there by accident and they let me know and mailed it back to me.  From the big things and small things it was a great experience!
