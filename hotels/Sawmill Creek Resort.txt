Text: Beautiful resort that has it all.  Would give it five stars but the resort was built on an Indian burial ground.  During the construction, they removed the tombstones but didn't remove the bodies, which caused an evil spirit to trap our daughter in another dimension.  They offer free wifi, but they charge extra for paranormal investigators.

Text: We went for Sunday Brunch. The food was great. We were a little disappointed that their credit card machine was down. Luckily we had cash (total bill for our group was $80). Service was just okay. We asked for a high chair when we arrived. We had to ask a second person, who took forever to find one. It also took a long time to get drinks.

Text: My family wanted to feel like we were on a beach vacation  without the 9 or 10 hour drive.   We made a great choice when staying at Sawmill Creek Resort.   My husband golfed while my son and his friend swam at the private beach.. We even got to witness a wedding at the beach.  We played basketball,  rented bikes,  swam at the lake and pool, and had a great meals at the restaurant.   We only left the resort one day and that was so we could take the kids to Cedar Point.  I would definitely  stay there again.

Text: We stayed here as a team for a soccer tournament and would definitely return. The resort is large and spread out so there are lots of fun things for the kids to do. 

The pool area is great to hang out in groups with both an indoor and outdoor pool with plenty of seating. There are also tennis courts a volleyball net as well as a nice practice field with nets.

The staff were also pretty friendly.

I would give this place 4.5 stars if i could because the rooms are a bit dated but not enough to lose a full star.
