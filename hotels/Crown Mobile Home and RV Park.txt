Crown Mobile Home and RV Park
Rating: 3
Text: I have lived here for about 20 years and give this place 3 stars because of the theft and break-ins that have occurred. I have personally had bikes and wagons stolen from my yard as a child, my parents have had their radio stolen from their vehicle 10 or so years ago, and I had my car broken into last year (nothing was stolen since there was nothing worth taking, they just left a big mess in my car). Another issue my family has had is that they keep raising the cost for lot rental. You are only permitted 2 vehicles per property, so any extra cars are charged $50 a month. My family has only had 2 cars but the neighbors keep parking in front of our home, since they have 4 vehicles. However, despite these issues, most neighbors and employees here are friendly and helpful. One thing I definitely wish would change is they need to have actual street names in the neighborhood. Anytime I have company, they easily get lost and sometimes their gps takes them to the wrong trailer because there are no street signs/names. I also wish this neighborhood was dog friendly. This place is a good 3.5/5
