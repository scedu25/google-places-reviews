Text: It was good.  I felt the haggling at the front desk for my second night stay.  Nothing really super close that you can walk too.  Room was very clean with tons of channels on the tv.

Text: Booked room ahead of time only for it to be given away and have no place to stay upon arrival. Completely screwed me over, as other hotels were then booked. Owner was not apologetic and didn't care whatsoever.

Text: Tried to book with them. They charged me 100 dollars for 'authorization transaction' called my bank and they confirmed it wasn't an authorization transaction but an actual charge! 

The guy on the phone was rude and kept hanging up on me though I kept my calm. 

When I asked 'is this hundred dollars going towards my stay?' He just kept telling me 'authorization transaction' over and over and over! He called my banker stupid and said she doesn't know what she's doing. 

I've worked customer service for 3 years and this is poor and beyond unacceptable customer service. 

Bad bad bad!

Text: After we got rooms and moved stuff in manager told us we couldn't park our pickups on the lot, so we asked for a refund and they got all no, but did once the police arived. Police were there since truck was vandalized. Was there less than 3 hours. Don't recommend staying at all, spend the extra 15 bucks and drive the 5 miles you'd save as to no hassle.
