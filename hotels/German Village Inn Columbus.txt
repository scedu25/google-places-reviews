German Village Inn Columbus
Rating: 2
Text: It's not the Hilton, that's for sure. We were traveling and needed a cheap place to basically take a nap. The only redeeming factor was the bed was clean, comfortable, and soft pillows. The guy at the front desk was friendly and helpful. Room Wasn't very clean, broken coffee pot, microwave was unplugged, so we had to move it, then plug it in for instant coffee. Room was kind of dirty (Not vacuumed) but you can tell they've updated a few things recently.

Text: The price was about 30% cheaper than other budget motels in Columbus. Room was clean and it appeared as though the carpet and sinks had recently been replaced. The A/C did have a bit of a damp odour when turned on. We skipped breakfast since it didn't seem overly appetizing - mostly packaged baked goods and premade microwavable sandwiches - pretty much what you would find at a convenience store. There was a fight in the motor court at about 5 am that was promptly dealt with by the staff. Overall average value for money but the neighbourhood that the motel is situated in is beautiful with many nice places to visit which pushed this rating up.

Text: Get what you pay for with a cheap room.  At least it was clean, no bed bugs. Cable did not work well nor had the continental breakfast been resupplied in a few days.  It is very close to establishments and the bike trail. Overall ok value.
