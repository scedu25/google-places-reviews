Text: I'm very pleased with our stay here, clean comfortable rooms, bed slept great! Riley at the front desk is an amazing young lady! She was so accommodating to us as I had hurt my knee on vacation and wasn't getting around good. She went above and beyond making me ice packs, helping with our things, information about delivery for dinner, the list goes on. We will be back here for sure in our travels!!

Text: Room was comfortable, however, I got there at 5 and my room was not ready when I had been told when I booked that check in was at 4. Took about 15 minutes

Text: Cavaris was so friendly and went the extra mile with our check in and gave a really good dinner recommendation.  Hotel located off the beaten path and homey atmosphere.
