Text: Very clean, spacious rooms and friendly staff. Affordably priced compared to nationwide chain hotels and motels that overcharge for small, mass-constructed cookie-cutter rooms.

Text: Made reservations for 2 rooms on Tues 12/29 asked if he needed to hold the reservation with a credit card & was told no not necessary then called to confirm reservation on Thurs 12/1 for arrival on Fri 12/2; it was confirmed & was assured at that time all rooms had a refrigerator & microwave. We arrived on Fri 12/2 & was told by the extremely rude attendant which was the same man I spoke with on both occasions he did not have reservations for us! He then said we needed to call after 12 to see if there would be any rooms available, there was 3 card in the parking lot, 3! I asked to speak with the owner of the motel & he refused to give me a name or number; I called twice after we decided this was so unprofessional & he hung up on me!!! If anyone knows the owner or supervisor of  this motel please post name & number. 
Thank you
