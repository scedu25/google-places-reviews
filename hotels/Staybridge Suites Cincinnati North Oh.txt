Text: I love this place. I will make a point to stop and stay at a Stay Bridge over any other Hotel. It is a home away from home. Every room has a stove and refrigerator microwaves in all the rooms. FREE laundry also a  workout center . They serve breakfast  dinner, snacks and beverages in the lobby daily. The staff is very nice very helpful. I choose stay bridge over any other place when it comes to overnight stay . Truly a gold mine

Text: It is a fabulous place! The staff were very friendly, and the rooms were fantastic as they were all kitchenette rooms. The room was very clean what so ever and I was impressed with the design of the room as it’s a very functional space. I would recommend this hotel if you are staying for 5 days or more.

Text: It looks and feel way better than shown on the web - they have tons of benefits like free entrance to a local gym (professional one) they serve great breakfast which they keep refreshing the dishes every morning, on Monday to Wednesday they also offer free dinner + 0.5 usd beer (!).

They give you free laundry service... the rooms are nice and new the hotel is quite and the staff are very helpful
