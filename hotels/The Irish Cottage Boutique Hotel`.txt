Text: My wife and I had a fantastic stay at this hotel. Rooms were very nice, breakfast was excellent, and the attached pub was very good as well. We also got massages at the day spa and they were some of the best ever. Highly recommended for your stay in Galena.

Text: Just got back.  Wonderful place.  Have been there several times over the years.  Met Jack for the first time, fantastic person. Fantastic hotel. Best part, does not cater to children and when we were there, there were none.  Fantastic hotel, rooms, bar, service and people.  Everybody is very friendly.  Will be returning soon.

Text: The rooms were a little dated for the price but overall a good hotrl. It looks like a bed and breakfast from the website however it's a boutique hotel that looks like it has been converted from a Hilton. I wish I brought my suit, as they do have a pool with a hot tub. Breakfast was alright.

Text: This place is amazing! The atmosphere is very cozy and accommodating, as is the staff. In addition, the amenities on site are top notch. Frank O'Dowd's Pub has great food and drinks and the Galena Day Spa will make you feel relaxed and refreshed. If you ever need a great place to stay, this is always my number one choice and one I can strongly recommend!
