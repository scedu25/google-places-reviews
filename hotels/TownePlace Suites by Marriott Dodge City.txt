TownePlace Suites by Marriott Dodge City
Rating: 4
Text: This is probably the nicest extended stay hotel I have ever visited. We had three people staying in their largest suite for over a month, and it was very comfortable and homey. The staff was beyond accommodating, and really added to the stay. There is an outdoor pool, fitness center, and business features. The breakfast is pretty decent as well.

Text: Nice place to stay in Dodge City. Reasonably priced. Clean, comfortable rooms. Conveniently located, although no eating or drinking establishments within walking distance and no sidewalk along street anyway so need a vehicle to get around. Full kitchen allows for eating in.

Text: We were in town during one busiest times of the year, Dodge City Days. The original hotel we had booked some how lost our reservation, knowing it would be almost impossible to find a room. We called the Towne Place Suites by Marriott Dodge City and they had a room. The staff was super friendly, got us checked in quick and painlessly. The room was very nice and clean. The breakfast bar in the am was great too. I cant say enough great things about this stay. I will definitely be looking for Town place Suites the next time I travel!
