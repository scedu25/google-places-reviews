Super 8 Cave City
Rating: 5
Text: Pool and hot tub was amazing. Maid service was amazing. Shower head left a little to be desired (water pressure), but it still got us clean. Very clean rooms and nicely decorated. Loved the photographs that doubled as headboards; wish I could have a set for own home. Comfy beds. Five star hotel at an economical price.

Text: This place is amazing it was a little more expensive than the rest in the area but there is a reason for it. Great hot breakfast rooms were clean and staff was so pleasant I think we actually stayed here because the night shift gentleman was so nice and friendly. Would stay again while passing through.
