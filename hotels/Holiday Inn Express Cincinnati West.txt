Holiday Inn Express Cincinnati West

Text: Great location.   Staff was pretty friendly.  Very close to downtown Cincinnati.  Hotel appears tired and rundown.  Carpet in our room was unbelievably filthy.  Huge dark stains near the bed and along the entrance.   Much needed rehab/renovation would really help this hotel

Text: We stayed here only one night while in town for a funeral. Every single person working here was so friendly and helpful, the room was very clean, the breakfast selection was great. All amenities were above average. Great deal for the $$. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Nice, quiet hotel with a nice complimentary breakfast every morning. Rooms have microwaves and Keurig brewers, as well as a mini fridge. Only issue was that our room was never really cleaned until 3pm each day. Other than that it has been a great stay.

Text: Our third year in a row coming here. Great staff, wonderful breakfast, some excellent restaurants in the area- El Rancho Grande on Harrison and the steak house across the way. Convenient location for access to many parts of Cincinnati.
