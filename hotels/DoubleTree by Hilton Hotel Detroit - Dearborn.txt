Text: This hotel was excellent. The service was incredible and the food was very good and did not feel or taste like mass production. All the employees were kind, helpful and on top of things. The gentleman that handled our room Tuesday morning was such an awesome employee. I highly recommend this for any event. Our professional development was great there.

Text: Had a great stay here. The amenities like the hot tub, fitness center and free cookies upon check in were all excellent and made our stay enjoyable. We were even able to push back our check out time which was convenient, however the housekeeping staff didn't seem to be notified and were a little unpleasant when we had to explain what we were doing.
