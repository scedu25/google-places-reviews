Sonesta ES Suites St. Louis - Westport
Rating: 5
Text: This has got to be the best hotel chain ever.  The rooms are amazing.  The walls are painted in subtle pastels, which makes the rooms bright and cheery.  The beds are incredibly comfortable and the pillows might be the best I have ever slept on and I don't even like feather pillows.  The suites are spacious and the kitchen is well stocked.  They have beer and wine available in the lobby and usually have a dinner time snack available.  If I had to pick a weak point, it would be breakfast.  It is only OK.  I feel like if they had some sort of signature breakfast item like big, gooey cinnanon rolls, this place would be perfect.  One other potentially wake point is that the air conditioning is very loud and blows right on the person on the left side of the bed.  This is a just a minor detail.  I never want to leave when it is time to check out and honestly feel like I could live there quite comfortably for some time.  My husband and I have joked that we only want to vacation in cities that have Sonesta ES Suites!  I hope they continue to expand because they really are one of the best.

Text: We had a two-room suite. We enjoyed the large accommodation, homey atmosphere, large kitchen (especially for a hotel) showers and bedrooms. It was comfortable, beautifully decorated, and clean. We absolutely loved our stay there.

Text: I really enjoyed my accommodations and stay. We booked a 2 bedroom suite which was spacious, bright, well decorated and CLEAN. The pool area was very nice, the breakfast was good....The hotel staff were friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay at a Sonesta in the future.

Text: I enjoyed my stay here. The rooms where clean and I didn't see any bugs. I would recommend this spot to family and friends coming to St. Louis, MO. The price was reasonable thumbs up. 
The only issue I had was waiting on my suit to be clean to check in, but I'm not complaining because I rather have a properly clean suit than one half clean.

Text: Sonesta is our go-to in St Louis! The suites are new, well furnished and quite large - perfect for the kids, and the rates are always comparable to regular hotels. Breakfast is something different every day with lots of options, and evening appitizers several days a week make an easy dinner if we're around for them. Staff have always been great too. We'll be there again soon I'm sure!
