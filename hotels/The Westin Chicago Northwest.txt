The Westin Chicago Northwest

Text: Very nice clean upscale hotel with friendly staff. The pool area is well kept as is all the other common areas of the hotel. The rooms are up to date with large screen TV's and Internet. This is one of the more relaxing places I've stayed in awhile.

Text: The staff is wonderful and the check in process was quick. The rooms are nicer than expected and are stylish and up to date. There are many dining options around the property and a nice walking trail. The pool and fitness center are top notch. Definitely a recommended place to stay.

Text: The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful! They do not have an airport shuttle, but they do have one that will take you anywhere within a 5 mile radius... So easy access to the train and near by mall. Overall great hotel.

Text: Very accessible for our offices location. Having WiFi and breakfast buffet included in the price of the stay is an amazing deal. The balconies opening up over the lobby from your room door is a very inspiring effect. The restaurant has great choices and was quite delicious.

Text: Hotel looks nice but their customer service is really unprofessional and rude. They hung up when I ask the person name who is helping me and saying "I can't hear you"  but you can still hear the rest of the conversation. I called back and another representative was helping me and put me in hold again. I called again S representative was back who couldn't hear me and pass me to her manage right away. I was able to get helped but still rude. This whole group did not apologize for their mistake and passing frustration on me. First person didn't even know (or not try to help?) how to pull up my reservation but later manager was able to do it. I can't believe this was Westin hotel. Everything was pleased until you had to deal with non sense customer service. Awful
