Staybridge Suites Indianapolis-Fishers
Rating: 4
Text: We were just visiting with family that was staying at the hotel, but it seemed very nice. The rooms were pleasant and had amenities I don't think I've ever seen at a hotel before, like a full-sized fridge and garbage disposal. They have a lovely courtyard with multiple grills, and an indoor pool and hot tub. Both pool & jacuzzi were decent, but not exceptional really. The only real negative to the experience was when my brother-in-law was told he couldn't have his drink at the pool, but it was in a container that did not break any pool rules. Overall, a very nice place to stay, especially if you want to have visitors while staying.

Text: We had a 2 bedroom suite for the weekend that accommodated 6. It was plenty of space and everything was covered. Full-size fridge, stovetop, microwave, pans, bowls, plates, silverware, etc. Dining room table, tv's in each room, 2 full bathrooms, and extra pillows and blankets already in the room. My kids loved the breakfast both mornings and ate well. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub also. A great time was had by all of us!!

Text: Top-notch! Very clean and all the amenities you can think of. The gym was a little rundown, exercise bike was on the fritz. However, free cookout food and drinks for dinner and excellent hot breakfast. This place is great.
