Interstate RV Park

Text: We stayed here for 6 nights in Davenport. Close to everything we needed. A nice park with lots of grass. Spots were kid of close together. There was a swimming pool. They were working constantly on the grounds so things looked great.

Text: Seems like a nice park if you don't get assigned to one of the sites like we were on. It was VERY narrow! Our slides almost touched the neighbor's. ? An ok place for an overnight.

Text: One star because you have to. They would not take reservations. We got there after hours. Had a hard time negotiating the roads. Very tight and could not see the sign telling us where to turn. We were trying to get in a spot that we just could not get into at our angle. Owner stood on her porch with a man and watched as we went back and forth. No one came over to tell us to back up and take take a certain road in. We made another go around and finally found the road. Owner was waiting at the end of that road angry as a wet hen that we dislocated 2 paver stones from her homemade garden. Said she was calling the police. When we got in our narrow spot we saw that someone else took out some of her garden ahead of us. High priced. And the pool is EXTRA! Tried to see what she wanted us to do about fixing her stones. We didn't want to do any more damage ( her words). RUN, to another camp ground.

Text: Very clean, plesant with flat sites. We'll kept. Friendly and ready to work with.  One down side was the store.  It had very few items.  They do have a Foosball and air hockey as well as a plethora of movies.

Text: Truck stops for fueling at the same exit and the park was easy in but not easy out . A little tight with the turns and narrow sites that were not  level. Baths seemed clean, and for a big rig recommend site 8-14 for an easier exit. Pricey for what you get.
