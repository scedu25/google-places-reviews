Text: Outlet shorted in our first room with Sparks.  Lost all power in our room.  Moved us to another room.  Air condition loudly kicked in and.out all night and our bathroom tub would not drain.

Text: Super 8 Ames, It's OK for the price, you can't complain too much and you can tell it's been getting some attention recently, a lick of paint here, there oh and paint splatter all on the windows, the rear access door doesn't lock so security is not the best, the furniture just like every super 8 we have stayed in recently is very dated and tired looking, power points, like Danny devito are in short supply and just shows how behind the times Super 8 as a chain are, most guests will have 2 devices to charge with them yet you offer no sockets for use. Breakfast is also only just classifiable as breakfast, IHOP or similar may be a better choice

Text: Very good for the price. Not over the top , but a price point hotel. Water pressure good and free wifi.
