Text: It was a nice hotel, located right off the highway, friendly staff, restaurants nearby, good hot breakfast, rooms were nice, jetted tub were huge and worked great, pool was small, the couple things I didn't like was there was no microwave in the room, and the layout of the room. The tub was right next to the bed. Other than that, good over stay.

Text: Awsome staff, nice clean and quiet. Good location right off interstate, and not far from town. Recommend to anyone.. only drawback was no elevator. But many rooms available on first and second floor. 
Will be staying here again.

Text: The room was ok. My room smelled like stale cigarettes and liquor, my cousins room smelled like dog poop. They need filters or something. They need a bigger parking lot. There was some kind of party going on I guess with some tenants. They used up the parking spaces. We were told to park by the liquor store. We said nope, they tow out of state cars. Not worth the $100 dollars it cost me
