Xtreme Hunts

Text: My hunt went the way it was explained to me on the phone when I booked the hunt with Tony May. In the first two days of hunting I saw five different bucks on two different farms that I hunted. The deer were within bow range too. I decided to wait a bit longer for a mature buck, 5 1/2 or older more towards the end of that week. On the third day I saw the deer I was looking for, but he never presented me with a good shot. Nonetheless it was a great experience to see a deer over 155 inches chasing a doe near my stand. The deer was nicknamed "Twin Towers" just to give you an idea of what he was like.

The guides were good and knew the property well, especially the deer that they were trying to get me to harvest. They did their homework beforehand. That was the most impressive part of my hunting experience. 

Stands were well marked and easy to find, even in the dark. The properties I hunted at were dream properties, with vast crop fields and lots of hardwoods and water running thru. It was a true Midwest hunting experience for me.

I booked another hunt for 2017 and I am looking forward to going back.
