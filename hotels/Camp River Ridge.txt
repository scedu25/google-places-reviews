Camp River Ridge

Text: This is an amazing camp!! The priests, brothers, missionaries, and counselors who run the camps and retreats are top notch, the property is beautiful, the food is great and there is a perfect blend of faith and fun!  Kids grow closer to Christ while building comradeship with their peers! I have sent my sons here for 17 years and they have always had a wonderful experience!

Text: The location is perfect!  The men, women, Priests and Consecrated who run the camps here are so skilled at working with young people.  Our son has been to several camps (both as a camper and a counselor) and he loves it every time.  Well done!

Text: My son likes the camp very much.  From parent perspective I am very happy that he received religion education in combination with fun, games,  and  outdoor activities, playing with other boys.  I hope he realized that there is much more joy and excitement  in real world apart from computer games and TV. The place is beautiful, filled with adventures and fun. Thanks a lot to priests and everyone who made it happen. God bless!

Text: This was our first year at Camp River Ridge and my son loved it! An authentically Catholic camp (adoration, Marian procession, confession, and daily Mass) with a good mix of "camp" activities like swimming in the lake, water games, reenacting battles, horseback riding, building a fort, archery, etc.!
