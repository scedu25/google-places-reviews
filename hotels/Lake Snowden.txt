Lake Snowden
Rating: 5
Text: Lake Snowden is located outside of Athens near Albany. It's probably the least crowded lake around. It's 20$ for a seasonal parking pass. There's never many people on the water and plenty of places to get out of the sun. It's an idle only lake so very safe for any age. The camping areas are clean and well groomed. Home of the pawpaw fest and managed/owned by Hocking College.

Text: My wife and I and our children, really enjoyed lake Snowdon, in 2016 went there for our vacation last summer for two weeks.....  it's very quite peaceful place to camp with your family, lots of friendy people,they  repect others,  beautiful scenery and a great place to swim and fish and boat many things to do, volleyball etc........ just walking or riding a tennis cart around many beautiful things to see in nature, beautiful green water, you can hear the crickeks at nights, it stormed a night we was there is was so relaxing listening to the storm and the rain and wind. Just have to go and experience it all, at this campsite....... my family and I give it a 10 such a great place. We had 4 room tent and our van and grilled out, and they have showers and washer and dryer area as well. If you need to relax try this campsite? it's really one of the best. We will continue to go to this one we have been to others but this one is the one we always choose and will continue too Beautiful there.
