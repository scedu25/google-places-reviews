Edgetowner Motel

Text: Room was not clean. Extremely old bed and furniture. No outlets could be found. Smoke detector didn't appear to be in working order. Newer carpet but didn't appear to have been vacuumed. Dusty furniture. We have stayed here a few years ago and it was better. Our room needed a really good cleaning. Something appeared to have something splattered on the walls.  Sheets were clean. It was a quick trip so this was our only option. The former owners kept it up better. I hope the new owners will try to improve this facility.

Text: Clean, neat & basic. This is not a Hilton, Marriott or Sheraton. Reminds me of a 60's or 70's property. The owners have tried their best to make things right. $59.95 is a bargainl in August during the State fair/corn festival. Small fridge &  junior microwave. Accepts most credit cards.

Text: One star is generous. The desk clerk was very friendly and helpful, but that's the only positive here. Old and worn is fine when you just need a few hours off of the road. Filth is never acceptable. Room #28

Text: So no maid for two out of four days.  WiFi very poor.  No ice machine pop machine.  No snacks no frills.  DeSoto is John Wayne's birthplace I think he was born in one of these rooms.  Hard time finding place to stay booked through Orbitz he said he could have booked it cheaper but did not give me difference in price.  Note: if you book hotels on those websites call hotel/motel before to see if they will give you same day.  I paid $5.00 more per night.  These rooms throwback to the original equipment from the 50's.
