Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile

Text: I had an overnight stay at the Sofitel for a work event and I was impressed with the cleanliness of the bathroom and comfort of the bed. The towels were quality and soft, not those hard towels that scratch the heck out of you. I had breakfast the morning in one of the meeting rooms and the croissants, eggs and chicken sausage were fresh and delicious. The kitchen staff for the meeting rooms provided outstanding service. The hotel is environmentally conscious and the service is on par. I will return.

Text: To the staff & Management of the Sofitel Magnificent Mile, 

I want to sincerely thank you for making this trip so very special for my wife and I. Upon learning I was staying for the Marathon (as a runner), you went above and beyond to make my stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. 

The simple Gatorade, granola bar and note (the night before the race) was  an excellent gesture. The shuttle bus service to the start line was outstanding. You took off so much worry of mine on race day in order for me to concentrate only on my run. I cannot thank you all enough for such a wonderful stay and I look forward to returning next year!

Text: Beautiful hotel!! The room was great and the bed was so comfortable. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was in a perfect location for me being new to Chicago. It is right in the middle of everything with easy access to get out of the city. Highly recommend this hotel.

Text: We enjoy the greetings every morning and every time we came or left the hotel. Everyone we encountered in the bar or restaurant and front desk were pleasant and always had a "can do" attitude. 

We wished that there was a hot tub for soaking after walking/running all over the town. That would have been just perfect! 

Many thanks for a wonderful stay,
Ginger

Text: I had a beautiful stay while on business. I loved the location even though I'm more of a West Loop girl...I walked all over after the conference was done each day.  The room was lovely and I slept great. All in all a great stay.  I would really love to be able to open the windows, if only a crack, but realize that's not feasible with the architecture.  Finishes throughout are upscale and modern.  Concierge and staff very helpful.  Pro tip: get a fridge brought up if you want to store anything; the mini bar is exclusively that.
