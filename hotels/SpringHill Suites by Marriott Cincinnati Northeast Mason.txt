SpringHill Suites by Marriott Cincinnati Northeast/Mason

Text: The room was very nice. It was modern looking with a couch, desk, and small kitchenette, separated nicely from the king beg and bathroom. The hotel staff were all very friendly, everything was clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was very good. Probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, and I've traveled quite a bit. They had a lot of good fresh fruit, including strawberries and pineapple, and they had hot items such as eggs, sausage, and oatmeal, in addition to cold cut meats and cheeses, various baked goods, cereals, and yogurt. I really enjoyed my stay here even though it was short.

Text: I liked that the place was located back away from the busy street. It was next to a highway and you could hear it in your room but not loud enough to distract you. The pool area is nice because you can open the patio doors and have access to the outside. The room was clean and set up nice. The breakfast was good. Fresh scrambled eggs and rolled oats oatmeal with no added sugar that you could flavor how you wanted was great. They even had organic nectar to put on them which for me was a plus. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend.

Text: The bed was super comfy! Very clean room, lobby, breakfast area. The room was spacious and had a kitchenette area. I also like how tje vanity was separated from the barhroom, so that we could get ready at tje same time. The breakfast was good and hot tub jets were strong, and felt great after spending the while day at King's Island the day before. The staff was polite & helpful as well. I would recommend it.
