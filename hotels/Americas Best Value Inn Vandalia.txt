Text: A nice hotel. All room doors are outside, which they have both smoking and non smoking rooms. Staff is friendly, and make your stay as convenient as possible.

Text: $80 was not a deal. This is a 2 star hotel,  super 8 should be rated as a 4 star in comparison.   We did not see any roaches , but its defiantly a roach motel.   Non smoking room smells like stale smoke.   Good size outdoor pool !  Jays inn 2 blocks away is same quality half the price.

Text: It was a clean sleep. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Beautiful pool, but not as clean as should be. Breakfast was ok but a little lacking, with the nice sized kitchen one would think they would do a bit better. Overall good place and will stay again when in the area.
