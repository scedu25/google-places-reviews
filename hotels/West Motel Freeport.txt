Text: Nice place to stay , I have been there many times since last 20 years. I have business.affordable weekly & monthly. My advise to senier there is better senier discount available , better rates than super8 or Baymont inn, there rates skyrocketed rates how offer minimum breakfast. Better check this place before you go  rediculasly paying rates.
