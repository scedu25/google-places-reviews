Text: After not finding a room at the Hampton we had planned to stop at, we checked in around 11:30 pm for a quick overnight stay during our travels home from vacation. The man working the front desk was very pleasant and helpful when checking in, and asked us if we were AAA members for an additional discount. Our room smelled a little funky, and it looked quite outdated. Lighting in the room was very dimmed, which bothered me not being able to see if the room was clean. The mattress cover had brown stains on it, which was disturbing. Beds were small (full sized beds) and I just couldn't sleep well. When we woke up the next morning, we found a bug on the ceiling and checked out immediately. 

While the staff was friendly and accommodating, I rather had just driven through the night than pay an exorbitant amount for the below average room and be afraid we brought home some critters with us. The desk worker did give us a bit of a refund for the stain and bugs, but we felt a full refund was in order. We'll keep driving next time.

Text: Older amenities. Pool and hot tub were fun... Hot tub needs to be a little warmer. Rooms were in need of a regular, but are clean. Front desk staff were fantastic

Text: The hotel was clean throughout. The rooms were fine. The bed and pillows were comfortable so I slept well. My only issue was breakfast. Apparently the early bird gets all the gravy. With one hour left for breakfast there was no gravy to be had. Most fruit was gone. The refrigerator with milk was empty. Television was turned off at 9am when breakfast went to 10am. Very disappointed start to my day
