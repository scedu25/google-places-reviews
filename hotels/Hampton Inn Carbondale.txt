Text: We drove down from Chicago to Carbondale Illinois for the solar eclipse. Hampton Inn had a sign out inviting solar eclipse parking. It was very inviting. We never went into the Hampton Inn but it was nice to know that we were cordially invited to be in the parking lot

Text: The hotel is okay. Location is a little outside of town so there isn't much happening around. Plan to drive, rent a car, or get a taxi/Uber. The rooms and hotel are nice. Nothing out of the ordinary. Breakfast is complimentary and was okay. Staff wasn't overly friendly when I checked in, but was pretty standard and nice the rest of my stay.

Text: I was there for a meeting. I didn't see much other than the conference room but it was a very nice room. It looked to be a very nice hotel.
