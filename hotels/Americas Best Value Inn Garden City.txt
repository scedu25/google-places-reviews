Text: Really a great place to spend one night or several weeks. The staff is professional and care about your safety. Great rate for extended stay blue collar professions.

Text: The room was clean and the staff was great, my only complain is the internet, I had barely 1 bar of wifi on my room and when I walked closer to the lobby to get better signal it turns out it is super slow internet. I needed to download some documents that would take hours to download, better went to the IHOP and downloaded them there

Text: What a nice place for the money.  The people that stayed next to us about midnight threw their Tiny dog in their truck and left it.  Poor little dog keep barking.  I called the office and the girl at the desk took care of the situation right away.  I threatened to call the police!   Why do people have dogs if they are going to keep in cages and not take care of them?  
Anyway...  the room was very nice. Got my room online and it was only 60.  Very nice staff.  Would stay there again.

Text: Hotel room itself was clean and comfortable. The town of Garden City itself reekes of the surrounding factory farms, the smell was sickening. The stars are more related to the setting of the hotel. Non stinky would have gotten it a 3.
