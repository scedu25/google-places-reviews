Comfort Inn South Windsor

Text: What you expect from a comfort inn. Staff are a mix of pleasant and surly. Bed is fine, but not great. Basic low definition cable for TV. Free breakfast is available, but it certainly leaves something to be desired. No significant complaints. Nothing wonderful to say either.

Text: After one month staying in this hotel, I can say that here you can rest confortably well. You have a regular breakfast, good fitness equipments and you it is close to a lot of options of services and restaurants. I recommend.

Text: The condition of the room we stayed at was excellent. The customer service was awesome too! My bf had forgotten his toothbrush and the guy at the front desk was able to provide me one! They were just so friendly! My only issue was with the breakfast in the morning. I wished they had hot sauce there with the other condiments. That would have made the whole thing a ?% perfect experience.

Text: This is an excellent inexpensive hotel to stay at. It was recently renovated which makes for a more comfortable stay. During my last visit they accommodated a rather silly request of mine and it was hilarious. I have been staying here on business trips for the last few years and will continue to do so.

Text: Stayed at Comfort Inn Windsor for my son's soccer tournament. Staff was very accommodating with moving us to the first floor due to my mobility issues and no elevator. Shower was a bit finicky where it would not maintain the temperature setting and default was scalding hot water. Overall our stay was great.
