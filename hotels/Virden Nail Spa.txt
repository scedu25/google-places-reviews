Text: Gave it a second try and well I wont be back. First time the lady continuously burnt my nails with the Dremel, to the point I was bleeding and this time my nails are uneven and not all shaped the same. extra acrylic hanging off the sides. Way too much money for the result I walked out with. Nice to have something close but it's worth saving a little money to drive to Springfield to get a better end result.

Addition... 72 hours later a whole nail came off....tip and acrylic all..... They fixed it but they look horrible.
