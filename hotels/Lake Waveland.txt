Text: The wife and I can't get enough of this place. Primitive campgrounds are great and almost never crowded. The staff are great and always helpful. Yes the shower water smells like eggs but who cares. It's great, it's not crowded, and we go there atleast once if not twice a year.

Text: Used to go there years ago to camp and fish.  Been twice this year. Fishing is good. But nothing is up and running. Big slide is broken tennis courts have no nets. Nothing for the kids to do but swim and fish. Plenty of camping spots and very clean

Text: Very helpful staff.  Employee Chris Jones was especially helpful.  He helped us get our Camp set up and even helped lubricant one of our bikes. An employee with a great attitude and approach.

Text: I've always had a great experience at waveland.. I personally like it because it is not a cookie cutter campground.. Not all sites are the same and I have picked a different one based on my needs at the time.. Just got done camping with my 3 boys today.. Our spot was quite, not in direct sunlight, and amazingly mosquito free.. Yes you do have to have certified wood to burn there and that is to protect the native trees from invasive species.. I usually choose to go when it's not to busy because it is so popular of a place and peek times it is harder ringing a good spot and the staff is stressed.. Wave land can be anything you want it to be.. I rarely feel the need to leave the grounds while I am there.. I've been going for 23+/- years..
