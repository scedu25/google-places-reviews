Econo Lodge Downtown
Rating: 3
Text: Nice enough place, bed was comfortable. LOTS of construction going on all around the hotel, but you couldn't really hear it in the room. Only a couple of negatives. Only enough coffee for one cup in the room, people coming up to you and asking for money in the parking lot, and the cable was out our entire stay. I'd stay here again if in the area. Decent place for what you pay.

Text: The actual hotel is very nice considering the price and location, but the daytime front desk clerk had some real attitude issues - she tried to ban my boyfriend from the hotel after we accidentally locked ourselves outside of our room. I had my credit card and ID in my pants pocket, but no shoes and i was clearly not fully dressed. He went down to get a new key card, and while i wasn't there for the interaction, after speaking to her she made it clear that his (not aggressive - he didn't yell at her or anything) demeanor rubbed her the wrong way.

Text: I enjoyed my stay here. The front office smells like cigarette smoke but the dining area and my room did not smell like smoke. I was impressed with the breakfast options and the rooms seemed well kept.

Text: Decent room for price (booked in advance online) Reasonably quiet for being downtown. A little out dated, but clean with a comfy bed. Staff was great on all shifts. Average grab and go continental breakfast. Only complaint is the $5/ day parking fee- really tight parking

Text: This is a nice hotel for the price. Could do with an upgrade as the carpet has marks as does the bathroom, but then I'm sure the price would go up. Good sized rooms, cable TV etc. Breakfast is primarily sugar as in most hotels in the USA.
