Text: Clean rooms, clean linens. Condition of outside and inside the rooms and building,  show good investments of owner/ management in great care and pride. Good price, & nice place to rest.  Daily fresh food at the store adjoining property  made the stay even better. Recommend to stay to anyone, as I will return myself for comfortable night away.

Text: Decent rooms, kept clean. Not much in amenities, WiFi and morning coffee. Not much in the surrounding area. Great for an overnight stay while traveling through, but probably not for an extended period.

Text: Do not be turned off by the name. This hotel was awesome! This small hotel has a wonderful and friendly staff. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Was here for a business trip and my company had a few rooms. Everyone enjoyed our week long stay here. The price was really reasonable, too. There is a convenience store beside it and they have an on-site laundry facility. There is also two more stores and 3 restaurants (all) open late within a quarter mile. I like that they also have shelters with grills that anyone can use. Long story short is that this may not be a Hilton. However, this place with the great customer service, and comfortable and clean rooms will win you.
