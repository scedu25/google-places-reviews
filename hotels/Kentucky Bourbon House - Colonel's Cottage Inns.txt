Text: We stayed at the Bourbon Cottage (the cute little blue one on Flaget Street.)  The location was ideal for a quick jaunt to the center of Bardstown. Near a delicious bakery and several great restaurants. The house itself was quaint, clean, and comfortable. We were well taken care of and certainly felt the Old Southern Hospitality of the owners and historic charm of the home itself!
