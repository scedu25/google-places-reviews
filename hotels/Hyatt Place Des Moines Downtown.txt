Hyatt Place Des Moines/Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: Great hotel right downtown. Walking distance to events center and arena. Literally 5-6 miles from the airport. Pillows were soft and I had a cool soda in my room. No parking, have to use valet service, which I don't mind sometimes. Will probably stay here again next time I am in town.

Text: Staff are abrasive and short. Management isn't much better. Drinka were decent. Good tasted like it was frozen and heated up.

Text: Room was ok however the couch in the room was in pretty bad shape. Breakfast was fine however it seemed as though it had been cooked awhile before eventhough breakfast had only just started. Coffee ran out often which was difficult as well since many people are there for business and therefore cannot wait around.

Text: The rooms were nice but the lobby has a Hampton Inn feel that does not really fit with the rest.
