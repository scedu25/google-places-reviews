Text: Cute Inn with a lot of personality. I was driving through the area and needed a place to stay that was pet friendly and served breakfast... And didn't cost an arm and a leg. Brook Pointe Inn fit the bill. I was worried it would be a dump and was so pleased when we drove up and saw the place! It is beautiful, rooms were more than comfortable and the grounds were great for walking my dog.

Text: Nice place to stay.  Friendly staff and reasonable prices.  The floor in my room had some stains and so did one of the pillow cases.  That was a little unsettling, but I was by myself and had a double bed room, so I took a pillow from the other bed, turned the cases inside out and used them that way. 
It would have been nice if they provided "Togo" coffee cups to take your coffee with you.
Overall, a nice, quaint place to stay with a country feel.

Text: I originally gave a good response about our stay because I was assured that our issues would be handled.  They offered us a coupon for our "next" visit that is available to everyone.
