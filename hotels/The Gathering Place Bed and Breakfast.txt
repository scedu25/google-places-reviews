Text: The Gathering Place is my favorite place to stay when in Columbia. The staff is amazing and the rooms are beautiful. Best of all, it's super close to Mizzou's campus and downtown Columbia so walking isn't that bad.

Text: Was very quiet, very nice. Loses one star because their communications/connectivity services for guests was very lackluster (DirecTV), and it didn't help there was an electrical storm. The breakfast offerings are absolutely incredible though. I would be a return customer just for the food, to be dead honest with you.

I was new to the States on a new job at the Uni Hospital and wanted a place to spend a few days before I got on my feet. Thank goodness I found this place. The booking online was so easy despite my crappy Indian internet connection and a crappy credit card. This place has a lot of history with the university and the state of Missouri itself so I learned a lot frim the books they had at the BnB. The rooms are all themed and I stayed at the Missouri history room. You're served by uni students who work at the BnB and it is at par with any 5 star hotel in Europe, I can tell you that. The Chef Debbie has been kissed on her fingers by the god of cooking (who ever that is!), oh sweet heavens, I can't imagine how great the breakfasts were. And each day they have a different menu of some of the most amazing gastronomic combinations I have ever tried. They are also accommodative of your special requests (I had to box the breakfast up for a couple of days due to my schedule). I met some great people at the breakfast too and in fact made good friends with some of them. 
The wifi is great, a 50in flat screen telly with all basic channels + an amazing back yard and a calm and cozy patio. The BnB is perfectly located in between the two main commercial roads here in Columbia, so I didn't find it hard getting around even though I didn't have a car. In fact discovering bthe place by walking around is the perfect thing to do when you are here. 
The rates may look a bit on the pricey side but you are guaranteed to get more than what you pay for and that will , for sure melt your worries.... I will definitely bring my friends here when they come to visit me from abroad.
