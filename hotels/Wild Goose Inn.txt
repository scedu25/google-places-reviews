Wild Goose Inn

Text: Fantastic room in the Winter Eden suite. Loved the jacuzzi. Lots of ambience and attention to detail. Lack of check in procedure seemed odd to me - we just came and went with no confirmation of identity. This didn't detract from the experience but I had some security concern. We loved staying here though and would do so again.

Text: Beautifully themed rooms all with unique fireplaces and jacuzzis. This place is perfect for couples looking for a weekend away. It's located just off of MSU's campus and Grand River Ave (maybe a 2 minute walk). The breakfast is amazing and the owner, Al, makes sure all of his guests are treated as family. World class service, bar none!

Text: 11 of us gathered this weekend at the Inn. Loved it. Great food, accommodations and Al, Paul and staff were like family when we left.  We will return.
