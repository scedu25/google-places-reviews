Tranquil Touch Spa

Text: My husband treated me to this massage today. The staff was very friendly when I went in. I filled out the first time paperwork that was simple and easy. I was then taken back to my room where the therapist asked me questions to get my sense of what needed to be done and what I liked. The massage process was very relaxing and I felt as though I had more patience and energy throughout the day. It was a great first massage experience and I would recommend to friends and will probably return again.

Text: That its absolutely amazing. Tranquil spa really takes the time to make sure their clients expectations are exceeded. It's a very professional atmosphere. Everyone that works there wants to be there and you can tell by all the work they do. My image of a dream Spa is exactly everything Tranquil Spa is. I love all the possible spa treatments!

Text: They shorted us almost 20  minutes off an hour couples massage. Cashier claimed it was due to our first time paperwork... But they didn't even use the paperwork for anything. We got a couples massage and told them our hands needed attention. Neither of us had any work on our hands. $150, few words, cashier couldn't wait for us to leave and had no words for us aside from blaming our paperwork as first timers at their place. I've gotten many massages in the past and never have I seen anything like this. We will not be going back and we will be sharing our poor experience with others. They would have had at least one couples massage from us a month. Instead they chose to screw us on our first visit. I suggest thinking long term and not alienating new customers, especially when you don't offer anything different from any other massage place. That was my wives first massage by the way, thanks for setting the bar extremely low. Baffling.

Atmosphere was nice enough, beds were heated. I've had much more comfortable beds but these still were okay. If you do go just make sure you check the time they start and finish and don't end up like us.

Text: As always VERY relaxing.  Today my regular massage therapist was ill, so they made it very easy for me to either reschedule with her on a different day, or see someone today who was willing to see me.  Regardless if it's my regular therapist or someone different, I always feel great when I leave and the attention to detail is always there!!  Thanks

Text: My husband and I have been going to Tranquil Touch since the beginning.  We have had a variety of services throughout the years, and have always been pleased with everything.  There have been many changes with the business over the years, which have all been positive.  The therapists and staff are all top notch. We wouldn't go anywhere else for these services. I always request Tranquil Touch gift cards for birthdays & Christmas!!
