Swan Song Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Relaxing, quiet, elegant, hospitable, accommodating....and so much more. Of all the places we have stayed over the past few years, this was by far the best. The innkeepers, Doug and Cheri, have thought of everything a weary traveler would want. They welcomed us into their lovely home with the expressed desire to meet our every want & at the same time gave us privacy. The spacious suites are a "home in a home" and well worth the price. The lake view setting of this very tasteful bed and breakfast is picturesque and calming. The breakfast was "over-the-top". We enjoyed every thoughtful detail...from the sparkle of the take home swan accent pin to the bling of the room key chains. Well done! As soon as the word gets out, I am sure the Swan Song Inn will be the chosen venue for many special occasions.
