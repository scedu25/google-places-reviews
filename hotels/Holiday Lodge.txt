Text: The guy is unfriendly. The beds were awful! We left a pistol and called to tell him we were coming back to get it. He calls the cops and tells them HE found a gun in the room. They now have our gun after we drove 1 1/2 hrs to pick it up. So yeah, he's also a liar!

Text: Room 33 had bed bugs. I don't think the sheets are changed and cleaned daily like they are supposed to be. But got move next door to 35 and that room was fine. A little over priced though.
