Text: What a great place! All around satisfied with our stay. Super clean, friendly and convenient to the Arc and Museum. Great breakfast too.  The atmosphere is also perfect for a family stay.

Text: Took a break from law enforcement for the weekend and took the family on a drive roughly 9 hours to see the Ark Encounter and the Creation Museum.  Everything was as described.  From the hotel, it's about 20-25 minutes to each one. Great staff !! Very courteous and provided everything we needed,  very good breakfasts every morning and very clean rooms.  If we ever have a chance to go back to the Ark Encounter, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.

Text: Very nice hotel, friendly staff, nice pool, tasty breakfast. The main part of a hotel is the bed, right? That's the point of staying in a hotel. The bed might as well have been plywood covered in sheets. Worst hotel bed I have ever slept on!

Text: Mostly nice looking facility.  Lousy customer service.  Sassy front desk help.  Bed bugs.  Yes! So sassy the clerk offered to go kill the mosquito for him after he showed her 3 separate bites.  Changed her tune when  she went to the room & found 1... but what do you at 1:30am?! Pool issues too. Check in issues.  Refused some of our group tombs they reserved & gave smaller rooms.  They overbooked & we booked months in advance.  LOUSY SERVICE!!

Text: Had reservations for 4 nights and had to early.  Pool was shut down by the health deptment. Front desk help was unprofessional and always sitting out front on smoke breaks. Staff and their family were swimming in the pool.  Rooms were filthy, pool was cloudy and not once  the 3 days we were there were our floors  vacuumed and sheets never changed.  If you wanted to eat breakfast you had to compete with the staff who was eating it.  Rat traps visible around the hotel. This place is a slum.
