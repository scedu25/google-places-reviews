Text: The room was very clean....bed was comfortable and it was very quiet n the room!!! The only reason I would not recommend it or come back would be because I was charged an extra $30 after I came home :-(

Text: Small, secluded, clean and quiet. If that's what you look for on a business or travelling trip then the Courtyard in South Bend is the place. The staff was courteous and made sure I didn't need any additional accomodations for my business stay. There is a cafe in the lobby that serves small breakfasts and coffee in the morning. The room was extremely clean and above what you'd expect from a comparable hotel.

Text: The courtyard hotel is a very accommodating and hospitable place to stay. The rooms are all very clean add quiet, and staying here felt safe and was close to popular attractions and shopping marketplaces. The only complaint, if anything, is the location is near heavy traffic versus what I'm used to.
