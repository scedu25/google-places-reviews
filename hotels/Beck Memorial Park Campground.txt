Beck Memorial Park Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Nice municipal campground on the Missouri River. Clean bathrooms, tho the older bathroom building has no hot water. Use the newer (cinder block) building in campground addition (above boat launch area).
Registration to camp is down by the launch and fish cleaning station. It looks like a ordinary bulletin board station (painted white) with info one ignores. We drove by it twice without realizing it. Cared for grounds.
