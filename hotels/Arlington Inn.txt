Arlington Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Well kept older hotel. Very clean, very comfortable. No frills or extra amenities, but if you are looking for a good place to stay on a budget I highly recommend staying here. The next time I go charter fishing I will stay here again. I would give another star if they had a decent breakfast, the free "breakfast" was pre packaged muffins and danishes, not much at to choose from. But this right on the bay and you can fish off the dock!

Text: Cons; It's a little dated, small, and could use some small repairs. Pros; location, view, price, clean linens, the staff was super friendly, the knotty pine wood is reminiscent of a cabin, there's a bar out back with propane campfire tabletops. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Text: Rooms are very noisy, bed was very uncomfortable... no temp control, outdated.... stains everywhere.

(Our friends room was worse and they were moved to a acceptable room)

Can't believe the ratings this hotel is getting. Should be 2 stars tops... will never go back.

Text: Small and reasonably priced with the option of a view of the docks.  Real close to the ferries and good fishing.
