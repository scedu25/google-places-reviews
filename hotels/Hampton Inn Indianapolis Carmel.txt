Hampton Inn Indianapolis/Carmel

Text: If you're a fan of good sleep, good breakfast and good coffee, this is your place.  They have two flavors of coffee, oh and decaf if you're into that sort of thing. But seriously, their "robust" will make your day. Very nice place indeed.

Text: Nice rooms, easy check in/out. Nice and quiet with comfortable beds, not much more you could ask of a hotel. Would definitely stay here again if I'm traveling through again.
