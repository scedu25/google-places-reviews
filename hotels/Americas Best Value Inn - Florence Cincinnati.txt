Text: My brother and sister stopped by to see me and my kids and were kicked out. First they told my sister too many people were here and she explained that she was visiting. We went and grabbed lunch and when we were coming back the guy stopped me and told me they couldn't be here. I asked if I wasn't allowed to have visitors and he said no. He gave them 30 mins to vacate the premises, we couldn't even enjoy our lunch. He was very rude to me as he told me if I wanted a visit I had to leave, this wasn't a hang out spot. I am very upset that I paid almost $150 for a night in a half and I am in a prison. I believe this was a waste of money and I will make sure it will never get any business from me or my family ever again! Truthfully, I feel I deserve a refund!! I have never been treated so rudely by hotel staff.

Text: Coming to the location it's in good place with no traffic sound but the room was not so furnished ..its look like a 10yrs old room. They didn't put new beds or floor was also not cleaned.

Text: Front desk area smelled musty and the front desk woman was not very nice. Dirty inside and out including Windows. The first room also smelled very musty. Second room didn't smell as bad but I killed a spider as soon as I walked in the room, bathroom ceiling had lots of mold. Cigarette burns on blanket, carpet and sofa. Weird red spots on pillow case and stains on the blanket. Couldn't stay.  Front desk said no refund. We headed across the street to the Best Western and ran into a police officer in between both hotels that said there was a stake out at ABC and someone OD'ed there the night before. We still have not gotten our money back yet,  but will continue to fight.  Don't put yourself at risk, stay somewhere else.

Text: Our non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke. Free breakfast and coffee were decent. The place served its purpose for one night.

Text: Rented a double room. One was decent the other was not so much.  TV remote wouldn't work for the tv, toilet wouldn't flush properly so we were given towels "incase it over flows", phone cord was cut, and the worker was very rude.  Oh and the bathroom had super long hairs everywhere it was not very pleasant.
