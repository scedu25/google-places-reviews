Rating: 5
Text: The owners are very nice, caring and kind. They helped me and I helped them. They don't like smoking in the rooms and that's understandable. They keep there yard rooms and everything else in between very neat and tidy it was the best motel I've ever stayed at 100% satisfied with my stay here.

Text: Didn't give the best impression when I arrived, there was some argument going on at the desk and fine people were smoking pot outside their room, but the room itself was five for a nights stay
