Text: This is a wonderful family destination, with miles of horse trails and great company! Jill and Rick are wonderful hosts and keep the place clean and inviting.. there are rooms to rent or the cabin with a loft...a peaceful, quiet place with stalls for your horse, hook ups, canoe launch areas, .... campfires by night and riding by day! I liked it so much, I decided to board my horse nearby.  Hope to see you on the trails of Wayne Natl. Forrest and Lake Vesuvius.

Text: The owners, Rick and Jill, do their best to make each and every guest feel at home!  Our visits there have always been very enjoyable.  The trails are first rate!  We have been there in both the spring and the fall, and each time has been breath taking!
