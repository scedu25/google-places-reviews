Text: I stayed in the Fierke suite with my wife to celebrate our 13 year wedding anniversary and we loved it! It was the perfect place to spend a quiet and romantic evening alone. The host was very nice and made us a great breakfast the following morning! We loved it and we will definitely be back in the future.
