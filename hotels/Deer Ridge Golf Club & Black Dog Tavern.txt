Text: Good service at 3:00 pm on a Saturday. The black dog burger was quite possibly the best burger I've ever had if you like a spicy burger. The philly was very good. Quiet and relaxing view from the patio.

Text: We play a lot of different courses in Central Ohio. This is one of Our Favorites. Clubhouse is a LOG CABIN. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. THE COURSE IS ALWAYS IN THE BEST SHAPE. WE PLAYED TODAY APRIL 18. The course was just unreal. The Clubhouse personnel are top notch. Take 71 North get off Bellview exit course sits behind The Der Dutchman. Make it a day to remember.

Text: This golf course is a challenge but I love it!! Be prepared to lose a golf ball or two.  My husband and I golf here as much as possible.  The food at the Black Dog Tavern is very good.
