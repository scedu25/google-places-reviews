Text: I spent two nights at the Fairfield Inn in Peru while attending an event for work. Everything was great. The room was clean, staff was upbeat and professional, even the continental breakfast was pretty good. They get two thumbs up from me!

Text: Good service. Had chili for football games on Monday nights. Jalepenos next door is perfect to get drunk and walk right back to your room.
