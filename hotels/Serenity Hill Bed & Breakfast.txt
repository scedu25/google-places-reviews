Serenity Hill Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here 29 Sept 2017 and probably can't find words to do it justice.  We've stayed at several B&Bs and the nature of them all is that they're unique.  This one is unique is outstanding ways.  Upon arrival we were immediately invited to park our motorcycles in the garage which was appreciated as it avoids the dew on the seat problem in the morning.  We were asked to remove our shoes upon entering the house which took as aback a little bit but we quickly understood why.  This  place is immaculate, impeccable, everything is perfect.  The hosts left for the evening and invited us to make ourselves at home, which we did, discovering the fire pit up the walkway, with stacked wood, fire starter and lighter.  We started the fire, sat around and enjoyed some wine.  It was obvious that it was there staged for the guests and we used it..  The location is up on a hill with fantastic views.  Richard and Stephanie are friendly and interesting and we were able to get more acquainted at breakfast the next morning, which was excellent.  This place is a few miles off I65 but it is certainly worth the experience.  If you're going to Mammoth Cave this B&B is actually closer to the entrance than anything in Cave City or Park City so it's the best of all worlds.

Text: Our first visit to a bed and breakfast and it was absolutely amazing. Private bathroom, clean comfortable bedroom, and breakfast was a special treat each morning. Richard and  Stephenie have perfected the art of being a great host and hostess. They both were very kind, warm, and helpful during our 3 day trip to the Mammoth caves. Great location to the National Park!! If back in the area we will return to Serenity Hill Bed and Breakfast!!!!

Text: Rick and Stephanie were very nice. Stephanie made the breakfast and Rick took good care of us while we ate. They weren't overbearing, and Rick was very pleasant to chat with. Oreo was great too. He's a bit old but he was very loving. I felt as if we were spending the night at a friends house. We rented the Serenity Suite, it was very spacious, everything worked and was very private. The view out the bedroom window was beautiful as it looked down the hill and across the street to another great view. We will definitely be coming back, and possibly bringing another couple to share the wonderful experience with.
