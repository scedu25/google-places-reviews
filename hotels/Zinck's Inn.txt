Zinck's Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We had a nice stay at the Carriage House #9.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The Jacuzzi tub was wonderful after a cold day walking down Main Street.  The front desk staff were super friendly. The continental breakfast was great.  I would definitely recommend this place.  The price is very affordable.

Text: We stayed at the Carriage House #7.  Had some issues such as bulbs were out in the night stand lamp bulbs out in bathroom also no extra toilet paper, the bed and pillows were terrible very hard and uncomfortable.  Lots of noise from room above.  Sleepless night.  Room was super expensive this was not a suite that I Would expect. 
 Would not stay there again.  Have stayed at zinck's Inn prior with a better experience.  What no comments from owners only when given a good review.  Disappointing.

Text: Thoroughly enjoyed our July 4 weekend stay at Zinck's!   Vacationing with 4 children under 11 is no small task, Zinck's quiet and welcoming family atmosphere allowed us to relax and enjoy Holmes County at its best.  Our room was clean and perfect, the staff and housekeeping were great. Plus, who doesn't love a well prepared continental breakfast and even bedtime snacks! We plan to make this a yearly family outing and Zinck's will be our go-to for lodging.

Text: Rooms were newly renovated but hallway and walls were in need of renewal, also. Nice to have snacks in the evening but breakfast was limited and disappointing. Lastly, the staff was excellent in their helpfulness. (It would be nice to have the military discount like most motels offer)

Text: We have had a very nice stay, friendly staff, clean, pretty rooms, very comfortable mattresses.  Everything is nice and clean and we'll taken care of.  Snacks in the evening and rockers to sit in and enjoy the beautiful countryside.  Very nice breakfast.  They do not cut corners, we will return!
