Viking Motel Detroit

Text: The best of my experience was the price. And because i got such a good deal i should have expected the poor quality of everything in the room and the customer service. The bed had dry gum, the fridge didnt work, and most of the outlets didnt work.

Text: Stayed here for proximity to the Masonic Temple Theater. I regret it.

It was a frightening experience. Stay away. It's a scary, gross motel in a bad part of town. Stay somewhere safe and clean.
