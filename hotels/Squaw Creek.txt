Text: This is a great park to visit for a short drive on a lunch break or to camp. We have stayed at the campground several times and it is wonderful for a weekend or for a week. The park has two lodges for parties and weddings. Both are very nice and have beautiful surroundings for your special day. A great spot for engagement or wedding photos.

Text: Looks like a beautiful place to stay. Only set up for RV parking,  not tent camping like the website says. You can tent in the RV spot, but you still pay for the electric and dump station even thou you don't use it. 20-25$. The camp host was very nice and suggested a near by place with the tent site I was looking for.

Text: Nice big park with lots of neat features like equestrian trails, camping, and one of the best (if not the very best) playground areas to be found in Linn County! It's the one in the campground by the shower building. Seriously check it out!

Text: Beautiful park. Campground is very clean and well maintained. Mountain bike trails are the reason we came here in the first place and they did not disappoint!
