Text: I loved my stay there, I wanted to have a relaxing day . I got just that and then some. The hotel was clean and comfortable... The jacuzzi tub was amazing. The service well above average. I have decided to treat myself to a room once every two weeks.

Text: We recently stayed 5 nights at the Port Columbus Best Western and it was beyond our expectations. The staff were polite, cheerful and professional. Despite being close to an airport no airplanes could be heard. The king size bed was very comfortable and breakfast was very good  I would certainly come back.

Text: My hotel experience was fabulous!  To begin with the hotel lobby and rooms were immaculate, updated, and even smelled wonderful.  ALL of the staff were gracious and friendly, and it was truly genuine service from employees who clearly enjoyed their jobs - even housekeeping greeted us with smiles. There was a nice, hot complementary breakfast with a waffle machine that was fun and delicious, and again everything was so clean.  Highly recommend!!

Text: King room with Hot Tub was wonderful! It took almost 45 minutes to fill the tub but it was worth the wait. There is a large Speedway on the other side of the parking lot which was very convenient for gassing up in the morning and for getting something to eat in the evenings.
