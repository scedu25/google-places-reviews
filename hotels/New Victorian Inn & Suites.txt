New Victorian Inn & Suites
Rating: 4
Text: Located right off of I--80 without a lot of traffic noise. Front desk was very helpful with a special request. Everything was clean and working. It was an excellent value for the price. Nothing fancy or special, just a fine place to stay the night on your way through. Pool looked clean and well-maintained (we didn't use it). Hot breakfast included waffles and biscuits and gravy, plenty of your standard continental fare as well. I would stay there again.

Text: My husband is currently in Nebraska for work so my 2 boys and i came to visit. Stayed here for a little over 2 weeks and we loved everything about it. Everybody that works there is so friendly, our room was clean, bed was comfortable, duvet comforter was amazing...it didn't make you hot at night, the pillows are just right, and the breakfast was great...they have a wide selection. We had our dog with us on the trip and everybody was so sweet to him the whole time. The indoor pool was nice and good size. My 2 boys loved swimming in it everyday. Also, There is coffee and cookies available at the front desk 24 hours a day (my boys took advantage of that, for sure)! There is a laundry area, as well. I can not say enough good things about this place! Everything was outstanding. Excellent customer service!

Text: Inexpensive place to rest your head. Appears that a lot of contractors stay here during the week. There were a lot of choices for breakfast and they were all were very good. I would definitely stat here again when traveling.

Text: Beautiful place, recently remodeled, wonderful hospitality. Breakfast is included, small and medium dogs accepted for $15.00 deposit.  After a long day of cross-country travel, this place was a jewel!
