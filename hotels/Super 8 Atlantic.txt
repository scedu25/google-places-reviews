Text: I work on the road a lot and stay at a lot of hotels, but this one is different. This one feels like home. Clean, comfortable, inviting. Biscuits and gravy (my favorite) every morning plus more. The staff is great, seems like a family owned business maybe. The manager, Sam I believe, is the most accommodating and down to earth person I've met in awhile. If you're looking for a cozy lil place to stay, this is the place for you
