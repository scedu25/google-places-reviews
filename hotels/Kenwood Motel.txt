Kenwood Motel
Rating: 4
Text: 1950s motel, clean, comfortable, quiet & reasonable rates. Most guests are construction in the area, they' re quiet, in bed early & up & gone earlier. The staff is very friendly & helpful. Room has microwave, mini fridge, flat screen tv, ac & oval (not round) toilet. Outlaws are few so be prepared. Shower stall is small, needs larger towels. Beds are at a normal height not like big hotels where you need a step to get into bed.  Will stay again when in the area. Check out the Gene Autry mural downtown.

Text: Although Kenwood is outdated, the room is furnished well (small fridge, microwave, 2 dressers, and a flat screen TV). The bedding was clean and the owner was very friendly. Make sure you have your own shampoo and soap though.  (Pardon my photos - it was checkout time).

Text: Horrible....I believe the bed sheets were not washed.  I can see hair, stains etc. on the bed.  Hopefully no bed bugs.  Bathroom had insects around.  They did not clean our room and gave us new towels the second day.  You must have been homeless to rate this 5 star.

Text: I want to thank the owners by giving this a five star rating because it's a nice cozy little motel with very friendly owners who operate their establishment. Newly refurbished rooms with new mattresses, flat screen televisions, air conditioner and refrigerators. A nice, quiet location with trees for shade and grills to cook on that is close to grocery stores etc. My crew and I are very pleased with the accommodations here as the rooms were well worth the money we spent. I plan on doing business with this man if ever in the area again and I recommend this motel to anyone.
