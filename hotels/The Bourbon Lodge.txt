The Bourbon Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Enjoyed a great day together out on the lakes with my friend.  Scenery is wonderful!  Quiet and relaxing! Had a tasty lunch prepared for us before shooting at the range, and REALLY had a lot of fun doing that!!  It is a little bit of a rough drive, would recommend 4x4. Otherwise, I could have stayed forever!

Text: Bourbon was beautiful? yet rustic. If you're? into outdoor adventures and prefer to end a long day with a deliciously-prepared meals and accommodations that rival any 4/5 star hotel...you need to book a night.   It was introduced to me as "Pottery Barn meets Bass Pro".  Spot on.
