Holiday Inn Express & Suites Nevada
Rating: 5
Text: You truly could not ask for a better hotel. We had a terrible experience with another hotel and were forced to leave at 4:00am, with three kids. The attendant at Holiday Inn Express was more than happy to assist us so early, and immediately booked us a very clean, comfortable, space-efficient room. Due to arriving so early, we were all exhausted, and they went as far letting us check-out late. The kids enjoyed the breakfast and we left feeling refreshed, with a positive attitude. The beds/blankets & pillows were phenomenal. The water pressure of the shower was perfect (I've seen complaints about the water quality, and just to clarify, that is just how the water is in that area. Every place we visited, the water tasted odd). We even loved the updated "scan" key-card option. We are very thankful for this hotel, in such a time of distress. They went above and beyond to relieve our stress that was not even caused from them.

Text: I stayed at this hotel several times at this point... the rooms are always clean, the hotel staff is always friendly, breakfast is mediocre at best, but I've come to expect that from most hotels :). Overall it's good accommodations for its value. Would recommend but not extraordinary by any means.

Text: Great location, being just off the interstate, with an ultra friendly staff, a delicious (free!) hot breakfast (with gluten-free & diabetic friendly options available!), dazzlingly clean (salt water) pool and cozy, well maintained rooms.
