Holiday Inn Express & Suites Wabash
Rating: 4
Text: Solid hotel. My room was clean, and the front desk agent was friendly. It was the typical holiday inn breakfast, but it was hot and tasty, so no complaints there. It's a bit hard to find your way into their parking lot, especially at night, especially in the fog- you just keep going through a grocery store parking lot until the hotel pops out behind it. Google maps handled it well, so if you're using a GPS you should be fine.

Text: The people are friendly, although not always particularly efficient. Breakfast could be refreshed a little more often. I stay here for a better working space than I typically got at Charley Creek. Internet can be somewhat slow.

Text: What a wonderful place! I had to stay overnight for work, and will absolutely be back! From the minute you walk in you are greeted warmly and friendly. Every staff member I encountered had the same cheery and welcoming attitude, I felt like I was staying with a family. 
 I'm not sure if the hotel has recently been remodeled but everything is so nice, clean, and well kept (and I'm super picky when it comes to cleanliness!). The rooms are large, towels are really soft, and every detail of the hotel is so tidy and clean. 
I loved that there is a fridge, microwave, and Keurig in the room. 
The breakfast was delicious as well, a great variety of options.
It exceeded my expectations. I will be a return guest!

Text: Good amenities. Customer service was hit-or-miss. Odd location made it difficult to get into and out of the parking lot.
