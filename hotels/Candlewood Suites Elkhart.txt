Text: Nice little place. Not crazy about the pets being allowed though. Room seems pretty clean and comes with fridge, oven and microwave. Staff is pleasant.

Text: Candlewood Suites in Elkhart. My son and I stayed in an (open floor plan) room with 2 double beds and a full kitchen. The room was extremely clean. Linens seemed fresh, the provided dishes had no spots, and the room seemed to come with everything you'd need short of food and clothes. The beds and pillows are exceptionally comfortable. I didn't even miss sleeping at home. Staff was friendly although we didn't see many people (kinda nice really). There are other amenities provided we didn't have time to use like an exercise room, pool, etc. Even so we both very much enjoyed our stay. There was some slight damage to parts of our room (the toilet handle was badly cracked and our room being on the third floor meant we had to deal with birds living on the roof. The TV was unimpressive but these are all minor issues when looking at the experience as a whole.

Text: One of the best hotels to stay at here in Elkhart. Full size refrigerator, cook top, cabinets, dishwasher. Close to many restaurants. Friendly staff! Wish the t.v. had more channels.

Text: Great place to stay!! I travel with a golden doodle and they let you stay here with a small charge unlike the other places that charge $100 or only take small dogs. I felt safe. Would stay here again!!!

Text: This place is just average. I will say more effort and time should be spent on customer service training. A simple smile and maybe a greeting would go a long way!
