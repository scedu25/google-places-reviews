Text: My daughter absolutely loved it! She hasn't stopped singing camp songs! I mean really, how many camp songs can one camp teach in 6 days!? I guess I am finding out! 
I do have two criticisms. At the open house it really wasn't worth more than just somewhat seeing the grounds. It would have been nice to have a sit down information session with Q&A. Have buildings actually open to see inside or at least have lights on inside the building if you just want us to look inside of a window. On a hot day, maybe sell water? 

The next criticism is snobby of me I am sure. I find it odd that in the packing list, girls have to wear a one piece bathing suit and are not allowed to wear spaghetti strapped tank tops due to being considered "too revealing"? Isnt that odd for a girl scout camp? Especially when we as GS are trying to let girls be girls and to express themselves. To embrace being girls. I mean, at least mask it in the book as maybe being more for sun/bug protection? Plus, if we are so concerned with appearance, why then have sooo many councilors with a bunches of piercings all over the place, all sorts of tattoos and different colors of dyed hair? I mean, way to go for self expression and all, but really then... spaghetti straps are a problem?

Text: My daughter will be a camp counselor there this summer.  I didn't go to all of the different camp sites, but the lodge is very nice.  The pool was still being cleaned, as it was still about 6 weeks before they would be open.
