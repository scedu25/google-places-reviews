The Seelbach Hilton Louisville
Rating: 5
Text: Arrived at the Seelbach with my wife Friday afternoon and was greeted by one of the valets named Corey. He welcomed us to the hotel and made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. He let us know about some restaurants and other attractions in the area which all turned out to be really awesome experiences during our stay in Louisville and was very helpful through out our entire stay at the hotel. The young man at the front desk was very friendly and helpful as well. The hotel itself is very historic and beautifully designed. We were 100% satisfied with our stay at the Seelbach and will definitely be returning in the near future. Bravo!!!

Text: Hotel was great, service was good, but the front desk was not super helpful. The French toast that is part of the breakfast buffet was phenomenal. It is made with a homemade cinnamon roll.

Text: Very small room that was slightly shabby. Worn and stained carpet and a tiny, worn bathroom with cracked sink. No ventilation in the bathroom. Noise from the street was awful until a bit past 11pm. You can feel the bass coming from 4th street much of the evening. Cranky breakfast attendant on the exec floor that doesn't think shorts and a t-shirt is appropriate for grabbing a drink. Not a luxury experience. Layer of dust around furniture feet and under dresser. I can overlook the shabby room, but will be going back to the Brown in the future because of the noise.

Text: I absolutely love this hotel. The staff is always friendly and the rooms are beautiful. There's so much history as well and it's so fun to learn about it all from the employees there. Larry in the El and Mike at the desk are especially friendly, professional and great at their job :)
