Prairie Oasis Campground & Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: We called about an hour ahead and got the answering machine.  The owner, Patty, returned our call within a half hour.  They had primitive tent areas, as well as large and small camper sites. When we arrived,  they were very friendly and helpful.  The gentleman showed us to our site and began picking up sticks that had fallen on the ground where we were planning to pitch our tent.  He then brought us firewood at no extra cost.  As mentioned in another review,  they had an extra towel for us to borrow and the bathrooms were spacious, comfortable,  and VERY clean. If travelling through and camping again,  we would definitely return.

Text: We camped here in 2015 on the way to Yellowstone.  Great off the highway stop.  It is indeed an oasis.  FU, which is a plus.  Easy in / easy out.  Nice little pond.  Would use again on the journey west.

Text: We got there late and they were so nice and took care of us. The campground was clean and had nice spots to pull through with our camper. My kids enjoyed the cookies they made! Great service.

Text: Todd and Patty are 2 of the nicest people. Pull in and got homemade cookies when we checked in. Level spots and very convenient. Close to highway, but far enough away to not hear it. Would stay here anytime.
