Motel 6 Indianapolis Anderson

Text: No room service for 2 days.  Had to ask for towels each day.  Got no appologies but did get yellowed and off white towels.  When I went to front desk to complain, I had to wait for a phone conversation of the same complaint.  Was asked if I had do not disturb sign on the door... right.  Pet friendly? Yes.   Dog across hall barked all day and night.  Beats sleeping in the car, but not by much.

Text: I had a 2 day stay at your Motel.  The staff was courteous, friendly and eager to meet my needs. I had issues with my air conditioning unit not working properly and spoke directly to the manager who immediately put forth an effort to fix my issue and did by making sure I was comfortable in another room. Housekeeping could be seen working daily and you could smell the cleanliness. I will definitely stay in your establishment again and want to make sure your staff is praised for doing a good job.

Text: Hello, I thought the stay was very, very good except for one thing. The toilet would not flush properly and I had to borrow a plunger from a second-floor maid and repeatedly push to get it free-flowing for the first time during my stay.  Other than that, the room, bed, bathroom, everything about that Motel 6 was much nicer than a typical Motel 6, I slept restfully for a full seven hours and I was amazed it cost me just $55.

Text: Carpets on stairs were worn, hairs left in tub/shower from lack of cleaning. Employees did not even clean our room after the first night, so I had to go down and ask for toilet paper and towels. Only plus was front desk help was extremely friendly and professional.

Text: The dirtiest motel I have ever stayed in.  Upon check in there was thick jelly on my desk.  The bathroom was filthy with crawling bugs.  The maids never cleaned my room, changed towels, or made my bed.  When I inquired with the management they put me off.  I was told after my stay I would receive some compensation.  I called 5 different times and was given the run around.  Finally I was offered a discount on my next stay.  ARE YOU KIDDING??  I WOULD SLEEP IN MY CAR BEFORE STAYING IN THIS FILTHY MOTEL.  ****** AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!  *******
THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER STAYED IN OR COULD IMAGINE!
