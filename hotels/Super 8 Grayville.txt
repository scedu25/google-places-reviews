Super 8 Grayville

Text: I had a great experience here. Staff was polite, professional and responsive. The place was immaculate. Breakfast what what you'd expect a continental breakfast to be. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Got a room with a hot tub. Looked like someone spilled soda in it. Kind of annoying to here pipes draining and people stomping in the hallways. But, people were nice, price was great, everything else was clean. And the coffee was good. The Mexican joint that shares the parking lot is good too.

Text: Clean, well maintained.  Loved the floors-no carpet! That was the best part cause it didn't feel gross and I didn't need to keep my socks on.  Bathroom was large and didn't feel cramped.  Would recommend to anyone.

Text: Stayed overnight on way from Arkansas to Ohio. Third floor was quiet and room was very nice for this type of hotel. Tub could have been cleaner but it was not an issue as it was just the front edge under the spout and not the floor or walls. Also the shower handle connection was leaking (forgot to tell the staff... I will send a note to then)) Staff were extremely nice and helpful. Restaurant in parking lot is great too.

Text: This is the least run down Super 8 I have ever been in. It actually was not that bad and I got a decent night's sleep. That can be had to find in low cost motels in my experience. The location was close to the highway. Great for a quick overnight stay if you are driving a long distance and just need a place to sleep.
