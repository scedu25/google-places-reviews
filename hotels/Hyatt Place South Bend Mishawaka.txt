Text: The best hotel ever!  Really kind and nice employees.  Everyone.  The rooms are cleaned in a timely manner, and coffee/bar/food area was incredible and they are open 24 hours. Especially thank you Rachel!!!!  She actually helped me go through my bags/room/ rental car to find my missing car keys. Also, it's in a very convenient area.

Text: I've stayed here several times in the past couple years, and always try to book here when in the area. The hotel is centrally-located, and there are about a thousand restaurants in a five mile radius. Okay, not a thousand, but quite a few. The staff is friendly and competent. The facility is modern, all rooms are mini-suites. The only thing about the rooms I don't love is the tiny area which houses the shower stall and toilet. It's a little tight in there... Excellent breakfast, too.

Text: Attended a baby shower in one of the conference rooms. Very clean, bright, and spacious. Perfect for a large group gathering.
