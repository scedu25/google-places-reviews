Guest House Motel Chanute
Rating: 2
Text: You get a towel and a tiny bar of soap and 2 plastic cups. Rooms are tidy, but in serious need of an upgrade. Pop machine is always either empty or broken. Poor customer service at the front desk. Housekeepers are friendly. Location is good if you like Walmart and fast food. Checkout is at 11 a.m.

Text: One of the more decent hotels in Chanute that is affordable. I actually know the owners failry well. My mom has worked for them for as long as I can remember!

Text: Checked in late on a weekend. Opened the door to un made beds with dirty sheets piled on top. Food on the floor. No toilet paper, other people's dirty shoes under the desk and no headboards on the bed. We asked the lady at the desk, she suggested that we make the beds but did offer toilet paper. Then offered us two single rooms for another 40$. Safe to say this place is scary enough to stay away from. Might need a translator to book a room

Text: Unfriendly staff, no ashtrays in smoking room. Very small parking area and construction workers crowded my doorway making me feel unsafe

Text: The hotel is clean, we have stayed there in the past. Good location & friendly staff! I would definitely recommend this hotel. No continental breakfast but they do have coffee & vending machine in the lobby. Microwave, refrigerator, coffee pot in room. I'd stay there again! :)
