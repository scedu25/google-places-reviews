Dr Hertich House B&B
Rating: 5
Text: First time in the Doctor's Room and we loved it.  It is small but the bed is extremely comfortable and the shower has great pressure.  Everything is spotless and smells great.  The air conditioner worked great.  Will definitely stay again.  Also, the French toast is to die for.
