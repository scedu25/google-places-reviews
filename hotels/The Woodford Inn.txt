Text: My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the inn. We started here our first night before touring the burbon trail. The room was clean and comfortable and breakfast was delicious.

Text: Wow!  Amazing food and a wonderful atmosphere!  All of the apps we've had are amazing!  The rooms are also really nice, we stayed in the room directly above the bar and couldn't hear anything.  The beds are ver comfortable and the bathrooms are very nice as well!
