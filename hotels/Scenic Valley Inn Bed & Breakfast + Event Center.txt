Text: My mom, grandma and I stayed at the Scenic Valley Inn this past weekend. It was absolutely wonderful with a Colorado cabin-type feel, delicious breakfast in the morning and stunning views (yes, even in KS!) I will absolutely be back!! Diana and her husband are such sweet people and if you are coming to MHK for a weekend, this is definitely a place to check out. :)

Text: The B&B is secluded on 20 acres of beautiful land. The home itself was designed and built by the owners. It is absolutely gorgeous. Diana and Paul were gracious hosts, the room was lovely, and the bed was comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. Do note the house rules on their website prior to booking!

Text: We enjoyed our stay at the Scenic Valley Inn... Such a peaceful setting. We got to see a beautiful snowfall, and some deer came to visit right outside our window. We enjoyed a cozy room and a wonderful breakfast. Before we left, we got a tour of the rest of the bed & breakfast. They cleared the path to the main road before we left in the morning... and even cleared snow off our car & warmed it up for us! Very hospitable. Would be fun to return during milder weather and check out the walking path with the beautiful scenery.?
