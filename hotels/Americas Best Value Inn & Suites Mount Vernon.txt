Text: My best friend and I stayed two nights here and the first night we went to the pool and didn't know the hot tub was out of order then she seen a cockroach in the bathroom.  Also there breakfast sucked I have had better breakfast at cheaper hotel. They also need better bath towels. We drove 8 HRS and I was not very happy with the room or the service we will not stay here every again
