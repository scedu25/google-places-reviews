Super 8 Brownsburg
Rating: 3
Text: Average motel. Has everything you need. The only (big) downside was it was VERY difficult to sleep. The motel is right off the highway  and it seemed like we were sleeping outside with how noisy and loud it was. Other than that, not a bad stay.

Text: We booked a three day stay with this hotel. Two weeks before our trip we discovered that we would have to cancel. Super 8 apparently feels that an acceptable cancellation fee is 20 bucks off our 300$ stay. They refused to speak with us regarding the issue when we called, and our efforts to contact them via their "appropriate channels" were met with silence. After a week of this we had to pay 280 dollars for literally nothing. Don't give them your business.

Text: Rooms have been renovated but they smell like they have been water damaged. No pool, no amenities, not even a guest laundry facility. Person at front desk was only mildly friendly. Place looks like a roach motel from the outside. Only 2 stars instead of one because out actually has a flat screen tv.

Text: At the end of a winding, confusing road. Lights in our room flickered. The shower did that high pitched squealing thing. Breakfast was out of coffee well before breakfast time was over. No one at the counter when we went to check out. They had no roof over the outside stairwell... a pain in heavy rain! On the plus side, it was clean and inexpensive.

Text: Unfortunately this was the worst visit I have ever experienced at a Super 8. It was an "upgraded" hotel that didn't even have ABC, CBS or NBC on TV. It was overpriced, and I was refused a refund because I had rented the room longer than 10 minutes when I requested it. I saw no "upgrades" that made it different from all other Super 8  motels I have stayed in.
