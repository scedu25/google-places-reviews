Knights Inn Napoleon
Rating: 4
Text: Certainly not fancy but the front desk staff was nice, the room was clean, the hotel was quiet at night and the shower had plenty of hot water and good pressure. I paid $59 a night including taxes, so I feel good about my stay.

Text: Napoleon Knights Inn-It was a very good choice among the other motels. Sheets and towels were clean and smelled very good. And the front desk were very generous when I asked for extra coffee and sugar packets. I will definitely stay there again.

Text: Attendants were nice and the beds were fine. Everything seemed clean enough for a middle of nowhere motel.
