Text: Friendly staff, clean rooms. Shower pressure was great! There was a dip in the floor, every time we walked over it, the tv went out. Very thin walls & ceiling.

Text: I would give negative 3 stars, but the place was clean, and day shift was nice. The place was way higher than it should be. Price was comparable to a full Holiday in in a major city downtown. Night shift however did nothing to help with parking.  Not sure why but folks in this part of the country who are NOT handicapped like to park in handicapped. ALL the spots were taken by cars with no plate, sticker or  placard. Thanks dirtbags.  I and another handicapped vet had to schlep our stuff from the back 40. When the desk person was informed, she flippantly said, "We don't worry about parking."  In business school they tell you to avoid an "irk". You can do everything right, but irk a customer and that is all they remember.

Text: The young lady who checked me in, Miranda, I think was very helpful with my requests. She was also funny and professional at the same time.
