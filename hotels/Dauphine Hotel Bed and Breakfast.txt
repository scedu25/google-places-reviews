Dauphine Hotel Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Authentic historic hotel, restored with care, providing private baths for guest comfort. Clean and comfy beds, warm and cozy for our fall visit. Delicious made to order breakfast with fresh eggs from their backyard chickens!  Great place to relax and take a time out from daily life and reconnect with history, nature and each other.

Text: We love to come here to get away from the world! Beautiful, peaceful surroundings. The B&B is both rustic and luxurious and comfortable. You feel comfortable sitting on the porch or the dining room or walking the grounds. The beds are wonderful! Breakfast is always to be looked forward to. And you can ask to see the cats and chickens. :-) Scott & Sandra know exactly what to do to give someone just the get away they are looking for.

Text: My boyfriend and I stayed here for our 4th anniversary and it was amazing! Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. The rooms were great along with the breakfast that was made for us in the mornings. Highly recommend this if you are in the area!

Text: This was my third time at the Dauphine Hotel. We spent three days here, in this peacefull little French town, hidden away by the Osage River, and it was just what we needed. Go for the peace and quiet, stay for the contentment, come back for the memories.

Text: My wife and I had a wonderful stay here. The room was very clean and neat and the breakfast was fantastic. The price for a night here is well worth the relaxing atmosphere and service. If you're a couple looking to get away, stay in the "Alex and Adelaide's" room. The jacuzzi tub was perfect for "couple's activites" and the bed is more comfortable than my own. We will be returning soon.
