Text: The worst hotel I have ever stayed in! This year alone I have over 250 nights and a few weeks ago I went home for the weekend and when I returned mo day night after work, I walked into my room and it was trashed and someone had stolen all of my personal belongings. I reported it to the hotel and the manager would not even come in to resolve the problem what so ever so I called the cops. When I was outside waiting for the cops another guest approached me and had told me how the front desk clerk had given a key to my room to 2 women. I reported that also and the hotel keeps trying to act like I gave these people a key to my room. A few days later I spoke with the police and the manager had not answered or returned any of there calls and has not even sent the video or pictures of these 2 women to the police. They refuse to reimburse me for any of my items stolen. I would never stay at the hotel again in my life. I was talking to another guest a few days ago and he had told me how his room was broken into and items stolen out of his room and he had deer cameras set up in his room so he captured the maintenance man stealing stuff from his room. That maintenance man was fired then I found out the next maintenance man they hired is a wanted felon in multiply states. If you value your belongings never stay at this hotel they will not take any responsibility for any of their actions.

Text: Elena Garcia was so nice and friendly to us.  She checked us in and treated us just like the people who checked in ahead of us, despite us not having a reservation and them having one.  She gave all the information I could possibly need and seemed happy to answer any additional questions I had.  With such friendly and helpful staff I would highly recommend this place and even stay here again.  -a new friend from Iowa
