Text: Hotel was clean enough. Carpets could use shampoo. The parking lot didn't feel very secure but had no issues.

Text: Huge suite for a great price. Room was clean and staff was kind and welcoming. When we checked out we were given the nicest gift bag with a bottled water and some treats for the road. Overall very pleasant experience.

Text: My home away from home!  You can't find a better staff anywhere!  Beds are very comfortable. Close to shopping and eating. Movie theatre right next door!  Great breakfast. Cable tv, microwave, refrigerator and coffee in rooms. If I could give the staff 10 stars I would!  I stay here every time I go to Henderson. Audubon park is right up the highway and its close to Evansville!
