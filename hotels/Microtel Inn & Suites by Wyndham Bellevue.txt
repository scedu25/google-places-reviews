Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Bellevue

Text: Smaller rooms as one would deduce from the name. The AC seemed a little wonky. In all, atmosphere is great and very clean. I will definitely recommend my family make reservations here over anywhere else in town. Good deal for the price.

Text: I actually loved how crazy small the room was. And having a bunch of mirrors around the bed was also cool, for reasons. Maybe a little bit pricey for what you get.

Text: It was a nice place to stay, but the jacuzzi didn't work and I'm waiting to see if I can get a discount.......
