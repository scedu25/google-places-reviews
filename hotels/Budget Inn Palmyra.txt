Text: This was one of the nicest motels we have ever stayed in. Clean, modern, well worth the price. I have paid twice as much for half the motel. Great value

Text: Great room in the new addition.  Non smoking no pet room looked fantastic and had a great upscale restroom as good as any high dollar hotel we've stayed at.  Very clean and at a reasonable price.

Text: We stopped without reservations and not expecting much. Owner made a couple comments about "being particular about that side" and quizzed us about smoking and pets. I don't blame him, if you have nice things you want to keep them nice... Inexpensive and super nice room! Bathroom is upscale and the shower was awesome. All in all I'm impressed and glad to see they take pride in their property.
