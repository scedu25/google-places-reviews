Text: Wonderful! Completely relaxing. Hosts are so friendly and accommodating.  Would recommend to everyone.  Sent family members there 3 weeks after we were there. Same review. Looking forward to another visit.

Text: The employee that checked us in was great. They leave you alone afterwards unless you need something. Nice and quiet. Nice clean room, stayed in Sedona room. It's close enough to Dubuque that you can get a cab into town if you want to party and you can Uber back. Beautiful set up!
