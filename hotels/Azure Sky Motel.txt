Text: Room was dirty and beds were small.  Owner woke us up at 8:30 in the morning asking if our dog was in the room.  She searched in the windows of the car to see if our dog was in there.  Also she tried to tell us I was smoking in the room.  I don't even smoke.  Could have had a lot nicer room for 3 dollars more, somewhere else.  No lampshade and only 2 plug ins.

Text: Room smelt like dried up urine. You came hook to the TV for gaming or roku etc.   because the area is so bad everything is locked in place. Air conditioner sucks. Woke up to a guy unlocking our room because the owners daughter rented it out before check out. When we got up because someone was messing with the door and stepped out. The daughter said oh its almost check out you should be leaving at 1030 in the morning this happened to us. We were just passing through on business for one night. At check out there was an appoligy but not from the girl that was clearly out of place. I would never recommend this place or go back!!!!! Id rather sleep in a car then that place!
