Text: This Hotel is currently being renovated. I was lucky enough to get to stay in one of the new suites. It was incredible. Not only that but the staff here is wonderful. So incredibly informative and kind. They went above and beyond to make my family feel welcome. This is the only hotel I'll stay at locally! Thank you for a great night's rest!

Text: Rooms were clean and beds comfy. Staff kept rooms stocked with towels and toiletries. Breakfast was typical continental style and was kept well stocked. Only real issue was a breakfast time discrepancy. The welcome book in the hotel stated breakfast would be served until 10am but when we arrived to eat at 9:33, it had already been packed up and put away. I guess there was a sign on the door stating breakfast would be served until 9:30 but alas, we did not see it. They had to have begun breaking it down before 9:30 for it to be completely cleaned up by 9:33.

Text: Holiday Inn 3rd Floor has been recently finished and looks outstanding and modern, cozy for any family and work stop anytime and day. Our construction crew had an amazing time sharing moments during the projects in the area and basically the entire Hospitality crew responded with urgency in attend to our needs and helped us with facilitating our schedules. A great location, we can't wait for the other floors to be done, so the entire place looks shiny and new. We are very thankful for Holiday Inn Express Rochelle services!! We recommend this hotel as the main hotel in the area for any kind of stay!!!

Text: The Holiday Inn Express Rochelle is a great place to stay. Checked into the room around three and was greeted with fresh baked cookies and friendly service at the front desk. The rooms are spacious and very up to date with large windows and a sitting area. Very clean and comfortable! Used their laundry facilities which were clean and open 24 hours which was super convenient. Enjoyed the indoor pool and complimentary breakfast buffet. Apparently the hotel is also renovating some of the common areas (which I honestly would not have noticed if not for the signs. That's how unobtrusive the construction was) so I expect this already great hotel to be even nicer in the near future.

Text: Recently our client, traveling comedian Jeb Wright, stayed here while on tour through the area and had a fantastic night's stay! The staff was very friendly, room was quiet and comfortable, and the breakfast buffet was perfect! He was also able to get some laundry done while relaxing by the pool. Thanks for taking such great care of your guests!
