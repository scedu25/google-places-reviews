Text: What an interesting place.  I have to start by saying the food was really good.  We were in on Sunday afternoon for lunch and it really hit the spot.  We only really had two things that rubbed the wrong way.

1.) They advertise tours but give no details of when they are or how the process works.  2pm on a Sunday and tours weren't being offered.  Seemed strange that a place like this wouldn't capitalize on all the weekends they could.

2.) The girl working in the ice cream store was like a fun sponge, soaking all the fun out of the room.  Ice cream, shakes, and cinnamon rolls to-go for a family of four ($30+) and it was such a drag for her to do all this.  There were about 1,000 places she would rather be and it showed.  They definitely need to find a new face for the ice cream parlor, because she is not portraying the image of "Welcome!".

I can imagine the profit margins for a place like this are razor thin given the location and seasonal nature.  They need to be on their A game to make it work, but not everyone is and it shows.

Text: This place is really neat as a historic site and as a restaurant. Excellent bread rolls! I enjoyed the spicy beef sandwich. I look forward to coming back and saving room for a cinnamon roll!
