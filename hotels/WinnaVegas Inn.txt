Text: Room quiet , has fully functioning mini fridge that keeps items really cold, microwave and coffee maker that work well. Staff is family oriented , friendly and courteous. Good continental breakfast from 6 to 10am. Always a person at front desk to help. Complimentary shuttle to winnavegas casino that leaves or picks you up every 15 to 20 mins. Really enjoyed our stay as guests and fighters for king of the cage.

Text: It's a little bit way too pricey if you pay the regular price for the room but I play at the casino so I get one room a month for a lot cheaper otherwise I think the internet is fine and the beds are fun very clean and a family-oriented place

Text: Room was clean, quiet, and comfortable.  I slept so soundly after driving for nearly 35 hours straight.  Shower was more than adequate.  The rate seemed very reasonable ($73 total).  Only downside, they don't allow pets.

Text: Check-in was between slow and incompetent. Room was acceptable but not exactly polished. But I was exceptionally pleased with the towel fluffy soft and luxurious.
