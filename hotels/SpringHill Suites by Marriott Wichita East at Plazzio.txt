Text: Looked pretty new.  Nice color schemes and furnishings.  New room layout I have never seen.  I liked it and enjoyed something different.  I went down about 9 am for coffee.  The breakfast area was in disarray.  We went down for breakfast after 10 am (past the breakfast time).  They had left the food out and we were glad.

Text: Great hotel! Very comfortable stay and really roomy. I had a King bed room and it had almost it's own small living room with couches. The beds are really comfortable. Could have a little more selection at breakfast though. The lobby / eating area is nice.

Text: Nice place with great lollipops at the front desk. Everything was good until I saw two charges for the same visit. one from hotwire and one from the hotel. They double dipped for one stay. I am knocking off 3 stars because someone on their end should have seen this discrepancy. Not sure how many other customers this hotel is doing this for.

Text: Pool was really small and had a lot of chlorine, but the rooms were very nice and the breakfast was good.
