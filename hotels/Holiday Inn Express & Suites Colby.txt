Holiday Inn Express & Suites Colby

Text: We got a lot of use from this hotel for just one night. We used the pool and hot tub and they were both the perfect temperature. I used the fitness center and the only thing I would change would be putting fan in the fitness room. It got extremely warm. The hotel is under renovations and the parts completely were really nice. We had a king suite and it was roomy and pretty furnishings. Great breakfast because of their variety. Gladly took us in last minute over the Memorial Day weekend.

Text: Great location along the interstate. Friendly staff, quiet rooms. Wish there was a data sheet that lists what local restaurants deliver  and their hours because so many places close early. Great halfway stopover between Kansas City and Denver and close to the Monumental Rocks and Buffallo Bill Cody statute.

Text: It's a pretty decent hotel for being in rural Kansas. I slept on the fold out bed which was pretty rickety. The free breakfast was great!
