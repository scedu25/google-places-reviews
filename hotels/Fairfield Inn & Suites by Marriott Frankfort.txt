Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Frankfort

Text: Frustrating experience. I called and asked if they had a functional hot tub, as my wife and I were traveling on our anniversary and wanted to stop and relax. They said they had a hot tub, so I drive in and pay for a king bed room. Dirty sheets on our bed. Then when my wife asked for extra pillows I noticed a blood looking stain on the pillow case.  Then after breakfast, we go to the hottub and it's freezing and broken (which happens,  but why lie about it over the phone).
So, definitely not the most pristine Fairfield by Marriott. Keep driving for Lexington or Louisville!
EDIT- we left with the promise of a refund due to the hot water not working. We were asked to try another room there, and its hot water wasn't either, so we had no choice but to leave.

Text: The hotel was under remodeling. Mostly aesthetically. But that didn't detract from the stay. The breakfast was better than I thought it would be. Waffles and cereal were expected. But there was also plenty of yogurt and fresh fruit and even cheese omelets. Very friendly and prompt service too.

Text: I don’t know about you, bud, but hotels don’t usually have biscuits and gravy for breakfast. But OHBOY they had biscuits and gravy for breakfast at this hotel. The room was very clean...until I spilled some biscuits and gravy I snuck up to my room. BUMMER!!!!

Text: Wonderful staff. Room had strong odor, but they are renovating and maybe that is the cause. Otherwise very nice accommodations.

Text: Wonderful staff all the way around. Vey clean even as they are doing some remodeling. Spacious rooms with 2 queen beds. Spacious bathroom with a wonderful shower.  And to top it off a refrigerator in my room that actually WORKED!  Came here on business but would stay for a vacation .
