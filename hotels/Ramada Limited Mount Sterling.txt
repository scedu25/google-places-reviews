Text: This is a great little place to stay. Comfortable beds and pillows. Clean room. Bathrooms could use an update but clean. Super friendly staff are knowledgeable of the area and events. Not much of a breakfast regular cold items and hot eggs and sausage with biscuits every other day. We stayed 4 days. Pet friendly. Fitness room pretty nice. Several places to eat especially the cattleman's steak house just down the street. Amazing. Will stay here again.

Text: It was clean. Nothing special but it certainly didn't turn me off. I like it better than the place next door. Next door is about $20 more and the only thing better there is the breakfast. When I come to do work near Mt.Sterling, this is the only place I go. Quiet, clean, close to food.
