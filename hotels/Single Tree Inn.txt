Text: This is a beautiful and very relaxing place to stay. The room is immaculate with wifi and a smart tv that has an extensive interactive cable network. The owners are extremely generous and very friendly, going up and above what should be expected. I stayed there because my car broke down and they were willing to give me a ride in town to eat and get car parts. Outside appearance is good, but when you go into the rooms, it's what you would call upscale. And it IS NOT over priced as previously stated by another poster
