Text: It is under new management and they are remodeling and replacing little by little the entire place, they were more than accommodating when one of the two rooms I reserved had an A/C unit that wasn't working, they noticed and volunteered to switch me to another one which was actually nicer and in better condition, they even brought me 2 fridges for each of the rooms we had. I will stay here again. It may not be high end everything but their attentiveness and willingness to serve is outstanding!!!! Thank you for great service!!!!

Text: Okay for an overnight with a baby but some rooms have a little smell of smoke since they changed to non smoking. The toilet in the first room didn't flush really. The bed was pretty hard. The price was unbeatable though.

Text: It's under new management so pets are no longer allowed. I booked a reserve before management change through 3rd party that helps find dog hotels so the new manager let me still stay with my pet which really helped me out. Rooms were clean, workers were friendly, showers were hot, etc.  Thanks again!

Text: Close to Huskie Stadium and the Convocation Center. The rooms were very clean and the staff very nice.  Comfortable beds. Horrible water pressure. It was so bad 2 of the settings on the shower message thing didn't even work.

Text: Location for my event is excellent! New management seem great. There are some things that make it a little unpleasant though. Right next to a loud bar that makes it hard to sleep at night, water pressure in the sink is very low, makes it a little difficult to get ready in the morning, carpet very dirty, one face towel was dirty before use, and there was no iron in room, only ironing board.
