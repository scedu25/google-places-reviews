Comfort Inn Warrensburg Station
Rating: 5
Text: This Comfort Inn was not your typical hotel.  It was like staying over at your friend's hotel.  The lobby was decorated traditionally for the fall season.  People were playing cards at one of the tables in the lobby and there is an indoor pool and hot tub visible on one side of the lobby.  Their breakfast was very good!  They even pushed our bill under the hotel room door on departure morning.  It was a very homey place to stay.

Text: We had several people stay at the Warrensburg Comfort Inn for our daughters wedding.  This is by far one of the cleanest and hospitable hotels we've stayed in.  The continental breakfast was very good and offered plenty of food and variety.  All of our guests were thrilled with their stay as well.  The pool and hot tub are exceptionally nice and the hot tub was actually hot.  The entire staff from front desk to cleaning ladies and maintenance were very friendly and accommodating.  I would highly recommend this hotel!

Text: This is an excellent budget hotel. You can tell in every way that the owners are proud of this place, and the entire staff is very pleasant. Very clean, and you will find extras not usually found at this price level of accommodation. We frequently come to Warrensburg for work, and look forward to staying here and being able to walk next door to Players for great food and drink.

Text: One of the best! The staff is wonderful and they make you feel welcomed and comfortable.  The pool is nice and the lobby is a fun place to just hang out.  I will always stay here if there is a room available!
