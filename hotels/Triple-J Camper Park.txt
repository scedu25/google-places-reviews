Text: Great place with friendly staff. Needed to get in early to drop the trailer and they was willing to let us come in at 7 in morning.  Nice sites and amenities.
We'll stay here again

Text: Not crowded. Right off I-70. Friendly owner, lots of grassy areas / fields where our dogs played with some other dogs off leash. Full hookups. No amenities like a pool, but nice to have room to spread out and let the dogs actually run. There was an old putt-putt golf area but we didn't use it. Might be fun for kids.

Text: Nice place to spend the night.  Fenced in dog area, but lots of open farmer's fields to let the dogs run in off leash.  Friendly staff. I stayed here coming and going on my recent RV trip.  Will stay again in the future.

Text: Great place for a overnight stop while traveling down I70.  I called  on a Saturday afternoon to check for a site.  The woman running the office (I'm sorry I didn't get her name) gave us a site to pull into since we would be getting there late. She ended up staying until 9:30 pm to take care of us. 
They have private bathrooms with clean hot shower, sink and toilet.  
They even mailed me my kindle tablet when I accidentally left it sitting on the picnic table!  
We will definitely stay there again if traveling that way.

Text: I would give this location 10 stars if I could. Easy access to this campground off of the interstate. The owner is friendly and maintains the grounds very well.You are guided to your campsite. Restrooms/showers/laundry room very clean. Full hookup available along with free wifi and playground  for children of all ages. Price is very reasonable. I will definitely return to this location if I am ever in the area.
