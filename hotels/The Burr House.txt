Text: Stayed in the Japanese room. Ate dinner out by the fire table on the patio, wonderful breakfast.  Friendly hostess willing to get us whatever we needed.  It's in farm country, but very relaxing weekend.

Text: My daughter and I stayed here in 2013. We loved it so much we plan on visiting again this summer!  Very welcoming hosts.  Hot tub, snacks, wonderful breakfast beautifully displayed.  We had the place to ourselves.  One of the rare B&B's with two beds in a room.
