Blue Top Inn
Rating: 4
Text: If you are looking for rooms to compare with the Hilton or the Marriott, and you are picky about things being new and you really want to have up to date bathroom fixtures, decor, and tv's... Then this isn't the place for you.
If you are looking for a bed to sleep in, a hot shower with awesome water pressure, some channels to flip thru, and you like it secluded and quiet....This is it. They even have an outdoor pool to swim in every summer!!
It's affordable!!
It's just as good or better & costs MUCH less than the Super 8 up the street. If in Lamar and need to crash... Choose blue top over super 8!

Text: Very happy to get you a room, make your experience good and a great price.  Not the fanciest, but a good clean place to stay with a nice pool.

Text: Owners/operators are very friendly and helpful. This is a nice little inn with reasonable rates (not many places you can pay around 50 bucks for a room and get a *real* breakfast! I'm talking eggs, sausage, hash browns, the works!). The rooms are clean and comfortable and even the cheapest rooms have a fridge and microwave. The bed in my room was awesomely comfortable!! This inn also has an outdoor pool. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I had a very pleasant stay here.
