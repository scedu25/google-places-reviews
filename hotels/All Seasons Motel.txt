Text: First off, this is not a Hilton so don't expect Hilton like qualities. 

This is a nice place for a weekly rental. My husband and I stayed there for a week while we visited family and we were more than happy there.  Their prices couldn't be beat considering we didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars at a more "high end hotel."  

The owners were super accommodating, especially since we had a trailer. They allowed us to park and unhitch our trailer in an area where they could keep their eye on it with their cameras. Our room was always clean, always had fresh towels and toiletries, and it was quiet. The staff was personable and were great with giving recommendations to local sights and eateries. There was cable but I brought my Roku 1, which we used the Aux cables to hook up to the TV and used their wifi to watch whatever we wanted. 

10/10 would go here again, especially since the owners made this feel like a home away from home.
