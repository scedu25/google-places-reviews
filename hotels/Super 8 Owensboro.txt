Text: We stayed at this motel for 4 days and 3 nights and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that our stay there was good.  It was better than good it was awesome.  the rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly and helped whenever they were needed.   the staff went above and beyond.

Text: Reasonably clean and decent for the price.  
This property is overdue for a remodel.  The in room furniture is all beaten up.  They could touch it up with a little stain on a weekly basis, but it appears they have given up on that concept.
Breakfast, the biscuits were so hard and dry that even 5 minutes after put the gravy on them, I couldn't cut them with the plastic forks.  In fairness, when I mentioned the biscuits to the front desk, she was right there changing them out.

Text: It was a mess. The building is being remodeled, and the room booked was supposed to have 2 queen size beds. They didn't have that though, and tried to give a king size bed, which meant sharing a bed, but were talking into a king size bed for more room. Breakfast was mediocre and their dining room is the entry way and information/booking area and parking with busses in the lot was a nightmare.
