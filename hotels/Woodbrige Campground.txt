Text: This is such a wonderful campground!  The owners are SO nice and helpful and the office staff is great as well!  Jeff even came back with us when we were backing in to our spot to make sure there wasn't anything we needed!  Plenty of area to ride your bikes around, the pool is great and they even have a pond and swimming beach! Everyone is so friendly! You can get food and ice cream at their store and they have activities such as a Casino Night for all of the campers! This is the second time that we have been there and the only bad part is that I wish it was closer to home! :-)  Keep up the GREAT work! We will definitely be back to camp!!

Text: First time here. Campground is well kept. Sites are good size, many are water front. We had a full service site in the new addition, which was priced reasonably. Wooded, very quiet, level pad, kids enjoyed the pool and bouncy pillow - overall a very nice family campground.  We'll be back! Thanks.
