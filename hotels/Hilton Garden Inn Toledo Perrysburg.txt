Text: We have stayed several times in this hotel and I have to say it's easily the nicest hotel I've been to. The rooms are so clean and fresh. The staff is so friendly and ready to help with anything. We have eaten the breakfast a few times and had food at a wedding on our last stay, it is excellent! I'm not a picky eater but am particular as to how my food is cooked and served. This was top notch! The serving staff was neat and tidy, always ready to bring you a drink or take your plate. The bus boy even stopped his tasks to fill my water glass. The bartenders were very friendly and nice. They even remembered what drink I ordered when I went up for a refill! The ballroom was beautiful and the event was amazing! I'll be returning for sure!

Text: I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  My family and I were trapped on the highway in Ohio due to a broken vehicle and the staff from the hotel was very helpful in making sure we got accommodations.  They even came to where were and drove us to the hotel.  I've never been to a hotel that treated their patrons so nicely.  Everyone was courteous and helpful.  They went beyond to make sure that my family was taken care of properly.  The manager, Mary was outstanding and her staff should be commended for what they did.  If this is how they treat they customers, I'd make a special trip there to stay.  Five thumbs up to them!!!

Text: This was an enjoyable stay. Usually check in is at 4, but I was in town to attend a wedding at 4. Simply called and asked to arrive early, there was no fuss. Only complaint was very thick pillows - boyfriend loved that, I prefer thinner, may bring my own next time

Text: Hotel lobby is nicely decorated. Rooms are clean and up to date. Breakfast was better than most HGI breakfasts.  I didn't really like the cheesy grits but they aren't usually offered at other locations. The hotel is located in a safe area and within walking distance to great shopping and delicious restaurants. The surrounding courtyards and fountains make it all feel really chic. I would highly recommend staying at this location.
