Text: My husband, toddler and I stayed here when we were in from St. Louis visiting family. It was very comfortable and affordable. The rooms were clean and the renovations were well done. I would stay here again!

Text: Had a great experience at the Backyard Lodge, they happily accommodated my changing late arrival and in the morning gave me the rundown on places to eat and things to see.  The rooms are beautifully done with every modern convenience and even private covered parking outside your room.  This should be your go to spot for stays in the Beloit area!

Text: Newly renovated with plush carpet, big screen TVs and comfortable beds. Bathrooms are amazing, and tasteful decor throughout. Heat and air is quiet--not your typical through the wall unit. All-around a great place to stay.
