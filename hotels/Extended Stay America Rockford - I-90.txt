Text: I personally have not stayed here. Was only here to visit relatives that were in town. Everything seemed in the up and up. Rooms were clean. The common areas were well maintained.

Text: Pros:
Cheap

The stag was perfectly pleasant and helpful, good service. 

Cons:
Unusably slow internet (Netflix was out of the question)

Loudest air conditioning unit I've ever heard (difficult to sleep here)

Curtain setup in a way that it billows out and blocks most of the cold air from the air conditioner. 

Bathroom door that closes itself (way more annoying than I would have thought )

No utensils plates or cups in the room despite having a stove and fridge. ( you have to ask for them)

No clothes hangers in closet 

No counter space in the bathroom. 

Overall:
Lots of little things adding up to the worst place I've stayed in a while even when factoring in the price. All of this through no fault of the staff, they were great, it's just a cheap facility.

Text: There are two Extended Stay America properties in the same general location but the have no signage distinguishing which is which. The room was OK. The property was clean. The price was good.

Text: We stayed here twice in two weeks. The hotel is very clean and provides a quick breakfast to go. I paid less than $50 for the hotel and we got a great deal. I would recommend to anyone. The hotel is also close to great places to eat, stores and night life.

Text: This hotel was one of our hotels we reserved rooms at for our wedding. While the other hotel raised no issues, this Extended Stay did not complete bookings for guests, provided an incorrect rate or, without alerting guests, cancelled reservations if a card was not on file, making us worry if our guests would have a place to sleep when they arrived. We wanted this to be a lower cost option for guests, but paid for it in time and frustration.
