Text: Great place,  nice sites,  great trail for walking or cycling, ,  ties into the sheltowee trace trail system, beautiful lake, only problem I saw was that the fishing was bad, no one I talked to caught any fish or even got a bite the entire weekend.

Text: I love this campground and laurel lake.  The staff is very friendly. The 3 stars rating is due to the noise level after midnight. All 4 times I've camped here it's been very loud at night, until 4AM this last time.

Text: It was good the first night we stayed I had no complaints at all, I called a week or two ahead before we decided to come down here as we are not from laurel county. A woman answered the phone I asked her if there was any restrictions as in generators etc. She said there was no restrictions I ran my small tailegater the first night asking pol around me if it was bothering them they told me no. The next night a site manager came and told me quiet time was from 10pm-6am and that if he was seen again there would be police enforcement called mind u we hadn't done anything wrong I provides that person with the day I called what number and the woman I talked to.
