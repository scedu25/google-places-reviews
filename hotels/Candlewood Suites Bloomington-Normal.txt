Text: One of my favorite hotels! Great location with a lot of food options nearby. Room was clean and decent. Nice staff. The best thing is they have washers and dryers to use for free. It's great if you stay in town for a few days. They do not offer free breakfast, however. But again, Panera is like 3 min walk so it's not a big deal.

Text: Came for a weekend with friends. Did not realize this was an extended stay hotel. Our room had a full kitchen. Really nice if that's something you are looking for. The only problem is one of our friends requested a room with two beds. Candlewood charged him $20 extra to guarantee him two beds. When we got there we were told the hotel does not have 2 bed rooms. What was the extra $20 for then?

Text: It was a very nice hotel! It has a full kitchenette with plates and silverware as well as utensils to cook with, we didn't utilize them but it was cool! Only down side was 2 "double" sized beds in it room. They were quite small. No breakfast, but we knew that before we stayed. Overall great!
