The Hill House
Rating: 5
Text: If your looking for a quiet, peaceful, beautiful, relaxing place for a getaway to rejuvenate and enjoy some R&R. I highly recommend The Hill House.  Our family just stayed here and absolutely plan on returning.  Auburn, NE was about 10 min away and we did our grocery shopping and had lunch there one day.  They had a great liquor store with plenty to choose from.  The town of Brownville was quaint and had some cute little shops. But the highlight and the reason I would return was hands down  the house itself. It was beautifully decorated, felt right at home and the seclusion of being tucked back in the woods was incredible.  It rained most of the time,  but we pulled the patio furniture under the covered canopy they had on the patio and enjoyed our coffee in the mornings, beer in the afternoon and wine in the evening near the fire pit.  Wonderful memories full of conversations, reading, and just enjoying the quietness of being away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We plan to make more memories as a family there and appreciate the care and details the owners have put into making this truly a special place.
