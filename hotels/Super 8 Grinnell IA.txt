Text: This property is pretty worn out.  Paint is newer, but everything else about it feels outdated. In general, the hotel was dirty and beat-up. Pool was cloudy looking, so didn't bother trying it. Others said it was freezing.  Cabinets in breakfast room had streaks of something (garbage bag juice?) coming out the bottom.  That was pretty gross.

Guest room was so-so.  Mattress was acceptable. Plumbing and AC worked okay. Refrigerator made an awful racket every time it ran -- woke us up all night long.  If this place were priced at $49, I would have known what to expect.  For the $86 I paid, I could have done much better.  I don't plan to stay here again.

Text: Our bed was most comfortable of entire trip but the free breakfast left a lot to be desired.  It was our highest priced hotel.  Pool was chilly.  Rooms were clean but amenities like no blow dryer were slim.

Text: Tons of crickets everywhere. Room had a funny smell. But otherwise good. Inexpensive and pet friendly.

Text: Clean rooms, comfortable beds, reasonably priced.  Great location. Will return soon.  Breakfast boring but what do u expect it's a hotel not a restaurant.

Text: Felt like it had not been updated or even really cleaned since 1970. Man at the front was very nice, but rooms were no bueno!  We had crickets in our hallway and in our room all night... guess thats what you get for building in a corn field! Ha
