Fredonia Inn

Text: Rooms are older and definitely need updating. Not handicap friendly rooms, as door to bathroom is small and no hand grips.
But if you're looking for an inexpensive, basic room that's clean - this is a good spot.  Staff is friendly. Refrigerators on room.

Text: Good place for such a little town. I am from the city and I would have to say its pretty nice at this motel. Other then a few issues with the microwave, refrigerator and heater it's pretty well. $46 bucks a day plus taxes. Not bad!
