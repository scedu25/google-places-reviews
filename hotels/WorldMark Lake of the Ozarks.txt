Text: Had a little trouble with electronic door when we arrived but it was fixed next day.  All in all good stay.  Clean and very nice accommodations.   Great view of the lake.  Close to grocery stores and restaurants.   Great customer service.  They gave us free internet.  Great showers.  Will come again.  Highly recommend.

Text: Got in late last night. Front desk representative was very polite and knowledgeable. Condo was pretty clean, very comfortable and freshly painted. The lake view is always amazing even from the 2nd level now that the taller trees have been removed.
