Baymont Inn & Suites Louisville East
Rating: 4
Text: Has been a decent stay. I've notice some cosmetic issues on furniture. My door is a bit hard to shut as well. I notice some mold buildup in the bathroom and on the wall next to the sink. Potential water leak somewhere? Employees were not overly enthused but not terrible either. Overall not a bad stay. Bed is very comfy.

Text: Overall not bad, shower curtain had a tear in it, tub leaked a bit, could have been a little cleaner. Staff was friendly and helpful. Lobby was clean and nicely arranged. Breakfast was good. I’d stay again with the above items checked per room and fixed.

Text: The male staff between the age 21 to 25 tried to charge me more($25 instead of $10) and I raised a question about the charge.
(I checked in at same time two days ago,so I knew early check in fee was $10)
He got pissed off, So I GUESS he wasn’t happy because I had already booked room for lowest price online($60), 
This place is managed by a North Indian family most of the time, so a female (looked like his mom)told this guy not to charge  me more and he asked her to shut up and mind her own business.
So avoid this guy, he might have some mental issues.

Text: If i could i would give this hell hole no stars. First of all I walk in to my room and there is this portable 1970s heater in there, then I go to the bathroom and see a pile of genital hair on the toilet and I left right away. I advise you to never go stay here unless you like small and nasty spaces!!!! I went to the country inn 8 minutes away and paid same price and this place way better.

Text: Even though we had some issues with our bathroom door and tub.  I'd still rate this 4 stars the pleasant staff and quick work to make our stay better was fantastic.   Beds were super comfy and it's quiet.
