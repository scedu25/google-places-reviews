Text: I love this place. The service is great. Everyone I have dealt with has been courteous and helpful. Everything is clean and well maintained. The price is wonderful and worth it for the rooms. The hot tub room with rain shower is a phenomenal deal!

Text: The rooms are everything we could hope for at an amazing price. The bed and bathroom we're both very sizable and comfortable for two people.

Text: We had a fantastic stay! We booked a king suite with a 2 person hot tub - it was definitely worth the extra cost for luxury. The room was very comfortable, to the point where we didn't want to leave. Besides that, the hot breakfast was delicious, and the service was exceptional. We will definitely be visiting Comfort Suites Perrysburg again!

Text: Really disappointed in this place. Looked like it was going to be a good stay. When i arrived front desk was very nice and easy check in. Go to the room and do my usual bug check (no bugs!), but during the inspection i threw off the bottom sheet and a band aid fell out. Found all the bedding had a yellowish tint except 2 of the pillows and one sheet that i used to lay on the bed. Bathroom was huge and nice looking but floor sounds hollow and found myself trying to walk quite (I already walk pretty quiet) to not disrupt people below me. Toilet paper was just hanging down the wall from the roll. Whole room just seemed like it was half a..ed cleaned and things didnt get replaced or changed. I wont be staying here anymore.
