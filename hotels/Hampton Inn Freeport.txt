Hampton Inn Freeport
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very clean, luxurious, and spacious. The staff was really friendly and polite. The breakfast was delicious and is no doubt the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. Perfect place to stay when you're out of town. Fantastic hotel and I would love to stay here again. (Oh and a random comment, the water pressure is great).

Text: Recently remodeled, clean, and safe. Very friendly and helpful staff. Full breakfast with lots of diet options. Great location, very quiet at night but close to everything.

Text: Nice facility. I've stayed before. Clean. Comfortable bed. Nothing to complain about other than the breakfast. Offer omelettes or eggs everyday would be preferred.  No bagels with cheese and eggs please.  Also sausages way too salty.  This is a common problem with Hamptons though.

Text: My work arranges for me to stay here. It's nothing fabulous, but a decent hotel and always clean. Nice, accommodating staff. Small pool and gym are nice amenities.
I usually skip the breakfast, except for maybe a piece of fruit and a yogurt.
