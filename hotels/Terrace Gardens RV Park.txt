Text: This is very embarrassing for the city of Oberon, KS. The electrical should be inspected by the city if not the state!  This property should be condemned. How dare the city to allow this person to continue to dupe traveler's  into trying to stay here. I will be calling the city to report this injustment to traveler's!

Text: Clean and well cared for.  No amenities, not even a trash can.  Good for an RV.  we were in a tent trailer and had to walk over to the nearby emergency room to use a bathroom. Nurses in ER room super nice.
