Text: Very comfortable beds and pillows. Almost too soft though (lacking support enough that my wife's back was sore in the morning). The breakfast options were really good. The bathroom seemed like it could use a deep cleaning. Overall a good place to stay.

Text: Room was clean and comfortable. However, the TV system is terrible. Changing channels was painfully slow and selection of channels was weak.
