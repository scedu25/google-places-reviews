Text: Clean rooms. Beds were ok a little on the firm side. It met or exceeded my expectations for the price. Bathrooms are small. If you plan to stay more then a night the rooms are on the smaller side. Breakfast is very limited with a waffle maker the only hot option besides warming up instant oatmeal.

Text: i specifically  asked if room had internet service and flat screen tv. I was assured yes and that it worked well. When I went to use it for my work I had no service in the room, I had to do all my work from the lobby.. the only place it would connect at. Manager on duty said the only router they have is above the desk. if your work is important to you don't stay here. buyer beware. the flat screen was to be able to extend my monitor for my lap top to get work done easier.
