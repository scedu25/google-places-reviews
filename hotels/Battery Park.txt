Text: First time to see a concert at this venue and not impressed. Especially after having been to many, many concerts. Doors open at 6:30 and you have one food truck with basic food that takes 1.5 hours to wait in line for then 10 minutes to make a burger? Then the alcohol line takes 20 mins because they aren't organized and not enough people on staff...plus the opener didn't start til 8pm? If you're going to start a concert at food time, I will eat here and wait for a show but at least be more efficient about taking my money.

Additionally: Opener act mic is way too loud and sounds awful. Who is mixing this show? Wow.

Furthermore: 50 mins unnecessary wait for main show... I suppose so everyone can stand in lines and make regrettable purchases. Half the crowd is sitting waiting....
