Text: Okay, this is a first time stay here. Rates are great, room is clean, A/C is working and the bed is firm but comfortable. The gentleman at the desk was very nice and said if you don't like your room or if something is wrong , let me know. More than I can say for the Marriot I stayed in last night in St. Louis.$220.00 plus 30$ parking and no breakfast. Had trouble from jump. Give the small guys a break please. It's older but aren't we all.
