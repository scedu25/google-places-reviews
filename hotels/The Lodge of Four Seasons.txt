The Lodge of Four Seasons

Text: We got a really great deal at this resort.  It has a full sized movie theater.  Indoor outdoor pool was a little too cold on our visit. Fun game room for the kids and a really cool indoor fire pit.

Text: Clean and beautiful!!! This place was our wedding venue!  We loved our whole experience, but somehow they messed up the catering? We ordered steak and salmon to be served and ended up with salmon and pick chops! When we noticed, it was FAR too late to say anything (it's not like they could just go whip up some steaks for all of our guests) but overall, our experience was good! The place was beautiful, and we enjoyed our time- and we're happily married (;

Text: The room was very nice, and when we reported that our shower light was not working, the management sent someone right over to take care of it. Also enjoyed their meeting rooms and catered meals. Beautiful scenery!
