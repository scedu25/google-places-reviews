Text: I paid for the hotel on  The website then when I get to the hotel from Texas to Missouri the man at the front desk made me pay again and gave me a receipt with someone else’s card number saying that I had to pay again or I couldn’t stay. Of course I was tired so I went ahead and paid so the next day I went back and checked out and asked for a receipt he refused and started yelling at me terrible customer service and I think he just wanted money . I will never go back to relaxin in Saint Robert Missouri and I hope no one else goes they  either  I advise you to not do it also,  TVs don’t work there’s no Wi-Fi  it says complementary breakfast that’s a no go there’s no such thing there

Text: Ice machine didn't work, Wi-Fi was very spotty.  When we rang the bell for ice, nobody came to the window.. 9pm I tried again 10 minutes later.. man was very grumpy and couldn't communicate clearly. Several people came and went sometimes honking near one of the rooms throughout the entire night. Room was clean, except for the stains and burn marks in the non smoking rooms bedsheets. Tv's are outdated and had terrible picture. (We rented two rooms) with all of the other choices with similar prices, I will be trying somewhere else the next time I pass through.
