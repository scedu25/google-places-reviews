C3 Hotel & Convention Center
Rating: 4
Text: Clean rooms, friendly staff overall. Did have an issue with a new hire double charging me, but the attendant on in the morning caught it and is doing her best to get it fixed (Expedia booking but had pets that needed added). Breakfast was complimentary, and decent enough.

Text: There are many things to like about this hotel, especially for young families: the awesome pool and activity area, the TV and internet, board games to borrow, and more. However, the hotel should be renamed C2, as cleanliness was noticeably lacking in the rooms and common areas, which tainted the enjoyment of all the other amenities. They are trying hard to be flashy, fun and modern, but need to get the basics right first. We'd still come back, because it's a fun little getaway with kids.
