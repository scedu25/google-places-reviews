Victory Inn Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The Inn was well kept and very clean.  Very quiet street and I slept very peacefully.  The Inn Keepers were friendly and made my stay very enjoyable.  I've heard from others that the breakfast is wonderful.  I was on a tight time schedule and was unable to stay for breakfast.  I highly recommend this Inn.

Text: We stay here with our 4 kids when we come to visit family.  The owners are warm and the breakfast is fantastic.  Not big city, but it's Wamego! It shouldn't be big city.  Five stars
