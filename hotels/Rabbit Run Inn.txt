Text: Great place to stay with family and friends.  We were staying for my sisters wedding and ended up renting out the whole facility.  It was very warm and all of us in the family were able to stay under one roof.  Great back yard with a pond full of fish and fire pit.  Not far from a beach and the "downtown" area.  Highly rated.

Text: We enjoyed our stay at this charming B and B. The rooms were cozy, comfortable, and clean, with a nice patio overlooking a pond in the back. It's close to the dunes, wineries, and orchards, with lots of nice little restaurants and antique shops nearby. I would definitely stay there again!
