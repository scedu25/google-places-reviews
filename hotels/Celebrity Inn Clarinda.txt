Celebrity Inn Clarinda

Text: Don't judge a book by its cover!  My room was very spacious, clean, sound-proofed, and decked out in a classy wood theme.  For $45, I expected the king bed to be a joke, but it was as cozy as my last 5-star room at the Cosmo in Vegas. The only nitpick is the shower had stick-on tiles from a remodel and a few of these were separating from the old porcelain tiles.
