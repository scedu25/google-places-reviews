Cherokee Lakes Campground

Text: The whole staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and honestly blessed our ministry! The owner Mike went way beyond hospitality and customer service! He spent a full 45 minutes helping me obtain emails and faxes so we could renew our tag on our RV that was close to expiring! And didn't charge us for all of his help. What a God-send. The campground is located by a lake and it feels like you are in the country. You bet we will return in the future!

Text: We stopped for 1 night. The sign and entrance off the main road make you wonder  what you might find. Behind what looks like an abandoned car dealership, the park is a pleasant surprise. It is older, but clearly the owner is working to renovate it. My girls were bummed the pool was closed for repairs, maybe next year. The park has many long term residents that were friendly. Our site was shaded and level. I think it is a good value for the night. What is nice is that it is quiet, no RR tracks or highway noise. The laundry room was nice and clean. We were in a 31' Class C 30 amp.

Text: Cherokee Campground is a great place to go and spend some time away from home when you're out camping. the owner and host are extremely nice and very helpful it has an on-site laundry facilit, also it's right on the outskirts of St Louis so if you're interested in fine dining or any kind of dining or carousing with the locals you can just jump right into town . My name is Philip, I would like to say "Thank You" for being a Great Place to call home, while I was away from home. Definitely a 5 Star rating....
