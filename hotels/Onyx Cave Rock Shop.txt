Text: Great examples of interesting cave formations.    This tour was more enjoyable than the Mammoth tour (which was nice too). Nice people.  Great rock shop; not your run of the mill junk-rock shop.  They know what they are doing, and the prices are solid.

Text: Good parking. Close to the Cave City exit. Nice little rock shop. The cave was shallow and exposed in the 70s while excavating... so close and easy. Well decorated with formations. Good guide. Tight spots..some low ceiling...steep stairs...nice. Worth the quick trip.

Text: Personalized tour of a beautiful cave, lots of different formations to see.  The wonderful guide Missy, took her time and didn't rush us because we are older folks.  I only got 2 drips of water and my husband didn't get any.  The steps weren't slippery.  At 240 lbs and 6 feet tall he didn't have any trouble with the narrower parts of the tour.  So glad we chose this cave because the tours at Mammoth Cave were crowded and most were booked solid.
