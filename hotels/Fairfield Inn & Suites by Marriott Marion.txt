Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Marion
Rating: 5
Text: One of the best Marriott locations I've ever been to. Isn't a very nice town and staff are incredibly friendly and the rooms are incredibly clean it has an indoor swimming pool and a great happy hour. Couldn't ask for much more. Would definitely recommend to anybody staying in the area.

Text: Staff was friendly, place was clean and well lit, breakfast was decent, the heated pool was working and there was a hot tub. Local Marcos pizza delivery was fast! The other guests coming and going seemed in good spirits. Saw lots of dogs staying the night so they must be pet friendly. The dogs were all well pampered so it had us wondering if there was a dog show nearby. The more times we try other places, the more we appreciate Fairfield. They're quickly becoming our favorite place to stop on family road trips. Our biggest complaint about the last location (Clarksville) was they ran out of bananas. Friendly staff there too. It's worth spending a few more bucks to stay somewhere nice and clean and friendly, and not the shady Days Inn where the room door doesn't latch shut.

Text: Best complimentary breakfast we have had on the road.   Edible eggs, vegetarian sausage was a nice touch but pork sausage was good, too. Lots of other choices also.  NO nasty "pancake machine "!  Room was noisy, lobby air-conditioning ran all night outside our window.  No water in the 'market'. Otherwise a decent stay.  Thanks for a great start!

Text: I thought the hotel was amazing during our stay. It was conveniently located to what we needed. Our rooms were very nice and comfortable. The room service was very nice. The others in our group said breakfast was good although I wasn't up early enough to eat it but it was close to McDonald's

Text: The colors, layout, immaculately clean environment here, along with the cloud-like beds and pillows make for a refreshing, restorative experience. The staff is very friendly and make one's comfort and convenience a real priority. We always look forward to a stay here!
