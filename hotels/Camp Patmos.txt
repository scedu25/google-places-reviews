Text: Pastor Dave is great! We drove around the island trying to find a church to attend and ran into him by accident. We happened to ask if they had a church service we could attend and we have attended twice and we're even invited to stay and eat with them. Wonderful place.

Text: One of my most favorite places to visit. Beautiful campus, kind and courteous staff, my kids absolutely love it here. We've been to weekend retreats, family camp, and children's camp for many years.
