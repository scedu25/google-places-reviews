Old Caledonian Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I spent a night at the Old Caledonian Bed & Breakfast and left wishing we were spending five more nights.  It is an incredible home with historical significance, lots of room and outside gardens to relax in solitude.  The location is perfect with lots of options within a short distance for those who enjoy the outdoors, historic sites, and antiques.  The experience provided by our hosts, John and Penny, was awesome.  We felt welcomed from the time we pulled into the lot and never had a need or want that was not met or already considered.  But the best part of our stay was John's creative and incredible menu.  If you stay at the Old Caledonian you have to get dinner!  My wife and I will be back as soon as we can.

Text: The house is beautiful with all of the original woodwork. It is tastefully decorated with cozy furniture and a cross between antique and shabby chic. The Caroline room was very peaceful. Blue and white decor and white washed floors just make for a relaxing space, and the soaking tub was just what I needed!! Make sure not to miss tea time!! A great varity of hot tea and even iced tea along with some yummy sandwiches and desserts. I also highly reccomend that you let Chef Jon prepare your dinner. It was just amazing!! Wander the beautifully landscaped gardens outside and relax with a bottle of wine in the gazebo. Walk down the street in town and check out the cute antique stores and general store. Penny and Jon are a lovely couple and are wonderful hosts. I can't wait to stay again!!!

Text: Simply perfect. Everything from the food to the rooms was on point. I went to stay after my proposal and Jon and Penny made everything extra special for us. Flowers, sweets, champagne. All the bells and whistles. The house is vintage and historic which adds to the the unique charm that I was really hoping for. We would love to go back in the future!

Text: My husband  and I celebrated our first anniversary at the Caledonian last night, and are sure to be back!  The hospitality from the minute we walked in was great. Jon  checked us in and then gave us a tour of the house. It was beautiful and we felt right at home. The house was very clean and spacious, the outside was so nicely maintained from the gazebo to the koi pond and fountain/waterfall, and our room felt very open. The bed was really comfortable and we slept very well. The most incredible part of the stay was Jon's cooking. We chose to do their dinner as well. I had grilled salmon with vegetables from their garden. My husband enjoyed a steak. The appetizer was fried green tomatoes with corn salsa, all from their onsite garden. The dessert was a peach jelly donut which was fantastic! For breakfast, we enjoyed coffee, blackberry bread, fresh fruit, and chicken and pancakes. Jon and Penny certainly put a lot of love into what they do! We felt that throughout the entire stay. Check it out, and you won't be disappointed!
