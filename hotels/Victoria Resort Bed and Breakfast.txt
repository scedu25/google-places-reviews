Victoria Resort Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: I've been going to Victoria resort for about 15 years now. The place has always been fantastic. The cottages and hotel rooms are cozy and always clean. The pool, although small, is still very nice. Also even though the Victoria Resort is now under new ownership the place feels exactly the same as it always has been. The owner is extremely nice and helpful. You won't regret staying here one bit. Definitely recommend!

Text: We stayed 2 nights in the bed & breakfast inn in the Deluxe Queen room. This was our first  B&B experience and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. Jim, the owner, was phenomenonal, and went above and beyond to ensure our experience was perfect for our 43 anniversary.  The room was quiet and comfortable. The breakfasts were excellent in selection,  taste, and unique each morning.

Text: I highly recommend staying at Victoria Resort if you are planning to visit South Haven MI, Jim the owner went out of his way, above and beyond to make sure we had a truly unique experience like never before.  Staying at a franchise hotel or anywhere you will not get the experience of a home made breakfast in the morning, and the pampered feeling you get here, it's definitely a must please try it out for yourself and thank me later. Peace
