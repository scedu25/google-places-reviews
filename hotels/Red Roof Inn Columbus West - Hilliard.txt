Text: Stop here while traveling from Maryland to Iowa. Being a Sunday night it was not busy. The lady at the front desk was real nice and helpful. The room was very nice inside and clean. They have just been renovated. I would stay here again for sure

Text: Needed a last minute, cheap place to stay the night, checked in around 9 or 10 p.m., got to my room and as usual I did my inspection of the place, check the mattress looked fine, lifted the bed skirt on the box spring and it was loaded with bed bugs. The employee initially doubted my claim and said "we don't have bed bugs, are you sure they are not ants or something?" I told her I would show her and she did follow me to the room and when I showed her under the bed skirt she jumped back and then apologized and agreed and then cancelled my charge. I would advise inspecting under the bed skirts and all over before staying here.

Text: The room was clean but the cleaner they used smelled a little weird. Plenty of hot water and the bed was comfortable. Basically what you'd expect and I was happy with my stay.

Text: Of the four Red Roof Inns we have stayed in around Columbus in the past few weeks, this was by far the nicest. Appeared and smelled very clean and I was very impressed by the layout as compared to the others as well. The manager on duty when we checked in (early check-in at 11AM or so) was wonderful. The manager who took over for her was not so much. She was very rude. No customer service skills whatsoever. I'd stay here again.
