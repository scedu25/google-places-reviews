Econo Lodge Oak Grove-Blue Springs
Rating: 3
Text: Nice enough room for the $65 but it's a bit hard to find if you're not using Google Maps. Comfortable king bed, highway noise once the TV was off and breakfast was not great. The lobby & rear entrance carpet by food area (2 tables) looked old & disgusting. The showers were fabulous, though, with high pressure for a relaxing touch. Eastern on-site manager...she wasn't really friendly checking in at 9pm and the office wasn't even open at 7am. Note that I prepaid online & they still make you register & run your credit card for $.01. Not cool, they need a new system.

Text: Good place, but A non-working refrigerator made a mess of food and  now I have warm drinks.  Not good.  Check all appliances first!

Text: This was fine for an overnight stay but nicer places can be found for similar rates.  $80 (counting tax) was a little much for the base motel.  Room was clean.  Office personnel were fine.  Lots of needed renovations taking place.  Breakfast disappointing with still frozen hash browns and biscuits/gravy the main items.   On our cross country drive, i paid similar amounts for better breakfast, cleaner facility, and a pool at several hotels.

Text: From the street you wouldn't notice this hotel as being too good. I asked to look at a room before I decided to stay. The owner was very accommodating and was happy to show me a room. His attitude went a long way from the start. When I walked in the room I was blown away. It's really nice!!! Super clean and very comfortable. Big flat screen and a microwave with a large mini fridge. I travel often and this is the best econo lodge I've stayed at by far. The truck parking is a big lot that can fit 5 or 6 tractor trailers easy.
