Text: Extremely clean, great breakfast and service at breakfast. Usually in this type of hotel the various smells of people cooking in their rooms is overwhelming, that was NOT the case here. Smelled like new throughout my stay of 5 nights. I will be back in town in 2 weeks and definitely reserving here again.

Text: Rooms are spacious and well equipped. I am very impressed at the amenities. Perfect for any long term stay. Rooms are well insulated as well. To be honest, the music in the hallway is a little annoying all night long, but you can't even hear it once the door shuts. The best part is that if you don't want to go out to eat back to back nights, you have a full working range and oven and microwave. There's big box stores and anything else you need to grab for making food. Full dishwasher, plates, pans and utensils.

Text: I am enjoying my 1 bedroom suite.  I feel secure and the staff is very friendly.  However, I have had a few small cleaning issues.  I had hoped for a weekly rate for a week+ stay, but that wasn't available.
