Victorian Acres RV Park & Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Green, clean, spacious lots! Breezy rolling country side conveniently off of Rt 2.  Some traffic noise but distance enough not real noticeable. Bathrooms and showers spacious and clean. Reasonable price with Good Sam club about $27.  Electric and water. Has dump station. More than an overnight. Would park here for couple of days or more. Would definitely return and would highly recommend!

Text: What a great spot!  My wife and I stayed here one night in our tent.  I guess they don't get much for tent campers like us but our spot was beneath a beautiful oak tree on a nice level gravel pad.  With water and electric nearby we had everything we needed.  The employees (the owners I would assume) were very friendly and accommodating.  The bathrooms and showers were very clean and you could tell they take pride in the upkeep of their facilities.  I would totally recommend staying here.  Thanks!

Text: This seems to be a nice campground. Friendly staff and clean shower house. The campsites and pads very good. I would recommend  this campground for just overnight or an extended stay. Give it a try and I think you will enjoy your stay.

Text: Absolutely gorgeous Campground! The grounds are all neatly trimmed & mowed.
A very "in the country" atmosphere.   Showers & restrooms with brand-new tile & is spotless!
The hostess/owner is very cordial & helpful.  I would almost find something to do in this area in order to have an excuse to come camp here again!
Wifi & laundry facilities excellent.

Text: Living here x 2 months now & will be until Feb.  They are accommodating to needs & gave us a site better for winter than we were in.  Laundry & showers very clean. Cute holiday/seasonal decor.  Will be back next June.
