Five Oaks Vacation Rental
Rating: 5
Text: This place is a hidden gem. My family and I recently stayed here because we were attending a memorial service in nearby Ironton.  The house is located on a farm and is just a short distance from the small & very neat downtown of Caledonia. Not only was the house itself was great, but the surroundings were picture perfect. They have an old barn, several decks and patios, ponds, access to a creek, a tire swing and more.  We especially loved the sunset and the field of thousands of fireflies at night.
