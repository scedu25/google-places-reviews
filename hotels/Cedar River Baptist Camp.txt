Text: Came with our church, Bible Baptist Church of Terre Haute. The staff were great. The sermons were just what was needed for my hungry soul. It was truly a blessing to be able to be here for a family retreat.

Text: Being a small and growing church, we were looking for a camp for our youth to attend for the first time this year. We wanted a camp that would preach the King James Bible, challenge the children spiritually, and allow them to have a lot of fun as well.

Cedar River Baptist Camp provided all those things!

Each day, the children received multiple devotions and sermons, each one tailored specifically toward todays youth. They were challenged in each and every message, and many of them responded with decisions each day. One of our group received Christ as his Saviour on the last night!

Each day I chock full of games and excitement. From capture the flag, to relay races to Cat-in-the-Hat, there was no lack of fun activities for the children to engage in.

And let us not forget about the food! The best camp food I have ever had! Every kid loved the meals, and there were always seconds for whoever wanted them.

In short, God is blessing this camp, and Bro. Todd, the director. God met with us while we were at camp, and we look forward to bringing even more of our children next year!

If you are looking for a camp for your youth to attend, please consider and pray about Cedar River Baptist Camp. They were an amazing blessing to us, and I hope they can be the same for you.
