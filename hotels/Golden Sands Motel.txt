Golden Sands Motel

Text: Good for a place to lay your head and shower. But don't expect anything extra. It's clean and bug free but dated and a little run down. No water pressure, semi-hot water(Good enough for quick showers), tube tv with a digital converter box.

Text: I have stayed in cheap motel rooms before.  This one was one of the worst.  Smelled like stale smoke and general death.  Walls outside were smashed by vehicle collision.  #39 had a door that was warped so you could see in the room.  My room, #35 the door looked like it had been kicked in before.  Shower leaked all over bathroom and was so small you couldn't help but touch the disgusting walls.  If you're looking to feel like you're going to be murdered or catch an STD this is your spot.  I tried for a refund or partial refund and they said no way only another room which was equally murdery.
