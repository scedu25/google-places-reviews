Text: The receptionist was very friendly, breakfast was well made. The rooms were medium sized but comfortable. The pool was a little small but it was there along with a hot tub. And it's located near a lot of great restaurants.

Text: Nice staff, but my "Suite" was in need of lots of maintenance. Needed to iron my shirt and pants, no iron or ironing board in the room, but there was a place to hang both. No alarm clock on night stand. Only 1 phone in a "Suite",  with it by the desk, not the night stand. One of the white sheets on the bed was stained. The bathroom door lock was broken, it was literally missing the locking mechanism on the inside of the door handle. Instead of a lock to turn, there was a hole in the door knob. The bathroom floor had hair on the floor in the corner behind the door, which you would only see if you closed the door with you inside the bathroom. Guess the maids never looked behind the door. The soap holder in the shower was filthy and NOT clean. It was caked in soap scum. The bathroom was in need of a serious good cleaning, painting, and caulking. The last thing, the dresser was missing a decorative wood trim on a drawer, and a very tiny nail I did not see it the dark room, that was to hold the trim on, cut my finger. This is the second "Carlson" hotel I've stayed at, and both were in poor shape and needed maintenance.

Text: Friendly staff. Coffee station and fresh cookies available when we arrived even though we were a very late arrival. Great hot and cold breakfast assortment all you can eat mini buffet style with nice assortment.  Right off the freeway, tucked in between a Starbucks, gas station,  and Steak and Shake right next to it. Walmart a couple drives down. Not fancy but not a dump either. Good value. Would stay again.

Text: Rooms are clean and comfortable. Our lock mechanism in the door was broken so they had to make us change rooms. We were upgraded to a suite at no cost for our inconvenience. Autumn at the front desk is amazing.
