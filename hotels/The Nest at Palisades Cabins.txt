The Nest at Palisades Cabins

Text: STAY AWAY! THIS IS MY SPOT1. OMG, I don't know where to begin. My wife and I were looking to get away for the weekend and found the perfect spot. We had our own personal cabin where we just relaxed and took in natures beauty. I took some time to walk down to the Mississippi River and did some quality fishing. Caught a couple of small catfish! It was cool to have a sauna in the room to relax close to the end of the day. I can't wait until I go there again!

Text: Loved the solitude of this wonderful retreat. The "Nest" is now at the top of our list of favorite places.  The innkeepers were attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  We settled in over a glass of wine, watching the deer come out of the woods, grazing right outside our window. Kicky!
De-stress and reconnect are the words that describe the wonderful peace and privacy we shared.  The comfortable cabin has a  kitchenette & hot tub. Our favorite was relaxing in front of the cozy fireplace with our favorite romantic music in the background. It was exactly what we needed to drive away the chaos that exists in the city.  A unique getaway... We'll be back!!!!

Text: My wife and I stayed at the Nest a few weeks ago, and had an awesome experience. We stayed in a cabin called the Starlight. It was so peaceful there, a great respite for people that live in a big city. The cabin has everything you need. Full kitchen, hot tub, amazing bed, fireplace/stove and a private deck with a grill. Definitely recommend this place for a romantic and unplugged getaway!

Text: Emailed the owner to ask a question about staying for one night instead of two. Apparently that's a big problem, all she said was sorry, noooooooooooo. Literally that many o's, like she was addressing a child. 

I asked an innocent question and was planning on staying the two nights if one wasn't an option, but why would I want to stay with someone who was so incredibly rude? So forget it, I'll go elsewhere.
