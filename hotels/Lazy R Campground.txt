Lazy R Campground

Text: First, I want to say that there are not frills here. The pool is a bit small and it can be tight to get your camper into the pull through spots. We have been coming to this campground for about 4 years now to an event in August at Eldora. For us, the location is perfect as it is maybe 20 min to Eldora. This is literally our favorite camping trip every year. The pond is well stocked and close enough that our boys can go and fish and come back to the camper when they are finished. It's a safe place and the people are very friendly. There are many permanent residents here, so that was different to us initially, but they are super friendly and honestly, it makes the campground feel very secure. If you're into geocaching, there are a TON on the paved walking trail. There is a small playground, a small pool, the walking trail, well-stocked pond and all (I believe) of the sites are full hook-ups. It's a short drive to the grocery/gas station. I think it's a great base camp to do other things.

Text: First time here. Its a nice quiet place for family. It definitely could use a new bathroom/ shower house and playground but other than that its nice. Will be back for sure !
