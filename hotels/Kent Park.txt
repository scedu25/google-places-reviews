Kent Park

Text: The park is lovely with campsites nicely spaced. Wildflowers bordered our campsite and I was able to watch and photograph hummingbirds, butterflies, and sunflowers. 

Their are numerous hiking trails that are wide and easily walked. I liked seeing the various old metal bridges that have been restored from other locations.

The only reason I gave it four stars at this time is that they are in the process of dredging the lake this winter, so it was dry. It will be perfect after project is done and their is water in the lake again.

Text: This is a great place for camping and hiking. There are several pull through spots for camping and you don't feel like you're in a parking lot.  The camp hosts were very friendly and greeted us as we entered.  The bathroom was kept clean.  Only one shower house,  but plenty of "long-drops. "  The trails were plentiful too.  You can get off the beaten path or take the flat paved trail around the lake.  (Drained for maintanace while we were there Sept. '17) There are a lot of benches along the paved path.  Great meadow land views.

Text: Used to  enjoy camping there  but the Rangers and campground host make it almost impossible to relax.  It's hard to enjoy the outdoors and friends when they are constantly stopping by and harassing you.  There's a reason why the campground empty.  It's a shame it took me a couple of weekends of abuse to realize it. I'll take my money elsewhere from now on!

Text: Huge park with secluded shelters. Not crowded at all. Go there with some time in hand and enjoy its natural beauty.

Text: Nice views but the lake has been drained for renovations and part of the road is closed so you can't even drive around the whole thing
