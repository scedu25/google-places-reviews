Text: You guys are truely disrespectful dirtbags , who are completely ignorant of the concept of costumer service. I also feel that if one decides to migrate to our great country and establish a business you should consider educating yourself on our native language and how to speak it. Matter of fact I think it should be a requirement your basically rude assholes who I can't understand and my room was filthy when I first came in.  Maybe show your customer some appreciation and let them access your Wi-Fi for free just a thought in my honest opinion

Text: Very old motel. Not very clean plus you have locals living here by the week that seem shady. Seems more like a homeless shelter with all the folks hanging around outside.

Text: I actualy would like to give this place 0 stars but its noy possible. Stained sheets, cigarettes burn holes on sheets and curtains. Housekeeper was a barefoot crackhead her husband helped her clean rooms, another crackhead.  Dirty carpets, found a live roach in bathroom. Never ever will this horrible place be an option for me. Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Totaly discusting place.

Text: A friend of mine was staying there, so I decided to drop them a visit. I was told stories about how a girl a few doors down was raped earlier that week. The cops showed up knocking on all the doors, looking for a suspect. Pretty sure most of the residents were on meth, but they could have just been zombies..
