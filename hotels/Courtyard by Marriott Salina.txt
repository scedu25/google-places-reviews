Courtyard by Marriott Salina
Rating: 5
Text: Room was clean and comfortable. It had plenty of amenites (Fridge, Microwave, iron, etc). The room was spacious and quiet. I was surprised how quiet the room was given that the hotel was right off the highway and my room was next to the vending machines. The only part of my stay that could have been any better was if the AC was a bit quieter and cooled a bit better - but it was sufficient to make my stay comfortable. Though I did not use them the laundry, pool and exercise facilities all looked nice.

Text: Easy to find off of highway. No complications in checking in or out. I thought the breakfast was very good. It was NOT included with price of room, but pricing and quality of preparation was comparable with any other breakfast place. My teenaged son used the exercise room. He felt the limited selection of weights were too small in size so workout was not satisfactory.

Text: Bistro and pool are nice features. Clean, updated rooms. Friendly staff. Good location near highway and food options. Floors creaky and sound travels between levels. At 9pm on a Friday night, we received a noise complaint from the room below just for walking around the room and talking which kind of ruined the stay.

Text: Very clean hotel. Had to switch rooms because I asked for a quiet room and was put next to the ice machine, the elevators, and probably the noisiest family I have ever heard. They were great about switching and even got a better room. the food at the bistro was great.

Text: The hotel was very nice and it was clean. I loved that there was a pull out couch in the room along with the 2 beds. I did not like that there was no free breakfast and the cafe was pretty pricey. The pool was a good size but it got deep really fast because of how small it is so it was hard to play with my young son in the pool without slipping because of how quick it gets deep. Other than that it was a good stay and I would stay there again.
