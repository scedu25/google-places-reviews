Text: Nice place to stay. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Would have liked a bar and a Continental breakfast. But the bistro in the lobby had a good selection of food for breakfast.

Text: Literally the only thing I don't like is how parking is setup. Its almost like you can't be close to where you want to be. But the hotel is wonderful. Ben there twice this year and love it each time.

Text: Room and hotel are very clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and easy to deal with. Spa is a little on the hot side. Very happy with my stay.

Text: It was a great experience and I'd highly recommend staying at this hotel. The hotel is full of amenities, pool, fire pit outside with a huge sitting area, elaborate lounge with a bar.  Beds are comfortable and the rooms are well maintained. The staff are professional and polite. The bathroom is roomy and not cramped. It's across the street from a college. After going out to eat on a Thursday night at a restaurant 15 minutes away I can say the city appears to have many restaurants and bars and it felt like a safe community.

Text: The hotel staff is very nice and accommodating. There are several quiet places to work in the lobby with free WiFi. They also have Starbucks and breakfast in the lobby until 9:00 am. Very clean and comfortable. Highly recommended.
