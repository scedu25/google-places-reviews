Crows Creek Park
Rating: 5
Text: I've only visited the southern section of this lake park, but it is a great park made specifically for weekend getaways and camping. There are many lots available for everything ranging from a small tent to large RVs, with amenities ranging from none on the lot, all the way up to water and power on the lot. Every branch has a community restroom with larger branches having their own shower and laundry facilities on site. Every lot has a place to build your own campfire, and the front gate sells firewood and ice. There are plenty of walking trails all around this lake, too.

Text: Peaceful trails around Smithville Lake. The cost is $8.00 per car but worth it for a beauitful picnic, horseback riding or wikdlife viewing. Today (3/30/16) there were lots of pelicans and cormorants on the lake. Thanks for keeping the park so clean!
