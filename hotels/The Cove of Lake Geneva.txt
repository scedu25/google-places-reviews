The Cove of Lake Geneva

Text: The room was nice, ours had a fridge, stove, microwave, and kitchen utensils and plates and cups. Room was clean, didn't smell funky or anything. Didn't notice any stains anywhere in the room, which I usually look for. Staff was great. Only thing that was a pain was I had to find a parking spot outside of the main entrance where the front desk was. Parked about 150 ft from the front door, went inside checked in then had to go back to the car and drive around the hotel to get to the closest entrance to our room. They should have some spots outside the main entrance for people checking in.  Other than that it was great. Would definitely go back.

Text: My friends and I had such a great getaway. The hotel staff was friendly, the pool was awesome, the location was perfect. I read plenty of Google reviews before booking our room. I read a lot of positive reviews regarding Room 234, so I requested that room. Reviews were spot on, the room was amazing for myself and three friends. It was completely updated, clean and had a great view, way better than we expected. We are planning an October getaway, we are staying at The Cove and definitely requesting Room 234 again.

Text: Attended a conference. Coffee, tea and water served throughout the day. Facility was clean. Wish there had been better signage for where the conference rooms were located. Of the multifloor conference facility there were only restrooms on the first floor. Rooms were either hot or cold, no in between. Staff was friendly. Beautiful location with a lot to do in the area.

Text: The resort is beautiful. It has a restaurant attached to it which is convenient. Many shops are within walking distance. If you stay here make sure your room is not close to the elevators. My one complaint is that people do not respect the quiet hours that begin at 11pm.

Text: The suite was a bit pricey however very large. The room was very clean although a tad bit dated. The pool area was very nice and not overly crowded. The fitness gym was somewhat lacking but had enough for me to get through most of my workout. Parking was a bit difficult but it was an extremely busy weekend and I was able to park eventually. All in all it was a very good experience and I would recommend it
