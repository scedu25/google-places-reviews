Text: Wonderful!!! Photos do NOT even come close to doing this property justice. It's beautiful, peaceful, large and comfortable. Owners are so accommodating and welcoming. We were traveling on last minute arrangements due to a family member passing. They accommodated my family and my special needs son. Highly recommended!
