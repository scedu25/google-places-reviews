Text: The room was clean and everything was impeccable upon arrival. The breakfast was great, with the ability to make fresh waffles with all the sides and pastries, there is always coffee and hot chocolate available in the lobby which is one of the best parts of Hampton Inn. The only frustration was one of the front desk workers gave misinformation about the availability of a suite for a stay extension which could have affected our plans if we did not instead check the Hilton website and book with them. She also shared personal unnecessary inappropriate information and was unprofessional. The rest of the staff was pleasant and helpful.

Text: My husband and I stayed there two nights while we hiked Starved Rock for our anniversary. We loved the room and the hot tub!! The service was good. The breakfast was OK for my husband. I am gluten intolerant, so there was very little for me to choose from. There was only one gluten-free cereal, but since I am also allergic to dairy, I ate the rice crispies dry. It would be nice to see more options that are gluten and dairy free since these allergies are more common than they used to be. But in all, we had a fabulous trip and loved our stay at the Hampton!!!

Text: I stayed here a night for business. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I had to leave for my job site before the breakfast officially started, but the staff member allowed me to take some food to go. Great quality hotel and worth the money.
