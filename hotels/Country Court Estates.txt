Text: Scenic wooded.  I've lived here 10 years & used to love it until the community was sold & had new management. I'll update as needed...UPDATE: The new management isn't nearly as good as the old. The neighborhood is beginning to decline. Very sad. ? There are no rules presented to new residents and the old rules are not enforced. The streets are now lined w weeds and trash and yards are cluttered and littered. The new corporation has invested $0 in the aging infrastructure. There are now numerous large dogs and homes w more than 2 vehicles. Very very sad? I'm making plans to move to Glenridge Manor.
