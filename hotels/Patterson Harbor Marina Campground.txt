Patterson Harbor Marina Campground
Rating: 3
Text: Bar doesn't follow posted hours. No reservations in the campground but most spots are yearly rentals it seems and any open spots have cars parked in them for days at a time from people holding spaces for friends.  I watched this happen for a week and a half straight. Showers are all hot water and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper. People driving like jackasses. No ATVs allowed out here but there are tons of jacked up golf carts with 12 year old kids driving them around. Makes no sense. During the week is better weekends suck.
