Hotel at WaterWalk
Rating: 5
Text: The room was great! Well furnished and very comfortable. They have the best complimentary breakfast I've had at a hotel in a long time, complete with made to order egg dishes and french toast, or buffet style of you don't want to wait. They also have a shuttle that you can schedule and take around the city which was very helpful. The driver was slightly rude when trying to wrangle our large group, but to be fair we were running 2 or 3 minutes late. Staff was very friendly otherwise. Also the toilet made weird noises when flushed, but obviously that doesn't detract a star.

Text: I've stayed at the hotel at WaterWalk several times and each time it is a pleasant experience. The rooms are homey and clean and the staff is always helpful. The free shuttle service is a HUGE help when you want to go to go out to restaurants out bars near Old Town or far from it. The price is very reasonable for quick to day visits or for week long stays. I highly recommend

Text: We had a wonderful stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The shuttle was a wonderful benefit as a very nice person drove us to dinner, picked us up and dropped us off and picked us up for concert. Breakfast eggs, pancakes and waffles cooked to order. Will definitely go back.
