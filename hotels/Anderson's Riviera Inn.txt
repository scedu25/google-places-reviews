Text: The best hidden gem... we will certainly return! Clean, quiet, great food nearby, casino, on the river with a view, on a golf course and the owners are THE BEST!! Great price..

Text: Beautiful, secluded, quiet & cozy... honestly I couldn't say enough good things about this place. Stayed all weekend and between the Inn, the casino and the bar Gary recommended, we didn't even leave the road it was on. We'll definetly be back one day.
