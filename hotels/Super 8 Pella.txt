Super 8 Pella
Rating: 4
Text: Very pleased with the accommodations. Business in the area gave me need for a simple, affordable place to stay. This fit the need perfectly. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Requested late checkout on last day and it was fine with them. Fresh cookies on the counter a bonus! Clean and comfortable bed!

Text: Recently renovated and it shows.  Clean room, bright, new furnishing, bed bug free, and very comfortable bed.  Receptionist is friendly and outgoing.  The location is in the middle of a small town and gas stations do not offer premium gas so if you drive a vehicle that requires it, make sure it's filled up before arriving to Pella.

Text: The pet friendly room we stayed in was very large with the king bed we requested but also a gueen bed, desk recliner, frig and microwave. The sound proofing, however, was not great; every step from the room above could be heard and the stairway noise resounded through the room. So, if you have a more nervous pet you may have a poor to sleepless night. Still beats paying over $100 dollars for a pet room with 2 queen beds at Holiday Inn Express and then a non-refundable pet fee of $50!

Text: I have stayed at this motel for several weeks now the rooms are clean and the people are very friendly. Vicky is the manager there at this motel and she is very helpful and will accommodate you in any way that she can. Also Vicky and her daughter who works as a housekeeper here bakes  cookies for everyone every evening. Great place to stay and I would stay here again if I was in the area.
