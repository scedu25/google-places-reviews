The Hotel SYNC

Text: Nice hotel. Under renovation. Eco- Friendly concept. Employees very nice. No breakfast, but nice fresh coffee bar. Some fixtures already need repair or replacement. Overall a nice change of pace over ordinary run of the mill hotels
Same price point as Hampton, Holiday Inn Express, but a suite with full kitchen.

Text: The hotel exceeded my expectations It's eco friendly. I stayed in the king bed room. It was amazing. The size of an apartment with a full kitchen, dishes, living area with sofa and tv, separate room, very clean linen, and bathroom. The shower was heaven, a rain shower. The owner of the hotel checked us it. He was very kind and helpful. Every visitor gets give a welcome snack box! In the morning free coffee/espresso bar. It can be brought to room if requested. There is a pool table and washer/dryer. There is a accessible computer with free printing. The only negative things I can say is that the beds were firm and no carpet on floor. Which is intentional I believer...being eco friendly. 
I'd stay again!

Text: Loved this boutique hotel. We loved the cleanliness of the rooms. The shower was wonderful! Our favorite part was the morning coffee bar. Not sure who he was, but the gentleman who made our coffee was AMAZING!!!!! We would definitely stay here again!
