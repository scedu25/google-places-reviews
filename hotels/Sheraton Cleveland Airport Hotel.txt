Sheraton Cleveland Airport Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Overall very good experience. The restaurant was good, all service (front desk, wait staff, airport shuttle) was friendly and excellent, 24 hour cafe/shop was nice. However, docking a star because I found a stray Tylenol caplet just under the corner of one of the beds. I'm glad that my 2 year old didn't find it first and that it wasn't a more dangerous substance. Still, the room should have been more thoroughly vacuumed. Everything else was great.

Text: Great place to get away from it all for a weekend. Staff is very confidential and the room service is such a delight. I've stayed multiple times over the past few months and each time is better than the last. I have taken many more "vacations" lately and am loving it.

Text: The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Check in was quick and very imformative about what the hotel offered. Room was spacious, beds were comfortable and was an overall great experience. Only drawback was the airport shuttle did not drop us off at the ticketing level. They went to the pick up slot and forced a long walk with heavy bags. Over all good experience. Management needs to look into the drop off locale being changed, as the walk was difficult with multiple heavy bags

Text: Great staff, pleasant bar with cozy restaurant. Older hotel. SPG lounge is average at best, and not likely on par since this hotel didn't seem full or close to being at capacity. However it's very convenient and accessible, with transport options to city.

Text: I was only there for about 6 hours, getting in late and waking early for a 6AM flight. We didn't have to set up a shuttle at all, but there was one waiting (though the airport is close enough to walk in a few minutes even without the shuttle). They had a bed, comfy pillows, and soap in the shower. What else does one need?
