Text: Disappointing experience in the Jen's room. Very small dormer room that we couldn't stand upright in, kept hitting our head on the ceiling. TV mounted to wall was very small,  maybe 19". Breakfast was mediocre, no choice's, you got what they decided to make, portions small. House is very old and had a strong musty odor. The owner was not exactly friendly and she took offense when we suggested she move the bed so guests could sit up in bed. And the bed...OMG squeaked whenever you moved!
