Text: There we were... driving into the night, along I-70, when our eyelids got heavy. We called and booked the room only minutes away and when we got there, we were completely delighted! It's wicked nice and sparkling clean here! The service is fantastic and breakfast is free and plentiful!

Text: Very nice place to stay at when passing through the high plains. They put in an air freshener in the entrance foyer, so when you enter the first set of doors, you are greeted with an aroma of a nice bouquet of flowers. Nice touch!

Text: We checked in later in the evening. Front desk clerk was nice but made many computer errors and was struggling to check us in. She ended up running my card without my swipe and sign and then pointed out she would be in trouble by management for doing so. Got to the room, it was clean. T.V. did not work. Woke up to go eat breakfast before finishing our long drive. I was told it started at 6:30. It is now 7:05 and we are leaving with eating only cold breakfast. Not impressed that I paid full price for multiple services that I did not recieve. Have stayed with this chain of hotels numerous time with stellar service. This was not one of those times.

Text: As with any holiday inn. The service and place were excellent. The room was nice and clean and the breakfast was great. There were a lot of families and the staff did a great job of feeding everyone. Highly recommend this hotel.

Text: We did not have a reservation and the staff helped us get the best price available. The rooms was very clean. The hot breakfast was above average and was great place to start the day.  It was worth every penny.
