Text: Nice campground for tents and RVs
Rating: 4
Text: Quiet, out-of-the way campground. Good RV sites for a national forest campground. There's a trail around the lake for hiking and mountain biking. A little overgrown and can get flooded. Didn't enjoy it as a mountain bike ride. Might be okay to hike. No real services in the area. You need to drive south to Tell City for amenities.
