Holiday Inn Express & Suites South Haven
Rating: 5
Text: Great place to stay when you need a place not far from the lake shore.  An easy drive to the beaches or downtown South Haven.  Plus it's next door to one of Michigan's best ice cream parlors Sherman's.  A quiet place to stay with a friendly and helpful staff.

Text: The staff was wonderful. The free breakfast had a very good selection that was constantly being refreshed! Great location to downtown without having to pay that downtown price! My only negative, and it could be considered me being 'nit-picky', I feel the shower/tub could be re-caulked because it didn't make it look great or the cleanest it could be, of course, it was something the husband never noticed. Overall, I would stay here again!

Text: Older hotel. Weird stains on the curtains and a couple on the wall. Typical continental breakfast, nothing special. Indoor pool with no hot tub. Staff was friendly but seems to be very busy working multiple roles (i.e. the front lady who checked us in was also cleaning rooms). Other weird items like the storage closet on one of the floors was wide open with the lights on all three days we were there. Price was $235 per night which included a company discount...this is SO incredibly overpriced for what was given. I would see what else is available before staying here.

Text: Older hotel and rooms, but very nice. Quite. Nice bathroom and comfortable bed. Had a nice jacuzzi in our room. A bit overpriced. Overall a nice hotel.
