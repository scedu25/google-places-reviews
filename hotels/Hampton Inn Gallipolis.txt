Hampton Inn Gallipolis

Text: We were warmly greeted by the receptionist. Our room had been reserved ahead of our arrival. The inn was quiet overnight and we got a good night's rest.

Breakfast was good. Staff attendant was friendly and kept area very clean and fresh.

Thank you for a pleasant stay.

Text: Really pleasant stay. People were very nice, rooms/facilities were very nice. Breakfast had a lot of good options but looked better than it tasted. Overall I'd recommend staying here and would again if I pass that way.

Text: The room was fine; however, the staff weren't helpful. They definitely weren't up to the normal Hampton Inn standards. This is my hotel of choice when I travel. Although, if all were like this, it most certainly would not be. 

The wife and I agreed that the water tasted horrible, and the muffins tasted like windex. I suppose the container was cleaned while the muffins were still inside ?

Text: Good stay. Wish they would have given me more shampoo and conditioner on multiple day stay. Pool was beautiful. Check out the mothman museum if in town!
