Country Club Apartments

Text: Ignore the management comment because I notified the golf course the same day.  Ignore the remarks about alternative parking because I parked on the north side of the 6100 building and got my other car hit again today.  They don't care, their lease releases them of any liability of any damage of any of your property.  Car sustained golf ball damage from the neighboring golf course.  I was told when I moved in that the golf course would handle damages from errant golf balls.  I walked over to the course the very weekend damage occurred and they refused to anything about it and their GM even laughed at the situation.  I sued the golf course and the small claims court ruled in their favor.  Country Club Apartments didn't take any action to remedy the situation either.  I wish I knew at the time that both parties didn't have any integrity between them to correct the damages they're responsible for so I could properly risk assess the situation.  I believed the apartment complex representatives that errant golf ball damage would be taken care and I didn't make the appropriate decisions regarding my vehicle's comprehensive coverage and deductible.  So because of that I'm responsible for $698 in damages to my vehicle.  If you like being told lies and sustaining damage to your automobiles, this is your place.  Look at the satellite pictures, there is no where to park near the first two buildings that would be out of line of the fairway.

Text: Beware of parking, golf balls dented up my car when visiting a friend... management was unresponsive.  No signs warning about golf balls.

Text: Our family moved from Sydney Australia to US at the end of 2014. We lived at Country Club Apartments for over a year. 

This is a great place! Nice & always helpful staff - they helped make things a lot easier for us. 

The monthly events hosted by the rental office were great, which helped us to get to know the neighbors.

We would highly recommend Country Club Apartments if you are looking for a HOME in Huntington area.

Text: I've had a fantastic experience here. There were no tricks in signing the lease, the grounds are always neatly kept, and the apartments themselves are in excellent shape. The monthly newsletter is a great way to know what's happening around the complex and I love the group email which allows you to sell or buy items from fellow residents. I've had a great stay so far at Country Club and know I will continue to enjoy living here!

Text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I moved to Huntington, WV but I am really glad to have picked Country Club Apartments as my residence during my time here. The staffs are super friendly and welcoming, I can come to them with any questions or concerns and they address it within 24 hours. The maintenance team is wonderful too! They pretty much respond within 24 hours as well to online submitted requests, and there is a designated number for emergencies for after hours. Very happy we chose this apartment.
