Illinois Beach Resort & Conference Center

Text: Stayed only one night as a stop over to purchase an RV to drive back to Fort Lauderdale.
The bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows. The room was very clean, and while dated, it was free of dust and odors. 
The bathroom was clean and no leaks.
I would stay here again. The hotel sits on the lake and there was a beautiful sunrise and moon set!

Text: Came to attend an early September wedding. The location is gorgeous - but a bit remote/quiet. The rooms were adequate - nothing special but clean and updated. 
The resort is right on the lake, nearby walking trails which was very nice and convenient, as we had some time to waste before wedding festivities began.

Text: The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. The room was very clean, updated, and comfortable. The beautiful and peaceful location made us feel like we had stumbled upon a secret beach. We can't wait to come back!

Text: Nice hotel, set off from the main area of town directly next to the beach. Friendly staff, and clean rooms. Shower was a little short for a tall person, and they need to improve their Internet. The wireless was so bad, it was unusable. Good place to stay with kids on a summer holiday.

Text: Seems pretty nice, but the bar was closed because of a wedding that night. Pretty cool to have a restaurant so close to a campground though.
