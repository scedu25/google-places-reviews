Text: Came for a wedding. Don’t let the old grimy outside deceive you. The inside is newly renovated. The wedding was lovely. And the rooms were relatively comfortable. Bathrooms in rooms are small. But otherwise a great experience!

Text: Love this hotel. It's in close proximity to stores and other attractions such as the Chicago Gardens and just 15/20 minutes to the lake front. The people were very nice and the hotel itself was clean and beautiful. I love the library area as well as the pool. It also helps that this hotel has a Ruth's Chris steakhouse attached to it.

Text: Classic hotel with top notch staff and service. Great that it is connected to a Ruth Chris steakhouse house. Many good restaurants nearby as well. Would stay here again.

Text: Between the free parking and most reasonably priced bar menu, this hotel has it all. Club lounge is great, amenities at the front desk/lobby are consistent with a higher category of hotel, staff are nice and helpful, and their room capacity is unmatched. Great hotel.

Text: The room was fine, but there were a couple quirks. For one, there were bottles of water in the room that appeared to be complimentary, until you read the fine print that they would be $3.75 added to your bill each. The vending machine down the hall had water at half that price, but it didn't work. Additionally, I had to visit the front desk to get toothpaste, and rather than give it to me, they had it delivered to my room 5 minutes later. Strange and inconvenient. The room was fine, though.
