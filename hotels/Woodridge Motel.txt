Woodridge Motel

Text: This place is fine and relatively clean. However, i guess non-smoking rooms were made non-smoking not that long ago, and without any renovation. Unfortunately, room still smells of smoke, and there are literally holes in comforters. It needs new bedding, new carpeting and paint job to get rid of that smoke smell.

Text: Manager was a funny guy. Rooms were nice but were only secured by a standard door lock; no deadbolt, etc. Beds were clean and comfortable.

Text: I wish they had a pool or hot tub, but the room was nice, clean, and the bed was comfortable. Nice motel for the price. Very nice staff.

Text: Room stank. Bed had stains on it. Pillows where yellow not white. Blanket had burn hole from cigarette in it. For a none smoking place. Took forever to get anyone to answer the bell at 0100. Would not recommend it to anyone.

Text: Very dissapointed. Cockroaches, bed bugs,  beds was made but sheets and comforter was dirty. Had TV but only half the screen worked. Workers for the hotel stayed in room by mine and was fighting  all night long.  Was offered nothing to make it right. Just told damn we just treated those rooms yesterday. No money back. No other room offered when brought  to their attention. Will not ever recommend this hotel  to anyone
