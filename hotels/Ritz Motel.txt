Text: Stay away. We had reservations that they refused to honor. Doubled the price reserved if we wanted to stay. Claimed their computer was down and didn’t get our reservation. Funny that our reservation was written out hanging on their calendar. When my wife pointed this out the “manager” claimed it was reserved wrong. It’s the owners faults. 
Whatever you do stay away.

Text: I wish they had a spot for no stars!? We used to stay there for our boys ball tournaments and it wasn't that great then. Went up there a couple weeks ago with some friends and it was better back then than it is now. We got two rooms and got there about 5:30 changed clothes and was out of there to eat dinner. Got back about 10 we were all in one room hanging out never even touched any of the beds saw 4 roaches and killed them all then our friends went to their room and killed 2 roaches. We saw that many of them within 45 min. We said we are out of here told management and they said the owner would get a hold of us for refund never heard from him and all we asked for was some of the money back we had to drive an hour and 45 minutes to get back home! We left at 10:45 Don't go there not good customer service make sure you look at the pics!!
