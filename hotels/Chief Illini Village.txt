Text: There is a lazy, self centered, narcissistic gay man living here that sued the previous management company, so he could live fat and fancy with out ever working. THAT drive the cost of ALL tenants lot rent through the roof. It would be a much nicer place to live, if ignorant people like that didn't continue to screw it over for their own personal ego trip and laziness.
