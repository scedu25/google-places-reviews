Text: Reviews of this hotel were horrible and I was nervous about staying here but budget forced me too. I have to say it was an excellent stay!. It was no Hilton or Hyatt or whatever high end you can think of but I feel it was a great value and the employees were the best at customer service. We never had any issues and stayed for 4 nights. I am so glad I didn't pay attention to the negative comments. I am allergic to smoke and I never could smell anything like it. The room was quiet, clean, and the bathtub even had jets in it for a good relaxing bath. I highly recommend staying here. Even if budget isn't an issue. When I come back, I will.

Text: A good hotel for a low budget price.  I've stayed here twice, a year apart.  I think they have remodeled some.  Beds were nice, bathrooms okay.  Breakfast is free.  The sausage is okay.  Biscuits and gravy is better, waffles are pretty good.  Stay away from the eggs, both scrambled and boiled.  They are inedible.  Staff is friendly.   The noise from the bar and grill next door gets loud some nights. Most of the hotel guests seem to be men who travel for working jobs.   If you need a basic room at a budget price, stay here.  Don't expect frills.  Don't eat the eggs.

Text: Great rooms, surrounding area looks a little rundown but the area was actually quite safe and conveniently located near some decent stores and restaurants. The only thing holding this place is 1 incredibly rude front desk lady. You'll know her when you see her and EVERY SINGLE request or question is greeted with an exaggerated sigh. She seriously treated me like I ruined her day by checking into a room already paid for and reserved by my boss. Aside from her I enjoyed my stay here quite much ha ha

Text: I MADE THIS RESERVATION 31/2 MONTHS IN ADVANCE.WAS MADE TO WAIT 4 HOURS BEFORE WE GOT OUR KEY. DUE TO FAMILY OBLIGATIONS, [MOTHERS FUNERAL]  WE DID NOT GET INTO OUR ROOM UNTIL LATE. WAS EXCITED TO SEE A JETTED TUB UNTIL I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT TUB, THE JETS WERE LITERATELY DRIPPING WITH BLACK MOLD, THE TOILET HAD FECES IN IT AND THE SINK HAD HAIR AND JUNK IN IT, THE FLOOR HAD NOT BEEN MOPPED IN WEEKS AT LEAST, THE CRISPER TRAY IN THE FRIDGE HAD DIRTY SOAPY WATER IN IT. THE WHOLE ROOM SMELLED LIKE MOLD AND WETNESS. THE NEXT MORNING THEY CHANGED US TO A DIFFERENT ROOM .THE NEW ROOM WAS CLEANER BUT THE SHEETS HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED. AGAIN DUE TO MY HUSBANDS MOTHER'S FUNERAL WE COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE BED TO BE CHANGED, HAD THEM GIVE ME SHEETS AND I CHANGED THEM WHEN WE GOT BACK. ON MONDAY WHEN THE MANAGER FINALLY SHOWED UP AND HOUR LATE, HER NAME WAS TANNIS AND SHE WAS RUDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE PICTURES I TOOK OF THE ROOM. REFUSED TO GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK FOR THE WHOLE STAY. THE COPS WERE CALLED TO THE HOTEL 4 TIMES WHILE WE WERE THERE AND MONDAY MORNING WE WERE WOKE UP TO THE SOUNDS OF THEIR CLEANING STAFF LOCKED IN A ROOM FIGHTING. THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE THAT WERE PROFESSIONAL AND NICE WERE THE NIGHT CLERKS, SABRINA AND JUSTICE.  THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. I USED TO BE HEAD OF HOUSEKEEPING OF A HOTEL BACK IN THE 80'S AND THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED ON MY WATCH!!

Text: Last time we stayed here they never cleaned the bathroom. It was disgusting from the previous people. I asked several times but they never came back to clean it. After a bad review last year, they apologized and said they hoped put next visit would be better. A year later, this time it was worse. I had to buy rubber gloves and bunch of bathroom cleaners. I cleaned the puke off the toilet and the floor, scrubbed the black ring out of the bathtub, and the toilet. We were there six nights, and they never changed the sheets!
