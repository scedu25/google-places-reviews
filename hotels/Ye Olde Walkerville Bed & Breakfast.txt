Ye Olde Walkerville Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Me and my husband absolutely love this place! Samanthas suite is the best room for your money.  Super cozy and you feel right at home and I feel like I could live in that jacuzzi tub :) 
We went there for my birthday and our first night being married together. 
Their breakfast is amazing as well lots of food.

Text: The owner was nice and the room comfortable, but I was given expired yogurt and moldy food for my to-go breakfast. I had to leave before the formal sit down breakfast, and the owner kindly offered to make me a grab and go bag for the morning. I was amazed by how accommodating she was! That said, I ended up tossing the food she left me because it was CLEARLY old, and I ended up at Tim Hortons buying my own breakfast. I am concerned for the other guests that were there. I hope they didn't eat the food!

Text: The facility is 3 stars as the house is quite old and squeaky, however it is clean and tidy. The service is 5 stars with personal touch. Good host.

Text: The room was typical suburban B&B style - cozy and comfortable with an ensuite bathroom with a shower, which was o.k. However, the breakfast was simply AMAZING. A three course meal was cooked and served warm just for two of us, and was super tasty. The owners were very kind, friendly and attentive throughout our stay.

Text: Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to experience this B&B. My experience was in attempting to make a reservation for my family of 6 which includes mom, dad, 3 boys (13, 13 and 10) and a toddler girl (18 months). Apparently, they don't do toddlers. That would have been fine had they said why. But instead they acted like it was my fault for even asking, as if to say, "How dare you even ask if you can stay here with a toddler? Get lost." Fine by me.
