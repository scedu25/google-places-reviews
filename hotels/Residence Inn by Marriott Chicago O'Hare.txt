Text: I was here due to a house fire for about two weeks.This place is great. Booked the two bedroom that had a fireplace. The breakfast was huge and free every morning. They even had a few evening dinners during my stay. The pool was clean. Room service was on point. Cleaned properly , sheets and towels given as often as needed. Felt like a little two bedroom apartment. Close to shopping and restaurants. Gazebo and tables to sit at by the pool. Bags on the walking path to clean up after your pets. Full kitchen with dishes and pots and pans. Laundry on site. Would recommend

Text: Very nice!  Clean, breakfast is done well every morning.  Housekeeping is good but they come around 4 pm when most people are home. I have had to send them away a couple of times already.  I think if i asked for a early clean they would accommodate though.  If you have to be away from home this is the place to do it.

Text: Very clean, very friendly, and very easy to walk across the parking lot to and from for concerts! The breakfast was tasty, the counters were kept clean and the food was replenished quicky. We will definitely stay again!!

Text: Rooms were very comfortable - the bed and pillows are terrific!  Every single staff person I encountered was very friendly - front desk, breakfast, housekeeping - everyone said good morning, have a good day, smiled, and just made us feel very comfortable.  If we had a question about getting around, or food, they didn't just answer the question, they arranged food delivery, printed metro maps, etc.  We had trouble finding seating for 4 one morning at breakfast; without us saying anything, a breakfast server said "are you looking for a place for 4?"...we said yes, and she said she would get us a table...she went to an adjacent conference room and came out a few minutes later and welcomed us to a table she had set up in that room - complete with a tablecloth on the conference table!  Totally unnecessary, but consistent with our interactions.  Went above and beyond with each interaction.  We would highly recommend this hotel!
