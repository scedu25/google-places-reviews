English Pines Bed and Breakfast

Text: Really nice place! The owners are very welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The house and property are beautiful. Breakfast was awesome!  Location is great because you are close to downtown but far enough away to still have peace and quiet. Price for the room is very reasonable. We would definitely go back!

Text: Very friendly staff! The room we stayed in was clean but it could have been a bit bigger. We have a 3 yr old child, and she was fine sleeping on the sofa sleeper. The breakfast was nice, but I just wish the boiled eggs were not cold. Downtown was walkable from there! Overall it was a nice place to stay!

Text: Stayed at this place. Had to share bathroom with another couple the owners put on the doors room 9 and 11only so I go to use bath room there's another guy in there I ask to get  I  the bath room and this guy starts to verbally insult me so when I get upset it's my fault. The people where  nice that owned it. If you put up signs that have rules they need to be followed to avoid this issue. Will not stay there  again

Text: This B&B reminds me a lot of the ones I visited in England several years ago. Beautiful building and grounds, lovely rooms, and the innkeeper are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious as well. We will be back next year, for sure!
