Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Bloomington-Airport
Rating: 4
Text: I was hear for a user conference (as a vendor representative) and stayed overnight 2 nights. The location was convenient and the accommodations were more than I needed, but very nice. The meeting rooms were above average. I'll also add that the hotel restaurant (Baxter's) was excellent, as was the bar. I would definitely be happy to stay there again and to host a work event there.

Text: Room and bathroom were clean. Loved the tile floor. More used to carpet, but the tile was a nice change. Only problem with tile is you hear the people above you walking around. The hot water was extremely hot so guests need to be careful not to get scalded. Front desk was friendly and quick. The free bottles of water they give you is a nice touch. Overall we were satisfied with our stay.

Text: Very clean hotel with nice modern rooms. We were upgraded to a king suite a IHG reward members which was a very nice surprise. The pool was clean and cool, hot tub was not quite hot enough but still nice. I just wish the breakfast was free like holiday inn Express... But still a great hotel.

Text: While at a family reunion we stayed here. Very clean and comfortable. We loved the breakfast (yes, you pay) offerings and the staff were so friendly and accomodating. We'll stay here again in a heartbeat.
