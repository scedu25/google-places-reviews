Hotel Fort Des Moines
Rating: 5
Text: I meet my parents in Des Moines every summer for the opera and we've stayed at the Hotel Fort Des Moines for the last four years.  If you like old world charm, this is the place to stay and they have a FABULOUS adjoining restaurant (Django).  I've stayed at most of the hotels in downtown Des Moines and this one is my favorite.  Sure, it could use some updating, but it's charming.  Pretend you arrived in your time machine and enjoy it for what it is.

Text: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!! You are better off sleeping outside. The air conditioning does NOT work at all. The staff downstairs will tell you that it's "working," but trust me: it is not working. If you like the idea of sleeping in a sauna: this hotel would be a great choice. 
We should have been told upon making reservations that the hotel room would be over 90 degrees and that we would have no control over the temperature of our room because there is only one very poor broken unit on the roof. 

Additionally, instead of claiming that this sweltering hot sticky room is "normal," the hotel should provide us a refund - but they are not. If we hadn't spent the last 10 hours driving and then an hour carrying up luggage: we would be leaving now. Instead, leaving first thing in the morning will have to do.

Text: Such a great location & historical experience! We enjoyed all of our stays here throughout the years while in Des Moines. I hear it's undergoing a complete renovation and I'm highly anticipating it's reopening.

Text: If I could give this hotel a negative rating I definitely would. We checked out mere minutes after checking in. We were (not) greeted by a very rude, and unprofessional staff. The hotel was dark, dingy, and dirty. We arrived to a rundown, sweltering hot room that had a window jammed open with a stick. We were then were informed, only after questioning, that the air conditioning did not work. Stay away from this place.

Text: Last year the place was great.  This year, showed up on Saturday for check in, the guy at the front desk was very short with us and seemed put out.  Got up to our 6th floor room and found out there was no AC.  The room must have been 100 degrees, no air movement, nothing, literally a sweat box.  The front desk never even mentioned it to us.  My group, along with many others, cancelled our rooms and found something else.  Not going back.
