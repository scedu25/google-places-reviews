Text: It's very quiet, clean inside & outside & the rooms are decorated very nice & the landscape is beautiful, the owner is a very nice lady, u can tell she takes pride in her motel, the rooms are small but like I said at the beginning they are very clean & nice,  a mini fridge, microwave & tv is in the rooms & a 1st stop gas station/convenient store is beside the motel, would I go back and stay again YES!!!!!!

Text: I was disappointed came to work in this town and could not even get a hold of this place to get a room. It was terrible. It is pitiful what customer service has became and hospitality in this town is zero.
