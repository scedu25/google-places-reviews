Text: This was the most disgusting place I have ever seen.. The roaches were so bad and the bed bugs were in competition there were live bugs and dead ones... It smelled really bad the bed had springs showing and the owner Jason he was rude as hell and the one worker Tonya has the rudest personality she has no heart... All I can say is karma will come to them... So much for southern people being ki d helpfully and nice.. I would never go to Kentucky again....

Text: Bedbugs,heavy drug activity ,fights,maitenence doesnt keep it up,office doesnt care.Its a rare day that the police arent there,they generally have to have several cars.Not safe for lone women,definately not kids.its very sad that paducah doesnt have a reasonable priced place for people escaping domestic violence and need a temporary place till they can get housing.

Text: Better places to stay for few dollars more.. No handicap parking. No breakfast. And bedbug hotel is the name it should be called. Drug problem is worst than bad.

Text: Went into a room, no blankets or pillow cases blood in the bathroom, door wouldn't lock, no hot water and room smelled like death. Said we had to pay more for cleaner rooms. Very bad neighborhood no place for kids. Among several other things, wouldn't recommend this place to the homeless.
