Sunset Terrace Rooms
Rating: 5
Text: Nice room. Very very comfortable bed. Free icemaker outside.  Wild turkey and deer right outside window. That being said this room would be half the price if it were not right next to mammoth cave.

Text: Wow - rooms are just right. Great view.  Perfect for those that aren't "campers" and need a room with heat/AC hot water and comfy beds. 
Walking distance to MCNP visitors center and cave tours.
Be sure to book your mammoth cave national park tours well in advance. We were fortunate to get in a few but we're surprised at how many were sold out for the week we were here.

Text: Family (anywhere from 8 to 20) makes exodus to MCNP every June, been doing so for 4 generations. Always stay at Sunset Terrace, rooms 317-319 at the far end by hiking trail because only people passing by are on hikes. Beds decent, A/C great, older looking bathrooms with vintage tile from floor 4 feet up the walls with nice tub/shower, folding card table and 2 extra chairs in closet of each room means picnicking in front of rooms with abundant table space and seating. Back wall of each room has bank of windows looking out into forest behind rooms, easily spot turkey and white tail every trip. Last year we were told there were going to be a lot of improvements and updates made by summer of 2016, will review again after the next trip. Rooms are not cheap ($110/night per room last three years) but your exposure to other tourists is greatly diminished, next to no sounds of vehicles or other people (except when guests check out in mornings or pass by heading to or from trails nearby).

Text: First off, the room is just like a motel room from the 1990's, so if you want really upscale, this isn't the place for you. However, it was clean, soap was provided, it had a nice view of the woods even though the windows did not open, and it was in walking distance of the hotel/restaurant building. It had an actual key instead of a card, another thing that was rustic. Also, when we woke up their were some wild turkey and deer right outside of the rooms, so close that you could see the number of spots and feathers on them. If you want to stay at Mammoth Cave, this is the place for you.

Text: We have been here 7 or 8 times,and always stay at the park. Its rustic, but worth it.
