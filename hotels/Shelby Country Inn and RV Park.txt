Text: This is not a campground. It works fine for an overnight stay.

For our needs this stop was perfect. We needed an easy drive through with 50amps that was level enough for us to stay hooked up for an easy launch in the AM. Didn't hook anything else up so I can't say anything about the rest of the full hookup. We always carry enough water to get through the night,  about 1/3rd tank. Easy on off of I-80. Sites were nothing special.

We're planning another stopover this August on our way back to Northern Illinois.

Text: We stopped here each way to and from Chicago and CO. It's bare bones but it's clean, inexpensive and easy on and off I80 for just an overnight stay. Electric, water and sewer. If you say you saw their ad you get 10 or 15% off. It might have even been 20%. It was very quiet. Large green space for walking the dogs. Two restaurants and two gas stations you can easily walk to. All sites are pull though.
