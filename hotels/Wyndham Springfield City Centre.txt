Text: Great downtown location fantastic for hosting am event. Affordable dining off the lobby and upscale options in the penthouse level. The large room was comfortable and surprisingly a great value.

Text: Place seems to be going downhill. Rooms are pretty outdated and on top of that it wasn't that clean. Prepared meals for a conference we're not very good either.

Text: Fairly nice hotel. Staff is courteous and friendly. Layout of guest rooms in circular building makes for extremely narrow hallways. So narrow in fact that a housekeeping cart completely blocks the hallway. Vending machines are far and few between, and then you are lucky if they work and don't steal your money. Rooms are clean and comfortable, although there is no refrigerator or microwave for convenience. The parking garage was undergoing construction and renovation so parking was a giant pain (although it didn't stop them from charging their full $7 a day rate). This was my second stay here but it will probably be my last.
