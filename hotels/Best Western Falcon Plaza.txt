Best Western Falcon Plaza

Text: Friendly staff and nice updated rooms!! We stayed on the top floor, and it was very quiet. The breakfast was well stocked and fresh with a good assortment of items, and they had cookies and coffee in the lobby all day and night. There was a refrigerator and a coffee maker in the room as well. They have an area with a couple of computers and printers for guests—that came in handy for printing a boarding pass. Everyone was very helpful and pleasant, and I will definitely be staying there again.

Text: Building, grounds, and rooms were all well maintained and clean. Beds were comfortable and cable channels plentiful if a little heavy on sports. The complimentary breakfast was also very good. The bacon was perfectly well done. My only criticisms are that the bathroom was too small with little clearance between toilet and door, and the cleanup crew is so efficient that you feel like you're getting the bums rush to clear out. Far more affordable than other area options, though.

Text: The hotel is well maintain and very clean.   The entire service staff was very professional and extremely attentive to any needs we had.  The location is near many fast food and family restaurants.  They allow pets and they have nice area to walk the dogs.  Great place to spend a night or several nights.

Text: Anita, who prepares the breakfast bar,  goes above and beyond her job!  She takes such pride in her job and is so friendly and kind to her guests!  Clark McEwen, the guest service manager, is so knowledgeable about the hotel and the entire area of Bowling Green, Ohio.  Both of these employees are such positive representatives of Best Western!  This hotel was so clean and beautifully decorated!  Housekeeping takes such pride in keeping their hotel clean and presentable!  I will definitely chose Best Western again when I'm in Bowling Green, Ohio!

Text: I've stayed here twice recently, and both times I was very happy with the stay. Both rooms I stayed in were clean and well kept. One of the cleaner feeling hotels/motels I've stayed in over the past few years. I've stayed at much more expensive hotels that were in worse shape than this Best Western.

Parts of the motel/hotel have recently been remodeled. The lobby and breakfast area are nice and have a very comfortable feel. There is a small sitting area off of the lobby that has coffee and tea throughout the day, as well as a guest computer. Though, personally, I've never used any hotel/motel computer; I just don't trust them. 

If I'm ever in the Bowling Green area again, I'll definitely keep this BW at the top my list of possible places to stay.
