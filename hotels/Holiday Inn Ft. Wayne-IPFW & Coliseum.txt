Text: Amenities were nice and all facilities that we used were clean. We had dessert and breakfast at the in-house restaurant. Staff was awesome, especially Desta. She did a phenomenal job at the restaurant making sure all was perfect! Beds were a little on the soft side and on the small side as well. Didn't seem like queen size. We will stay here again.

Text: Recently attended a wedding reception held here, and stayed two nights in the hotel.  We had a blast.  Everything was well done and beautiful.  The staff was professional and very attentive.  Highly recommend this location for an event or for a nice place to stay when visiting Ft. Wayne.

Text: Top notch friendly service from all of the staff. The food is pretty good at the restaurant too! The rooms are a bit small but the beds are comfy. The location is within 1 to 10 minutes of everything! There is even trails nearby if you like walking, running or biking!

Text: Rooms are comfy and clean.  A little bit higher prices than I normally stay at.  Love having the restaurant and bar on the first floor when I get back to the hotel late.

Text: Location was great! Right next to Johnny Appleseed park and the greenway bike trails. The room was clean and tidy. The check in staff was friendly and attentive. There is no free breakfast included here, but I don't feel that it is required as there are many restaurants nearby.
