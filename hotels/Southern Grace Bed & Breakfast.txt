Southern Grace Bed & Breakfast

Text: The accommodations and staff were amazing!!! My wife and I planned our wedding with Theresa (the owner) and the experience could not have been more enjoyable. Everything was coordinated perfectly and we were treated like family. I think it's important for someone in the hospitality business to love what they do and I can tell you that Theresa and her husband (who was our chef for the occasion) are two people who do just that. I would recommend them to everyone I know. My wife and I plan to revisit every year on our anniversary.

Text: A wonderful experience with my family for a quaint little vacation.  Plenty of little animals to enjoy a wonderful fishing spot of which I caught two large mouth Bass in a very loving owner and stuff.  The house was built by the owner son several years ago and shows and very unique work! Lovely swimming pool and beautiful rooms . And experience to never forget.

Text: From the website and all of the pictures I have seen, it’s a beautiful place. I was really excited for my partner and I to have our wedding ceremony there, until I found out they don’t allow same sex couples. I emailed them and asked, but there was no response to my email, so I called and was told by Theresa that they do not hold same sex marriage ceremonies. Disappointing and a little sad. Regardless of personnel beliefs, when you are a business owner, you should try to be a little more open minded when it comes to your business

Text: I've never stayed at Southern Bed & Breakfast, but I love next door.  We have a relatively quite neighborhood. Our location is close enough to the city so you can find things to do, but far enough from the city that we don't have the crime, traffic, and other issues.  The folks that own Southern Grace are great. I've never heard anyone leave angry.

Text: Southern Grace Bed and Breakfast is simply amazing. Teresa & David are two of the sweetest people you will ever meet. This place is the best for a small wedding as every detail is taken care of. All you need is your wedding attire. They have the rest. Thanks for everything you made our special day very special!
