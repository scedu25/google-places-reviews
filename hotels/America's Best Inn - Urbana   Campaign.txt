Text: Location was great for the conference I went to. The guy working behind the counter that checked me in was incredibly nice! The room was okay but felt like I had to check on my vehicle often though nothing happened. Shower head was low on me...even though I am 5'8". Ending up hitting my neck it was so low. I loved that there was a gas station on one side of the street and KFC on the other. Price was great and overall not too bad. Pretty basic room of course. I didnt use anything else while there.

Text: I guess you get what you pay for. The rooms were clean but fixtures were old so the shower was very difficult to operate and there was no hot water. Very small pillows on a large king size bed is not good for the neck. Staff was very nice. Fridge was not working and was not plugged in or cleaned. The price was so low that you easily tell cost cutting is a major deal here. Bring your own toiletries. I would recommend this place only if you need a quick stop for sleep.

Text: Sorry this was for a very short visit a year ago. I remember liking the rooms well enough, nothing special nor anything outstanding, but definitely worth the price.
