Hampton Inn Auburn
Rating: 5
Text: Awesome hotel just off I 69! Great, spacious rooms with fridge and microwave, and great breakfast s. A lot of amenities like a fitness center and a pool! Great place to stay the night while in Auburn or when you need to get off the road for the night. Also quite near a movie theater and restaurants.

Text: The room was excellent, couldn't ask for any better! What sold me was the location. I feel it should be mentioned that right across the street (walking distance) you have a movie theater, restaurants and also a wonderful ice cream shop. Will be staying here again!

Text: Nice and fairly new. It is in a new business park right off of I69. Close to your typical chain restaurants. Basic pool and hot tub indoors. Room smelled of either Cedar Oil or Patchouli. Nice. Now the bad. Room above me could be clearly heard. I was on the interstate side, very noisy all freaking night. No tub in the room. Shower only. Not a handicapped room. Rooms are kinda small. Not asian room small, but still kinda small. Poor layout of room. Wasn't greeted as a Diamond member at check in. The breakfast is the lower end of Hampton Inn breakfast. Not the worse I have seen, but not the best either. This property is definitely a "commuter" property and not a "destination" property. But it was a place to lay my head, no matter how much the interstate kept waking me up.

Text: Nice, newer clean hotel.  Nice touches of comfort an convenience in the lobby, computer room, pool and workout room.  Nice big fridge plus a microwave, a nice desk and an above average flat screen in the room.  Beds were very comfortable and breakfast was usual good Hampton fare.

Text: Nice hotel. Hamptons usually are. Plenty of restaurants close. No complaints.
