Cobblestone Inn and Suites

Text: Have stayed here three times in the past two years.  It was brand new when I stayed in 2015 so reviews that say it needs remodeling are full of it. Pleasant, had no issues, staff was helpful, comfortable room. An older woman traveling alone I felt safe.  It is  not fancy but what I expected for the money and I plan to stay there in January when I travel west again.

Text: Well never stay here again.  The place sucks.  Starts a reward program quite,s it and does not give you nothing. It's a piss poor motel chain. Have CLC card it's direct bill. Than in order to stay you have to give them a credit card. So they can go to hell. Poor business people ripping the public off.

Text: This is a great reasonably priced hotel! Soft and fluffy beds and pillows! Helpful and friendly staff also! They have some truck parking in front of the hotel, and had no issues being right next to the truck stop. A great place to stay if you need some work done as a truck driver, or if you would like to take your 34. 10/10 would stay again!

Text: Location is right off the highway, easy access. Has free breakfast, newspapers, coffee. The room was very large and spacious. Parking was challenging since there was work being done on the road adjacent to the hotel, but over all, a pleasant stay.
