Embassy Suites by Hilton Detroit Livonia Novi
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent rooms with a great breakfast and managers reception. Staff was helpful but not overly friendly. King bed was very comfortable and furnishings were up to date and well maintained. Best hotel stay we have had in years.

Text: After a horrible night of double booking with other less than satisfactory hotels. My boyfriend and I, extremely tired from driving hundreds of miles decided to book with Embassy Suites. On this particular night there was a popular concert and a Big10 game so we were having a hard time finding a place to stay after the double booking incident. Although we experienced a minor hiccup with the booking and description of the room, Kevin and Ryan  at the front desk, did not miss a beat assisting us, even calling around to see if other rooms that met my needs were available. They made sure to make up for the issues that we experienced and understood the long and horrific night that we had and made up for it in every way that they could. Not only was the service great the hotel is very updated, clean and quiet. The room is all very clean and spacious. Service is very prompt and willing to assist. I appreciate my night ending here and I'm pretty sure I won't book anywhere but embassy going forward. Thank you so much for the great service!!!
