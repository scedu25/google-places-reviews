Text: My wife and I went to this great motel for our honeymoon. The staff which we preferred to call aunty Chuanita was very friendly. We have never experienced a morning breakfast like what she had offered us on the morning of our first stay. She left a tray with two home made muffins with coffee and milk next to our room door. Amazingly, rooms were internet ready and satellite TV were in all TVs. We strongly recommend this place for a romantic getaway.
