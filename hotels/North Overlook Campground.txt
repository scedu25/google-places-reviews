North Overlook Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Campground was very clean and in good condition while we were there and the trail passing through and toward Pella was very nice for walking / biking.  The sites are fairly well spaced and there is good tree coverage overhead, but not much greenery between sites.  Our site was level enough that it wasn't a problem to adjust easily and the gravel pad was in good condition.  We hope to have occasion to stop in again in the future.
