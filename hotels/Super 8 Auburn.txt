Text: We were told it's a none smoking facility, but the down stairs hallway was strongly polluted...
Upstairs?? Nice and clean....
We got to our designated room, and housekeeping had never cleaned it ?
Got to the second room and two light switches didn't work ?
No complaints, just reality of life in a fallen world.,,

Text: We were in Room 101. the last room on the hall , smelled so much like smoke we had to walk to Walmart but air fresheners a d cleaning supplies. My wife asked for mattress cover and linens to be changed . The staff had. NO problem accommodating . After scrubbing down the bathroom the smell subsided . Untill the next time we walked into the room , i realized the smell was coming out of the bathroom vent , i used a hand towel to cover vent . And turned on the exaust ( it was extremely loud , but took care of the smoke smell , my wife has told me We will never stay there again

Text: I was visiting friends who were staying at this hotel. They said the hotel itself was just okay. The beds were not as comfortable as most, and there was no hot water but yet no discount was given. (I guess a part broke) Also on a few third party booking sites it has a pool listed with this hotel but it doesn't have one. It's in a convenient location and around a lot of main shops, restaurants, etc.
