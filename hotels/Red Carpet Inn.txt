Text: This is suppose to be a place where you can relax and get sleep but you can get sleep when they have people working till 10-10:30 at night pounding and being disruptive and then it starts again as soon as the sun comes up they DO NOT give any consideration to anyone trying to sleep.

Text: 1980 zenith televisions barely any wifi it registered but couldn't get connected.
The swimming pool looked like trash had moss covered like swamp water big chunks of concrete dropped in it. Our room phones didn't work. The mattresses were probably 30 years old with blood stains or poop stains we noticed while doing our check for bed bugs. Only good thing is great restaurant next door cable and we didn't find any bed bugs.
