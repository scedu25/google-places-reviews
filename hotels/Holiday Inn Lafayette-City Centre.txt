Holiday Inn Lafayette-City Centre
Rating: 5
Text: We love staying at Holiday Inn City Center when we come to Lafayette. A really classy hotel with very helpful, friendly staff, super clean rooms, comfortable beds (lots of fluffy clean pillows, too!) and beautiful views of the city from its windows. Housekeeping is also very quiet and efficient. Convenient location for walk to historic downtown, and close to Wabash River Walk and Purdue.

Text: I was given a balcony room with a great view. The towels were old and dingy. Other than that, great place to stay! Close to the downtown scene. The hotel bar and restaurant looked like a good place to grab a drink.

Text: The staff are friendly and helpful. However, the place is just adequate. The first room they gave me was already used. The key cards for the second room didn't work the next day. The floors could have been cleaner. There's a small gym and heated pool (sadly no hot tub), but it didn't look that appealing. The tv took forever to start up and always went back to the hotel channel. The hotel is completely adequate but not outstanding.

Text: OVERALL: Nice hotel in downtown Lafayette with average rooms.  A bit chaotic with a lot of things going on in and around the hotel.  

POSITIVE:  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Hotel was very clean and well maintained.   Booked using Priceline's Express Deals for $69. 

NEGATIVE: Parking garage across the street isn't too bad of a situation (they validate for this garage), but the space in the actual hotel parking lot is less than what is needed for the size of the hotel.  No fridge in the room.  Breakfast is an extra cost.

Text: Excellent location. Very close to Purdue University. Room was quite comfortable but didn't have microwave/fridge. Pool was fun for kids. Staff was flexible with checkout time.
