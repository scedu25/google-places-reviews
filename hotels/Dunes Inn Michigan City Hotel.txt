Text: Very low rate motel. Hard to get to from frontage road. No amenities. Pretty much just a spot to stop and sleep.

Text: I kind of had no other option due to finances but most of the comments were true. I never looked under the mattress. I saw stains on the sheets. Slept good enough for a night.

Text: The management is constantly hateful with my wife, my wife is constantly harassed by the drunks that stay here.  The sign says keep noise  down after 10 but parties are constantly going on till 1 or 2 in the morning every night vulgar, drinks cussing and screaming and management does nothing.  ONCE WE CAN AFFORD IT WE ARE OUT OF HERE.  NO PLACE FOR FAMILY OR KIDS.  PEDOPHILES ARE ALLOWED TO STAY HERE. Oh and it's  $25 extra for housekeeping so the rooms aren't kept up.

Text: This was the dirtiest place ive ever stayed.  Sheets were dirty.  Walls were even dirty. Was trash still in the waste basket.  And had a funny smell.  If I would have been able to just leave and pay for room elsewhere i would have.  Not a good end to my night
