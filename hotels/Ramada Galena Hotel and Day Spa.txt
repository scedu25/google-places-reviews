Ramada Galena Hotel and Day Spa
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed overnight with family during the week. The pool is huge and it and the hot tub were mostly empty until the evening. Everything was very clean and well maintained. Beautiful deck and fishing lake. The rooms were nice and the beds very comfortable. The breakfast selection was pretty decent.

Text: Nice clean hotel for the price.  The free breakfast has lots of usual options like waffles, yogurt, eggs, fruit, etc.  It would be nice if all rooms included a mini fridge rather than hoping you get lucky to get one.  Fortunately, I had a fridge in my room, so I could have fruit, veggies & juice. Check the back yard.  It's gorgeous! I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Wonderful hotel. Clean and comfy. We enjoyed the pool and deck and even took our daughter out for an impromptu photo shoot on there beautiful property. Could not beat it for the price.

Text: Had reservation for 2 rooms and requested in advance for adjoining rooms and was assured they were available. Upon check-in, our rooms were not adjoining and when inquired, we were informed that our reservation had been "adjusted" that morning due to a "maintenance issue" (plumbing) and that no other adjoining rooms were available. The room we personally ended up with had 2 queen beds and both were terribly squeaky with even the slightest movement. The included breakfast was well below the standard of what most hotels are offering these days.

Text: They have a awesome water exercise Aqua Zumba class offered to the public that starts at 4:15.  It was a great workout for the cost!
