Text: It was amazing as always.  The playground is very nice for children or people of all ages.  Everybody that went to the playground were lit and hype people an they were all so nice and friendly.  As for the shooting perspective it wasn't amazing to shoot here and always has been.

Text: A great facility for camping and shooting. There are more than enough campsites and shooting stands to go around. The scenery provides a nice backdrop and there are plenty of lakes to swim in.

Text: This is a great complex; the number of trap houses is unbelievable. The Hall of Fame and Museum of Trap Shooting was very interesting, definitely worth it.

Text: We watched the total eclipse here. It was great with a large concession building and plenty of open outdoor spaces to watch from. They even came around in a golf cart offering free eclipse glasses

Text: I came down to watch the eclipse which was amazing.It was only place with open sites. For $35 i at least expected a fire pit or a lake to swim in. I jumped in the lake anyway because there is no shade what so ever. Showers were nice and didnt have to wait too long.
