The Duchess of Wellington

Text: Fun atmosphere, creaky floors, relaxing stay, and a great breakfast. This B&B was a great way to spend a few days off. Old timey charm and a great place to curl up on the couch and read a book.

Text: Chatham is a great place to go when Michigan has gone stale.  About an hour from Detroit, it isn't touristy, but sights to fill out a weekend.

This bed and breakfast is really cool.  An old restored house with very cordial owners.  Very reasonably priced especially when taking into account the exchange rate if you're from the U.S.  Lots of antiques in the room as the owner used to be in the business of antiques.  It is almost nerve racking to try to not damage anything in the room, but definitely makes the experience better.

Highly recommend this place.

Text: The Duchess of Wellington is a bed & breakfast in Chatham, Ontario, situated in a restored Victorian house that is as old as Canada itself. It has three rooms for guests, each featuring a queen size bed. The suite we stayed in was a beautiful bedroom with a modern bathroom with a jazucci bath/shower. The hosts are a wonderful, friendly elderly couple who only want to make your stay as relaxing as possible. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic, with fresh raspberries, cherries, and French toast. We loved our one night stay there.

Text: I come to Chatham often, where i had the opportunity to stay at different hotels.  I must say this is the best place in town.  The interior of the b&b is like a 5 star chateau as you get in, you will feel the royality of this place, every room is private and spacious with it is own private wash room.  The house corners has such an amazing fine and classy crafts and pictures.  I always found treats in my room every morning.  Antja and her husband Rick works so hard to keep this place amazing.  They served me an amazing breakfast(fruits, main entrée and cake pluse coffee ofcourse).  I will definitely comeback whenever i come to Chatham.
