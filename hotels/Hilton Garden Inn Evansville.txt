Text: Diana was not helpful at all. Upon asking for a shuttle to take me to a near by shopping center, she informed me that the shuttle only runs 3 miles from the hotel. Both shopping centers I mentioned were 2 miles or under from the hotel, and which I let her know that. She stood there looking at her computer not even responding to me! Another younger gentleman stepped in the conversation and assured me that they would be happy to take me to North Park Shopping Center which is 2 miles away, about a 7 min drive! She clearly had no intent on helping me and was rude in the process. She lied telling me that the shopping center was over 3 miles from the hotel, which it wasn’t. I was also told there was supposed to be a refrigerator and microwave in my room, which neither one was in the room. The room is clean but it’s also located right next to an active airport runway. Thank you to the gentlemen who stepped in to help me getting to the shopping center or I would have gave them 1 star.
