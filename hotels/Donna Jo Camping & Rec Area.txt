Text: Love the wooded setting. Friendly staff. Clean restroom. But a delay on hot water. Large fish in catch and release pond. We will be back soon. Loved it!

Text: Not sure how some of these reviews are 3 or 7 months ago the place would not have been open. Sounds like bs to me. There hasn't been swimming here for years - the place is nice and clean ran by a family. They don't allow nonsense which is probably what was going on with some of these people. It's a great place to take the family and camp/ fish. Safe and tucked away in the woods. We try to go at least once a year for a decade now. Always have a nice time.

Text: Called this campground with little time to make a reservation, it was so easy to schedule and the person on the phone was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed. My family is very excited to go camping for fathers day and a birthday!

Text: Was amazing. Very friendly people very quiet. Beautiful place. Many different birds. The pond is a bit small. But lots of blue gill, bass, and carp. It's really a great place to get away or bring the family. Will be returning for sure. There's also a playground for the kids and a game room. Also access to water a bath house and for those long stays even a laundry room.

Text: HAHAHAHA!!!! This place is a complete joke!!! To just swim in the mud puddle it costs you $20. Then the old guy that takes you there sits and watches you and yells at your kids for going near the rope that splits the deep and shallow parts. The whole thing smells like diesel fuel and I got a headache from it. Then you go shower,  their were the owners grandkids running around playing inside making it very uncomfortable. We finally left and this old lady yelled at us for flooding the shower when it was her Bogan grandkids. They do have a peacock walking around, but you can see plenty at Lincoln Park Zoo for free. It's definitely a trip of a place.
