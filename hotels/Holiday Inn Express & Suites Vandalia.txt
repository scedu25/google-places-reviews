Text: Wonderful hotel.  Such a caring staff.  Clean, updated rooms with restaurants within walking distance.  Great customer service.  What more could you ask for.

Text: I would be lying if I said it was my best stay. There was a number of smaller things that collectively resulted in a subpar experience. Checked in, then immediately rechecked to another room as my work associate had a more senior rewards status (they checked in just after me). Upon checking in, I was handed a note saying their renovations were still going on; bare dry wall, exposed electrical boxes, missing ceiling tiles, and very dirty hall carpet. Got the the room and it was a little dirty, specifically the bathroom, but there was some visible dirt on the carpet. All that was okay, but the beds were honestly quite terrible. Did not sleep well. The next morning was met with, very, poor breakfast food. At least the hot food. Ended up just eating some cereal. Sadly, I am not looking to return. Booked another hotel the following night, even though the drive was further away.
