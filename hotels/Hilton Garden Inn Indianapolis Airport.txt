Text: We called here last minute and got a GREAT room. Probably one of the top 2 rooms I've ever stayed in at a chain hotel. Also a REALLY solid fitness room, which is a rarity.  AND a free DELICIOUS breakfast in the morning. 12/10 would visit again.

Text: Everything is great.   The hotel is right off the I-70 that is quite convenient for my trip. The only thing is the breakfast hot food is served by a waitress.   My family came to eat at 9:15 AM .  The dinning hall is quite occupied.  Only one waitress was helping customers. We waited about 10 minutes to get served.  It did not bother us since we were able to help ourselves on juice and cold items before eating the hot meals.

Text: Very clean hotel. The staff was friendly, although one was on his second day on the job be and needed help. That did not bother me at all. Bar staff was great and always ready to serve you. I would stay there again.

Text: Excellent fitness room. Free earplugs for each screen on each piece of workout equipment.  24/7 hours. Upscale hotel. My suite excellent.  Staff attentive and thorough. Didn't use spa or pool but it looked nice. Lobby inviting.  Keurigs in each room.
