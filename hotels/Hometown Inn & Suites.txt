Text: Dirty. Arrived to find all the windows open and could smell the musty smell from the parking lot. Manager admitted it was dirty but refused refund after canceling. Called credit card company and disputing charge. I wouldn't let my dog sleep in this place. Manager very rude. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website. False advertisement. Expedia should be ashamed for booking rooms at this place

Text: Dirty, manager was sweet (Patsy) but place NEEDs some help. $80 is too.much for this place.
3 different rooms...posted 3 different smoke alarms disabled.  Rooms 211, 202, 206.  I'm pretty sure that's illegal.  So much for getting sleep.

Text: Not the greatest but more than sufficient for the price. I found (and I searched) zero bugs. No breakfast but decent comfortable beds.
