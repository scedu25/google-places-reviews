Lincoln Land Inn
Rating: 4
Text: This place is kept up well, rooms were clean, service was very friendly.  Coffee pot in the rooms.  Rooms are not moldy like most other places.  They have a laundry area that was functional, nice touch.  Most of the ground floor rooms are freshly remodeled onto handicap accessible rooms.  The traffic on the ground floor is a little noisy, so if you’re just looking for something clean and quiet, try the second or third floor.  This place is much better than the Super 8 across the street.

Text: Nothing spectacular, but well kept and clean.  Checked for bedbug signs by removing top/bottom sheet, and all around the headboards/nightstands.  Perfectly clean, and no signs of bedbugs.  Very friendly and courteous staff.  Only downfall is that there isn't much around for dining (besides Wendy's/Denny's and a few mom and pop restaurants in the small town.  Had to travel to Jasper (15-20 min) to find some other dining options.  Not all that bad though.  I would definitely stay at Lincoln Land/Baymont if I need to visit the one horse town again.

Text: Pool very small but nice, not over clorinated. When I pulled back bottom sheet to check for bed bugs none were found but dog hair was all over the mattress pad. The rest of the facility was well maintained and appeared clean.
