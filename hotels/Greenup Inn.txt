Text: Although we reserved a room for 4 people, there were only towels for one. I called the motel number and explained. They arrived with only 2 more sets of towels, because they didn't think I knew what I was saying.

The rooms need serious updating. Although clean, didn't feel like it. The shower pressure was feeble. The room was shabby at best. You get what you pay for...I'll pay more next time.

Text: Wonderful service. The employees really helped us a lot. Location was good, right off the highway. Room and bathroom were clean and tidy. AC was COLD! Would stay here again if we were going to be in the area.

Text: Great place to stay. Ash and his wife are awesome, the rooms are clean, and the bed was very comfortable. They are remodeling and updating. I would definitely go back.

Text: We weren't sure of our arrival time but the staff was awesome. You get what you pay for as far as the state of the room, things are a little outdated and the windows don't open, but the beds were clean and very comfortable and the shower was hot with a good amount of pressure. For this price this is an awesome hotel. Honestly, the guy at the front desk was so nice.

Text: It's a cheap motel but it served our purpose late at night after our previous arrangement turned out to be overbooked. It's not pretty, it's not modern but in a pinch, it was clean, it didn't smell, the people were really nice and the beds were surprisingly comfy. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed but like I said, in a pinch....
