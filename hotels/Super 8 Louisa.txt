Text: It's decent for a budget hotel. It's pet friendly, with the extra fee not being exorbitant, which is a big plus for us. The employees were friendly and helpful. Other than the carpet being a bit dusty around the edges, the rooms were clean. I found the beds to be comfortable, and slept really well. The breakfast was more like the old school continental breakfast - no eggs, meats, etc., but I also didn't have to pay an extra $40-50 for the "free" hot breakfast. It had toaster waffles, cereal, milk, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit cups, juice, bagels, cinnamon rolls, toast, and hot drinks. My biggest complaint is that the lobby and hallway, at least on the first floor, smelled heavily of stale cigarette smoke. I didn't notice it in the room, though. To sum it up, I would stay here again.

Text: It's a dairy queen. Decent quality, but fairly overpriced like all Dairy Queen's. Four bucks plus for a blizzard is crazy. But, what are you gonna do if you want a blizzard? You're gonna pay the four bucks plus. The chicken strips basket is pretty good with the white gravy to dip them in. Not much else to say, good or bad. I just wish they, and all Dairy Queen's would lower their prices.
