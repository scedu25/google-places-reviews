Al's Place Bike Hostel

Text: A most excellent hostel for touring cyclists. We stayed here a couple nights when we were on the TransAm in 2015. It has a super comfortable apartment feel with a nice lawn area to have a cookout. Very happy that Farmington supports touring cyclists- you guys without a doubt have one of the best stops on the 4300 mile route!
