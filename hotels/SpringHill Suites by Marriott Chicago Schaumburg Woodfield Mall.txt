Text: This hotel is great. The staff is friendly and everything is maintained well and clean. I have stayed here for a few weeks for work training, and I couldn't be happier. The room is spacious with a nice kitchenette and desk, as well as a lounging area and bedroom bathroom area. It's nothing fancy, but it's perfect for me during a week long stay. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Breakfast is just fine. A decent selection of hot and cold items, and is really pretty good. I can't complain. It's not the best hotel breakfast I've had- but the combination of nice clean. Rooms and a pretty good breakfast is perfect for me.

Text: We checked in late in the evening. There were four of us. We were there for a softball tournament. At the time we checked in there was a large group in the lobby eating pizza and socializing. They were very loud and I was concerned that the noise would carry to the second floor where we were staying. I was honestly surprised to find that our room was very quiet. Myself and my daughter both took showers that evening. The bathrooms are split with a shower/tub and toilet in one room and the sink and mirror were in another. This made getting everyone ready the next day so easy. The showers are very roomy and welcoming after a day of travel and softball. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were very soft. We had a room with two double beds and a couch. That was perfect for myself, my husband and our teenage son and daughter. The next morning we had to leave very early to be back at the fields. Breakfast was going to start for another hour. The staff was kind enough to make certain we had a choice of some "grab and go" items for breakfast. Overall this hotel is amazingly clean and updated. The staff is very kind and accommodating.

Text: Great place to stay, honestly worth it. Jessica at the front desk is literally an incredible person. She booked my taxi for my group and I, even though they were complications with it she was very kind throughout the entire situation. The people here are great people I can not express how amazing they are. Next time I am in chicago I am coming here.

Text: I had no idea what type of hotel I was registering into other than it was the Marriott. Upon arriving here we found it was absolutely beautiful. To start off with the receptionist at the front desk was amazing and personable and nice and just really sweet. Our rooms are amazing! Plenty of room with a front living area bedroom this close off separate bathroom wonderful! Clean and beautifully done. Definitely will come back

Text: We stayed at SpringHill for a mini vacation as it was near the attention we were visiting. The staff was super friendly and helpful with questions we had. The room was bigger than a typical hotel room, including a sofa sleeper. My wife said the free breakfast was one of the nicest she's ever seen! We'll be back for our next visit.
