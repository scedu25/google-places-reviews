Text: We had a birthday party here, it was fantastic, everyone said it was the best birthday party ever! The owners and staff were all so nice and helpful! My kids have been to other parties here and always have a great time. Thanks, Lazy T!

Text: This is one of the most poorly organized places I've ever had the misfortune to visit. Apparently this ranch hosts weddings, but because the bride was jilted, the owners thought that they would make the best of the weekend and host a German schnitzel festival. I don't want to go much into detail because I just spent the entire day living through their disorganized hell, but suffice it to say that the entire event was poorly planned, poorly managed, and was overall one of the worst experiences, dining or otherwise, that I've had in years. I arrived at the ranch in the early afternoon and did not get to sit down and eat any schnitzel for four and a half hours. I didn't realize until I got towards the end of the line that the reason for this was because they were making the schnitzel ten at a time, which meant that they were frequently running out of meat and causing the line to stop moving. As I told a friend, it was as if a person decided off-the-cuff that they wanted to host a barbecue and then invited thousands of people. I could go on an on about how awful this place and this event were, but I'd rather just move on with my life and attempt to forget that any of it ever happened.

Save yourself some trouble and some sanity and stay far away from Lazy T Ranch.

Edit after seeing owner's response: Everything the owners said is a lie and they know it. It stands to reason that if I stood in line for four and a half hours, hundreds of other people did as well.

Text: My family had a wedding here and I also attended Schnitzelfest this year. Our experience has been fantastic for both! It is the most beautiful setting for a wedding, the food was terrific, the staff helpful and responsive. They did a great job! Schnitzelfest was a long wait because there was a huge crowd, but the wait was well worth it!! We enjoyed the time, visiting the beer garden and meeting other people in the German community! The Lazy T Ranch brought this community together, and we appreciate it! We loved the experience and the food! Please do this again and ignore anyone who doesn't want to wait in line. We will wait!! Thank you so much!

Text: I had an appointment here to have my wedding here next fall. After waiting almost 20 minutes the owner never showed. When I called the week before she was not very nice and she made it seem like answering my call was interrupting everything she had going on. She informed me they would be out there all day cleaning up a wedding they had over the weekend and there was no one anywhere to be found and had looked like they hadn’t cleaned anything from the weekend. Will not be recommending this venue.

Text: If i could give them 0 stars I would. ..I'm so irritated!  I was looking for wedding venues near Manhattan and I'd heard that Lazy T was a pretty place to have a wedding.... after I called and left a message,  sent 2 emails, and a Facebook message (which they replied to and said they would email me information, which I never got) I had to write them off... so irritating! It's been 2 weeks since I first contacted them,  and still nothing. I'm aware that is a small farm,  but this put a really bad taste in my mouth. No decency to send anything back,  but a message saying they would do something that they still never did! Don't plan on having a wedding at this place!
