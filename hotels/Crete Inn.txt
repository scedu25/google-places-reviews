Text: We've  stayed here often and travel for work. I can honestly say that I've got some of the best nights sleep here. The owners have worked hard and still are updating the rooms. They are very nice and try to accommodate all your needs. If you're looking for a quiet, comfortable, clean, affordable  room and pleasant staff you'll find it here. We'll be visiting again!
