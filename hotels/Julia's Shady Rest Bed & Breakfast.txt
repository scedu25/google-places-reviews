Text: What a wonderful place to stay and the nicest people you will ever meet.  We stayed two nights in the Lilly of the Nile room and had an amazing time walking around the farm and relaxing.  Julia and her husband were wonderful hosts, we immediately felt welcomed.  The breakfast was delicious!  Stuffed french toast, crepes, fresh fruit and farm fresh eggs were just part of the amazing menu!  I would recommend staying here if you ever are lucky enough to get the opportunity!  We plan to go back and check out the Hideaway next time!  Thank you so much for the wonderful get away Julia!

Text: My husband and I spent two lovely days in the cabin at Julia's on our honeymoon. This place is off the beaten path, and well worth the drive. Julia is a fantastic host who made us feel at home, and her breakfasts were amazing! 

We loved having three horses right outside our cabin, which we could watch from the windows overlooking the corral. There is also a family of ducks that waddled around the property, along with deer and even some calves when we were there. 

The cabin is large and comfortable, with all of the conveniences you would expect (including wi-fi, of course). 

We would highly recommend this B&B, particularly to those 'recovering' from a wedding. The R&R was much needed, and this was the perfect place for it.
