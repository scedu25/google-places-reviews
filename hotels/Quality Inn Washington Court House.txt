Quality Inn Washington Court House
Rating: 2
Text: The pictures are decieving, makes rooms including lobby and eating area look much larger than actual. No elevator, mold in yogurt, silverfish on sink in room, tear and stains in bed linens. They also charge $1 for a room safe fee unless you ask to remove at check-in, however, you are not told about the fee until check out. The room smelled like smoke even though it was supposedly a smoke free facility. The staff was friendly and kept the breakfast area clean and stocked. The price of $100 including tax was too high considering the quality.

Text: Stayed overnight on a Wednesday/Thursday. Staff was polite, hot shower (bathroom was very small however), clean room, breakfast was decent. A no frill hotel for a good price. Would stay again. (Didn't get to get in the pool bc of time restrains but looked nice!)

Text: Travellers, BEWARE of the desk clerk if he is a chubby, arrogant, ignorant individual who accused me of being a liar.   He is lucky I am from Canada and could not have a police record, otherwise, I would have jumped across the check- in desk and beat the hell out of this obnoxious person.   He should not be dealing with the public with his attitude.

Text: The kid that checked us in seemed like he'd rather be somewhere else and he spoke so low that I had a hard time understanding him. The outside door lock into the hallway was broken allowing any non-guest entry. The bathroom was tiny. There were not enough outlets to plug in three phones and an iPad to charge. The towels were yellow and the washcloths were stained. It was fifty-fifty if the towels were going to be soft or scratchy. Breakfast was good and the morning gal was more friendly.
