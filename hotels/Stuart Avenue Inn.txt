Stuart Avenue Inn

Text: The breakfast was delicious. Our room was somehow simultaneously spacious and cozy. Location was close to downtown so driving wasn't necessary. The inn keeper was very personable and helpful and their dog was a sweetheart. I'd stay here again!

Text: We wish we would have stayed longer! Dana was incredibly warm and inviting. The breakfast was amazing. We stayed in Lois' Retreat and it was the perfect space. We could not have been more pleased with our stay here!

Text: This place is great!! The rooms are so clean, bright, and nostalgic.  We stayed in Ruth's room which has a full bath and the most comfortable mattress ever.  The food is amazing and the innkeepers were very accommodating by letting us eat late and offering vegetarian options.  If you like good food and great beer a trip to Kalamazoo and the Stuart Avenue Inn is highly recommended.  Thanks Dana, Chris, and Arlo!!!  Hope to see you soon!!!

Text: The Stuart Avenue Inn is a beautiful old house in downtown Kalamazoo. The Innkeepers are friendly, helpful, and make food according to your dietary needs (tell them ahead of time). This is a bed and breakfast. It has several different rooms. I stayed in the Cook's room that had a kitchenette, deep bathtub, breakfast nook and Queen or King sized bed. And there is the nicest dog named Arlo.

Text: I spent the weekend at this charming inn. Dana and Chris were very friendly, helpful and accommodating and Arlo was friendly too. The room I stayed in was comfortable and spacious. The breakfast that was prepared for us was delicious. I loved the decor and it's proximity to the college. I know I will be staying here when I am in Kalamazoo. Thank you making my stay at your inn a pleasant one!
