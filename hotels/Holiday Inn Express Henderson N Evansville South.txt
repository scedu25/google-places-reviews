Text: Possibly the nicest place to stay in Henderson. Very clean and comfortable. They ARE remodeling right now so if that bothers you might  want to delay staying here until finished.

Text: Nice place, however the company didn't warn anyone reserving a room about the construction and, most importantly, you can feel eighteen wheelers flying past all the way to the third floor. My bed shook off and on all night. Friendly staff, it's just not my ideal location.

Text: The room and the building itself were okay. My children were concerned with the part of town and there did not seem to be much security in place. It is currently under construction which meant power tools in the rooms right by ours in the morning.
