Courtyard by Marriott Cincinnati Blue Ash

Text: The bed was comfortable, And the people at the front desk were friendly, which are the only positives I can say about this hotel.

I was on the second floor, and the entire floor smelled weird. Like yoghurt or rotten milk. Thankfully the smell didn't extend to my room.

The bathroom didn't seem to be well cleaned. There were some things that had obviously not been washed since the last visitor, like leftover soap in the shower. 

Another very concerning thing to me was that there were no safes in the rooms. When I asked the front desk to use a safe deposit box (as the key card specifically recommends for valuables) I was told they didn't know how to open the safe deposit boxes. I felt extremely uncomfortable letting maids and whomever else into my room with my electronics, And so I had to utilize the "don't clean my room" door hanger for the duration in order to feel comfortable leaving my electronics behind. Due to this, I never had cleaning service or fresh towels. 

One other thing- while this may not have been the hotels fault, our power was out for 4 hours one day.

Text: Friendly staff, clean and quiet room, comfortable bed (softer than most hotel beds I've slept on). Had a great time at the Blue Ash Courtyard. Stayed for a few days on business. Beautiful surrounding area.
