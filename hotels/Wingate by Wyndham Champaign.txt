Text: We stayed here during move in week, which happened to be around the 2017 solar eclipse as well. Understandably, the hotel was super busy, but they manages to make time to serve our needs despite that. The food was great, the sheets and room were clean, the staff were very friendly, and it was a great experience. We didn't use the pool, but we did see other guests enjoying it. It's location is also great for visiting u of i. 5 star experience for a nice price.

Text: Booked a two queen room weeks in advance. They gave us a one king corner suite. Couldn't switch because they were booked out. Shower door looked like it used to be two sliding doors, but one of them was put on pegs to make a makeshift hinged door. Otherwise, nice room, just not what we booked.

Text: Nice place.  The presidential suite was really spacious and well laid out. The pool was a little small and could use more frequent maintenance and a little less chlorine (it was at the burn-your-eyes level). We had to skim it ourselves before we used it.

Text: Very quick stay on cross country drive, but rooms were spacious. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was good with eggs and bacon and staff was excellent.
