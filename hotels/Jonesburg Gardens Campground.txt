Text: We really enjoyed our week long stay here ! Owners are very friendly, making sure your needs are met. Lots are good sized, prices are awesome and tons of wildlife around. Easy to maneuver your rig, was told police even patrol the campground, very safe! They also acknowledge Good Sam Club memberships! Will be returning on our next trip to MO ?

Text: We were looking for a last-minute place to watch the eclipse; we rented one of the small cabins onsite and were treated very nicely by the friendly staff. Amenities were older but well-maintained, with a very nice pool area - the owners went out of their way to put a double-filtration system on the pool so that families who forget swimwear can send their kids in, in shorts and t-shirts without worry. This is also a treat for Mennonite ladies as they can wear their traditional bathing costumes, which many places will not allow.

They sell a generous helping of firewood at the front office; you shouldn't bring outside wood into an area, as it may carry parasites not found in the area.  Our load was a little damp and hard to get started, just double-check that yours is dry and bring some extra starter fluid and you'll be fine!

Text: This place should not be on.the Good Sams list. Do not go there in your rv. Trees way to low, trees everywhere. We asked prior to going in if it was 14 feet high, they said it was 15, its not even 13 as we found out the hard way. I agree with above, it needs to be inspected. All we saw were fulltimers living in their little campers. And moldy old empty trailers, everything run down and terrible. Stay away!!!
