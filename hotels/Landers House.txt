Text: We love the Lander's House! Stayed here a couple of times now and they are very accommodating. The rooms/cabins are so unique! We hope to keep coming back until we've had a chance to stay in each room or cabin. The served breakfast is absolutely delicious! I would recommend to ANYONE.

Text: Been here twice now at two different cabins, they were both very well decorated, and had unique themes. Staff is very friendly, and the breakfast is great!

Text: We had a nice stay. The jacuzzi was fantastic and breakfast was phenomenal, the bed was a but firm for our taste. But overall we had an excellent stay.

Text: My wife and I stayed a couple nights in the La Noche cabin. The star-like lights in the ceiling were very romantic at night and the breakfast far exceeded my expectations... so good! Location was great too. Minutes away from Starved Rock and Matthiessen. Driving there and back was a breeze.
