Text: Not a 5 star hotel but I'm giving it 5 stars for cleanliness, comfort and service! This is a really nice hotel to stay at when in the area. Bed was really comfortable and super clean and the staff was very friendly. If paying with a debit card, you will have to leave $200 for incidentals that will be held for up to 5 days.

Text: This place never sent me my $200 deposit check in the mail like they were supposed to!! Been waiting for a month now. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT AN EASY STAY. You're better off traveling a little bit further for better service
