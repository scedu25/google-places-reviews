Text: I had a great time the room was clean and modern. The staff was excellent. But I spent 4.00$ at the food shop on a small bag of chips and only 2.00$ on the Pop bottle. I understand a price increase because of location...but that price was ridiculous. So was a few other things in the store that was up at least 4-5 times more then would have been somewhere else. I never had this issue and it never would have bothered me. ...untill I went downstairs to get a snack and only got 2 small (I mean those small bags) of chips for 10$

Text: Nice hotel, clean, and very friendly staff. We visited for a hockey tournament. They had a great breakfast with made-to-order fresh items. Our room was a handicap-accessible room, which was unexpected, and we thought we were getting two queen size beds but we got two full size, which was difficult for 4 full-grown people. So thats why i give it 4 stars. But it was nice and located conveniently.

Text: Lunch break of a business meeting. Chowder and fish specials were delicious. Servers were delightful. Place was mostly empty, so hard to say if the quick service was a feature or coincidence. Next time will come later and try their bar.
