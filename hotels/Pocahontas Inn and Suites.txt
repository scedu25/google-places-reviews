Pocahontas Inn and Suites
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel gets an A+.  Clean, friendly, quiet, nice parking lot.  What more is needed?  It would be an A++ if they had waffles at breakfast, but the breakfast was still good.

Text: Front desk lady was rude. Pillows were tiny and asked for extra pillows, they said "uh I guess." Asked for clean towels because we stayed more than 1 night and they didn't even take the old towels. For the price you pay they could of made our bed changed out the trash. Been nice but they weren't. I will not stay in this place again. My in-laws live in this town, we live 4 hours south so next time I will bring a tent. At least i won't pay 200.00 for rude and lazy service.
