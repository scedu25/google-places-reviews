Reel & Trigger Resort

Text: Great quiet getaway! The resort, Terry, Lisa & the staff are all wonderful. My husband and I stayed at Reel & Trigger for the first time in 2015. 

We'd only been to Truman once before in 2014 and had stayed at Grand River, where we felt like we were at a wild college party, not our idea of a relaxing getaway. If you like to party hard on your vacation then Grand River is the place. If you're like us and want a mellow, peaceful, quiet relaxing vacation then you'll be very pleased with Reel & Trigger. We're so blessed to have found it. 

The entire staff is incredibly welcoming, warm, friendly and genuine. The resort is quiet, calm and a beautiful, peaceful, place to relax and unwind. It's just minutes from the State Park & Marina. The resort has a beautiful hiking trail that leads you to a bluff with a breath taking view of the Lake. They definitely don't charge enough for all that they provide.

Reel & Trigger has become an annual trip, we make two trips a year if we can. We've been back to stay 4 more times since our first visit and we're heading down again next month and can not wait! You will not find a more inviting, friendly, convenient place to stay on Truman Lake. 

Whenever I call to book our spot, Lisa is always there to pick up the phone and after just one visit she remembered us. Terry & Lisa are truly genuine people, we are so fortunate to have them in our lives. Their website says "arrive as a stranger, leave as family" that quote could not be truer.
