Text: This was my first time skydiving and had an amazing time.  Ryan was our pre-jump instructor and was very helpful answering any and all questions our group had.  I personally jumped with Vince as my tandem while cameraman Timmy took video and photos.  I highly recommend the video and photo package to any one jumping for the first time.  Pictures were very high quality and turned out well.  I was really nervous prior to going but Sky Dive Chicago and their staff were very helpful in making this an unforgettable experience.

Text: This was my first Tandem jump and I had a blast.  Not 1 time did I feel unsafe.  There were safety checks on the plane before we even jumped.  Staff was excellent and helpful.  I structure were fun and have a lot of experience.  I can't wait to jump again!
