Text: We are loving our stay here. It was very comfy and accommodating. The food (breakfast) was very good with good quantity and variety.  Need to use the workout room and jacuzzi before we leave! Oh and helpful, friendly accommodating staff too.

Text: My family came in from out-of-town recently for a funeral and the staff were extremely helpful sorting-out our reservations for a small group over a holiday weekend.  The staff was friendly and helpful during our stay. The kids loved the pool (especially the shallow splash area, it's perfect for younger kids) and the rooms were very comfortable. We will definitely be back again!

Excellent service, clean, all the essential amenities including ample room outlets, coffee and tea, good breakfast, and friendly staff. The hotel is centrally located near major motoways and within easy access to restaurants. I would definitely return to this hotel!
