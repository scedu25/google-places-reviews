Text: So some others have said in their reviews that the place was a little shabby. Maybe so but my sheets were clean (NO BUGS!) and the towels were clean and fresh. Plenty of hot water to bathe. It was relatively quiet and I felt safe. Only cold items for breakfast but there is a GREAT cafe next door. Staff was polite. Housekeeping visited and tidied my room every day. I will reiterate- NO BUGS! That is always my #1 concern these days. Two of my colleagues and I stayed there for 4 nights and we were all satisfied. Can't ask for much more for less than $75 a night.

Text: The owner is really nice and accommodating. The room was a bit outdated. The beds were sleep number beds but the remote didn't work so we were stuck with the previous setting.

Text: The manager and desk clerk were very nice and accommodating.  My room was clean and affordable. I'm a 59 year-old female traveling alone and I felt safe. That means a lot to me. Not really fancy but  nice.
