Text: We stayed one night and it was very nice. Clean and breakfast was very good. They had a large variety and it was hot and seemed fresh. Pool wasn't very deep or big but it was clean. Employees were friendly. No complaints I can think of.

Text: I stay here a couple times a year for work. They are always friendly and attentive. Rooms are clean and neat and so are bathrooms. Morning breakfast is really good with a ton to choose from. Only bad thing is that the train tracks run right behind the hotel, like RIGHT behind. You actually have to cross over them to pull into the parking lot so bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper!
