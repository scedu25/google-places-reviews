Donna's Premier Lodging

Text: I have stayed at Donna's three times, and we plan to return every year. Donna and her staff are amazing. The details they put into their work is unbelievable. Cleanliness is 100% every single time. They never fail to make me feel like a princess during my stay! 

TIP: Do NOT pass up the hot Country breakfast delivered to your door. Only $20 for two huge delicious breakfasts delivered by a smiling face in the morning. The Amish Baked Oatmeal is to die for!

Text: Stayed in a Cedar cabin - they are back in the woods and very private.  The cabins are clean and spacious.  Hot breakfast can be delivered to your door if you request.  All in all, very nice for a getaway for two.
