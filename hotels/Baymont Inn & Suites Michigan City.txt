Baymont Inn & Suites Michigan City

Text: If purchasing a room online, don't be fooled by the photos. This place is a dump. Old and in need of renovation. Brown film floating in whirlpool in swimming area. The only thing worth mentioning is the beds are comfortable despite the tiny room they cram them in.

Text: Booked through expedia, so check in was fast. Got to our room to find that it smelled heavily of womens perfume, and a soiled bed. Spoke with the front desk, and was given a different room. The only real complaint that we had, was that the water pressure in the shower was very low, and that the toilet constantly ran. Other than that, the building is dated, but for the price, I cant complain.

Text: Older place. Really nice with indoor pool and hot tub. It has a private outdoor patio off the pool area. Gigantic lobby and eating area.

Text: Really nice hotel with a good size pool and hot tub, although the hot tub doesn't have any jets it's still really nice. The room fit our needs and also had a small balcony, with the right chairs and small table it would be really nice but they only have the old chairs from their last remodel.

Text: Clean rooms, comfortable beds. Electrical outlets are lacking. Only one available for refrigerator, microwave, & coffee maker. None were plugged in.
