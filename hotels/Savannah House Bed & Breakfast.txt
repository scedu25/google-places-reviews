Text: Oh how beautiful! This place doesn't look like much on the outside, but the inside is gorgeous. The rooms are comfortable and some bathrooms have jetted tubs! The manager is very personable and makes sure you have all you need! Breakfast is included in the price, and it is down-home, hot and delicious food...and a lot of it! Great price as well! ($70 for 3 people!)

Text: Rick and Carol do a fabulous job of making you feel at home.  The rooms are uniquely decorated and named.  A chair lift to the second floor is helpful for guests.  The cooked-to-order breakfast is delicious. I've stayed here three times and highly recommend it.  Who would have thought there was such a gem in the middle of no-where Kansas.
