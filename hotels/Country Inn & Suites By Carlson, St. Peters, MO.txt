Text: After a bad experience at another hotel in town we moved to this hotel. Every member of the staff we encountered were super friendly and just amazing. Nice room. Good breakfast. Great pool. Would never stay anywhere else in town now that we've found this gem.

Text: Had a great time at this property this weekend on our trip to visit St. Louis! The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the man who works the late shift at the front desk. He gave me some tips on cool places to visit while in town. The room was clean, beds comfortable, and the pool even has a hot tub, something that seems to be harder to come by at affordable hotel chains. Breakfast was better than some Country Inns I've stayed in. Overall a great stay!

Text: My wife and I stayed 3 nights at Country Inn & Suites in mid July 2017.  I can say without a doubt in my mind that this was by far the best hotel experience we've ever had.  The staff are absolutely amazing!!  Miss Yolanda & Miss Shae & Mr. Jake all made us feel right at home.  It wasn't any one thing they did, their attitude and willingness to ensure that everyone there has a wonderful experience.  At one point I was speaking with Miss Yolanda in the front foyer and another guest whom was checking out, a grown man with his family, ran up hugged and thanks then for their kindness.  So it was obvious this in common practice for them.  The rooms were clean & comfortable.  The showers were nice and spacious with good water pressure.  The hotel has on laundry and a decent breakfast in the morning.  There's an IHOP & McDonald's within walking distance if needed.  The owners have really got a great business and staff. It's obvious the work and care they put into their hotel.  Several times I saw the owners carrying groceries and doing laundry and helping in everyway.. Anytime I'm in the St Charles area I'll be staying here.
