Text: My sister had her wedding here in October, a lovely little place perfect for a small-medium sized group. Beds are available if one would want to stay overnight.

Text: My fiancé and I recently stayed at the Inn at Clover Hill.  The house is a picturesque farm house.  The fire place in the living room was perfect and toasty.  We stayed in the Rose Garden room.  The bathroom adjoined to the room was grand with a heated floor and a great shower!  The breakfast served by the owner was a full spread and very filling.  I especially enjoyed the yogurt parfait with fresh fruit and homemade granola.  We will definitely stay again!

Text: I came to Chillicothe for a business trip and only had 2 hotel choices of the Super 8 and Best Western.  After reading the reviews on those my stomach felt so uneasy, I was desperate.  I decided to check if there were any bed and breakfast places around and found the Inn at Clover Hill.  The pictures and website looked fine, but they do not compare to how nice the house actually is.  There is a gorgeous downstairs sitting area with a fire place and big screen tv.  I stayed in the Magnolia suite which was so cute and cozy.  Kathy, the owner, offered a cabinet full of snacks, had fresh homemade cookies upon my arrival and made the most delicious breakfasts.  I wish there was an Inn at Clover Hill B&B available in every town.  I usually stay at Hilton properties, but the best 5 star hotel does not even compare to the Inn at Clover Hill B&B.
