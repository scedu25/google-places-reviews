Text: This place has a nice enough look to it and considering what they put on the billboard they seem to be locally owned which is always a plus in many peoples books.  We went there due to our hardwood floors not being refinished in time.  It was late, we were tired and they wanted way to much for a room, for a local, late night while nothing big was going on in town.

Text: The hotel was nice enough, but it was the staff that made a real difference!  Dallas, and  another employee whos name I will post as soon as i find my notes (a woman), were polite, helpful, and went above and beyond. They are real assets to the company.

Text: Great hotel. It was clean, breakfast was ample, and the halls were quiet. We travel with pets and it isn't easy to find a clean, smell free, pet friendly hotel. I didn't use the pool but my husband and kids said it was warm. Besides having the worst pillows I've ever felt in my life, this hotel was perfect.
