Lazy Dog Camp Resort

Text: We have been here for about 2 months now and it has been a good experience. The ground is well kept, the guys are out there mowing the lawn every other day. The lots are very close to each other so early on when it was fishing season it got really crowded. Now the season is over the ground is half empty. The people who are still staying here mostly work long hour during the days (such as my husband) so it's quite and peaceful at day time.
It has a small laundry room with 2 washer and 2 dryers. For the price they charge monthly, I'd say it's a pretty good deal.

Text: Nice staff.  The office is a bait shop and the camp ground has a lake to fish.  The sites are pretty close together but level with a ? ring and table.  It has a pool and playground.  We didn't use either we just stayed overnight.

Text: They have been totally booked due to pipe line workers but managed to get us a spot. That enabled us to come and visit our nephew that we only get to see once a year. Great people that own it now.
