Hampton Inn by Hilton Owensboro South
Rating: 5
Text: The room was very clean and well stocked. Very modern conveniences and lots of power outlets. The staff was professional and courteous. My only issue was the toilet had a slow leak so it was constantly refilling the tank.

Text: Pretty standard hotel. Nothing really extraordinary. Room, bathroom, linens all clean. Morning breakfast bland like all morning breakfasts at hotels. Fairly good selection of dry cereals, juice machine, waffle iron, oatmeal, warm ham and scrambled eggs. Pool area looked clean, but I didn't use on this visit. I did notice a handicap lift for getting in and out of pool. Workout room was clean with the normal hotel equipment. All was in working order.
