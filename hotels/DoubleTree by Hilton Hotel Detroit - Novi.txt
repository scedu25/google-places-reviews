Text: Our stay was great, nice, clean, spacious. Refrigerator with water. Very good breakfast.Staff is very nice, helpful, and kind. They make you feel welcome. They treated us like I would treat someone in my home. They even found us some ice cream when we came in after dinner and couldn't find some at the local gas/convenient store. Would definitely stay here, and recommend people to stay here.

Text: I've started here many times over the last 10 years. The recent remodel is a welcome change, and makes the hotel even an even more pleasant place to stay. The rooms are remarkably quiet, thanks to the cinder block construction, so noisy neighbors are not a problem.
