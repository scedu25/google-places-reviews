Text: we booked the extend stay suite for the night at first it looked nice but then we find crumbs on top of the fridge cob webs on the walls along with something not sure what it was. but when we pulled out the sleeper sofa the sheets were dirty so we went and asked for clean ones and the front desk person gave them and was very sorry about it. then we pulled off the old ones and this horrible smell took over the room we pulled up the mattress and there was mold and other dirt stains on it. we went back up to the front desk to ask for a roll away bed and again she got it for us and was again very sorry she did not charge us for the roll away. the pool was cold and nasty the hot tub was nice. but we could not get in the pool. the next day at check out the did take $24 off the bill but not sure if we will be staying there anytime soon. it kinda put a damper on the girls weekend. since we book because it had a pool and the pull out bed.

Text: The only thing that saved this hotel is the service at the front desk! The rooms were very dirty and I found food in the couch. It is the only hotel in that town or I would have stayed somewhere else. #wantmymoneyback #hotelfail
