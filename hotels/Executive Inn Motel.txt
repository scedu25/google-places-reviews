Executive Inn Motel

Text: Was the most disgusting motel I have ever stayed in, the doors don't lock, it smelled like it was 200 years old and dead spiders in the bathroom, half roll of toilet paper in the bathroom, horrible place to stay! Spend the extra $17 and stay at the Super 8. The lobby says "no refunds" for a reason, they should pay ppl to stay there.

Text: What did I like about it? Probably the only thing was the price but I guess you get what you pay for. I have to say though, I really did like the receptionists, they were helpful. But the room was awful. First thing we see when we get there is a random glove in the drawer by the TV and then Taco Bell TRASH in the drawer by the bed. Then, pulling back the sheets to one of the beds, there was a brown nasty stain on them. Seriously?! AND We only got one thing of shampoo for a room for 3 adults. The lock on the door was very "ghetto" haha. Its a good place to stay if you want to fear for your life and don't like cleanliness.

Text: Well the faucet on the hot tub flew up to the ceiling when turned on.  Smelled like mold.  My sinuses got really irritated.  The guy at front desk called me at 1240 at night fo bring my i.d. up to him cause the lady that checked me in didnt know how. How rude.  Not to mention the fact they smelled of alcohol.  And dirty bathroom.  But the bed was comfortable!
