Blue Stone Inn

Text: The price is well in the budget market... But there are several caveats to know of 1.) some of the room fixtures are dated and may not be up to use. (one room had a sink that is not attached to the underside of the counter. 2.) wifi is terrible due to the way the owner's have set up their network. 3.) not all ac/heat units work well.

Text: Seen drugs being done in the parking lot, a fight in the parking lot and a raged man at 0230 yelling for one of his girls who was in another room and he lost her.  Roach crawling on my wall, used bar of soap and shampoo bottle in the tub and long black hairs on the shower wall.  I'M BALD. No refunds.

Text: I wouldn't even give it a star!! Druggies everywhere police and sheriff's are in N out, owner does not care about safety and his cameras don't work! Also found out after being there a week that they only remodeled the rooms because of bed bugs a month prior... Do yourself and everyone else a favor and just don't go! Place needs to be shut down permentaly!!

Text: The best "Bang for your Buck" hotel I have ever experienced.  The room is super clean and comfortable.  The amenities are priceless; new TV, wireless internet provided, excellent service staff.  Some of the most humble management staff I have ever met.  It was a pleasure spending my visit in this establishment and I will recommend and continue to use this hotel only for my Central Ohio needs.

Text: This motel... I repeat motel, is cheap but has roach problems and some of the rooms beed some serious work. Like curtains replaced, ac's worked on, carpets replaced, cabinets fixed and updated TV's in all room. and either do smoking in some rooms and give ppl a choice ir ban smoking from rooms all together. Also the cleaning staff is a bit rude at times.
