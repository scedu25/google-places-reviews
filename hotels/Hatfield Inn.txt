Text: Most comfortable room for money EVER!  Great beds, tub, fridge, micro. ........if you are looking for a room, go here!  Eggs, sausage, pancakes for breakfast.  I've paid 3 times for far less.  I will make a point to route further journeys here.

Text: We made a reservation for a room at the hotel 2 months in advance and assumed everything would be kosher. We had a wedding to attend and was traveling from out of town. There was a mistake made with our reservation and I spoke with Dana via phone almost 3 weeks before we were supposed to stay, we were assured we would have a room. Upon our arrival, we were told we did NOT have a room and that the manager of the hotel, Gail, had cancelled our reservation. They could not tell us why our reservation was cancelled or were we ever notified of this. It was the only hotel within a 25 mile radius and why the manager would not be on site is beyond me (Weekend is the busiest time). The most disorganized hotel I have ever been to and I am so glad we gave our money to the Hampton Inn. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone and if you think you have a reservation please check two or three times for they have zero sense to tell you if it has been cancelled and what is even better is that they will not be able to give you a reason as to why.

Text: Small rooms, perfect for two people in the queen bedroom. Breakfast was good. Normal inn nothing special nothing bad.
