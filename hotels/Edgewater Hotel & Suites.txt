Edgewater Hotel & Suites
Rating: 4
Text: We have stayed here several times. The room was newly updated. Refrigerator, sink, microwave, couch, chair and flat screen TV in one room and 2 beds and bathroom in second room. Always clean and staff is friendly. We always get the School's Out Special which includes a golf cart for the duration of our stay. We go in the middle of the week rather than weekend, and have a great time without jam-packed crowds.

Text: Hotel was newly remodeled and had great TV and bathroom. WiFi was extremely spotty however and we had issues connecting numerous times. Staff was pleasant, if a bit unprofessional; It certainly didn't feel like checking in to a hotel.

Text: Nice location, long list of rules kinda imposing. Golf cart constantly coming in and out. Close to all the fun though.

Text: I literally don't even want to give them one star. Also owned by the put in bay resort. Please. These are the most terrible owners I've ever come across. They charge you for a night at the island you can't even get to because the ferries are not running. In the words I've heard all night long from many In the same position as me, these people are SNAKES. BEWARE. if you value supporting local business with kind hearts?? Do not take your business here. Their advice was to charter a plane. Oh, yeah ok. Because I'm made of money. No. Just a single working momma trying to get a break and have fun. Thanks edgewater. You have taught me a valuable lesson. We will never, ever be back. It made me sick to even give one star.
