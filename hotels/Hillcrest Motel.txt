Hillcrest Motel
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel may look a bit old from the outside but, rooms are pretty clean and has everything that you'll find in a 3 star motel. They do have a outdoor pool and also serve continental breakfast, all this at just 45/50 bucks a night. The location is ideal for a town like Norton where fast food restaurants, ATM's, banks, gas stations and also a county hospital are all at a walkable distance.

Text: For budget hotels, it's a 5-star in my experience. Excellent bed, large wall-mounted flatscreen, good bathroom facilities, AC not overly noisy, mini-fridge and microwave, large closet (!), clean, very quiet. Only $46 including tax on a summer weeknight. Can't beat that.
