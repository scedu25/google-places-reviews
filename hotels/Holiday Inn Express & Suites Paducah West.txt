Holiday Inn Express & Suites Paducah West

Text: Check in was fast, efficient, and friendly.  Hotel was clean, inviting and quiet for having no vacancy.  Room 335 was tidy and ready for us when we arrived.  I love the fact you don't have to slide the room key, so with my wallet I could just leave the key in it and hold my wallet to the door.  Genius!  Breakfast was a typical Marriott breakfast full of choices of premium items and the woman in charge of taking care if it on 9-30-17 was great, she was fast, efficient, and professional. Kudos to the staff.  Thank you for a wonderful visit.

Text: After many years staying at Hampton Inns we are looking for something else of similar value. We were very impressed with this Holiday Inn. It is new. Very nice room, walk in shower which we prefer, nice breakfast and great, comfortable lobby. Front desk friendly, efficient and helpful. Highly recommended.

Text: Arrived at about 10:30p, and was able to get the last room available at a reasonable rate. The front desk staff were very friendly, as was the morning/breakfast staff! They all made sure we had everything  we needed and we're satisfied. Nice breakfast with a good variety of both hot and cold items. The room was spacious and clean, with a microwave and mini fridge. Overall, excellent location, building, and staff! Would definitely stay again!

Text: They were so accommodating and helpful with the exact type room I needed. I checked 5 places before finding them. It was late and they were still very helpful. Nice clean rooms.

Text: Love this hotel!  It was comfortable, clean, friendly but what got us was the home baked warm cookies and milk in lobby at bed time.  As if that wonderful and tempting bed was not enough to make us look forward to climbing in it.  After a long days drive, this place was a wonderful spot and we already look forward to staying there again on our next trip.
