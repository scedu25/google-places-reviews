Text: I've never had a bad experience here. My family comes 1-2 times per month, sometimes more. The food is wonderful and the service is spot on. Try the Pho, the spring rolls appetizer and the Singapore noodles. Everything I've tried is good but those are my favorites!

Text: A wonderful laid-back atmosphere of live music and friendly staff.
   The only dark spot on what was otherwise an enchanting surprise date for the lady of my dreams. The only thing that would send me running to McDonald's. The staff seem bound amd determined to take your plate
   Nothing, and i mean nothing pets my peve more than someone *taking* my plate before I have fully enjoyed my meal.

BITES PEOPLE!!

FULL BITES!!!!
