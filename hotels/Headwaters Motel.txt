Text: Off the beaten path,  quiet, rustic old style motel. Not as clean as I like. The beds need sweeping under. Has soap dispenser on wall in shower and above sink.  Our room had a microwave and mini fridge they were clean. The room is done in mossy oak camouflage curtin and sheets. And a electric fireplace nice effect. I labeled it a guys place.  The desk clerk possibly owner, was very nice. We arrived about 7 pm I asked if the room had a coffee pot he said no but he would find us one. Ok for the price.

Text: Great place for the price, rustic / hunting type decor, no breakfast or pool but that is ok, I would say again.
