Spur Oil RV Park

Text: Great for overnight parking. Right off the freeway, easy to get to, easy to navigate in our 40ft RV with a tow vehicle (didn't have to unhook). Full hookups. The spots are grass, and we pulled in after heavy rain; we were concerned about getting stuck but we didn't have any problems. There's a gas station with a little cafe in it. We didn't eat, but it smelled good. I'd stop here again for an overnight.

Text: Bargain stop. Not much for scenery, but right off expressway, full service and great rates.

Text: 30/50amp, water & sewer, 70ft long drive through spots, $25/night and secluded and not busy...what else could you ask for! This will definitely be our planned overnight stop between NC & OH!  It's not fancy but it has everything you need including a small convenience store with fuel.

Text: Staff was real nice. Park would be a good overnight stop. Restrooms are a disaster.
