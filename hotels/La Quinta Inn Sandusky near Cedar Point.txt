La Quinta Inn Sandusky near Cedar Point
Rating: 3
Text: The hotel itself was fine. Thin walls, slightly strange smell, smokers directly outside entrances all the time, but the bed was comfortable enough. Basically what you would expect from a La Quinta. Better than average breakfast. Under no circumstances, however, should you give them any contact information. I have been bombarded with multiple emails daily since staying there despite having not signed up for any marketing. Attempting to unsubscribe has not yet eliminated the spam. I also received unsolicited text messages during and after my stay. It's a La Quinta, I just want a clean bed for a night and to be left alone otherwise.

Text: Some aspects of the hotel seem a bit outdated (pink tub), but overall it's pretty nice. It's located an easy 10 minute drive from Cedar Point. There's plenty to eat and play nearby when you aren't at the park. We got a room with a very large jacuzzi that will easily fit two adults. Breakfast is pretty standard. I would stay here again.

Text: Arrived later than expected.  The staff could not have been nicer.  They upgraded our room.  Moved their vehicle to make sure our vehicle was in the most secure site.  The room was very nice & comfortable.  A nice clean place.  I would recommend this place.

Text: We stayed here on a last minute decision during a long trip. We were pleased with the level of service (very professional and considerate) and the room was appropriate for the price paid- clean, well maintained. The door lock was a little challenging at times (a bit sticky) , but nothing that made us feel unsafe. The hotel is about 5-8 miles off the turnpike, but it isn't taking one too far out of the way. Overall, it was a nice experience.
