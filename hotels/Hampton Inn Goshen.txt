Hampton Inn Goshen

Text: The staff here lied to our face about charges and then overcharged our group. The manager on duty assured us there would be no charges after the reservations and room numbers were screwed up multiple times. Before I left, I checked on the room charges, which I gladly would have paid, but the staff said they would stand behind Hampton Inn's 100 percent satisfaction guarantee. The hotel manager went behind his staff's back and charged us without even notifying the customer. We even have a voicemail from the hotel stating that there would be no charges. The manager then proceeded to tell us over the phone we would pay for it, we shouldn't have stayed there if there was a question over the charges and that his manager on duty at the time didn't have the authority to cancel any charges. I've never seen such poor management at a place of business. I will not stay at a Hampton Inn again. I would advise you to stay away from this place.
