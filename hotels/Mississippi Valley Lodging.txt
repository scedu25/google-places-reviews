Text:  This hotel should be given negative stars but Google forced me to put one. You would most likely have better luck fitting your family in a shoebox rather than one of these rooms. We were first greeted by a critter crawling on our wall which we so graciously terminated for them. The staff is incredibly rude. While getting ready in the room I sat on the corner of the bed to put my shoes on and the bed collapsed because they have it held up on PLASTIC. We left the room for the night to attend an event and the "maid" went into our room and went through our personal belongings. We were out of towners and we were treated like it. We were blamed for taking a mirror off the wall. What their highly intelligent staff didn't realize is the mirror DID NOT belong to them we had brought it in from our car. When leaving this "hotel" I cleaned up all of our belongings and took the trash out for them and was polite to the lady on staff. Who I later find out was one falsely accusing us of "destroying" their room.
