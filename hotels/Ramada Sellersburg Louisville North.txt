Text: I arrived before check-in time and they were able to place me into a room. However the room was very damp smelling. The bed was comfortable. The room was fairly clean. Parking was convenient.

Text: Room wasn't ready.  Door was open...no toilet paper,  no towels,  the floor was dirty.   When I went to ask for these things the front desk acted as if it was our fault these things weren't in the room.  It was said the housekeeping called off for the day. And the help they had was rude as well.  Saying they weren't finish with the room and I asked why we were placed in the room,  knowingly that it was ready.  Point blank I will not visit this hotel chain again... not a satisfied lodger......

Text: Comfortable King Bed.  Quiet and away from traffic.  Room was stuffy.  AC must not have been working properly.  Stepping out into the hallway after a good nights sleep I could feel the hallway was cooler and less humid than the room were in.  Would stay here again.
