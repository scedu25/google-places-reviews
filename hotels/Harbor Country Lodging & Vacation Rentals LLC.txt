Text: We enjoyed our stay at one of their properties in New Buffalo. At check-in, the staff was friendly and helpful, offering ideas on local dining and attractions.  The only drawback was really out of their control, as recent storms had damaged the hot tub at the property  we rented, but they did offer the use of the hot tub at the main property instead.
