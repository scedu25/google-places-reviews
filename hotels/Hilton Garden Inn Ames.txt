Text: Very nice staff. The room was clean. However one of the lamps didn’t work and the door wouldn’t shut all the way unless you pulled it shut forcefully.

Text: As always a nice place to stay. Would be better if they toned down the chlorine in the pool, but also understand it needs a certain balance. Wish they would include continental breakfast at no extra charge.

Text: Pros: Common areas well kept Room very clean Cookies, tea, water and coffee on table as you walk in Front desk completed check-in in about 1 minute because I booked with my Honors credit card Pool and hot tub area well maintained Gym small but very clean 
Cons: Thermostat was broken in our room so adjusting temperature had to be done on unit by window Bed has adjustable firmness/softness but the adjustments are for the whole bed, not just one side so my wife and I had to find a compromise.
Coffee and hot water for tea we're out multiple times during the stay which was annoying but didn't affect us much  Overall a nice place to stay.

Text: I came from Nigeria for a two weeks training at Iowa State University. I spent ten days in the Hilton Garden Inn. I love the place. The hotel staff are very warm, the food is nice and the rooms are cosy and clean. Guess what they also have lots of complimentary service for guest..

Text: As always a great lodging experience. Rooms vary clean, appliances are new, the hotel has a small bar and they provide breakfast in the morning so it is very convenient.
