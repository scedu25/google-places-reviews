The Leisure Suite
Rating: 5
Text: Dang, your life will change after you stop by the Leisure Suite. You don't just get a little taste of happiness--no man-- it's like escaping into an alternate reality. Enjoy some conversation, steaming mugs of caffeine, bumping to some catchy indie beats, or even some casual reading in one of our many assortments of vintage furniture pieces. Pick up one of our tomes on Linguistic Theories, or a commentary on the Gospel according to Mark, if that's more your style.
Stop by and "let's fix what's been broken. Words have been stolen, but silence is golden...Just a place to meet. We can press repeat. And do what we do when we're there..."
