Text: Great place to stay! The complimentary breakfast had great options to choose from. Location of hotel is great as well. In walking distance of 2 restaurants and a Wal-Mart. Room was nice and clean and beds were comfy. Only issue was housekeeping walked in my room twice and both times without knocking. Otherwise a wonderful stay!

Text: My wife and I prepaid for a King room the night before our stay and upon arrival received two Queens (not typically a big deal). I went back to the front desk to ask to be moved and I was told that no King rooms were left and we were bumped (without notification) because we weren't VIP club members.

Upon getting into the room, we found that the sheets were stained and the room wasn't super clean. There was a ton of noise throughout the entire hotel and it did not stop all evening.

My wife went to the front desk to grab a bottle of water and the staff member (Miranda) was extremely rude and unhelpful.

Personally, I would stay somewhere else in the area if possible.

Text: Very nice staff,  upgraded our room because they didn't have a rollaway as we had requested. Every Marriott experience we have is excellent! Highly recommend this location!
