Text: This hotel went above and beyond to make for a pleasant stay. 
The manager called our room about an hour after we checked in to make sure everything was to our liking. 
They had Neutrogena toiletry products and even had bath gel and make up wipes.
The room was super clean. I take bathes for muscle pain and usually underneath the bathtub soap holder isn't very clean, but it was spotless at this hotel.
The breakfast buffet was extensive and very good. There was an assortment of coffee and tea to make in the room.
The air unit had where you could set it by degree, instead of just "hi - low". The unit also actually cooked the room down, most hotel air units are very hard to get to cool off a room very effectively.
We will definitely make an effort to stay here again when we travel nearby.

Text: Nice hotel. Wonderful friendly faculty, clean rooms, I just wish they had biscuits and gravy for breakfast or plain scrambled eggs and not those omelette cheese things.

Text: It was a nice place.  The staff I interacted with was very polite.  I want to thank the lady who prepares the breakfast. She understood my request for a Kosher breakfast and delivered. Thank you.

Text: Awesome We always stop at this Hampton Inn on the way to Bonnaroo. I appreciate the staff, and the convenience for our family. We look forward to our stay every year. I like the cleanliness of the rooms, and the whole place actually. My husband appreciates its closeness to food and the road.
