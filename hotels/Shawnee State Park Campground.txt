Shawnee State Park Campground

Text: We camp here every October due to a large family gathering. Unfortunately sometimes it falls on the same weekend as the fall festival and we can't get a site because everything is booked as soon as they can be booked. Hopefully my nephew can get us a walk in site this year. I'm on the list if anyone should cancel, but the last time that happened I was not notified and I just happened to see where someone canceled and I jumped right on it! It is a very beautiful place and the staff is always very friendly.

Text: I went into the forest hiking trail a little down the road which was really lovely. 

There is a lake with a sand beach. 

There are public restrooms (port a potty style in a cabin) with a soap dispenser in the wall and a spigot for water just outside. The spigot was locked when I attended yesterday, likely shut off for winter. 

There is a large parking lot with many picnic tables and grilling stations where you could start a fire. There were also little corners to shield from wind where you could make a campfire. There is a dumpster at the edge of the parking lot as well as frisbee golf throughout the park.

Text: Very nice State Park, with very helpful staff. I was originally in a primitive site, but the lack of sizable trees made it difficult to use my hammock tent! I explained this to the staff and they hooked me up with a good spot no problem!

Text: A cute campground in a nice area.  Many of the sites are a challenge for a camping trailer though so beware that you may not be able to get your trailer on the site you picked.  A 25' site is 25' of pad all the way to the road.  A 25' trailer will not fit on that site as the tongue will stick into the road.
