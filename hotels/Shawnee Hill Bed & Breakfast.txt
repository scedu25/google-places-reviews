Shawnee Hill Bed & Breakfast

Text: Stayed for the eclipse and would love you come back. If you are definitely into wine, then you found a great place to stay at. Located fairly centrally, easy to find and great host! The cabin I stayed at (The Victorian) was lovely and very cute. Also if you are planning booking, get Rhea to cook the breakfast. You will not be sorely disappointed!

Text: The log cabin suite at Shawnee Hill is such a special treat.  It feels so cozy from the moment you walk in the door.  We have enjoyed the scenic location each year as well.  Our host and hostess have thought of everything and have designed a comfortable, restful, and romantic getaway.

Text: We stayed here while visiting the wine trail. We stayed in the Log Cabin room and loved it! Very much like a log cabin! Very cozy! The breakfast in the morning was also great! We will come back!
