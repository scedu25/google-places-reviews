Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Effingham
Rating: 2
Text: Comfortable rooms and great breakfast, but bad service. We had been in our room for about an hour and a half and I received a call around 6:15pm from the front desk that there had already been two noise complaints from neighbors... AND the front desk felt the need to remind us that quiet hours are from 11pm to 8am. Our family was settling into bed for the night since we were driving all day. I feel the front desk should have reminded the neighbors of quiet hours instead of us especially on a "first offense" and before sundown no less.

Text: We stopped after a 300+ mile ride. The place was an oasis for sure! Nice lobby. Excellent service. The room was spectacular as well as affordable. Left with a belly so full from the hot breakfast bar I didn't stop for lunch!

Text: Average Fairfield, nothing special or anything stands out. Good location off the highway and access to national chain restaurants boost the score little bit. Hotel Jim has enough for one person doing weights, two treadmills, one bike, and 1 elliptical
