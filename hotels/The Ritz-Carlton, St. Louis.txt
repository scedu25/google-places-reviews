Text: I visited the cigar club as a guest. The service was spectacular and the ventilation system did a good job of clearing the smoke out of the air. They only issue I had was the lack of selection for beer. The liquor and wine assortment was vast but it seemed that only AB beers were available. Overall a great experience.

Text: Wonderful flashback to a time of older elegance and sophistication in St Louis. Service is always impeccable and the lounge is a great place to sit back and relax.
