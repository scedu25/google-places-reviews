Comfort Suites Cincinnati Airport
Rating: 3
Text: Very nice room. Front desk staff very friendly. Breakfast more than satisfying. The only thing that kept me from giving them a five was that two of the housekeeping staff stood outside our room and had a 30 minute argument.

Text: Had a good comfortable stay here for a week. I have a low maintenance family so we were fine on our own (not a lot of staff presence or personal interaction). The reason this place doesn't have more stars from me is because the bathroom was never cleaned/sheets never changed, and the pool was dirty and peeling.

Text: The rooms were very clean. And the air conditioning was excellent. It looked like it was full when we visited, but I didn't here any other guests, so the sound proofing was good. The breakfast buffet, was not the best that I've had, but it served its purpose.

Text: Not perfect, but not all that bad either. The pool could definitely use some attention, and the rooms are showing some wear. But the room we had was pretty spacious. Breakfast was fine, and the staff was great.

Text: The room I reserved several weeks in advance was not available at check in and the staff was not helpful. I was told I had to talk to a manager 2 days later at check out. The manager was not helpful either, saying that a discount or refund was not possible since I pre-paid. The sofa was dangerous with springs sticking out and the pool was in need of repair. Their customer service needs updating along with their facilities. The Country Inn and Suites across the street looked much nicer.
