Motel 6 Ann Arbor Mi
Rating: 4
Text: Location is super convenient, right off I-94 and maybe 20 minutes from Detroit Metro Airport.

Rooms have been recently (if cheaply) upgraded in Motel 6's new minimalist studio style.  This meant clean, no odors although couldn't hide signs of age and wear around doors, walls.

A fair bit of sound bleed from the next room.  Not horrible, but noticeable. 

Check in was easy.  Clerk friendly and efficient.  Overall, compared to other Motel 6's (my choice when hitting the road with pets due to cost and convenience) it was above average, not spectacular.  You get exactly what you'd expect at this price point.  No more, but certainly no less.  Picking on little flaws (they're not hard to find) or comparing it to pricier options is counterproductive.  I'd stay here again if I was just looking for a place to crash for a night.

Text: The room was nice.  Carpet would have been better.  And I know it's a motel but because it's Ann Arbor I thought maybe I wouldn't see this. But there were a lot of shady looking people around.  Which can make you feel unsafe. I know its hard to really monitor who you rent a room to. But it may be worth looking in to. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay. Also, the room was more than I originally booked it for online. Which is why I stayed the one night instead of two like I planned.

Text: Our stay was good The staff were friendly, and the room was acceptably clean. My only complaint would be that the heater in room 209 is as loud as a lawn mower. You'll want to look into this. Management should also look into the diversity of their customers, and pricing policies. Our daughter was in U of M Hospital for emergency surgery, but because there was a football game, we were priced (by 4x the non football nights) out of our room for the last 2 nights we had to be in town.

Text: The rooms are clean and the staff friendly and responsive. The heat and fan worked well. The deadbolt on our door would not retract. We were given a new room and the keys brought to us immediately with an apology. The outlet near the sink did not work in the 2nd room. General maintenance may need to be improved. We appreciated being able to book a room with a microwave and refrigerator.

Text: Room was clean. No frills but the beds were comfy. That's all we used the room for was to sleep. For what you get, even though it was a football weekend, the price is still a bit high. Location is good; looks like there are other businesses being built around here.
