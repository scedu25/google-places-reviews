Deluxe Motel

Text: Impressed by the small town charm, cleanliness, friendly staff, comfortable bed, oversized shower with great water pressure, etc.  If you need a chain hotel with a crappy coffee maker in your bathroom, you don't want to stay here.  If the things I've listed, plus a terrific price, are imlortant you should look here.  The only criticism I have is the parking arrangement.  I'm looking forward to staying there again soon.

Text: Clean but I have constructive criticism. 

The AC thermostat doesn't work. Had to turn it WAY down to cool the room from a 90+ day.

The oversized shower has no light inside. Very dark. The toilet is extremely close to the wall on the right hand side and there was a fuzzy carpeted bathmat on the floor that I immediately kicked under the sink. In my opinion no bathroom should have carpet of any kind.

We never got the wifi password and when we went back to the desk no one was there. We could have tried harder and gotten I'm sure but we're lazy.

None of this is to say that you shouldn't stay here. It's a clean room at a good price. The TV is HUGE. The drive in theater down the road was a blast. Its also good to see an old town with a functioning main street. It's kinda dead on the weekend I guess but every storefront is filled and would make for a nice after dinner walk.

Text: The single rooms are small but they do seem to be remodeled to be more modern and they're kept clean.
