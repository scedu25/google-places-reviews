Text: Not a bad stay. The only 2 things that I'd complain about is the TV and viewing choices were horrible because the quality of the movies were like watching bootleg movies and then the heater unit was a bit noisy and squealed a little, but the rooms were very clean and comfortable beds with nice pillows, which seems to be rare in most hotels. Slept great, quiet rooms (besides heater), great showers with excellent water pressure. The pool was nice and the hottub decent. Last hour of the pool from 11-12 is without kids in case you want a little adult time. Staff was helpful and very nice. Great location right off the highway. Good shopping malls close by and lots of eating choices in the area.
