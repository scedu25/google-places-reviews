SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Naperville/Warrenville
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed in a king room. Nice layout, plenty of room. Had a mini fridge, everything was clean, comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. The desk clerk was very courteous and welcoming. Breakfast in the morning was very crowded but continuously being refreshed by staff. Excellent stay.

Text: This is what SpringHill Suites by Marriott should be like.  Friendly folks who know the ropes.  The breakfast was above par as always.  The sitting area in the lobby was nice.  The rooms are all suites hence the name with separate living and dining prep areas.  Always a pleasure to stay when the kiddos are in tow, which by the way is always.

Text: Nothing extraordinary. Being a Marriott Gold member gets you a gronola bar and water at check in. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are clean. The free breakfast has an average selection including a waffle iron and oatmeal with many toppings. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and got what I expected.
