Road Home RV Park

Text: It's part of the hotel, very nice people and place to be. Draw backs are gravel lot, and pretty uneven in parking areas. Other than that they let you use hotel facilities like laundry, ice machine... 30 & 50 plug in as well.

Text: It's essentially a car park with hookups next to a hotel. A Google maps overhead view will give you an idea of what to expect. Just don't expect a playground, pool, RV shop etc. Think Walmart car park with full hookups. 

Staff inside the hotel where you check in were very friendly. 

It is what it is. You just need to manage your expectations as to what it is. A KOA it most definitely is not. I've given it 5 stars because it met expectations for what it is and the staff were super friendly. 

Closest RV Park we could find near Fort Larned.
