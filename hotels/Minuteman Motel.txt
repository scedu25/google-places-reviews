Text: TVs from 1984...smells like my grandma's house..and that's not really a good thing... It's a place to crash but a little updating would go a long way

Text: Cleanliness is the most important thing to me, and the room was VERY clean (also spacious, quiet, and a good price). Nothing new (even the TV wasn't a flat screen) or fancy, but all the basics for a night on the road.
