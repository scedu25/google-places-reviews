Super 8 Liberty NE Kansas City Area

Text: This would be a wonderful place to stay if you want hair on your sheets, pillow case AND the toilet!! That is correct the toliet, long hair at that. The room smelled musty, dirty. The bathroom has black mold. The air conditioner are in  terrible condition. The breakfast in the morning, fruit flies flying around it.
   So NO I would NOT recommend this Super 8 motel.

Text: Thankfully they had availability during the eclipse day last minute. It's pretty much what you expect to get for what you pay for. The beds were fine but a bit scratchy. Didn't really get their full experience due to the power going out in the building due to a massive thunderstorm. AC fried due to the brownout it caused.

Text: The room was very nice & clean. The bed was also comfortable & the room itself smelled fresh when I walked thru the door.

Text: I spent the evening and morning of 9-13-17, at the super 8 motel and had a pleasant stay, the room all in all was reasonable priced. I would definitely recommend staying at the super 8 again
