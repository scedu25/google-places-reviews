Text: Amazing customer service... incredibly "out-of-their-way" service. A friend of mine walked over to the juice machine (at 11pm) and we asked if it was off, the front desk guy said "yeah but that's no problem I can't fix!" And turned it on for us. Also, I busted my shoe while down here and asked if by chance the front desk had super glue, and the woman totally went beyond her necessary response of "not up here, sorry!" (which I was expecting) and found the maintenance guy and had him find me super glue.

Text: This facility is by far the best I've stayed in. Nice spacious and clean rooms. The staff are very friendly and go above and beyond for their guest. I absolutely love staying here every time I'm in town the accommodations are nice. Very family-friendly or business-friendly
