Text: Everything was great, including the complimentary breakfast! Wonderful price for a suite, we only paid $99 with taxes it was $115! The only part we did not like was the pool not being open 24/7 but hey that's most places, right? I highly recommend and would definitely stay again. The lady that checked my family and I in was incredibly nice as well!

Text: Nice hotel, our room was comfortable, & clean. The hot tub was so nice! It was not quiet thanks to the constant trains that pass by, but if you're not a light sleeper then that will not bother you. The parking lot is abysmally small, but if you don't have a trailer that shouldn't be a problem for you either.

Text: Room was nice and clean, though it did have a little bit of an odd smell, which we only noticed for a minute or so each time we entered the room. Ac and fridge worked well. Bathroom was spacious, serviceable, and clean. Service was very slow. Breakfast had many options, but many offerings were reluctantly Mai trained and refilled, and several hot items tasted strange.
