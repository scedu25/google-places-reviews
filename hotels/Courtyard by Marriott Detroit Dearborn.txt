Rating: 4
Text: Really nice Courtyard - friendly staff, comfortable beds, and we had a nice balcony with a lovely view of the courtyard. Great location, not far from downtown. Would have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the ice machines (all three floors) were absolutely nonfunctional. But otherwise would highly recommend.
