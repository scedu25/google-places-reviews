Days Inn
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel did a great job of accommodating the crowd of sun-chasers that descended upon the place (myself included) to witness totality on 08/21.  The continental breakfast was decent and the hotel had an attached Chinese buffet that was superb and they had a very large array of choices.  My favorite was the scallops on the shell and coconut chicken.  A minor issue with my room was taken care of very quickly and to my satisfaction.  They were pet friendly so I shared a room with my little girl.  The premises were very clean and my bed was comfortable.  It was a very pleasant and fun weekend in Madisonville, KY
