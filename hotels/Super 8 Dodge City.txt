Text: Room said non smoking, but had definitely been smoked in. The room was absolutely infested with bugs. (flies, spiders, and beetles)  It also must have not been used or cleaned in at least a month due to the cobwebs and bugs (live and dead) Had to go buy a blanket from Walmart and sleep on top of the covers because I was too scared to sleep under the disgusting blankets on the bed. Wish I could give this 0 stars.

Text: The t.v. didn't work and we found used soap in the shower. The getting desk was rude so we shortened or stay. We got way better service at an other hotel.
