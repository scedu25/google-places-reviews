Hill Street Inn

Text: Very dirty for the third year in a row. I've stayed here for as long as I can remember every time I come to town to work at the hospital. I politely let them know about a dirty in the past but nothing has changed. This time candy on carpet, hair everywhere, toothpaste stuck on counter top, dirty tabletop, etc. Its time to search other towns for a motel.

Text: This is a great inn and has a decent price.  The inn was clean and the service was great.  I stayed there for 5days.  I was glad I found this Inn instead of having to drive 45mins to Norfolk.

Text: Nice place to stay in a cute little town off the highway.  Very clean, refrigerator in the room, comfy bed and pillows.  The free wireless internet was a nice find also.  Would come again.
