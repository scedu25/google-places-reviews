Text: Hotel was supposed to have pool.i made reservation here specifically so grandchildren could swim . I had had checked several times to be sure pool was available. Hallways smelled awful. Kids eat free was advertised yet kids only eat free if you ordered specific items off menu. Staff was unable to compensate us for any issues we had because we made reservation through Priceline.  Very disappointed was supposed to be surprise trip for grandchildren - swimming at hotel and trip to zoo in morning. Zoo was great hotel was not. We have stayed at holiday inn express many times as my oldest granddaughter is in competition  gymnastics and have never had issues so expected same from holiday inn. Will not recommend to anyone.

Text: Halls and elevator not air conditioned. AC units in rooms were actually oversized so they cooled the room too quickly to have much moisture removed so the rooms were cool and damp feeling. That said, rooms were clean and staff was helpful and polite.

Text: No doubt the best customer service at a hotel I have ever experienced. They went above and beyond their duties, and actually care that each guest in the hotel has a fantastic experience.

Text: Nice clean motel, easy to access, great parking. Check in hosts were awesome, check out host not so much. Nice breakfast.

Text: Got my room for a great rate by using a coupon from a book picked up at an Ohio travel plaza. The room was clean and comfortable and the night time staff was very friendly and helpful. The entire experience was pleasant. Not detracting, but there was a strange odor in the lobby.
