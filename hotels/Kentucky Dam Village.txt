Text: Great place for a fun weekend. When we were tucking in our kids the last night, my son started tearing up and said, "I'm going to miss Kentucky!"  Thanks for the great lodging and hospitality

Text: Park is pretty and staff is friendly.  The golf course was really nice.  If you have any mobility issues, this is not a place for you.  The facilities are spread out over a great distance.   We booked a king room, but they are not accessible, so we were given a room with 2 full beds.  Husband and I slept separately.  The pool is not accessible (only ladders).   The beach is a long slope of rocky sand.  They are pet friendly now, so we had a barking dog in the next room for 2 days.  No plans to return, but will try a different park.

Text: Great food and a very friendly staff. It has an absolutely beautiful view of the lake and a nice lounge area upstairs. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because it was so cold in there we cut the meal short and left. Didn't think we would need long sleeves in August!
