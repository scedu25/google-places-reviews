Text: Food is amazing and rooms are clean and it's very quiet and peaceful. The rooms are small but nicely organized. WiFi works great and so does cable. But the food at the café is really good and the restaurant was enjoyable with all the history. Not a place for a family to come stay the limit is only 2 people per room.
