Acorns Resort

Text: They need new towels and items in the kitchen.  Pans are dirty and can opener is broken.  The floors needed mopped really badly.  The floors were sticky and there were cobwebs in the bedrooms. My white socks were black after walking through. Simple and rustic is fine but dirty is gross.

Text: Went there to spend an evening with friends. The resort was very nice and I liked the look of the cabin and the facilities. The cabin we were in had a big enough living area for all of our friends (10 adults). It was a close jaunt down to the lake where I was able to fish. The staff lady in the resort shop was super nice and made us laugh. You are abe to buy day fishing passes and yearly passes there too. Great evening spent :)

Text: Cabins are nice. Friendly people. The Cove had good food and is a perfect place to hang out after a day on the lake.

Text: Great boat rental and a friendly team to set up the pontoon for you. The Cove is very relaxed; nice outdoor seating.
