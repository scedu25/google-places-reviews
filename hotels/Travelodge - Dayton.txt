Travelodge - Dayton

Text: Worst place I ever stayed.  So dirty and outdated. Bed sheets had cigarette burn holes in them.  Toilet was running throughout.  Very limit breakfast selection.  Management needs to get their act together and put some money into the place.  Only then stars will appear.

Text: Definitely dont go by the pictures on the website. It is not as advertised. Mold all over the ceiling in the bathroom, cup of noodles under the bed. Rooms and hallway smelled bad. Sheets on bed had stains on them when asked for more sheets made it seem like it was an inconvenience to get some. Difficult to cancel and get refund. One lady on staff was extremely nice.

Text: This place was exactly what ya pay for. First room was not clean. The hallways, stairwells FILTHY. The non-smoking room smelled of smoke hence so did you and your clothes. Shower wouldn't drain, the bathroom lights inop. Not a good place.

Text: They don't fix things when they say they will. The covers are ragedy and the TV is ancient. Stay here if you don't have any other choice.
