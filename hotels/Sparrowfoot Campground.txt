Text: I have been camping at Sparrowfoot for over 20 years.  We started going down there when I was 5 years old.  I love it and it feels like a second home.  It is beautiful, peaceful and a somewhat hidden treasure in Missouri.  It has been on my mind lately and I cant wait to go this Memorial Day weekend!!!

Text: Sparrowfoot is right behind Cozy Corner Campground; I almost missed it, glad I didn't. Beautiful place with great trails my dog and I explored. Busy weekends for fishermen to pull out the big ones from Lake Truman; Clinton 6 miles away for supplies. Best part is, Oct 15 --- April 15, rate is only $8 including electric and there's a campground host there.
