Text: Wow!    If customer service had a negative rating.  Never checked in.  The place smelled like ... well i dont know but it was bad.  The owners son showed us a room and was insulted that we wanted to see it.  We left.  There is a reason why they are half the price of the next dump up in town.

Text: We are staying in our own RV in the so called "campground". It is just a straight row of approx. 12 RVs. The lot sizes are small, meaning your are very close to your neighbors, there are no trees, and no picnic tables as many parks have. The only good parts are that most of the neighbors are traveling workers so it's quiet and since our stay is long term, the owner has no problem with us putting up a temporarily fenced area for our dogs.
