Text: Great price and plenty of space for my family of 5.  We booked the room with two queens and a pull-out couch.  There was a laundry facility that was cheap, secure, clean, and easy to use.  Our family enjoyed complimentary dinner and breakfast!  Beer was also on tap!  The swimming pool is clean and family-friendly.  This hotel made traveling easy.  We definitely recommend this place!

Text: Normally we have found Homewood Suites to be good places to stay. They tend to be clean and have a kitchenette. The Lexington HS is undergoing renovations (April 2017). It will be nice when finished.

 However, when I pulled out the sofa bed and started making it up, our suite was filled with a strong urine smell. I don't know how it could ever have been deemed acceptable. I called the front desk and asked if they had some roll away beds but didn't luck out.

They did say they will be  crediting back the points for our stay, which I have to commend them for. Their customer service is good and the reason I am not giving a one star. I am still wary of their cleaning crew, though. There is no way they could have missed the urine smell.
