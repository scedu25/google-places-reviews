Text: Just getting settled. This is where they put us. It's currently 4:51pm. Completely ruins ours experience. I can't hear anything over the motor. They did apologize afterward and offered firewood if we burned through what we previously purchased.

Text: This place caters to RVs. Staff is friendly and most campsites are easy pull thru. Campfire rings lack grates which was problematic.
