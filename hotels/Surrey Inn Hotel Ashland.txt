Surrey Inn Hotel Ashland
Rating: 4
Text: Comfy, nostalgic Inn. Older style furniture and a bit worn, but clean and friendly staff! I love that it is more historical! Reminds me of childhood hotels! Love it is right by University!

Text: Me and my husband stayed 1 night because everything else in Ashland was booked. But it was very nice and clean. Staff was very nice also. We would definitely go back again. We even checked out late with no problems from anyone.

Text: Such a wonderful little Inn! Any time we're visiting family in Ashland we'll be returning here. Family run, family friendly and they are always accommodating.

Text: The rooms were big and close to campus would be nice if it was updated with newer beds and such.

Text: Wow....this is a no go at all cost..warning..spend the extra $30.00 and stay somewhere else. Moldy shower, noisey in room refidgerator, and my God - -  the creek floor from the guests above me. Coffee maker did not work either. I should have read the reviews and stayed somewhere else. It is a shame that this hotel has fallen to the way side as it was once a beautiful hotel when I attended AU...
