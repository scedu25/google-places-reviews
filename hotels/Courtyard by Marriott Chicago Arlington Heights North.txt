Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Arlington Heights/North

Text: Very nice rooms with a very clean hotel. Bottom floor has a sliding glass door to the parking lot. Breakfast is not free, they have a bistro with options averaging around 10 dollars a plate. But the lake next to the hotel is serene and despite being next to a freeway the locations was very quiet and secluded. 

We will be staying again

Text: Monica, Elodia and Chanel  are the best!  These ladies manage the restaurant breakfast hours, their patience, politeness and hard work was the EPIC in my tiresome jet lagged morning... Thank you ladies you made me feel at home with your kind demeanor.

Text: Beyond Excellent! 
The staff was spot on, very clean room, very nice pool. The bistro was welcoming and staffed well. There is one standout young man who works the desk and the bistro. Friendly, intelligent and very focused on the guests. If you met him once you'd never forget him. He deserves a raise and a generous tip. 
Even if I were just passing through Chicago I'd take a detour just to stay with these folks.

Text: Our group had a dance, to attend. Marriott provided a shuttle to and from the hall, provided a room for our after party, and a breakfast for our entire group. We had a very nice time, but we're not able to take advantage of the pool of fitness room.

Text: Stayed here while on business.   Really nice hotel and a friendly staff.  The food at the cafe was fresh and delicious.   The rooms were clean and modern.  The housekeeping staff did an excellent job.  Overall the hotel aas quiet and relaxing.  Only complaint I had was the remodeling that was going on in the rooms on either side of me.  The paint fumes were a bit overwhelming one day.
