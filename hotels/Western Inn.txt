Text: Really great place for the price. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's clean and has some updates on the inside. Continental breakfast includes biscuits and gravy that is excellent. Way more TV channels than most hotels. Beds are comfy and firm, friendly staff, cookies every evening. If you want a nice, clean, affordable place, this is it.

Text: The stay was nice. The outside looks a little questionable but the inside was nice. The only downside I can give is the fact that the security deposit for the room cost 25 dollars more than the 2 night cost for the room itself. Other than that it was a nice stay

Text: Hotel was very clean and staff was very friendly. Our room was big and they served completely cookies and hotdogs when we arrived and the breakfast was very good. We would definitely star there again.

Text: Adequate but nothing special. Room was clean and bed was fairly comfortable. Only 2 flat pillows on each bed, and only 2 towels for a room with 2 queen beds and booked for 3 people. No fridge or microwave. Breakfast was okay. Oatmeal, biscuits, and sausage gravy, plus cereal, yogurt and toast. Most expensive room we have stayed in over a 3 night road trip, yet fewest amenities. Staff was super friendly, even when we checked in after midnight. We requested a ground floor room due to physical limitations and our request was met cheerfully. Decent place for a quick place to lay your head.

Text: Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Clean and large rooms, cookies and hotdogs for free at check in. Indoor clean pool. Good shower pressure in the morning and lots of TV channels. Couldn't ask for anything more. Oh, and staff was friendly and appeared that they liked their jobs.
