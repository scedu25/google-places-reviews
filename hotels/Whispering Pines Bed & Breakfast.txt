Whispering Pines Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We spent the night there for my husband's birthday. Nice atmosphere, very friendly owner who made you feel right at home. The grounds were well kept. Breakfast was excellent and I might add because my husband was diabetic she even fixed him his own breakfast. I would highly recommend this place

Text: Love Whispering Pines! Cute, clean accommodations, lovely grounds, and an enjoyable experience. We have stayed before as a couple and enjoyed the breakfast. This time we were part of a larger group that rented the whole place, which was super nice for a family reunion.

Text: My wife and I spent two nights at Whispering Pines in the Victorian suite. We had a great time relaxing in the hot tub and enjoying the beautiful garden. The food was fantastic too. All around great B&B!
