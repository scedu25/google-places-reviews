Homewood Suites by Hilton Champaign-Urbana
Rating: 5
Text: Had a great stay of a whole week for family with two grown up children. The suite was sufficiently big for 4 people. Free breakfast was ample and changed everyday. There is a Walgreen right next door and other eating places a stone's throw. Very clean and well maintained. Also just a couple of miles from the UIUC campus.

Text: We had our wedding reception at the Homewood's "sister" hotel, Hilton Garden Inn, and the Homewood was so accommodating with room rentals for me and my bridesmaids. I really wanted a larger room for the night prior to the wedding for my bridesmaids and I to stay in and a large enough space for all of us to scramble and get ready in the morning. Rachel was super kind and helpful in scrambling to find us rooms to fit us all on the different days.

They have a full-size fridge and stove top in the room we stayed in. They also had a table near the kitchen that was perfect for the stylist who came in to do my hair and make up! It was perfect getting ready with all of my girls! Would definitely do it again!

Totally would recommend staying here!
