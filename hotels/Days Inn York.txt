Days Inn York
Rating: 4
Text: Innkeeper provided excellent customer service as I changed my reservations more than once. Gracious and accurate service from him and his staff during the eclipse weekend time. Beds comfortable, cooling unit not noisy and worked to our satisfaction. Rooms clean and comfortable. We appreciated the pet accommodation.

Text: Fairly new cosmetic remodel of a dated hotel.  Clean rooms and convenient access to the interstate. Very small continental breakfast room with 4 or 5 two-top tables. The staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful.

Text: Great Value! 
The pool was small and we had to ask for pool towels. The breakfast area way too small. No exercise room. They had foam plates for use in the microwave which is extremely unhealthy. Otherwise,  Everything appeared to be clean. Beds were comfortable. Rooms were small, but clean and still had a small fridge and microwave. Breakfast was typical and decent quality. Lobby was up to date and just large enough to be comfortable. 
Overall, and despite the negatives, with the cleanliness and comfort. I definitely feel like it was well worth the price of  $68/room (weeknight). With booking online hidden taxes/fees may be avoided. I would stay here again.

Text: I usually love staying at days inn but this location is horrible. They said they gave me my military discount when they didn't, then over charged me for the room that had dirty blankets and bed sheets. Than they clamied it was the tax that made it that price.... i didnt realize tax was $15?? No one told me anything about it when i was paying. And they wont do anything to fix it.

Text: Very comfortable bed but air conditioner had an issue.  I truly would appreciate it if someone could contact me as I love the bedspread & dust ruffle.  I am interested in purchasing one or two.  Thank you.
