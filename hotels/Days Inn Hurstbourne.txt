Days Inn Hurstbourne

Text: Ignore the bad reviews. We checked in for a 3 day 2 night stay, and for the price, this place cannot be beat. Despite our room being fairly close to the elevator, and them being pretty busy, it was very quiet. Our room was sparkling and clean, and we slept well, even with a toddler who is somewhat noise-sensitive and a light sleeper. Sam, the manager, and his staff were some of the most courteous friendliest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Air conditioner was nice and cold, and we wanted for nothing during our entire stay. Our every need was met. Indoor pool was nice, and continental breakfast was generous and good. Biscuits and gravy was hot, bread was fresh and coffee was good. (Note: breakfast is 6am to 9pm, and it goes quickly -- so get there early!)

Text: I have to say that this was first time I have booked a hotel room and wished I didn't.  Very old and dirty, this place needed a remodel in 1985, let alone today.   I will give them credit for new mattresses, and clean sheets and pillows.  However, the bed blanket and top sheet, I tried not to touch (so old).  I could not find another local vacancy, so I was force to spend two nights here.  The maid came into the room, did not make the bed, replaced my bath towel, took the bath mat towel and did not replace, and did not do any cleaning.  And the last guests dirty soap bar was left for me on the first nights stay.  I don't think the cleaning team is doing much cleaning at all here.  If you can find another place to stay, I'd try there first.

Text: If I could give less stars I would. We typically stay at Days Inn while traveling and usually are satisfied. This is by far the worst and we have visited 17 states at this point.

The hotel has a first floor that is external and the next 2 floors are internal entrance. The halls smelled horrible and full of beer bottle caps and debris. Once we entered our room we also found beer bottle caps. I went to place the milk in the fridge and beer was present there as well.

They failed at every level of hospitality and cleanliness. I would not recommend this to anyone.
