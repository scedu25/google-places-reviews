Text: A hidden gem just few miles off the highway. Very homely feeling and very reasonably priced place. 
Had a warm feeling to the place even when I got here at midnight. 
Spacious rooms with classical feel.
Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to stay in this region. 
Very friendly and accommodating front desk host.

Text: If you're staying around the area, you'll definitely wanna check this place out. Rates are a great value for what you get. Clean room, no bugs, no worry of bugs, comfortable bed and the rest of what you likely expect. If I had to say something to improve it would be the wifi, which worked during my entire stay, but was a little spotty at times. Still, much better than other rooms I've stayed in. 

And the customer service is excellent!!! You will feel welcome

Text: It's a nice hotel. It has a pool, cable tv, and it's much nicer than what it was in the past now that it has new ownership.

Text: Very friendly front desk staff.  Clean room, comfortable bed.  You could tell it was a little bit of an older hotel but I was not disappointed with it at all!  Would definitely recommend and stay again!
