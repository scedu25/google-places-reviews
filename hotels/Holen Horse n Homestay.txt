Text: Peggy was an outstanding host for our stay, going the extra mile and adding personal touches at every turn.  The historic farmhouse is exceptional, and has been updated for every modern amenity.  You won't regret staying here!

Text: My work crew and I stayed at the Holen B & B for a week during a botancial survey and had an absolutely amazing stay! We felt totally at home. This historic home has been completely restored with an eye for style and comfort! There were some really cool historic touches (clawfoot tub with original feet, woodwork on main floor) but also all the amenities of a modern home. We filled all three bedrooms that were available (2 rooms with queen beds and 1 room with 2 twin beds) and were all happy with our spaces. There are two shared bathrooms upstairs and another bathroom available downstairs. The entire feel of the home and property was like spending time at your cool grandma's farmhouse but with lots of nice, modern features (and no tacky decorations). 
Peg was an astounding host! Breakfast was homemade every morning and seriously delicious and different each day. Several days we came home from the field and Peg had a sweet treat ready for us (brownies were fantastic!). We opted in for a dinner made by our hostess and were treated to deviled eggs and a mediterranean salad. I enjoyed it so much that I asked for the recipe and have made it at home twice already! She accommodated our food allergies and preferences with all meals and went above and beyond any B & B host I have ever encountered. I would love to return for another stay and gladly recommend this sweet place to all my friends!
