Text: This was a major let down. Advertised as a bed and breakfast for $150 dollars a night this was a shame for the price we paid. There is no innkeeper at night and the food is terrible. The only real positive thing I can say is the housekeeper Sharon was professional and kind. Toney the innkeeper was grumpy at best. Our shower was broken and he scolded us like it was our fault. I would recommend the Inn at 835 over this Pasfield house.

Text: Stayed here 1 night for our 11 year wedding anniversary. The renovations that have been done to the house give it a nice update while keeping the historical feel. Tony the owner is very nice! Made sure we were comfortable and gave us menus to look over for restaurants that were near by. Very personal attention you won't get from a hotel. Would have given 5 stars but I didn't like the eggs (although my wife loved them) and limited cable reception. We will definitely be back!

Text: I really loved it. I think this was worth the trip to Springfield. It is a beautiful Bed & Breakfast. It is close to a lot of the cities sites. But most of all very beautiful, clean, historic architecture but also has the modern conveniences of a kitchenette and Jacuzzi. I highly recommend staying here over any hotel/motel in the area. I loved the rooms. I love the Lincoln history.

Text: I went because I was playing Pokemon Go. The Inn is a gym and I've been trying to get rid of the Team Mystic scum that have been inhabiting it but the gym is glitched. Still had fun though cause I found a Vulpic over there.
