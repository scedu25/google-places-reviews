Text: Spreading Oaks Village is very clean and quiet. I have seen some reviews about the management which must be from the people of the community didn't want. The only times I seen Paul ever get mad was when people was being disrespectful to their neighbors. The people that wrote bad reviews about the Brooks must like people who play loud music all night, drive fast without care of people walking or children riding bikes, have cops at their trailer, or a place like how Pine Aire Village was. Pine Aire Village was full of drugs, broke down cars, rats, burnt trailers, just plain and simple trash. I liked how Paul manages where everyone respects each other.  If there was a problem Paul would try to fix it stat. I never mind paying a little more for anything that comes with a insurance. I know I wont hear loud music all night, people won't break in and steal my stuff, seeing cops running in and out of the same places very many times, or cars flying through the streets without care for kids. With all that said if you disagree with that than move to a slum where you feel more at home.

Text: The community is indeed very nice and clean, but the management is very rude. Paul always rides in his golf cart all day back and forth. And if that is not annoying enough, he and his wife have a rule for everything in the community. They don't value good tenants. In fact, they raise the rent, which is a shame. I'm surprised anyone even wants to live here.
