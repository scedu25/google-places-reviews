Richmond KOA

Text: Great stay, especially for overnighters.  Variety of spots and rates to accommodate differing needs, but not a huge number of any of them.  Very clean, very friendly and helpful staff, great rates.  Small, but very nice K9 off leash area with a good 4ft fence. Washers & dryers work very well, but there aren't many of them.  Definitely a place we'd stay again.

Text: A great KOA - returning customer (have stayed here for up to a week, multiple times, throughout the past 6 years). The grounds are well maintained and pretty. Clean bathrooms/hot showers. The pool is refreshing and is taken care of. The highway noise did not bother me like others have mentioned. Keith and Bonnie are super nice!

Text: What a great campground!  
Extremely well kept and nicely landscaped. Nice private lake/pond!  Only 30 feet from your site!  
We'll be back!

Text: We are first time rv owners and spent our first night here.  We had a water issue.  The owner was very helpful figuring out the problem and lending towels.  I would highly recommend this KOA campground.  The area is very inviting.

Text: My family and I love this campground. The tent sites are level and always clean. My kids love the hayride and movie night. The owners are awesome, and do everything they can to make it enjoyable for everyone. The highway is close, but that quickly becomes background noise.
