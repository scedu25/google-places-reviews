Text: This was year 3 for us at this B&B. The owners are wonderful people. We stayed at the Farm House surrounded by fields of corn. Judy is an excellent baker and cook. Breakfast is something special to look forward to. ...thanks Sam & Judy.....Becky&Don

Text: We stayed in the farmhouse with our family for a reunion. Meticulously up-kept and updated 100+ year old farm house with all the conveniences and comfort of a luxury hotel. We had a wonderful vacation. And the hosts are lovely. Highly recommended!

Text: Sam and Judy are wonderful hosts - very personable - and our experience for an overnight was everything we had hoped for: a comfortable room, pleasant, quite surroundings and a delicious breakfast.  They actually rent rooms at two locations, their (newer) home on the highway where we stayed and a vintage farmhouse way across the field that has been in the family for generations.  Breakfast is served at both. 

Our room was very spacious with an open view to the south complete with sliding doors and large balcony.  Loads of room to lounge right within our quarters. (We were in Room 8.)  We would stay there again.
