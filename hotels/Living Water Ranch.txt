Text: Our Fraternity has our Chapter Retreat at Living Water Ranch. The facilities are always very clean and well kept. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. They provided us with breakfast that was delicious and filling! The scenery and property is beautiful. We highly recommend visiting, the prices are very reasonable and well worth the experience!

Text: The amenities and staff are top notch! We camped there, with a church youth group  during a very big Kansas storm and we felt safe! We felt like family. Love the "spirit" of Living Water Ranch and will visit again! We swam, went on the challenge course, hiked, played on the playgrounds, all kinds of fun!

It's also a great place for a work retreat or group focus project work place!
