Text: My wife and I stayed here on the way out west to the Grand Canyon. The hotel was basically right off the highway. A little tucked into where the casino is. They gave us a great rate for a king bed room that had been recently updated. We basically only slept there but we had a positive experience!

Text: The service was nice. The room was clean. There were a lot of running in the halls by kids, but it was beyond their control. The pool wad nice and clean as well. I forgot my key in the room late at night (close to 1am) and i waited a while for someone to come. Other than that, it was a good stay

Text: This place is amazing! A really nice and clean family friendly facility. I have no complaints! The cookies at the front of the lobby were so yummy! The staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was amazing! They do not offer dinner but that's not a big deal to me. Again a very clean hotel! I LOVED it. The breakfast also was served later in the morning for those who like to sleep in. Again NO complaints!

Text: This was a amazing hotel! The pool was always clean, and very fun for family and friends. The staff was always very kind and helpful when you asked for something. The rooms were very nice but I do have something about the shower, it is that it doesn't give as much power as I would like but it still gets the job done, the beds were very  comfy and soft, there was no stains you would always see the house keeping cleaning rooms. The breakfast was very nice and had long enough hours so that people  that liked to sleep in would still be able to eat. Also the cookies at the front were very good! Over all my stay was amazing I did not have to deal with bed bugs or anyone screaming and the hotel is very close to the zoo and it's not to far from restaurants and stores for late night runs.

Text: The beds were comfy and they had extra pillows in the room closet already which was nice. There was a small microwave and fridge which was already cold ready for our pops. Not quite enough outlets for a family of phone chargers, we had to unplug the alarm clock. The A/C was not quite cold enough because at night when the curtains were closed it blew under the curtains instead of into the room. The curtains did do a good job of keeping the light out. There was a bathtub but standard hotel tub, not very deep. The shower head had some hard water build up but that almost can't be helped around here. The room had a neutral smell not bad and not overly scented with air freshener or cleaning products. The breakfast was busy so they had to replenish several items by the time we got down there. They did have a decent selection though. My kids used the pool, it's on the small side. It is connected to the Mid America conference center and right across from Horseshoe casino which has a shuttle to Harrah's, this is good for concerts. It's also not too far from several restaurants and the interstate exit. Decent hotel with a convenient location.
