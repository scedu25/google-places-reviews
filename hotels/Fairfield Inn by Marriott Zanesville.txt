Text: Good news is that I finally had a real problem with my room.  Never had one before, and I'm over 50... I reported it quickly and timely.   I was quickly and efficiently assigned a different room  that met my high standards for cleanliness and working fixtures.h  The staff was kind, courteous, and efficient. 

They did not have a full time concierge, but they were familiar with the area, and gave me directions to several good restaurants that were close by, and even gave me directions for a good gas station.  Top notch people, and even though I had a problem, it was corrected quickly, and without a fuss..  Additionally, the Internet was amazingly fast.

Text: We arrived late in the evening with no reservations. We got the last room available and the woman checking us in was extremely accommodating. She was down to earth, sweet and so friendly. The man checking us out the next morning was also amazingly friendly. Place was clean and breakfast was good.

Text: Drive on by. Wish I did. The people who I met on my way in and then on my way out 20 minutes later were very nice. My room smelled and the place is in total disrepair. Hard to believe Marriott put there name on this place! It's not cheap either. It's actually worse then then the reviews state.
