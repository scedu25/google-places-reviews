Text: We just had an amazing 3 course dinner at Nate's Place served by Ms Laurie. My brother said it was the best steak he had ever eaten!

Text: I've been staying here for ten years whenever I come back to my home town.  Never disappointed.  Miss Pat will take care of you!  Food at Nate's place is great.  Little bar over there too.  It's a jewel.

Text: Amazing! I never seen anything like it. Boutique B&B that perfectly blends historic ambience and modern technology, where it is appreciated (flat screen TV, DVD player, and hi-end shower/whirl pool/steam/massage). 

The kindness and hospitality shown by Miss Pat and her staff (especially Shawn) will instantly make you feel at ease. We will be back. And soon.
