Text: If you're looking for an secluded primitive camp site, this is for you. We stayed at the Cozy Campsite, and it was everything we wanted it to be and more. We did not see another person the entire time we were there and loved it. Definitely will return!

Text: Amazing land, and the owners are very hospitable and treat their guests well. Our campsite was very private and cozy. They provided us with water & a fire grate, and the bathroom/showers were great! I also lost my phone on the campground and the owner Patty was nice enough to find it for me and send it back. Thank you so much :)

Text: Locust lodge has everything you need for a weekend getaway so you don't need to bring much...it's more like a little house than a cabin but it's cute and cozy.  The lodge is right off the road hidden in some trees but you do occasionally hear cars driving by and ATVs coming through and the owners cabin is within eyesight, but they are super nice and keep to themselves unless you need them. It's not as secluded as some of the cabins we've stayed in but still was a great experience! Also, it's right on 44 acres of hiking trails so you don't even need to get out to the public trails of hocking hills for a little day adventure. Our dog loved the freedom to explore too and was welcome by the owners in the cabin and on the grounds!

Text: This was my second stay at Hawks Landing Retreat, and our time there definitely lived up to my memories of the first trip!  We stayed in the Locust Lodge, and it was very clean and well stocked for our stay.  We had plenty of towels (such a luxury that a lot of places forget!) and the kitchen has all those little odds (like seasonings, vegetable oil, hotdog skewers, etc) which always end up getting left behind when we pack.  The hot tub is wonderful and very well maintained, the beds very comfortable, and the atmosphere incredibly relaxing!  We arrived on a Thursday night and left Sunday morning, and aside from check-in we were able to enjoy what felt like a completely secluded vacation; the owners are excellent at having everything you didn't realized you would need ahead of time, although they were also very kind and assured us that we should call if we needed anything (even though we were there over Easter weekend).  This place will definitely remain my go-to when I visit Hocking Hills.

Text: An amazing piece of land that's very well taken care of by the owners.  They provided us with water and the cleanest composting toilet / outhouse I've ever seen. The property was very peaceful, the nearest campsite was at least 500 feet away through dense forest and we could barely hear the other campers.  Would stay again.
