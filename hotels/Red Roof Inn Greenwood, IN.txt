Text: We have stayed here 4 or 5 times in the past and never had a problem. Rooms were clean and employees were always nice. We came in to town for a company picnic and when I woke during the night and turned on the bathroom light, at least 20 roaches scattered! We left early the next morning only to find our 3 yr old COVERED in beg bug bites.. 47 to be exact as well as my husband. Reported to front desk and later called asking for a return call from the manager which hasn't happened! Needless to say, what we thought would be a good choice turned out to be a $90 disappointment not to count the pain our child is in, medication and cleaning everything we took in that room and the car!!!!! Never again will we stay here!!!! Wouldn't even give a half a star after this disaster and ruined trip due to filth!!!
Update: owner has called and apologized and is givinng a full refund.

Text: Not clean at all!! Front desk staff was very friendly & helpful, but as I checked in (to the ONLY room left in the area), I found every surface & handle was sticky & then discovered urine "splashes" in the toilet seat & hairs there as well! This was right as I walked in after checking in. Luckily I brought my own cleaning/sanitizing supplies, but seriously? I had to clean the room before I could use it?? Yuck yuck yuck. Also semis running & dogs barking all night. I know they can't control so much for that. I don't require anything fancy, just clean & a bed & clean was not happening here!

Text: Billed as a non smoking room but not true. Front desk said they are non smoking and there are signs in the room but the room smelled terribly of smoke. Had to go buy air fresheners just to make it through stay.

Text: This hotel has a good location off the highway but didn't offer much more. Rude staff at check-in, bedding had burn holes, only had 2 bath towels for a 4 occupancy room, 1 teensy bottle of shampoo and a bar of soap. Nothing more. Pool was outside (that's great!) Pump not working or was not on so many bugs floating around, VERY cold water, and no pool towels offered. This property also fails to tell overnight guests that there are many who LIVE there long term and I find it creepy and dirty. Housekeeping staff does not speak english. This hotel needs a very heavy makeover and possibly new management. Never staying here again.

Text: The atmosphere there just feels like its a cheap motel with combination of the look and the people that stays there.  There was an older woman who looks like she was 'working' the corner and an old man that was in a chair facing out at his door watching people. Our chain lock to our room was also broken. Would not recommend.
