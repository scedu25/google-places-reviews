Redbud Campground
Rating: 5
Text: In the near half-century I've been camping and hiking, this campground is one I return to time and again. It's peaceful and quiet even during it's busy season. The trails are easy to access and clearly marked. Although the water always seems to have a very strong iron taste, it's clear, clean and trucked in a few times a week during the summer months. I can only surmise the iron taste comes from the hand pumps you use to fill your containers. If natural beauty and peaceful outdoor spaces are you thing, then, by all means, seek out this gem in the Shawnee National Forest.

Text: The Campground in this National Park is operated by a concessioner, a private bussiness called Randolf Concessions!!STOP SELLING OUT OUR FEDERAL LANDS !!! Check to see who you are paying your money to at these sites, the money envelopes tell who you must write checks to, if your paying cash you may not catch this. If the payee is a business, get in your vehicle and find a part of the park where an actual park ranger or park employee takes your money. We dont stop at these sites anymore, and will review them negitively as we find them. The employees of these companies are rude, and have made it clear that they only want your money. Campsites and bathrooms are dirty and NO SECURITY PATROLS AT NIGHT! ONLY ONE PATROL WAS MADE, TO COLLECT MONEY!!
