Riverside Smoke House & Grill
Rating: 1
Text: If I could give them negative stars I would! My family hired Riverside Smokehouse and Grill to cater my sisters wedding. We payed a lot of money for them to show up throw the food into the oven and leave. For the price that was paid, We were told there would be set up, decoration, and an hour of serving the food. None of that was the case. Oh yeah! I almost forgot they didn’t even bring buns for the pulled pork that they brought.

Text: Fantastic service and even better BBQ...what more could you want?!?

The beef brisket is one of the best I've ever had.  Smoked sausage is great!  Awesome desserts.

Anyone who has rated this place with LESS than 5 stars is completely wrong.  Solid choice if you live in Quincy or staying here.  Easy walk from the Quality Inn or Hampton.

Text: I truly enjoy everything they offer except the ribs.  They are consistently tough. If I understand it correctly, they disagree with the "low and slow" approach.  Believe me, every other offering is 5 star (from the sauce to the baked beans). Friendly service too.  I can't speak concerning the salad bar except it looks like a rather small spread.

Text: Wow! The food here is amazing! Everything tasted as if I were eating at back yard bbq. Passing through from tx that should speak volumes. Thank you so much!
