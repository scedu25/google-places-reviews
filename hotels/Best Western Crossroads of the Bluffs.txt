Text: A great place to stay! Love the remodeled rooms with all the carpet removed! Staff & breakfast were wonderful. Even though we didn’t use it, the pool was one of the biggest I’ve seen at a hotel!! Will definitely stay again!!

Text: Best Western Crossroads is a nice hotel to stay at in that area. Value and comfort combined! It is clean and very convenient. Has all the amenities a traveler could want, and very affordable. The hotel, even with renovations that were going on when we stayed, were not a bother at all.  It will be even nicer the next time we come through Council Bluffs Iowa.

Text: The hotel is being updated and I really like the new flooring in the room over carpeting. Location is convenient to get anywhere: zoo, shopping, gas or food. Right off I29/80. Breakfast was good. My only issue was the loudness of the air conditioning unit.

Text: We wanted to pay cash for the room upon check in and use our CC for the amenities deposit.  The swing shift person told us we could not do this without giving him a $500 cash deposit and our credit card.  The room was less than $60, why would we do this.  Could not get him to understand what we wanted to do.  We did not want to charge the room.  Room had no hair dryer, called to the front desk, after 1.5 hours went down to get it ourselves as it was never delivered.  Front desk person told us he lost our room number.  Not very efficient upon check in as we are diamond members and not treated like a diamond member.  Was not offered any snack/drink or anything else upon check in.  Showed my diamond card but did no good.  Might stay again if service at check in improved some.

Text: Comfortable room at a great price.  Was pleased to get a nice stay there.  Parking was not too bad and was glad to have had a nice evening there.
