Text: Would not recommend this place.  The bed was SO hard that I could not sleep all night!  And, I love a firm mattress!!  There was no hot water for my shower.  The phone in room did not work.  There was a big cigarette burn in the blanket.  All of this for ninty five dollars!!!

Text: Horrible place to stay, very rude front desk person! We are from Illinois, our truck broke down, she gave us grief for trying to check in early, upon check out time, she was calling the room to make sure we were leaving. The continental breakfast was taken right out of our hands at 9am.  Had  to sit in lobby and wait for repairs.  Was told there was NO public bathroom available for us to use from 11:30am until 5pm when our truck was done. (We had just checked out) NO TV, NO coffee, NO hospitality.  Please, please DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
