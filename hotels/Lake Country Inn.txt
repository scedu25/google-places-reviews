There is also a public space where you can play games, watch a movie, or just hang out with your family and friends. A quick walk away from beautiful Lake Michigan and fun shopping! The dining in New Buffalo is also quite exquisite. So if you are ever curious to know about New Buffalo and need a nice place to stay the Lake Country Inn is the place for you!

Text: This place is perfect. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood the staff was nice and helpful and the bed was off the charts comfortable. All that said, it was our first time in New Buffalo and when we arrived a staff member gave us a card with the backdoor code to enter later that night.  When we returned at 10:15 PM the door was left unlocked.  There is no one on duty after 8PM and we were the only ones in the place so needless to say we didn't get any sleep at all until the sun came up the next morning. Security is always our number one concern when we travel.

Text: I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here! The owners are very personable and involved, which makes it feel very homey. On top of that the location is amazing. Being able to walk to the beach, and near the downtown scene is the best of both worlds.  After all was said and done, it definitely was a reasonable price for the experience that it offers!
