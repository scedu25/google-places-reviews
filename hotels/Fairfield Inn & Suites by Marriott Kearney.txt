Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Kearney
Rating: 5
Text: The staff at the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Kearney were very accommodating. I specifically requested a picture of Chuck Norris be placed in the room and they provided a good Chuck Norris joke while they were at it. The complimentary continental breakfast was awesome, they had eggs, sausage and a waffle maker among various other things one could expect from a continental breakfast. I wasn't from the area and when I asked what good dinner options there were in the area, the front desk people even offered to call them to see if they were still open. Awesome staff, awesome hotel.

Text: It was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. The room was spacious, clean and very nicely decorated. The lobby, breakfast area, patio and other main areas were clean and very "easy on the eyes." The Pool and Whirlpool we're very well maintained and clean. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed them. There were numerous amenities and the hot breakfast was amazing. You won't regret staying here. :)

Text: Check-in staff were polite and courteous especially as late as we were checking in. It is very beautiful inside and very clean. Our room was well taken care of and clean and the shower was something I wish I had at home! Definitely staying here again when we come to Kearney.

Text: One of the best Hotels to stay in Kearney.  Nice modern rooms. Free breakfast and happy hour drinks and snacks around dinner time.  Skywalk connects to the convention center is a bonus if you are attending meetings there.  Especially in bad weather.
