Text: I've always enjoyed coming out here. It's nice and peaceful. It is too close to Hwy 281. You can hear the traffic. It has a nice bike trail, too.

Text: What a find. Very inexpensive, level concrete pads, quiet, friendly.  Only had electric on the sites, but dump site and potable water are convienient on departure.  All in all, a very nice campground.
