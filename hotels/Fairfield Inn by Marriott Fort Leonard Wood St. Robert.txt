Text: Staff was great, rooms were a bit small and extremely hard to get to the desired temperature. Convenient location to walk from when getting food and easy enough to get to a main road to drive somewhere.

Text: Room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed: refrig, MW, enough power sockets to charge our electronics, etc.  Desk was manned by a very helpful, pleasant and friendly fellow (Ron) who welcomed us and answered our questions.  All in all, it was a good experience.

Text: The hotel was set at a great location. We had a nice time, except it took us about 15 minutes before we could check in. The person in front of us came in a day early and adjustments had to be made. It just seemed to take quite awhile. Otherwise, room was clean and bed was comfortable.

Text: Clean rooms and Common areas. The best part was the full line up of channels on DirecTV in the rooms. The morning breakfast was really good too.
