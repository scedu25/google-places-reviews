Comfort Inn & Suites North

Text: I travel extensively to promote my blog (Marshmallow Ranch) and public speaking. I travel pulling my camper. I recently was traveling cross-country when the AC went out on the camper. It was 103 degrees when I pulled into Hays, KS and I couldn't face a night that hot. I stopped at Comfort Inn & Suites North and within 10 minutes, I was in a cool, air conditioned room. The rooms are comfortable, impeccably clean, and quiet...something I really needed for a good night's sleep. I travel alone much of the time and I felt very safe and secure in this hotel. The staff was wonderful. The breakfast was well stocked and the attendant friendly. I have stayed here before...that's why I bypassed the other choices at this exit. Good job, everyone...you do the brand a great service. I'll be back!

Text: Ck in was easy and friendly.  We were greeted as a Choice member!  The room was very comfortable and clean!  Nice pool and hot tub area as well as a large exercise room.  Breakfast was good and the area was a good size to accommodate a crowd.  Had an evening food set up which was a plus.  Beds and linens were really good.  Would definitely recommend!

Text: Clean, comfortable and convient... I wouldn't recommend the pool or jacuzzi because they were pretty dirty. I can't say what the breakfast was like because I did not partake. Overall if you're u are dead tired and have an animal this is a good place to stop.

Text: Disgusting motel. It was a like a dog kennel with a some humans added for good measure. Just yuck. I was just coming out of my room an a vicious dog tried to attack me. Horrible stay.
