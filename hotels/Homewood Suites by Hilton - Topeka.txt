Homewood Suites by Hilton - Topeka
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel appeared to be new and was very clean. I stayed with my family and we enjoyed the pool, the outdoor area with fire pit, and the game room. The breakfast was good as well. We stayed in a very spacious suite with a kitchenette. I really liked that the sleeping area was a separate room. I would definitely recommend the hotel!

Text: The room was very nice, 2 queen size beds, and a fold out couch accommodated the five of us quite well. Everything we needed for our stay was provided, i.e.dishes, cooking accoutrements, sheets,blankets, pillows. We did need to request extra towels. The staff was very friendly and helpful, coffee was good, we didn't take advantage of the breakfast offered, so I cannot comment on that. The only reason I didn't give our stay a five star rating is because the water provided for bathing was tepid, to the point of offering a cool bath, and a cold shower. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Hands down the best hotel in Topeka.  I travel for work and have stayed at all of the hotels in town.  Nice, clean, and new rooms with refrigerators and a simple stove and microwave.  Game room, pool, grills, free evening apps and breakfast top it off.

Text: Some of my family stayed here while in town for a funeral. Afterwards a lot of our kids were able to use the pool and game room allowing us adults to enjoy the patio area. Very nice facility.

Text: Visited friends and family staying at this new hotel - the lobby is spacious and very modern looking. Had a cool "fire pit" and other furniture to relax on outside. My kids swam in the pool with their cousins who were hotel guests - it's not a large pool, but good enough for a quick dip, or as on this occasion, for the kids to splash around in. Family seemed very impressed with their rooms and said they were quiet despite people down on the patio outside.
