Text: Extremely satisfied! This property was excellent. The room was amazing, the bed was comfortable, the shower was perfect and Barb was super helpful after we drove all the way from another Best Western that was across the state where we decided to not stay. The 2.5 hour drive was worth it when we got to this place! This may have been the best Best Western that we stayed at the whole trip!

Text: Awesome experience with the staff, specifically Barb, who accommodated everything we needed when we arrived very late. She made sure we were well taken care of and even provided treats to her favorite 4-legged guest of ours. Bed was comfy, great atmosphere, and very clean hotel. Thank you for making this such a comfortable stay!

Text: My husband and I landed at the Best Western after starting down the road at the Motel 6. That place was just not of the quality I am comfortable with.  The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and friendly,  even had a restaurant recommendation for us.  The room was fantastic. And hot tub jets didn't work, but it was still plenty hot and thus relaxing.  I would absolutely stay here again, and am now a Best Western Girl.  We will be starting with Best Western for any trips we plan in the future.

Text: The motel was great, very clean and quiet.  Reservation was for 2 adults and 1 child (6 years old), reserved a king room with a pull out couch.  The gentleman checking us in was very rude and insinuated that we all three was going to be sleeping in the king bed.  Really!!  Never had that happened before.  It was like he did not have a clue that the room had a pull out couch.
