Red Barn Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Quaint B and B maintained by longtime resident couple who go overboard to please. Has a unique feel of days gone by. Wonderful venue to stay for a night or two or to hold a family reunion. Themed rooms and yes...they have a heart shaped red hot tub with Jacuzzi? for use by guests. Great family style breakfast and gift shop for themed antiques.
