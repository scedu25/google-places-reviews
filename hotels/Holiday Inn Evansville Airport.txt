Holiday Inn Evansville Airport
Rating: 5
Text: I have been to several events at this hotel and they have always been amazing. The rooms are perfect for any occasion whether it be a party or a conference. The lobby and bar area are great, so comfortable and spacious that you barely know your in a hotel. The pool is in the middle of the hotel out in the open, but still tastefully remains private and separated from the rest of the lobby/hotel areas.

Text: Over all I enjoyed my stay. Thanks shuttle service to get airport is awesome, we we're able to get to the airport in 5 minutes and we didn't have to wait for the shuttle at all. The staff were all very nice and the room was clean. The hottub was great too!

Text: The front desk was super friendly! If you fly into EVV, they have a shuttle that can pick you up. The rooms are nice since they have a little balcony that overlooks into the main area where there is a pool. The chlorine smell is a little strong, but it doesn't get into the guest rooms.

Text: This is a clean enough hotel. The lobby is nice. Breakfast was real good and the attendants were really nice and helpful. There is nothing around the hotel though so bring a car or plan on eating there.

Front desk team cheerful and welcoming! Bar/restaurant staff also great.

Super close to the airport, comfortable - overall a great landing pad.
