Text: Nice accommodations. Beautiful view of Gun Lake. Grounds are lovely. Enjoyed the waterfall and sitting by the lake in the evening. Staff was friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast included in stay wasn't great. Items made in house didn't have much flavor.

Text: This Inn is beautiful. Just got back from a wedding at the boat house. The staff is superb. They are very friendly. They have a very organized system in place for everything. I highly recommend this place for weddings, vacations, relaxation, group events etc, etc...very fun, lots of things to do on the beaches and boats. The accomodations are spectacular and the views are beautiful.

Text: Travelling for work, picked this because is was close to where we needed to be.

Great property, friendly staff. Nice complementary breakfast (limited, but decent). Awesome spot in the lake, this looks like a great little destination hotel for a wedding or mini vacation.

Clean, well kept rooms. They apparently have live music Wednesday evenings in the summer. Cool looking outside patio/deck area.
