Americas Best Value Inn South Sioux City

Text: The hotel is located right off the highway in a slightly industrial area. The exterior has been renovated and has a tourism center attached. My visit was to check out their conference center for an event and we were extremely impressed with both the price and how updated the room was. It's three rooms total that can be connected or kept apart. Very updated, painted in neutral colors with large screens for presentations. The facility allows for outside catering as well! Huge plus!

Text: It's okay.. decent price, old building, nice employees. Back door to building had a card slot but didn't lock at all. All window unit a.c.. carpet felt weird, rusty shelves in bathroom.. but acceptable.

Text: After telling the guy at check we needed a bottom floor room, (3 times due to him not paying attention) he still have us 2nd floor. He was too busy chatting with cleaning lady to listen. No carts for bringing stuff in and no elevator. Checked out before looking at rooms.

Text: Decent hotel. Room was clean, and the wifi was decent enough, but my ac unit in my room was super loud
