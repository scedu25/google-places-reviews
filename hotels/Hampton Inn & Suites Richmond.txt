Text: Unbelievably friendly and accommodating! True to the Hilton name! Breakfast is amazing and coffee is hot and fresh 24/7.

Text: Breakfast was great. Room was very clean. Staff was very friendly. Only issue was with the shower. Open shower but no way to stop water from extending in to the bathroom floor. Also the water was too soft. Never got that "clean" feeling. Overall good stay

Text: For the most part this hotel is As Nice And as good of a value as its sister hotels. The staff was polite and helpful. The rooms were clean. The beds were comfortable. Our main issue was that the wifi was down, and nobody on hand to fix it, and having wifi was a deal-make or break feature of us choosing this hotel.

Text: Was really clean and fun! Would reccomend for a short stay, as there isn't that much variety for breakfast. Pool was fairly fun, but we were hoping for a hot tub. Overall it was nice.
