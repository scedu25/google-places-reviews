Grand Motel

Text: For the money, it's a pretty good deal! The room was clean and everything works. Bed was great and I slept very well. There is a continental breakfast IF requested - the owner explained that was to keep the costs down, but you'll at least know the coffee is fresh! He was extremely helpful in everything, in fact. For guys like me who just want a clean place to sleep without laying out a bunch of cash, it's the way to go. I'd stay here again, no problem.

Text: I like to stay at family owned establishments.  Preferably older motels where a certain sense of old fashioned comfort can be found and the owner, their spouse and kids are involved in the motel's day-to-day activities.  I also like to know that the money I spend stays locally. I found just that place in the Grand Motel in Hastings, Nebraska.

I chose the Grand over the other local places because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews posted on the Internet. I was not disappointed. Despite arriving rather late at night, the owner greeted me with a smile and a hearty "welcome to Hastings". Parking was plentiful and backing a 20 foot truck and car trailer was easy.

The 60-year-old motel is charming and boasts a nuts and bolts attitude that provides the essentials for a weary traveler.  The room was clean and agreeable. The microwave was clean and the fridge was a standard sized unit found in almost all hotels and motels. Free wi-fi was a treat. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean and provided the essentials (towels, soap, shampoo, and conditioner).  Free breakfast is available upon request as are other amenities such as an iron and ironing board. The area is safe, quiet, close to restaurants and other services.

I slept well and woke up refreshed, ready for the long day ahead of me. Thank you Mike, I look forward to staying at the Grand again!
