Holiday Inn Express & Suites St. Louis West-O'Fallon
Rating: 3
Text: I would put it at 2.5 stars, but I'll give them the benefit of the extra half star. 

The housekeeping was minimal-not that I do it at home, but I've come to expect the bath mat to be hung up. 

Despite being a non-smoking hotel, I felt like the smell of stake cigarettes was everywhere. 

The decor was perfect for mid-1980's. 

On the plus side, the staff I interacted with directly were friendly, very helpful and kind.

Text: Gets old when maid service knocks on your door at 8 am after a 21 hour day at work!! Also when asking for a late checkout, i was asked, "What time?". I said 2-230. Was told, "Nope we will only do one." Why did you ask me what time if you only had one time??? Any other Holiday Inn would have zero problem with 2. Have done it multiple times when working very late and were eager to please.....not this place. Personally i would search around for another Holiday Inn around the area.

Text: Have stayed here several times and have had good experiences. Clean and tidy rooms and a nice breakfast selection. We really like the suites they have which helps us only book 1 room since we are a family of 7. Will be back again in the future .

Text: The TV's in my room did not have power cables so they didn't work and I had to change rooms. But the hotel staff was very helpful and got me switched right away. Good breakfast and not too bad rate.
