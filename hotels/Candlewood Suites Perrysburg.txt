Candlewood Suites Perrysburg

Text: The hotel is reasonable in price, kept up fairly well, with a comfortable bed. The best is a nice small kitchen with a large refrigerator/ freezer, small stove, large microwave, and a few utensils & plates. Just a little crowded.

Text: Usually a Candlewood Suites are suburb stay. This one was subpar. The elevator and entire third floor smelled of cigarette smoke. My room smelled of ammonia and rubbing alcohol as if trying to cover something up.  The shower was so dirty and bad. I had better water while deployed to Afghanistan.
