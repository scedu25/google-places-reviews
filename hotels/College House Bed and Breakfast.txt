Text: We spent a wonderful night at the College House B & B on the weekend of the Ashland Balloon Fest.  We stayed in the Art Room on the 3rd floor.  I'll first start with the Bed, it was absolutely wonderful.  Like sleeping on a marshmallow.  The room was a bright and cheery room that had true character.  The house was nice and clean and the amenities were everywhere.  If I forgot anything, it was right at hand and beautifully presented.  The temperature was well regulated and the bathroom shower was divine.

The host and her children were wonderful.  Very personable and ready with suggestions and the lay of the land.  The breakfast was delicious.  The sausage was scrumptious.  Everything was delicious and there was plenty of it.  The real gem was the screen patio.  The birds provided a tranquil surround sound to an extremely comfortable local.  It was breathtaking and peaceful.

Overall we will come back to Ashland.  I want to spend more time on that porch and have a chance to discover the town and the college near by.
