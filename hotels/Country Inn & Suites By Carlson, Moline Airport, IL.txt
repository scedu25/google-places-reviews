Text: It was a nice stay. Nothing major to complain about. The sheet had a rip on the side and the room could be a little more spacious. The pool was very nice. Warm and clean salt water. The breakfast was very good, almost great. Cookies in the lobby were fantastic!!

Text: We rented a room with the jetted tub. Tub drain doesn't work. The front guy tries to fix it. Had to ask to move rooms. Wasted a $10 bath bomb. 
Room was dated. Walls had food or something on them. Bed was very uncomfortable. Breakfast and cookies were amazing!!!

Text: Everything was good and clean, other than the pillows were awful. Stacked 3 together just to try to make them comfortable.
