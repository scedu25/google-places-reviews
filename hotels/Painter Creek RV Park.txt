Painter Creek RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: The park is in a lovely setting, very quiet and tucked away, however the slope of the property doesn't make it conducive to parking/leveling your trailer easily. Customer service was gracious and effective, and helped to accomodate my needs.  We would stay here again, and overall we give it a 4 out of 5.

Text: We came here for our anniversary in the rv and it exceeded our expectations! Nice and clean amenities. The owners were wonderful and attentive. And the people that rent for the season were very friendly and accommodating. It was peaceful and quiet all day and night. The lake is a mile away if you have a boat. We didn't bring a car and were able to get an Uber into French Lick for the night. There was plenty to do there and the historic hotel and casino were great! We will be back with our kids next time!
