Text: Room reeked of marijuana and cigarettes. Tub was filthy and old rubberband of hair still in the window seal. Crack heads and prostitutes in the area. Do not recommend.

Text: DO NOT RECOMMEND! Having lived here my entire life, I highly advise you to stay somewhere else. Although, the Staff are rather nice, the rooms are not. Stayed there for a weekend and left with bed bug bites all over. The neighborhood is drug infested and crime ridden. Neither you, your room or your vehicle are safe here. People use these rooms to traffic and abuse drugs and solicit prostitution. A rather high number of people have been murdered and overdosed in these rooms. Yet, the activity continues? (SMDH) Ultimately, you get what you pay for. -- This is not a fake or biased review, this is pure honesty! Folks deserve to know the truth, honest reviews can potentially save lives, in this day and age.
