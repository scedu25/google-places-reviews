Text: I was very pleased with my experience at the Red Roof Inn. Very nice place and no bugs of any sort and the people are very kind. The hotel is close to the highway and many restaurants. I highly recommend checking in at the Red Roof Inn.

Text: Very nice budget room. Room was clean, smell of cleaner was a bit overpowering at first but we got used to it. Clean sheets, clean towels, floor had been swept, didn't see any bugs. Good range of tv channels. Reception guy was friendly. Well lit parking lot close to rooms. I felt safe staying here. Would recomend.

Text: Easy reservation online, check in simple. Friendly front desk, room not exactly as advertised,( no microwave or soaking tub) But late check out was easy to get. And a couple small problems that were addressed as soon as reported.

Text: Entire hotel room reamed of smoke, there were burn holes in the sheets and comforter, our bathroom light didn't work. If there were any other choice at the time of my stay we would have gone elsewhere. But, Jason Aldean was fantastic and made it worth it!
