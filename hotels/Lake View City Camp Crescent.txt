Lake View City Camp Crescent
Rating: 5
Text: Nice shade in the campground and spacious campsites. I love that there is miniature golf right there, and a nice playground at the beach. The city park and playground, and downtown with a grocery store, gift shops, bait store, hardware store,  and ice cream shop are within walking or bike ride distance.
