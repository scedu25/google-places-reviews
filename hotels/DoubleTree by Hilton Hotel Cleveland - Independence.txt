DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Cleveland - Independence

Text: My work has meetings here 3 or 4 times a year. Everything always looks modern, clean and fresh. I always have to stop at the front desk for the WiFi password if nothing else and am pleasantly surprised every time. It's as if they don't mind being at work, weird. The lunch provided is always really good too. I never eat dinner when we have a meeting here because of how much I end up eating. All the tech stuff runs smoothly for the bosses and they've mentioned how helpful the staff has been. I'd be willing to bet the staff was working outside their job discrimination. Not to mention I know how tight my bosses are so I know you're getting a good deal here. Enjoy

Text: We had a conference there.  The place is nice and food was good.  The temperature is the room was either hot or cold. They couldn't figure it out. The limited interaction I had with the staff was pleasant and professional.

Text: Stayed here on our wedding night with family and friends. Incredibly helpful sales manager George, easy to work with and always responded promptly. I highly recommend, but the rooms are a tad dated. Hospitality suite was spacious, but the doors didn't sit flush, so we heard everything in the hallway at any time.

Text: Beautiful hotel. Great service. Warm chocolate chip cookies are delicious. We stay there once a summer when we attend an Indians game. Just one negative. This past september, I left my cell phone charger in the room. Within hours I contacted the hotel. I talked to someone who took my phone number. I gave them the room number where we stayed.They promised to call me back and never did. Very disappointing.
