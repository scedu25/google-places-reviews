Text: There are many many much nicer hotels in the area!  The Travel Inn Motel was by far the nastiest place I have ever stayed.  After one night I requested a refund for my second night as I planned to get a different hotel, and the owner refused.  I then forfited my payment and went on to stay at the Best Western just off hwy 35.  The owners know their motel is crap and do not know anything about customer servise.  You have been warned!!!  Do not make the same mistake as me as all motel/hotels are not created equal, and their is nothing worse that arriving at 1 a.m. to a pure dump!
