Text: Very nice place for long-term stays... Staff is awesome

Update: Housekeeping is not doing a good job at keeping the rooms clean - was not up to standard during my stay back in August this year - manager made good on the issue after I called her a few days later... I hope they plan to do something about this. I see there is some sort of branding/ownership transition that has just happened - hopefully they will fix the problem.

Text: Arrived late at night to a welcoming receptionist and a clean room. The room was spacious and well suited for an extended stay. The complimentary breakfast was simple yet well made. The cook even offered to prepare something if we were not satisfied with the selection. Honestly one of the best hotel experiences I've had.

Text: Great room. The full kitchen is a very nice amenity. The breakfast is very good. Nice mix of hot and cold items. Will stay again. You can pretty much count on it being a nice place to stay regardless of where you are staying.

Text: Definitely the nicest 3 star I've ever stayed at. Rooms are more like small apartments than they are hotel rooms, staff is really nice and friendly too, and the price we paid ($60) was an absolute steal. Recommended for sure.

Text: Rooms are kinda weird. They do have a full stove which is great. Dinner table and full fridge. Place is older and while not dirty, you feel its getting long in the tooth and might be time for renovation. Very good for traveling family though. There is a small outdoor pool.
