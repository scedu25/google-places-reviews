Prairie Path Guest House
Rating: 5
Text: If you are planning a trip to western Illinois and need/want a wonderful place to stay, this is it!  Owned and operated by Fern and her husband, this fabulous bed and breakfast really gives one a flavor, on many levels, of what life was like and still can be in this beautiful corner of the world.  In my opinion, this is a five star experience full of charm!

Text: Great getaway, tucked on the edge of Mt Carroll. Fern and Buster are the heart of the Prairie Path Guest House. Early morning hot coffee on the balcony, followed by a fantastic breakfast feast including French toast, true maple surup, freshly made cinnamon buns, sausage links and patties. Hot coffee and orange juice.  And to top it off great conversation.
