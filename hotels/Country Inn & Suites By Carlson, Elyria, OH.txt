Text: Great hotel! Very clean rooms, spacious! We had a handicap king bed suite for my disabled son and it was amazing! Zero entry shower with padded seat and pull down shower head, large doors, wide walkways! Very pleased with our room. All 5 of us slept better then our last 4 nights of hotels at high end hotels! Breakfast had a huge selection and the atmosphere here is amazing. People are all so friendly! My kids loved the pool and hot tub as well! Definitely a place to come back to in the future!

Text: Often stay here when I am in the area. Always enjoy the free breakfast, which is why I choose here over other nearby hotels. Very easy access to the highway as well as a nearby mall.

Text: Well first I believe you treat your employees who work for you with the most respect no matter the circumstances no one deserves to be picked on or bullied or not helped. Sad to say this owner is petty. You can't get far with the way you treat your employees they are your company. Sad situation. Just sad.

Text: We stayed two nights. King bed was hard and the pillows were very small,  come on king beds should have at least two regular sized pillows. breakfast was ok but not kept full and you had to wait.
