Tradition Inn

Text:       Overall Tradition Inn is a very nice motel. Their breakfast area along with the public areas accommodate a variety of uses. The only problems we had were that the pool was freezing, and the night desk clerk was in need of a refresher course. 
      We had gotten in later than expected and were in need of a place to eat. He didn't even have a clue as to the when the bar and grill stopped serving in the same building. If he would have known, we possibly would have been able to be there in time. Also, dressed in swimsuits, we asked him where the pool was. After directing us, he went back to the video game on his phone. It wasn't until we had looked for pool towels at the pool, and then had to come back in from the pool just to get towels. It was at that point, he explained that we needed to sign in for the pool and to give us towels. At that point, it was a little too late to enjoy anything that night.

Text: Solid choice if you find yourself needing a place to stay in Farmington. Very reasonable rates. Rooms a bit dated but clean. The adjacent restaurant, Spokes, has an amazing beer selection and good food.

Text: Room had a wierd smell, TV controler did not fully work. Rooms need to be updated bad for the price to spend for the night. Staff was very friendly, bed was good and room had great A/C. And Breakfast was very good.

Text: This was an odd hotel. Signs that went nowhere. Rooms with nothing in them. Old school tvs. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. And it did exactly what we needed it to I suppose.
