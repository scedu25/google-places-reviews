Super 8 Columbia City

Text: Awesome experience, I would definitely recommend. If Quality INN is a 2.5 star hotel at that rate super8 should be rated 3 Star.
Count on Service, Security and Maintenance. BTW good decor. 
Keep the good work going.

Text: I give him three stars just because all they ever serve for breakfast is just biscuits gravy and cereal they do not mix it up I mean come by give me a break how hard is it to mix up your breakfast menu that is all other than that it is a very beautiful place.

Text: Check in was a breeze. The hotel is a bit older, but they have done a great job with upgrading the furniture and fixtures in the halls and rooms. The entire hotel smelled fresh and clean. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious. We had no complaints and would gladly stay again. Definitely worth the price!
