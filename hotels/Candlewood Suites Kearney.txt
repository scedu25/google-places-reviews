Candlewood Suites Kearney
Rating: 5
Text: This is a great hotel. The rooms are sizable, come with a full kitchen, utensils, full size refrigerator, freezer, and a big screen LCD TV. I stayed here for work and have no complaints. The staff were friendly and professional. They do not have breakfast at the hotel, but the rooms make up for it. I definitely recommend them if you're looking for a place to stay

Text: Loved our stay here. We were traveling along I-80 and needed a place to stay. It was right off the freeway. It was also walking distance to a great restaurant (Angus burger). The staff was friendly. They had DVDs you could borrow for the night. I only wish they had a breakfast. They did have juice and a few donuts. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The beds were really comfortable. We loved our stay.

Text: We took a large group through Kearney and stayed here on the way there and back. Rooms are clean and the hotel is fairly new, and very modern. It was great to have a kitchenette in every room, and the bathrooms were still a good size. The staff was courteous, helpful, and made everything about our stay easy, even with 20+ teenagers.

Text: The rooms here are the definition of perfect. Clean and absolutely accommodating in every regard. I hope I have the occasion to come back here. There are 3 awesome restaurants right next door including a wine bar, steakhouse and a gourmet burger joint. I highly recommend staying here.
