Tu Lakes Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I have stayed at this motel several times and have always found it to be very clean. I have never seen any type of bugs or gotten any type of bites. The staff is very friendly and the manager is always asking if we need anything. He is also well informed of the area businesses. The country setting makes for a quiet stay. We also love going to the lake just down the street.
