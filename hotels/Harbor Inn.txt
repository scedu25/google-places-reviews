Harbor Inn
Rating: 4
Text: There Harbor Inn provides a decent place to stay in an area mostly filled by camping trailers and cabins. The current owners are renovating this property which they recently acquired. The experience is not as predictable as staying in a suburban hotel (no regular turndown or towel service at the time of my stay), but if you ask for something, the staff will do their best to oblige. The Harbor Inn includes a  good-sized, clean pool, and easy access to Mark Twain Lake's recreation areas.

Text: The new owners of Harbor Inn are awesome! Our band recently stayed there for 3 nights and they were so accommodating and kind.  They even sent me my pillows I accidentally left for free! Kind people, great service.
