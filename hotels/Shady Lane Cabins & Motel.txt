Shady Lane Cabins & Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Cabins and motel rooms available at this location. Be sure to make reservations well in advance. Cabins and motel rooms are nice, it has the basics but fit the bill for a good night under the stars and for sleeping. Very quiet area, located in town next to gas stations and restaurants. There is also a laundromat on location. Quiet times are enforced, no big partying is tolerated and I am thankful for that. Staff is wonderful and willing to accommodate any way they can. Be sure to check their website, prices are different for certain days of the week and certain times of the season. I love staying here during my visits to Eminence.

Text: We love staying at Shady Lane Cabins.  Hubby and I have been staying here almost every time we visit the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.  We've tried other places but we always come back to Shady Lane because none of the others compare in price or value, especially if you're there to enjoy all the outdoor activities the area has to offer.

The cabins are cleaned daily and the housekeeping staff does a fantastic job - very clean!  We always stay in the small, one-room cabins where we have all the amenities we really need.  It would be nice if there was a microwave, but we never really miss having one because the local eateries are so good. (The larger cabins have microwaves and stoves)

The people at the front desk are awesome.  There's a laundry there if you need it.  Besides the clean but no-frills cabins, there is a playground for the kids, barbecue grills, and a fire pit if you'd like to have a bonfire in the evening.  There are local outfitters nearby who will take you to either the Jack's Fork or the Current River and pick you up at the end of your float.

The cabins are different from the motel.  We have never stayed at the motel but we have stayed at one of the larger cabins (top level) when there were no small cabins available.  Those were every bit as nice as the small cabins, with a few more amenities (microwave, stove).  They honored the small cabin price for that stay, but the price difference is normally not a very much if you prefer those additional conveniences.

Text: A group of friends and our kids stayed in Story Creek Manor and we loved it. It was a perfect accommodation for our group. The house itself had everything we needed and the best part was the maid came if you did need something. Will more than likely use this every year. Two thumbs up!
