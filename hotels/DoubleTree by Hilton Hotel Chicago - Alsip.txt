DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Alsip

Text: The hotel staff was very friendly. No complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and you get quite a bit for $11.99. They also give free warm and soft cookies..... on another note, they hold $50 per night. We kept seeing little brown ants in our room on the wall.  I thought the price was too high due to not having a microwave or refrigerator in the room. The Evian bottle of water in the room is $4, so drink up if you want. Pillows are extremely soft. They do offer cots. Must wear wristband to get in pool.

Text: The room was amazing and closer to the highway than we expected. Staff and associates were helpful with directions and hospitality. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. Wish they had a microwave in room to re-warm cookies. But other than that, amazing stay!!!!

Text: Hotel stay was comfortable. NOT at all happy with transportation from airport. Returned flight,, called hotel at 7:45 pm for "shuttles on the hour" only to find that it was going to be 50 minutes. Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. To which I was told that I could take a taxi. So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. Should be called park and get stranded.  WORST park and fly experience ever. Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.

Text: The on site restaurant was cozy even though they had a wedding going on. We sat in the bar. Service was slow that night, but the food was very good and worth the wait. We had the taco salad with chicken. All of us like it as an appetizer, then burgers. Definitely a nice time. I would go again.
