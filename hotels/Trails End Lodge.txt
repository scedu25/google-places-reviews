Text: The food is awesome here. This place is one of the hidden gems of southern Illinois. I highly recommend that you come in and try it out. Very friendly staff with a unique atmosphere. The view of Shawnee National Forrest is picturesque. Two thumbs up!!!

Text: I can't praise this place enough, while on vacation I knew in advance I wanted to check this place out. It was a real treat! We all loved the experience of cooking on a lava stone! We have never heard of anyplace like this! 
It was so much fun and absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it!  My only regret is, I live across the country and cant pop in for dinner when I want!

Text: Nice and unique. Enjoyed the view and cooking on the stone. Could have been a little more helpful, we really didn't know what we were doing. But very nice.
