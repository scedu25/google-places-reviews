Text: Fantastic place.  They have some tent sites and several camper converted rooms to stay in.  All of them are very well finished and polished.  They have a wonderful lodge building for groups.  I would highly recommend this place for a Christian retreat or even a place to call home while you hit the trails.  The owner was extremely personable and really cares for her guests.  Can't wait to go back.

Text: Very nice little quit place to relax. The lady that runs the place is super nice. The place could use some updates and landscaping but was not bad for the location. Just a few min both ways to the Hatfield Trails.
