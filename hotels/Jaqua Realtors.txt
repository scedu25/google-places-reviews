Jaqua Realtors

Text: I'll start with the positive stuff about our property: it's decorated well, the screened in back porch of our rental was a very nice feature. I don't want this to be true about this place and I've never understood their business model but they treat rental customers like an inconvenience and like they're irritating. When we pulled up to our property we couldn't get the code to work. Called Jacqua and the woman that answered rudely informed me "It's not 3:00 yet, the code won't work until 3:00" It was 2:50. Why not set the code to work after housekeeping leaves? What would be the harm in that? Also, our sink wouldn't drain in the bathroom and the kitchen sink faucet leaked all over the counter and into the basement. Stuff like that happens, right? Yes, in almost every Jacqua rental we've had there have been plumbing issues. If you're over 6 foot the light in the middle of the kitchen is way too low. The thermistat didn't work very well and the best of all: NO DISHWASHER! There are better rental agencies in this town and I strongly urge you to find one of them.
