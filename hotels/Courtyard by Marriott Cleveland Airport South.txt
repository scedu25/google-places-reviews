Courtyard by Marriott Cleveland Airport South
Rating: 5
Text: Great room. Very clean. Quiet area. Front desk staff very attentive to needs. Easy access to stores, and then to I-71 which gets you access to Cleveland and surrounding suburbs. Card key system worked first time, every time. Shower has great non-slip surface, and a grab bar. Beds were comfortable and looked like newer linens. Room was in good shape upon arrival. Free Internet was adaquate for email and browsing.

Text: We met extended family in the hotel lobby for drinks and conversation. The atmosphere was very conducive to fellowship, though I can imagine it might get noisy during busier times (this was late evening on a week night). Having a bar in the lobby was an unexpected convenience that isn't as common as it used to be for hotels of this class.

Text: Location is close to Interstate 71 and the airport. The suite was a nice size and updated. Staff was very accommodating for my friends' wedding.

Text: We had a great experience at this hotel. Our room was clean,  the beds were very comfortable,  and the room temperature was comfortable too. The pool and hot tub were clean and clear, and there were plenty of large fresh towels to dry off with. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The food and drinks and service at the hotel restaurant were all excellent too. They have a station by the front desk where you can print off your airport boarding passes, and there is a free shuttle service to the airport  that runs every 45 minutes. Svetlana, the shuttle driver, was very friendly!

Text: The room has been nice, the hotel front desk staff to say less than enthusiastic would be a compliment. Luckily the room makes up for the rest, the location is great, and the bed comfy. Now if someone just seemed happy when you checked in or entered the building.
