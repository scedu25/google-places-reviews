Holiday Inn Express & Suites Findlay

Text: We called to book a room with two queen beds. The lady booked the room for us and when we arrived at 1:30am, the computer system stated that the room was dirty. The lady at the front desk then says “I’ll go check the room”. She stated that the deadbolt was on so they had given our room to someone else. Unfortunately for us there were not any other rooms available with 2 queen beds. But the would offer us a king bed with a pull out couch. Sleeping on a pull out was not on my to do list this evening. 
We ask for a discount due to this issue. 
We were refused a discount because according to the staff “it was their fault”. I’m not really sure how that makes any sense but I guess given the time of night and long drive we had, I didn’t have the energy to argue with the lady. 
All in all it was not a pleasant experience at all for us. It’s my second night in a row in a Holiday Inn. I will have to think twice after the episode this evening.

Text: Not terrible. The breakfast was actually pretty good. Rooms are small, which is sort of to be expected. Can definitely hear everything going on in surrounding rooms. Especially with doors that go between them. All in all not great, not terrible.

Text: Went here for an overnight get away with my other half. The room was perfect! The jacuzzi tub was heavenly, free continental breakfast and an excellent staff! 10/10 would recommend!

Text: A very convenient location just off of the interstate. Nicely appointed and clean. Refridge, & microwave in the room with coffee maker. Our room had 2 queen beds, desk -w- chair, table, and an easy chair. AM endless breakfast was better than expected, and server kept well stocked.
