Clarion Hotel & Convention Center

Text: Great value for the money. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Hallway lights need to be updated, they give off a pink appearance which is not pleasant on the eye.

Text: Just stayed here last week because we were moving into a new home and needed a nice place to stay for the night. This is NOT what I remember as being the nice hotel it was years ago. The elevators were sketchy at best, the bar area was run down.... The best part of the stay was sitting in the lobby because it was somewhat well maintained. I travel a lot and I was very disappointed in how the hotel has gone downhill.

Text: Booked this reservation using points for my brother and sister-in-law. They said they enjoyed their stay. They did state the guest directory in the room was a little mangled and had water spots, but other than that had a great room. They said the staff they encountered at the desk was very helpful, however they elected to go to Burger King for breakfast. I told them the breakfast at the hotel was free though.

Text: My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised by this place! We were expecting a very simple hotel to stay the night based on the price. The moment we walked in we were thinking this place is a little bit classier. It's not like some other hotels we have stayed at, you can tell that this place wasn't always a very classy place. But the staff and condition of the furniture and decor and everything told us that this place strives to be a very comfortable and well kept place. The rooms were clean, breakfast a continental but with waiters and waitresses and the food was pretty good as well.

My wife and I will definitely stay here again should we ever be in this area again!

Text: It's a decent stay for the cost. If love better water pressure in the shower, but that's my "thing". Breakfast was really good for a complimentary. I'll be back.
