Text: My whole family loves this place! I have 2 dogs and I feel like I'm leaving them with extended family when I leave them here. I'm never worried about how they're being treated and they get to share a roomy kennel so they feel more at ease. The staff is always friendly and so sweet to my dogs. They send them home looking better than when I dropped them off, with a little bandanna, a bag of treats, and a report card! I won't board them anywhere else. Period. I've also had them groomed there and, even though I live in Independence, I will drive all the way to Odessa to have them groomed there again. We had a wedding at my parent's house one weekend and wanted to board all the dogs so we wouldn't have to worry about them. We took all 8 (yes, 8) to Bed and Bones (booked in advance, of course) and they handled it with no problems. They all got to socialize together and share kennels. It was like sending all the kids away to camp!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

Text: We took our dog there for an extended stay and gave specific food instructions written on the bag and on the food cup.  We provided a large 24 oz yellow cup and placed it Inside the bag of food and said give him one cup 2x a day and they gave him one 8 oz cup 2x a day so they shorted him 4 cups of food a day for 12 days.  He lost 7 pounds while he was there.  They also groomed him while he was there and we left instructions on how we'd like him cut and they shaved him really low one length head to toe so his pretty curls were all gone and he had no protection against the sun because you could see skin patches.  I just checked into taking him again hoping that I could make the feeding instructions more clear somehow this time and knowing he was just groomed so no chance for a haircut and they have increased the price substantially and the lady on the phone was less than pleasant.  She seemed irritated by my inquiry for a reservation so I think I will pass.  I was concerned about leaving him again and her less than welcoming personality was all I needed to make my decision.  I would be happy to pay the increase for a place that could follow simple instructions and acted as if they actually wanted to care for my dog.  So, we will pay someone to stay with him here at home instead.

Text: We love Bed & Bones.  Prices are very reasonable. If you stay for a week or more, you get complimentary grooming.  They even post pictures of your dogs on Facebook while you are gone!

Text: Although it's quite a drive to get there from where we live, we trust them to take great care of our pets.
