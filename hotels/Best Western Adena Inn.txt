Text: Front desk service was good, but I'm hoping to get a refund for the 2nd night considering that we couldn't stay due to natural gas fumes. Also the nonsmoking suite has a very distinct smoke smell to it. Front desk was eager to help but couldn't without over stepping her bounds.

Text: We had reserved a room with a queen size bed but when we received the key to our room it hadn't been cleaned.  When we went to the desk we were told the only available room was one with two full size beds.  We did receive a discount but we weren't comfortable sleeping in a bed smaller than what we have at home.
