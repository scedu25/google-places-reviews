Super 8 De Soto

Text: The staff is very nice and helpful. The manager gave me a very early check in without additional cost! My room has a refrigerator and microwave. The bed is super comfy. Very quiet and peaceful here, and the prices are nice. This is an older building and isn't the most perfect place, but the service makes up for it.

Text: It was ok for one nights stay. The staff were super friendly but the hotel itself could use a revamp. And don't anticipate the best breakfast in town. But if all you need is a place to lay your head and a friendly face this is a great place to stay!

Text: The management at Super 8 was quite nice and friendly. They allowed me a free early check-in on the eclipse day. Rooms were clean and spacious. The front desk was always helpful in sharing tips about local eat-outs. Overall great experience

Text: It was a nice, safe looking area right off the highway with a gas station and McDonald's next to it, 15 minutes from Lawrence. The building looked surprisingly nice from the outside and the rooms are also spacious, nice, and clean, with everything needed included. My only suggestion would be to provide toilet lids or else provide a different place to hang the towels than right above the toilet.

Text: The TV even at full volume was kinda quiet but we had two rooms and the TV in the 2nd room was just fine.
