I am so greatful the employees are so helpful and truly cares about your comfort. I will stay here from now on. Thank you guys for being awesome. Ellie is an outstanding employee who goes goes that extra mile she helped us so much.

Text: For $110 for one night. This was not worth the money. A.c. in our room was not working. We sweated all night... told the guy up front which didn't do much good.  He was very nice but didn't offer a different room or anything and when we first got there we had to ask for towels . They were suppose to go up with them but when we got back after our concert there were no towels. I don't recommend wasting your money here.

Text: The pictures are devious. This hotel has no good qualities including the staff.  It is in a run down area and only restaurant was Mexican and it also was terrible. Room was dirty and mold in shower. Glad my wife wasn't with me. Staff was rude the check in process took 30 min. They overbooked and we're sending people elsewhere. Carpet frayed and just old and un-kept. On a good note wi-fi was good and breakfast bar was good they gave bottles of water at breakfast bar which was nice.

Text: Room was musty  and AC  Smelled of Mildew.   Sheets  had stains. On the plus side staff was friendly and accommodating  and the coffee was good... but. Will not be staying again.
