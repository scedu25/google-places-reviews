Text: My husband and I were visiting Ohio with our young children to go to the Toledo zoo and give them their first hotel experience. We stayed the night along with my parents and special needs brother who came with us and stayed in a room right next to ours. I liked that the room was so close. After getting our discounted tickets from the hotel that morning (which was nice) we drove to the zoo and had a blast. I called the hotel around 12pm and asked if we would be able to check-in early and they said yes. Check-in is usually 3pm. The check-in process had a few minor issues but all together wasn't too terrible. The rooms were clean and tidy. The air conditioning worked very well in the rooms as well. My kids also we're looking forward to going in the pool which was inside. We stayed in the pool for about an hour. There was a large hair ball/glob floating around, other than that the pool and surrounding area was clean. The breakfast was good, there was lots of choices and the pancake maker was kind of neat. I wish they had a waffle maker like I've seen in other hotels because my family loves waffles. Everything was really good overall.

Text: I can't say enough about how we loved our stay here. We loved it so much we extended our stay an extra day. We had a room with an in suite whirlpool and it was the best we have ever been at. It is perfect for 2 people! Though the jets on that and the spa by the pool are a bit strong. People are just the nicest, friendliest staff ever!

Text: Great, affordable rooms. Very clean and new. Really great breakfast with a super cool pancake machine. You press the button and two pancakes come out in a minute. Highly Recommend this establishment.

Text: As the president of our Band Boosters, I reserved 39 rooms for our marching band on September 23, 2017. I have to say that the staff there was incredible.  JoMarie at the front desk was very thorough about helping us get everyone in the proper rooms, and the staff who helped with breakfast, Ron, Kaylin, and Lisa, were  extremely helpful. I was surprised by how good the breakfast was. There were a lot of choices, and the food was better than probably anywhere else I've ever stayed and had a continental breakfast in the morning. They opened up their meeting room for us so that we would have enough seating and kept the food coming. The beds and the rooms were extremely comfortable. I definitely would recommend this hotel.
