Text: I'm at one of these shops nearly everyday.  The Dunkin especially because they have a drive thru on the side and $1 ice coffee any size between 2-6pm in the summer.  The Liquor cabinet, for a compact liquor store, has a decent selection and always friendly and knowledgeable.  They have a rewards program for usual customers I think it's a 15% discount when you reach 22 points.  I've gotten various samples from: Dickies  (yellow cup with any purchase), chocolate dipped fruit from edible arrangements, guac and chips from freebird.  The pet center is a nice break from the petsmart/petco scene although I bought some cat collars that were overpriced. The firestone auto service center has done my oil and replaced tires at prices you would expect and recommend other services based on your mileage or general inspection.  The new building on the corner of 21 and Greenwich is pretty much complete not clear what businesses will be in there yet!  I hope they put a fedex or ups office in the village so I don't have to venture over to rock rd.
