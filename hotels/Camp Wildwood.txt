Text: I started my scouting career in 1976 and I believe I camped at Camp Wildwood in the early 80's.  This boy scout camp has really grown in the past few years it has a really nice chow Hall, and plenty of campsites and activities for the kids to do I would highly recommend camp for all your boy scout Adventures, in Terre Haute Indiana.
