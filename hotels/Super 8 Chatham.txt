Text: Room was nice. Location was great. Price was also great. Would have liked more options for breakfast though.

Text: All in all it wasn't that bad of a stay, but they could use a much needed update for furniture and fixtures. Location is very close to everything. If in town for a quick stop over I would recommend if staying over a longer duration I would suggest else where.

Text: Rooms are adequate and provide the necessary accommodations. No frills but that's expected in a place like this. Was clean and had enough towels and amenities.

Text: Small but very well managed facility. An extremely friendly couple owned and operated. Nice and clean room. Front desk responded to it every request in few seconds. Helped finding a place for dinner. More worth than money spent. I will recommend to my friends? without any reservation.

Text: When we made the reservations, for four nights, we requested a ground floor room with two beds.  Everything was verified on the confirmation.  So we get here and they have us on the second floor with no elevator with one bed.  I have really bad legs, and have fallen before on stairs, so this was not an enjoyable stay!!!  One bed was the second thing that was not preferable but we could deal with.  The people behind the desk were not cordial.  We said good afternoon when we got here and they just stared at us like we were not welcome.  I would not recommend this particular Super 8.
