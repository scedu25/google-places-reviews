Text: Relatively nice rooms, although a bit older. Hotel is in a good location just if of the interstate and closer to food options. Area felt safe, but the entrance is from outside. No breakfast is served.

Text: The staff has been very friendly and courteous.  The room is clean, the area is quite, the bed was comfortable  (at least for one night so far).  The shower only has one power level and that was gentle.  
There is no breakfast, no gym, no pool, et cetera; there is a Bob Evans in 55 seconds walking distance though.  Overall the experience\stay has been great.  No problems to report on my end.

Text: I am very low maintenance.  Visited the Dublin area for a half marathon, & just needed a clean place to sleep & take a shower. Affordable for a comfy bed. Flat screen tv & free wifi. You can't go wrong for $90. Staff super nice & friendly.
