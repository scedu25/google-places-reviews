Super 8 Burlington
Rating: 2
Text: I'm going to start out with at least no one died and our stuff is still here. Ordered two King deluxe suites which were supposed to have a king bed and a pull out couch. First one had a king bed and nothing else. Second room had a recliner. Moved is to a double twin for four full grown men. Ended up with guys on the floor.

Text: Room was nice.Recently remodeled. But came from 6 hours away for family that had to have emergency surgery..Got in at 2am so asked for early check in...  Booked room online which my reservations couldn't be found so they just checked me in. My Reservation was for Wednesday to Thursday. Was informed had to check out at 11am this morning!!! So $80 for 9 hours... Not happy at all!! Have rented other rooms in Burlington as all my family is here.. Other hotels in Burlington have always accomidated me with a small extra fee for early check in, which I tatally understand.. Definitely won't be staying here again!

Text: The room smelled like mildew and mold. The pillows looked scary! I could go on, but I won't. The front desk worker was the best thing about about my brief stay. We checked out immediately.

Text: Dirty-Old and outdated is OK with me. But when the place is dirty, filthy dirty it becomes an issue with me. Underneath pull out couch tons of chip crumbs. Lipstick marks on window. And it looks like there was a pizza that fell face 1st on the carpet and wiped up with a dry rag .The repair and maintenance in this place looks like it was done by a 13 year old. The breakfast was good though.

Text: I will not ever stay at this Super 8 again even if it is close to Fun City. First and foremost I'd never dealt with such a rude person that work for such an establishment until coming here. The front desk person who work nights was very rude and act as if she doesn't like her job or people. I needed a blanket and went to the desk and stood there for almost 15 minutes before she came from outside with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth and walked pass me as if I wasn't there. I politely asked for a blanket and after waiting almost another 5 minutes she brought one  back. I thanked her and she grunted. Earlier that day my son and I left to go to Fun City at 11 A. M. And came back to the hotel at 5 P.M and the towels were still laying in the tub where I placed them instead of the floor. The trash hadn't been emptied, etc. I had to walk down the stairs from the third floor to take dirty towels and trash and to ask nicely for clean towels. The soap was opened and used. Floor in bathroom was filthy and carpet un vacuumed. I can go on about attitude but I'll stop here.
