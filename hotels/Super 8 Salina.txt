Text: Clean room, nice beds. The place seems well kept, for reasonable prices. There was an unusual smell that was only at our doorway. It didn't extend into our room or into the hallway.

Text: Clean, quiet place. Takes pets. I've stayed here 4 different times and always had a good stay. I've even left things and retrieved them on my way back a week later. Recommend.

Text: Beautiful room paintings, big TV with good selection of shows and channels, nice staff. I think the woman we worked with was named Vina and she was very helpful and accommodating. The beds were very comfy. Everything was clean. They had a waffle maker.

Text: Elevator stopped working when we got there.  They called right away but we still had to carry everything upstairs.  4 suitcases and 2 kids.  But it was clean and comfortable.
