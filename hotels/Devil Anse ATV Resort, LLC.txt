Devil Anse ATV Resort, LLC

Text: Fantastic. This place is under new management and they are great. A friendly retired couple has renovated all of the facilities and they thought of everything. There are spaces for primitive camping, RVs with proper hookups, and cabins. The bathhouse is brand new and in sparkling condition. They have a lake to fish in, fire pits all around and even a grill for food coming off of the trail. The prices on the small things are a bit much but their rates per night are great especially considering you are right on your own trailhead so it makes up for it. They even have bags of ice on site. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who likes to be outdoors and wants to hit the ATV trails.

Text: Stopped in to say hi and see what it was all about. Nice looking cabins and property. Not a big fan of the 3 day minimum for rental or the fact that you need a bigger group to make it affordable to stay here. Rates or places that accommodate 2 people would be more attractive to me.
