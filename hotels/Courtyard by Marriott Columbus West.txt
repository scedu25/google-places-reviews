Courtyard by Marriott Columbus West

Text: Very clean and nice hotel. Room (double queen) was spacious and accommodating for 2 adults and 2 kids (both 10 and under). The pool was nice and the area was set up nice too. The lounge area was large and comfortable too. The only complaint I have was the workout area - no water and not enough weight lifting options (only a rack of dumbbells and a bench).

Text: Stayed here for one night. Overall a really nice hotel. The bar area was nice, although we didn't stop. The rooms were large and spacious. There was a refrigerator which is always nice. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were a little on the flat side for my tastes. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Beautiful new upgrades! This hotel goes above and beyond a regular hotel with its new chic interior design. The conference rooms are very comfortable well climate controlled and renovated. The lobby and seating areas are comfortable and welcoming with plenty of TV's to watch the latest news on CNN. I'm excited to see the beautiful new renovated rooms on a future stay.

Text: Very nice hotel. Not super impressive from the outside, but the common areas and the rooms were definitely up to par. There is a nice bar and lounge area on the first floor along with a pool that you can see from the balconies of most of the rooms. The room was very nice had all of the amenities that you can expect including a mini fridge. Everything was very nice and clean. The staff was very nice.
