Text: Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. We asked the staff for restaurant recommendations and they helpfully provided a sheet with local eateries and marked their favorites. The breakfast area was roomy with plenty of seating and offered the usual fare: waffles cereal, bread for toast, coffee and juice.

Text: Dead flys all over bathroom. TV stations suck, nothing to watch. Nothing much for breakfast. Only cereal or small walfels. Should have stayed at Holiday day inn Express instead.
