Text: We highly recommend this La Quinta hotel for anyone traveling in the area. It was very clean, the rooms were updated and quiet., Lobby wonderful. The breakfast was one of the best we've had at hotel situation. Restaurants, shopping and fuel are all very close. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area.

Text: very nice hotel. good location for walking to restaurants, nice staff, very clean. I am not a fan of the dog policy someone has allergies and stays in a room after a dog's been there it could be a problem. Also in the morning there were some times when I could hear dogs barking and whining  other than that there were no problems with dogs . But if you're a dog lover it's a nice hotel to stay at.

Text: Big, big, big standard rooms. Well, the one on the third floor that I stayed in seemed pretty palatial given the price. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fairly straightforward for these types of chains. There was a small note from the manager in the room, which I thought was a nice touch.
