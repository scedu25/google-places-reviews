Cummins Ferry Resort

Text: Beautiful scenery surrounded this RV park! Although is tucked away with a tad steep hill and turn to get down to it (and back up from it), that's part of its charm! It's so peaceful and quiet, but with the sound of the river that runs just beside the park! Our 33' tow behind had no problem making the hill (and we have a smaller truck engine, so no worries about the steepness). It evidently looked worse than it was! Ha! Ha!
  Staff was terrific! Even put out a orange cone for us to identify our site, as well as having lovely PAVED and level DRIVE -THRU sites!  Pool as well! Really lovely hidden gem!

Text: Cummins Ferry just might become our new weekend getaway.  We stumbled upon it by accident when trying to find a Memorial Day weekend camping site.  We were not disappointed.  The campground is old, but it has been marvelously maintained.  With the exception of the pull through sites, large rigs might find the sites too short.  Nestled under the Kentucky River Palisades, the campground is scenic and QUIET!  No interstate or main road traffic noise.  There is a nice pool (unheated) which our grandson enjoyed, and despite teeth chattering cold, couldn't wait to get back into it (at 6:00 am).  Cell service is spotty and doesn't support gamers.  Great place to disconnect.  Will be back soon.

Text: Very peaceful. The people are incredibly nice and friendly. This place is very natural and sits right on the Kentucky River.

Text: Stayed three days very much enjoyed the peace and serenity. The owners are on site and wonderful people. After spending just a few minutes with this couple you understand they love what they do. Looking forward to our next visit.
