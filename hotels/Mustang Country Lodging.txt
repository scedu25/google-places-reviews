Text: Stayed in room 32 - 2 people for 63$. Room was very clean, smelled fresh, new shower curtain. Had hot water quickly, good water pressure, a refrigerator, and lots of TV chanels. Friendly service. They said the rooms had all been remodeled three years ago. One of the cleanest motels I've been in in a long time. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend.

Text: I absolutely love it here! I honestly was scared to be this far away from home without family I usually travel with but I'm glad I got over my fear and came! You guys made me laugh and feel comfortable as I do back home! I will never forget this place and I'm sure we plan on coming back soon. Glad I met you guys! thank you for everything!

Text: This place is great...it's  clean, clean! It is quiet, the rooms are  cozy and homey. The owners take pride in it and it shows...they are very hands on (that's why it is so clean and homey) The rates are very reasonable . The owners  along with their assistant do their best to give you  the best stay possible...they are all super friendly and add so much to making your stay comfortable and pleasant.  I also enjoyed the fact that the beds  were  super comfy too.  It is also a big deal for me that it is American (and veteran) owned! In this day and age of  generic big box motels , and motels that are being bought up  by East India Corp.s , and then allowed to rundown to substandard conditions, it is so refreshing to find those  small motels that still have high standards!!!  IF YOUR THE TYPE OF PERSON  WHO THINKS MOTELS ARE YOUR PERSONAL SERVANTS  AND YOU CAN BE SLOPPY, DIRTY, NOISEY,  AND LEAVE YOUR TRASH EVERYWHERE ......THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!  If however you want clean, comfy, cozy, and super friendly  and your respectful of other people  THIS  IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY. 
I  arrived here as a stranger but I am leaving as a friend - with plans to return!
To all of you who made my stay so pleasant...THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! -  T.
