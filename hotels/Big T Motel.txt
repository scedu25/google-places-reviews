Text: My wife and I stayed here in the autumn of 2015, and it was clean, quiet, and very affordable. All we needed was a small, simple, clean room to spend the night before our camping trip the next day, and this was perfect for that. Of course, this isn't the kind of place that offers a suite with a swimming pool and fireplace, so in all fairness it should be judged in comparison with other economy motels. If you're looking for a modern, state of the art, romantic location to stay for your anniversary, you're expecting too much. For a good night's sleep in a clean, quiet room with a comfortable bed, this will do nicely. The married couple who managed the motel (at that time, at least) were very polite and congenial. I would definitely stay here again for the purposes mentioned above. Ignore the reviews from several years ago that are negative---it was under different management then.

Text: Last week we stayed at the Big T motel for several days. The young couple that own the motel are absolutely wonderful! They went up and above their duty of service. It's a no frills motel but it is very clean and comfortable.  I would highly recommend The Big T Motel.
