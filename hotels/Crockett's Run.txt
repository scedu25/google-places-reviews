Text: Location is great. Very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed in the lodge. Sleeps 20, but only 2 bathrooms. Would have been nicer to have an extra bathroom, but we made it work. Outside picnic table was broken, and the paddle boat almost sank. Overall, a nice place to stay and would consider it again.

Text: The building in which the event (4-H Cloverbud camp) was held was wonderful! Not too large, but big enough to have fun with the kids. The area is beautiful, and the kids had a great time exploring! Would be great for a wedding venue!

Text: Cabins, lodges and a venue for something like a wedding maybe. Some units are isolated but not secluded, others are closer and would be great if you rented multiple units.
