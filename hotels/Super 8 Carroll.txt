Text: The beds are soft and comfy. Pillows are soft. Not too soft not too hard. Pet friendly. Continental breakfast was great. Person working the front desk is nice and very helpful. In my opinion, this place is as good if not better that any hotel that is more expensive.

Text: Love it! Manager is awesome. Very nice, clean rooms. You can walk in here and enjoy breathing because it actually smells nice & clean.  Great place for a trucker to get a good nights sleep, warm shower, and good food without having to worry about bedbugs or worse. Quiet spot to relax.  No smoking room was actually smoke free unlike most motels that claim to be. You get a pass for free Anytime Fitness as well as breakfast, and amentities. Will be our stopping spot from now on.

Text: Rooms were clean with exception of the bathroom. Manager was flighty and off putting, she also compained a lot that she works too much. AC would only work on full blast. Vending machines broken.

Text: The manager was very hard to deal with and rude... my advice is go elsewhere or jus sleep in your car instead
