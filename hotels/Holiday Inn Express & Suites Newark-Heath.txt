Text: Sad to hear that the hotel will be turning into a comfort suites in a month. The hotel is finally being fully upgraded, just in time for the change. The breakfast is the usual fare. The rooms are comfortable, beds good, pillows both firm and soft versions. Internet is good, showers a bit weak, but good enough.
