Turkey Run Canoe & Camping
Rating: 1
Text: Called "Turkey Run Canoe and Camping" now. Terrible experience. Some staff members were rude over phone and in person - ensuring we felt our questions were an inconvenience to them. FILTHY, DISGUSTING bathrooms and showers. No soap in ladies room for two full days. Overflowing dumpsters. One of our campsites was only 12 feet wide (site 11). They could not manage tube and canoe trips properly, so we couldn't go out on the trip despite following their directions to show up on time.  Campers also do not respect the 11p quiet hours, and staff doesn't do anything about it.  You have to pay $20 for a grill b/c fire pits aren't equipped.

Text: Took 4 hours to float down river but fun I suggest if the wind is not blowing you where you need to go get a kayak or canoe

Text: Nice camping alternative if you can't get into the main park.

Text: The primitive camping site size is large, but its a long long walk to an outdated shower or water hydrant. The worst pit toilets, use your imagination.....Portajohns are available, but needed servicing.
