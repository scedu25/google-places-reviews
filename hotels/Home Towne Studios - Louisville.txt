Text: This place is the pits.  My review is based on the conditions of the rooms and upper management, not the front desk.  Let me start by saying the security, maintenance and front desk are cordial, personable, and attentive.  The cleaning staff needs training and I feel that upper management needs to inspect the rooms, and the health department needs to make a visit.  The rooms have cockroaches, the refrigerator was disgusting, and the bathroom filthy.  You have to ask for towels, and maintenance doesn't hook up the tv until after you get to the room.  I've attached a few pictures.  This place needs a deep cleaning and renovation.

Text: This is the WORST EXPERIENCE I ever had they treat you so poorly here it makes no sense. I’ve been treated like the scum of the earth since I’ve been staying here little over 5 weeks. My room has not once been cleaned I had to bring my own wash rags and towels. The smoke detector beeps all night long I work two jobs and this is the only place I know with the business hours of 11-7. I’m never able to make it to the office during business hours. They put me on hold for hours when I try to process payments. I was moved to three different room because the rooms were INFESTED with bugs. Guy the on-site manager has done NOTHING to accommodate my needs and security beats on my door late hours during the night saying Ive been checked out when i already paid for the week. DO NOT RENT ROOM HERE if you have other options.

Text: For the price, very acceptable. Only issue was on arrival our room phone had no phone cord so that it could be used, and the remote was for a different type of tv. Both issues were promptly fixed though.

Text: absolutely terrible place. Very poorly managed and not customer friendly what so ever. The office hours are set so that they can take advantage of what amounts to stealing from their customers by taking payments for the rooms and never allowing u the opportunity check in as no one is ever attending the office and they don't answer the phone. Enjoy the money you stole from me but I will never return again.
