Hilton Garden Inn South Bend

Text: Check in for my reservation was easy. They gave me a bag with some bottled water and got off to my room. Room was nice and clean, shower looked a little dated compared to the rest of the room, but water pressure was nice. Ate breakfast(not complementary but they had a kichen you could order from) and was on my way.

Text: This hotel moved me from the room I picked out with the online app.
Oh well, I could live with that.  Then, during my stay, they took my things out of my room and put them behind the desk without informing me and assigned me a new room. When my key didnt work upon my return at 1:00AM, there was no one at the front desk to tell me what was going on. after waiting for 15 minutes and searching to the extent i felt comfortable
i called  the hotel number, was answered by the receptionist on duty who arrived 10 minutes later from parts unknown.  She gave me a new key WITHOUT TELLING ME IT WAS TO A DIFFERENT ROOM. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS.  POORLY MANAGED WITH NO CONCEPT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  It was the worst hotel experience of my life.  for my touble i was offered a free breakfast.  Never hilton again.

Text: The room was large, comfortable, with a medium sized working space. The lobby is attractive. The front desk folks were friendly and helpful.

Text: Heat did not work in my room, reception advised there was nothing she could do. After persistence, maintenance came up and my room saw that my room was below 60 degrees and its 20 degrees outside. It was totally unacceptable, and will definitely be providing feedback to my corporate travel agent

Text: Clean, modern facility. Room clean and tidy with the exception of a candy wrapper under the bed. Room and bathroom well appointed. $10/person breakfast brunch selection underwhelming, went to Perkins 1 block over for same price. Will stay again to check out the rest of the facility.
