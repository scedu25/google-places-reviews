Amana Colonies
Rating: 4
Text: Arrived in Amana at 10am on a Friday and hardly anything was open.  We stopped by the visitors center and asked about the hours and the answer we got was "Most of them should be open now.  If they're not, they will be soon. Or they may open later.  Or not at all."   
After spending a good amount of time browsing the General Store (the Christmas area is AWESOME) we came out to find most everything open except the fudge store. (It opened later in the afternoon and I did go in, but wasn't terribly impressed.  No one acknowledged my presence even though I was the only customer, so I left.)
We spent the entire afternoon going from store to store and had a wonderful time tasting and shopping.  Every other store was very hospitable, glad to see us and eager to answer questions and help.  Loved the experience.  Will have to go back again!

Text: We greatly enjoyed our visit to the colonies.  I wish we would have been able to spend multiple days here exploring each of the colonies.  
It was totally worth the half hour detour on our way home.  We'll see you next road trip!

Text: Everyone should go here once.  Definitely read up on the history of the colonies before arriving.  If you use a walker of wheelchair, some things will be challenging or you can't do.  Don't go during Oktoberfest unless you are doing Oktoberfest.

Text: Interesting combination of historical buildings well maintained alongside present day commerce. A bit too much appeared to be imported goods brought in to "fill out" the inventory. I also wish there was more historical interpretation available. Nonetheless, an intriguing place to visit.

Text: A former German communal society transitioning to more of an artist community. Great German food and festivals. A fun place to visit for the history,  food and the antique shops. Oktoberfest there is great.
