Text: The family running this place were nice and responsive to our needs but the cleanliness of the bathroom in particular was hideous. Mold and mildew in the shower, stained towels, mildew ring in the toilet, and hairs in the sink and shower. Its not like this place was so busy they can't keep up with maintenance... we were the only ones there all weekend. We did not ask the owners to rectify the bathroom because we didn't have time, we had a wedding to get ready for. Cannot recommend this place.

Text: My experience was dreadful this weekend. Spots on carpet, bedding actually had not been changed from previous guest. Towels were all gray (should have been white). They were all stiff, bathroom was scarey,rust and crude around tube and shower doors. Bed spreads dirty turned back one bed, stains on the bottom sheet that were not old.. If there had been anywhere else close, I would have left. Slept in my clothes. I'm having a hard time reading all the positive comments. Must have been other owners at the time.
