La Quinta Inn & Suites Louisville Airport & Expo
Rating: 5
Text: We stay at many La Quintas and this is one of best. It was clean and comfortable with lots of room. Hot breakfast in the morning and warm cookies at night. New pack in play to borrow for the babies. Pet friendly and free shuttle to the airport.

Text: 5/5 100% recommend. 

Pros: fair price, free shuttle available to expo center area, pets allowed, grassy area with pet cleanup bags, super friendly staff, really quiet, clean rooms, comfy bed, good free breakfast, small pool to relax, easy access to everywhere in Louisville. 

Cons: none

We had a great stay and this hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. Definitely not an upscale, fancy, type of hotel, but everything was great. Definitely would stay again.

Text: Don't waste your money or time with this place. They will give you whatever type of room they feel like regardless of the reservation you make. And they have zero customer service skills. For this price point, you are much safer going with Hampton or Comfort Inn. I will never stay at La Quinta again.

Text: Large very spacious room with comfortable beds. Only complaint is the breakfast was nothing special. The eggs and sausage patties did not taste good at all.

Text: This place was awesome. The employees there need an award. They were all extremely nice, spoke every time you past one of them. Room very spacious, clean & comfortable. Not a bad area at all.
Close to restaurants. Fresh coffee all the time. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Can't say enough about this place. I will be back.
