Honeysuckle Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Arrived late to this charming place, yet we were greeted with a friendly smile. Got the last available room. With a REAL key in hand, we opened the door and the freshness of the room's interior was a welcome smell and sight. Neatly-made beds with crisp white linens (the top sheet was turned down just enough to reveal a small, embroidered hummingbird and flower). Clean carpet, sparkling vanity and tile in sink and bath areas. Nice array of quality soaps and bath products. After a very long drive from NE Alabama, to sleep in such an inviting, clean, locally-owned motel was a treat. Price was very reasonable, too. Happy we found the Honeysuckle Inn.

Text: Clean, comfortable. Helpful staff. Get a room on the side away from highway or else you'll listen to traffic all night.

Text: We saw the hotel on the drive to NC and thought it looked cute so we looked to stop on the way home from vacation. The only available rooms were deluxe, they include mini fridge and microwave so we took the king and after tax the room was $107.11. 
The room was dated but clean. I took apart the bed sheets to check for signs of bed bugs, I was pleased to find the bed encased in fairly thick protective cover. Overall the room was clean the bed was comfortable there was a bit of a musty oder in the room probably due to the humidity here but I slept good!

Text: Very pleasant at check in, room was comfortable when I walked in. May be a little dated but was pleased with it really clean with no oder. I'd stop n stay again if ever in the area.
