Ramada Bettendorf

Text: Really only giving this a 1 star because I can’t give it zero. Reserved a hot tub suite, and it was a total waste of money. The mirrors above the tub were smudged and clearly weren’t cleaned since the last use, the hot tub had hairs and dirt all over the bottom. The sheets were stained, the bed needed to be replaced years ago. It WREAKS of mold. Staff is less than pleasant, to put it nicely. Could not possibly be more disgusted. Supposed to be here another 2 nights but we will be switching hotels tomorrow. Unless the world has come to an end and this is the only place with a mattress, go elsewhere.

Text: It’s a shame that google won’t allow a zero star rating. Disgusting, smelly, sub-par hotel. The employees were depressed, as well they should be working in such a decrepit establishment. The only good solution is to tear the place down to the studs and rebuild it, or simply take a wrecking ball to the place. The overall lighting of the hotel was circa 1950, sconce lights that barely light the rooms and hallways adding to the overall depressing and unclean atmosphere of the hotel. The rooms smelled terrible and haven’t seen the house keeping service in years. The carpets are peeling back, there is dust, dirt, and HAIR everywhere. The pool and hot tub are “under construction”. Do your self a favor and DO NOT STAY HERE.

Text: Damn! Wish I'd read the reviews before booking and staying here. Dated looking hotel. Pool was COLD. Hot tub was under construction. Room was noisy with mini-fridge and AC rattling and buzzing all night. WiFi was so slow as to be useless. The only redeeming amenity was the included breakfast. Definitely NOT up to Ramada standards.

Text: They do not deserve even 1 star.  Our hallway smelled like a mouse died somewhere and was still rotting! Our room was non-smoking but obviously was occupied by many smokers as we couldn’t breath.  Our heater was set on very low heat and kept running on high heat so was very hard to sleep so we shut it off completely and got cold bc the weather outside was 29 degrees! Our shower had mold in the ceiling!  But what really made us mad was we came back after being gone all day and found a bite in our bed that said, “Due to personal items on the bed we were not able to make it.”   I? always travel with a small  blanket and small pillow and folded it before we left and out at the end of the bed so housekeeping didn’t have to mess with them.  But their policy is to not make the bed because of 2 small items were setting on the bed! I? called front desk and complained that we’ve been to hundreds of hotels in 30 years and never had anyone leave my bed unmade because if this.   WE WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE!
