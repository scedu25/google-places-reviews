Text: The beds are amazing! Very comfortable and clean rooms, I loved the porch you can have morning coffee and would totally stay again. My daughter got the stomach flu and they allowed us to do a late check out for no additional fee. Overall very accommodating!

Text: Great price for a clean, enjoyable stay.  Quality bistro food and drink selection, though a continental breakfast would be a plus.  Rooms were clean and well appointed with plenty of outlets for phone/device chargers.  I was able to hook up my game console directly to the 37" in-room TV via HDMI, though TV channel options were quite limited.

Front desk service was very courteous, friendly and efficient.

Overall an enjoyable stay, great price in a reasonably accessible neighborhood, would stay here again.

Text: I've been in bigger rooms but it was fine. We got a double queen room with two kids and it was cramped at times. I was surprised they didn't have a clothesline in the bathroom. The pool area was fine but there were dead bugs seen here and there. Not overly terrible. The pool and hot tub we're a comfortable temp and the kids had a blast.

Text: Very nice accommodations. Didn't like they request an incidentals fee. Neither desk clerk was able to explain it to my satisfaction. Claimed it either wasn't charged or I would receive credit back.

Text: The location was great. It was close to the office I was visiting. Lots of restaurants nearby and close to the freeway. The room was big and there is free internet. The room rate is a bit high for a Courtyard. The cable TV reception wasn't good.
