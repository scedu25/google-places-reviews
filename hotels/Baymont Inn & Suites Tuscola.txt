Rating: 5
Text: I love when a place just really meets my expectations.  Great staff, clean, comfortable, and spacious rooms, everything was modern and in great working condition. The linens and towels were super soft. I would definitely stay at the Baymont again next time I'm in Tuscola, IL.

Text: No customer service at all. I made a reservation in person two weeks before my stay. The meeting I had in the area was canceled so I called the hotel direct ,immediately,  which was the day before my stay( more than 24 hours ahead) I was charged for the room anyway. The manager would not return my money even through the room was canceled and available for them to use. If it is worth the $94. they got off me to loose any further business from my family they better use the money well as unless I am reimbursed they will get no more..

Text: Staff was very friendly, the pool was nice, and everything was very clean. The bed and pillows were slightly below great but that comes with the price. The showerhead was excellent and water pressure was good. Overall good experience.

Text: The first thing I noticed about the Baymont was its fantastic location. It's just off I-57, which takes you directly to Champaign or Chicago. There are also several restaurants nearby, which was convenient.

I always appreciate when a hotel lets me check in early. Tuscola doesn't have a lot to do, so I was very grateful. I was very surprised on check in that the lobby, which is adjacent to the pool, does not smell like chlorine at all. The check in process was quick, which is always nice.

When I got to the room, I was a little worried because there were a few kids in the room next door. But when I went into my room I didn't hear anything. A plus soundproofing, seriously.

As hotels go, this place was decent. Water heat and pressure were great, the room temperature was easily manageable, and there were WAY more channels than I need. The only real down side to the entire hotel is that there's only one entrance and exit to the parking lot, which was a little bit hectic when I left. And if that's the only complaint I have, this hotel definitely earned it's 5 star rating. I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
