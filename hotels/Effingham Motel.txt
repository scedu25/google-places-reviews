Text: The usual 50's motor lodge. Utilitarian at best. $165/week. Other than the price, not much good to say about this place. It does have micro/fridge in every room. No wi-fi available. Furnishings in poor condition. Lukewarm water at best, sometimes all you get is cold water in the shower. No laundry facilities onsite, but a public laundry about two blocks up the road. Smoking rooms available.
Geared more toward long term tenancy, but cheap enough to be good for a one night stopover for those budget-oriented and don't mind staying in squalid conditions.
Only stayed for about a month, but its quite apparent via dialogue through thin walls that drug dealers and users frequent this place for residency. Effingham police department were onsite arresting tenants at least every weekend for fighting. One particularly busy night someone was hurling beer bottles at another guest in the parking lot. So yeah, light sleepers wont get any sleep.
Well, if you have some cash in your wallet it is slightly better than sleeping in your car, I guess.
