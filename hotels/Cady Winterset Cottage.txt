Cady Winterset Cottage
Rating: 5
Text: A beautiful cottage with an early European flair and filled with antiques. It is so calming, relaxing, and charming. The owners pampered us which made us feel very special. This is our second visit. We definitely will return. The owners are quite amazing people.

Text: Chris and Gretchen are the epitome of genuine hospitality! The food could not be any better, made to order, from scratch, locally sourced, eggs from the chickens out back, and prepared on silver platters. They will treat you like royalty. Accommodations are charming and lovely. We stay here every year on our wine trail weekends. We've stayed in other B&Bs in other cities, they all pale in comparison to Cady Winterset Cottage.
