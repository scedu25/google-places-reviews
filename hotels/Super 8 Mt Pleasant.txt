Text: We stayed here on our way to Mn, and our room was very clean.  The whole motel was very clean.  The free breakfast was wonderful...lots of choices to choose from, and they kept it well stocked for the not so early risers.  The staff was extremely friendly.  I would stay here again, and I would recommend it to everyone.  We had a great stay here.

Text: Reserved a two beds room and apon arriving after 11hrs of driving we find that it was a 1 bed instead of two then once that was corrected we were accused of smoking in a none smokimg room because a pack of cigarettes along with hat, keys, wallet etc was sitting on the desk when staff came in, then was threatened to be charged for smoking in the room that never happened...    Won't be using this place again!   This is not my first time in a hotel I know the rules and don't care to be treated like a little kid..

Text: I wouldn't stay at this hotel. Husband stayed last night for work (7/28/17) walked into a dirty room, and woke up to multiple bed bugs in the bed. Took bugs to front desk in a cup (very angry I might add) and they laughed as if it was a joke. He insisted on a full refund, got it. Which I'm glad. Don't recommend this place to anyone, well maybe your worse enemy!
