Text: This place is just magical! I didn't want to leave. From the little things like the kindest hospitality, to the most tasteful style in decor, to the beautiful grounds and creek trail to wander and great bikes to borrow... everything was so perfect

Text: The pictures dont do this place justice! Julie and Eric do a great job making sure their guests feel at home, and there is enough space to allow for privacy. The daily breakfast was always amazing and the portions were spot on! Overall 5 stars, absolutely will stay again

Text: Great bed and breakfast. The hosts were super nice and happy to accommodate you in anyway. The breakfasts were great and plentiful. I would definitely come back and stay again. Beautiful property and close by lots of wineries and restaurants. Loved it and will be back
