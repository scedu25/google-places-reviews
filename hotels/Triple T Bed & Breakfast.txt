Triple T Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I just spent 2 nights at the Triple T Ranch, and we were very pleased. It was a great place to get away and recharge, especially if you're an animal lover. It was very reasonably priced for the services provided. We plan to return!

Text: Just stayed at the Triple T Bed & Breakfast and had a great nights sleep.  Private and quiet with no one running around in the hallways.  The room was very clean and breakfast was more than I could wish for.  All the amenities without the noise and traffic of a hotel chain, and at a competative price.  I highly reccomend for business travelers in the Findlay area.
