Text: Hands down the best customer service I've ever experienced. The owners went well above and beyond to accommodate me during a crisis caused by a competitor without the help they gave me I wouldn't have had a place to stay. The rooms are spotless , staff has been amazing, just an all around  great place to stay  thank you so much for all you've done , there are still some good people out there after all

Text: Very clean accomodations. Rooms cleaned daily with towel exchange. Linens changed every 7 days. The owners are some of the friendliest people you can meet. I enjoyed my stay in the small, quaint, quiet town of Wilton.

Text: Not good anymore.  We stayed there for several years, but in 2012 they charged us $250 for smoking in the room.  Which we did not do.  It didn't matter that we phoned them and told them we did not do this.  They were more interested in the money than keeping steady customers.  We will not be returning to Motel Wilton.
