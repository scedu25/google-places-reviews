Text: Our visit this time was great! The room was very nice and clean. The girl at the front desk was a real sweetheart! When we got back to the motel tonight there were fresh baked cookies right out of the oven! What a nice treat!

Text: Check in was a little rough, had to go back 3 times to get a good key but overall the room was nice and clean.  The staff were very friendly.  We would recommend.

Text: The hotel was nice & the staff were very welcoming, friendly & helpful. The breakfast room was very clean & organized. We stayed in the standard room, it was fine, roomy enough for our boys to play in. Basic furnishings & clean, nothing fancy. Any issues with things not working or faulty, the staff were very prompt on making sure, it was replaced or fixed. Continental hot breakfast was good, but I'm not a fan of rubbery egg & cheese omelettes. But decent selection of breakfast items. Pool was decent, but very hard to see as there wasnt enough lighting. That would be the one thing I could possibly complain about. Reasonable priced through a 2nd party travel website. Most likely stay here again.
