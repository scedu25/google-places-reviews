Text: All it takes is common courtesy & ears for effective listening when you're dealing with the public. I arrived to this hotel and I told the young lady at the front desk that I will be staying 2 to 5 days and that I was here on a business trip. I will not be using this IHG card again it's pointless and now I can't stay tomorrow because now they say they're overbooked.

They won't take into account that I arrived first and that I stated that I was staying 2 to 5 days I will never come here again. I would leave right now they gave me my money back.

Checking it out first thing in the morning,  and I promise you I won't be back?

Text: This Holiday Inn Express is fairly new, so the room I stayed in was nicely decorated and very clean. I appreciated the mini frigrrator and microwave. The shower head is fully functional and the water pressure is also. This hotel's location is easy to find and is located in a good area of this city. Thank you!

Text: Large, well appointed, clean room. Friendly, helpful staff. Bed was a bit too firm for my liking. Don't bother with the continental breakfast. A Bob Evans and McDonald's are close by.
