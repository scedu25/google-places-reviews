Text: Not a nice hotel.  Told me the rate was 60 dollars per night.  I had my wife check out for me after three days and the bill was over three hundred.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  Im not mad just honest.  Take notice of the names that are giving this place a high review.  Just saying.
