Timber Lake Resort

Text: I found this place by Google and it is a great place to camp. We had a cabin on the lake - worth every penny. Definitely coming back soon! Pool area is wonderful and the playground is close to the cabins - very good for the little ones. We brought 4 littles under the age of 5 and thoroughly enjoyed our time. Keep it up!
