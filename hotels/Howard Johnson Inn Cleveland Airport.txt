Text: Great location,  great customer service from all.  From the young lady at the front desk. Even the housekeeping left a note thanking us for coming. It just doesn't get better than this. Oh yeah beds are amazing and so was breakfast. Thank you Best Western of Brook Park.  Dusty

Text: Stains on the carpet, almost positive we had bed bugs, on one of the beds, the frame was not the right size for the mattress so it was sticking right out. I cant tell you how many time my family and I smacked our legs on it. I have a permanent scar from hitting it so hard and cutting it. The rooms just don't feel clean. It is a dirty atmosphere... and I am pretty sure there was a drug deal going on in the middle of the night in the parking lot. You couldn't pay me a billion dollars to go back.

Text: I'd give it 1/2 a star or no star if I could. Stayed here for a night and noticed they charged us an extra $250 a week later. They tried saying my wife and I smoked in the room. After arguing with them, they then stated we were doing drugs in the room which was also false. We contacted corporate and they were extremely upset at the hotel and gave us our money back. We also received a call from an investigator with the company wanting to know what happened. Stay away from this dump! I know it's nice to save a few bucks when staying at a hotel. However, after our experience, I'd rather pay over $100 for a room and know I'm in a nice hotel and taken care of.

Text: The worst you can ever imagine. I have never been treated with such disrespect by the manager and her staff. Drug dealers, Prostitutes on the staff and guests. 

DO NOT GO THERE there is a very nice Hotel down the street for the same rates. They Have a gym, Indoor pool, restaurant and BAR.

Yes they have towels and toilet paper and the toilets Flush, roof don't leak all over. 

NO STAR FROM ME
