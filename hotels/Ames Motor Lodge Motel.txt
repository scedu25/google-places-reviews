Text: Very disgusting place. My husband was staying there for work and he has bumps all over his body how disgusting. How can u have bed bugs in a HOTEL!! Very disrespectful people when u confront them about there nasty problems with there rooms. For sure not a place for a baby/kid. Should be shut tf down! Not a Hotel, to dirty.

Text: There's mice. The water pressure in the bath is very light and the water doesn't get hot. They kicked me, my 10 MONTH old and boyfriend out because we called and told them that the room was infested. The employees are rude. Spend the extra money for a different hotel. Not worth the stay.
