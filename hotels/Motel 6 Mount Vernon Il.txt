Motel 6 Mount Vernon Il
Rating: 1
Text: I have stayed with the motel 6 chain for years. I have always been pleased. Until now. The front desk associate's were professional and kind. The hotel itself or rooms, and beds were less than amazing. You could hear everyone in other rooms as if they were in your room. The beds were hard really hard to the point my daughter and I had to buy foam toppers just to get comfortable sleep. I understand that there are firm beds but these beds exceeded firm. I started at motel 6 in Pueblo Colorado and it was awesome in every aspect.

Text: My stay was terrific!  The room was comfortable for myself and my 2 dogs.  Check in and check out were quick and painless.  The front desk clerk was very helpful in locating a good parking space for my truck and travel trailer.

Text: Stay twice a year, on my way to and back from the south for the winter. Love Motel 6 because I travel with two cats. Being able to park directly in front of the room door is important to me.  In addition, the rooms are more than adequate and the staff is always great!

Text: Very friendly staff, very nice and enjoyed talking with her.   The room was really clean, but small bathroom. Very hard hard beds, no hair dryers or even a coffee maker. Two things we could used.

Text: We stayed 8/31/17 on travel to Maryland. Close to Interstate, pet friendly with no extra charge, has large grassy area. Room was clean & smelled fresh. No extra amenities but price was low budget at $65. (Bring your own hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion. Had 2 small bars of soap.) Micro fridge & microwave. Bed was overly hard, I still got a good night's rest. The area seemed to be fair. Individual door opens to outside. Office receptionist was nice & professional.
