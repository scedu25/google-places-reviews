Indian Creek Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Great secret of Missouri camping. Plenty of distance between sites. Great views of lake.  Plenty of thick woods in and around the campground. Access road is well maintained. Peaceful. Lots of shade. Getting to this campground  can be a little difficult.  Yes there are ticks, like the rest of MO, so bring bug spray.

Text: Very nice campground. Had a great time. They have a playground and a private Beach area for the campers. Nice place for kids to be able to ride bikes. Clean campsites. Bathrooms were pretty clean...I hate Spiders!!! We will definitely be back.

Text: Our favorite place, we spend the majority of our summer weekends here. Nice large spots, shower houses are clean, kids can ride bikes to playground without a worry. Love it.

Text: Quiet hours are a joke and not enforced. If you want to be loud, I suppose it's a good thing. We, however, were not wanting loud. It's 11:17 p.m. and one group is drunk, drunk, drunk and letting their kids run around and scream. Every so often a drunk adult will scream at a kid to be quiet. It just results in a lot of screaming and more noise than if I had stayed home in the city where I live 0.5 miles away from a major highway. It's annoying and so disappointing.

Text: Nice camping spots, not cramped. Good fire pits, area was clean & well kept. Restrooms don't have soap though & were only cleaned once in the week we were there. They were not horrible but not fantastic either.
