Text: Nice breakfast very good treatment from all staff. Needs some deep cleaning in rooms, had a centipede visitor. I know they are valuable for smaller critter control, however I would prefer they stay outside.

Text: After a very difficult day, it was very nice to check in to a clean room.  The shower was hot and good pressure. The bed felt new and was very comfortable.   They offer a great selection of breakfast items. The coffee tasted like coffee. Will definitely be back
