La Quinta Inn & Suites Cedar Rapids
Rating: 5
Text: Wow, solid 5 stars, easy. I stay in a hotel about once a week for work, and usually stay in best westerns. Not only does everything at this La Quinta look and feel brand new (including the beds), but the customer service is great and they have several amenities which impressed me. This location has a pool and fitness center, both were above par for the usual hotel standards. The breakfast is the best I've had all year. It's within walking distance of a chili's and a wehrenberg movie theater. And there are plenty of quality restaurants within driving distance. I thought the baggage carts were awesome... just like at the airport.

Text: Amazing service for so little a price! Laundry is very affordable and fitness room has a plethora of machines for use.  The Breakfast Bar is filled with foods to stuff you during your stay.

Text: I've stayed here 8 or 9 times over the past year.  It's a decent place; standard hotel, not expensive, standard features. It is clean, the staff is nice, the rooms are good, and the place is usually very quiet (I rarely realize there are other people around me when I'm in my room). My biggest complaint would be the Wi-Fi, as it is constantly drops the connection and is all around slow.  Since I need to work, a spotty connection is a problem. Not sure if I'll be returning on my next CID visit primarily for this fact.

Text: The room was great! I was traveling with my sister and my cat and we had a great stay! I especially like that they don't charge pet fees. The breakfast was also good.

Text: Very pleasant surprise. We're on a drive across the united states and this hotel was by far the best. I little off the hwy but well worth it.
