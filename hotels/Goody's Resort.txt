Goody's Resort

Text: My family and I have been going down to Pomme for over 10 years.  It is a nice and quiet lake that is perfect for family and friends.  The accommodations are not "plush", but it is clean and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  The docks are well kept and there is a nice pool and rec room as well.  Most of the property is campers, but we stay in the cabins that have bedrooms and kitchens.

Text: The rooms were full of spiders that the kids found crawling on them in the middle of the night! We got a note saying quiet time is from 11 to seven because the lower cabins can hear every step you take across the floor.
