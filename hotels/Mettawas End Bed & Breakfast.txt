Mettawas End Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed one night in June 2017. Rolland was such a kind and wonderful host, and a talented chef. The beds were so comfortable and as other reviewers said breakfast did not disappoint! I would HIGHLY recommend staying here and can't speak highly enough about the experience.

Text: Very nice man. Breakfast was the most amazing thing I have ever had. Just down the street from me and I would pay to stay again. Beds are so comfortable. This is probably the best place to stay in the whole Windsor and Essex County. Very accommodating. Let myself and bridal party get ready there . Have nothing bad to say.

Text: The fabulous four-course breakfasts by Chef Roland are a must-do experience.  Kingsville is a charming town, central to adventuring at Pelee Island and Park Pelee.  The facilities are historic, neat and clean, including access to a laundry room, kitchenette, and a sauna.  Be sure to visit the Pelee Island Winery in Kingsville as well.  Note: GRRM fans can eat supper at King's Landing.

Text: High attention to detail with cleaning and an excellent 4 course breakfast by your French chef and innkeeper. Hammocks, flowers, fruit trees, coy ponds, and a hot tub. Bathrobes and chocolates waiting in the room. Jacuzzi tub and his and her sinks were nice. Private terrace balcony with patio furniture attached to the room. Walking distance to the island ferry and shopping at the pier. Drove 20 minutes to the southern tip of Point Pelee for a great sunset on the beach. The inn was only 30 minutes past the border. Great getaway for Detroiters!
