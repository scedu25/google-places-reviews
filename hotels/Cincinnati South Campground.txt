Cincinnati South Campground

Text: It's a nice campground if you weren't in-between a major interstate and railroad tracks. Very noisy.. train comes by every few hours blowing horn day and night. Didn't get any rest the whole time we were here. Will not be coming back.

Text: We had the same experience as other campers did on some of these reviews. We pulled in to see if there was availability & we followed the arrow to take a peak before we booked. A man came in a golf cart & asked what we were doing. We explained & he said, didn't you see the sign, & we said yes, we followed it. He said, no the one that said you must register. We said no, but we wanted to look before we booked. He asked if we had reservations & we said, no. He then said, then you probably can't stay anyway. He said follow me & I'll show you out. We got to the driveway out & asked if they were full & he said, YES. We left & on the way to another campground, we called back & ask for a site for that night & the man in the office who answered said yes they had a lot available. The first man was not only rude, but LIED to us! We drove to a very nice campground & were glad that we did. BEWARE!

Text: Nice campground.  Clean and affordable.  Shower stalls are tiny.  No handicapped bathroom stalls.  Pool works but staff reused to fill it.  No game room.  Lots of train traffic.

Text: Priced right,  nice lots, but sandwiched between the interstate  and a rather busy railroad ! We were glad we were in a camper !

Text: The campgrounds and owners couldn't be nicer! Doug and Rob care about every aspect of your experience...even when you are leaving. They took the time to give us an alternate route into the city to avoid local construction traffic not reported anywhere else. Bring your earplugs - the night trains create a little sleep disturbance but the owners and atmosphere more than made up for it ?
