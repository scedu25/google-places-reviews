Text: Very nice. Convenient location. Tony the receptionist was the best. He recommended a great restaurant and even gave us bottled water after we asked if the water was alright to drink. He was very helpful and funny!! Coming from Hawaii i must say they have a lot of aloha there. Courteous and friendly! Breakfast is great too.

Text: Everything was pretty good. There's an airport shuttle and free breakfast. The only problem was that the strong lights from the parking lot were still able to come into the room around the edges of the curtains. Looking at the curtains at night with all the lights off you'd almost think daylight was shining in from outside.

Text: The bedroom smelled bad when we came in. Our Uhaul got broken into overnight. They didn't do anything about it either. In the morning they were even kinda rude about it and we had to pay about 500$ for the damage. Our whole life almost gotten stolen away from us; Social Security cards, birth certificates, etc. And they didn't even let us stay for a little bit longer while the guy came to fix the broken window and ignition.
