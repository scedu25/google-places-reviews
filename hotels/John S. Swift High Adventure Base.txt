John S. Swift High Adventure Base
Rating: 5
Text: One of the only Venturing specific BSA camps in the country. Located on the shore of a 270 acre private lake on a 5200 acre scout reservation. Plenty of room for many adventures. Shoot, sail, swim, horseback ride, climb real rock, rappel real rock, high and low ropes, canoe, kayak, water park, mountain boarding, stand up paddle boards, mountain biking, and more. At a cost you might pay for just a couple of things you'll do. Located in the middle of the country so accessible from many councils.

Text: Great camping grounds even when summer camp isn't going on. I went paddleboarding and kayaking with my Troop and the guides watching over the lake activity for that weekend were great! Can't wait to go back.
