Text: Can't wait to come back! Peaceful, quiet, clean, fun.  The owners pay close attention to every detail to make our stay special.  My only regret is that we didn't plan a longer stay for our family.

Text: Granted, this was about 4p and their hours are 10-2, BUT my husband I and drove through the property to view the facility for a possible event.  We were on our way out and someone pulled up next to us and asked if we needed anything in a very demeaning and rude manner.  We said we were interested in the property for an event, they again were rude and asked if we  had information.   We said yes and were not offered a tour or if we would like to see anything.  Not a great first impression especially when you would like to spend a nice chunk of money to host an event there.   Very beautiful grounds and facility though!!!!
