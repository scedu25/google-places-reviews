Text: I wouldn't stay there again. Our room had two queen beds and was close to the end of the building. We were also staying with our small dog. When we opened the door from the outside of the building (you have two entrances into your room), we searched for a light, but only found one working lamp other than the light above the vanity and the light by the inside front door. There were dead bugs in the bathroom and standing water in the bathtub. There was also visible water damage to multiple places in the ceiling including above the beds that appeared to just be painted over. The blankets covering the beds had a horrid smell. I'm thinking maybe no one had stayed there for quite some time. At one point, we thought a plane was flying over only to realize it was the A/C unit turning on. For $108 including tax, I am glad it included breakfast because my son was able to make a waffle, so... there's that.

Text: It's not a bad place to sleep when you are on the way but has no elevator for the second floor.
