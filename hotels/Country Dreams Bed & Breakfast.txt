Country Dreams Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Just got home from Country Dreams B & B in Marion, KS.  We had a wonderful time.  My hubby got his turkey with help of Jim the personal guide, I got my rest without having to ask!  Had wonderful family style dinners served up by Alice, a clean organized household with the help of Brenda. Kent was warm and welcoming.   We will be going back. A beautiful lake, and lots of wildlife you can view from the sunroom.  Oh, and the breakfast never stopped!  I would give this a thumbs up!
