Text: The staff was very friendly but that alone could not overcome the fact that the building is very out-dated and filthy. I couldn't take my shoes off in our room the carpet was so disgusting. I would say this is the same quality as an old motel.

Text: Man at the desk was very nice. Explained everything as far as where our room was, internet. Rooms are nice. Beds are not super comfortable but not horrible. I would stay here again.
