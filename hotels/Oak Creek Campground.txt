Text: Been here a few days and I love it! Only thing I don't like is being shut off from water without notice... I knew it was gonna happen but please let all of us know when ur doing it, no one is happy about it, something u have to plan for and just notice would be nice instead of shutting it off at night while cooking... ?

Text: Friendly staff!  Beautiful campground, tucked in the hills yet close to the interstate. Some low level road noise yet a good night's sleep.  Great place to stay when visiting The Ark Encounter.

Text: Stumbled upon this site by accident. Great place! I was the only one tenting and had a lot of room to myself. Staff is great and the facilities were fairly well maintained. Great showers!

Text: The best thing about this campground is location. We visited the area to see the Ark Encounter and the Creation Museum and this campground was about halfway between the two. There also is a nice looking pool available. There are no sewer hookups for RVs but they will come pump your tank for free periodically. Some of the RV spots were a little closer together than was comfortable but not a huge deal. Free wifi is supposed to be available but the signal was very weak where we were and the connection was very slow when we could connect. Overall this is a good place to camp if you are headed to the Creation Museum or Ark Encounter.

Text: Great folks running this place and staying here. Seem to be a number of long term camp sites. Bathroom is clean and sites are well kept. It is so convenient to the interstate but nit so close that it is annoying. Also this was my first stay alone in a campground and I felt quite safe.
