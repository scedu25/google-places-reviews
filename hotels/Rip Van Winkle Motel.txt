Text: The rooms are out dated but for the price, you get what you pay for.  Found sunglasses under my bed,  beds were ok,  fans in room don't work properly. The only reason I won't go back that i won't is she allows smoking in rooms and I was woke up several times while sleeping due to someone smoking.  Had fridge, microwave couple chairs and tables dressers,  and nice tv.
