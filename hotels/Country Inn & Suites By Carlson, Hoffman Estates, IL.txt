Text: Place was horrible for 90 bucks a night. Checked in then pulled to the door and keys don't work on half the doors. Then saw dust everyplace. Get to the room and instantly you smell mold. Located a huge amount of mold behind toilet.  Then I notice what look like blood splatter on the wall. Called the front deck and the lady had no others rooms avail and offered no solution. I slept on the top cover the weekend. Paid threw online and didn't have money to go to another room. Was there for a Basketball tourney and new no one in town.
