Mammoth Cave Horse Camp
Rating: 5
Text: The owner and staff are top notch. They make you feel like old friends and are there to help in any way they can. Grounds are very well kept and show the pride they have in their facilities. Couldn't ask for a nicer campground and hosts. Trails can be a bit challenging.

Text: This is an excellent place for horse campers. The facility is exceptionally clean and up to date. The owner and staff try to help with any request. This is adjacent to Mammoth Cave park many, many miles of public trails that are well marked.
The Labour Day ride provided great meals and an outstanding country band in the enclosed pavilion.

I can't say enough about how great this place is.
