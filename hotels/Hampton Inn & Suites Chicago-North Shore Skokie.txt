Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago-North Shore/Skokie

Text: Recently renovated and very nice for an older hotel.  Generally quiet even with several girls soccer teams staying there.  The coffee IMO is super spot on, the Robust is very hearty with no after taste.  Breakfast is big and awesome.

Text: Stayed here 6+ times always enjoyed pool, sauna and Whirlpool. They got rid of sauna and Whirlpool, won't be staying here anymore. They should know that people really, really enjoy the WHIRLPOOL.

Text: Everything I needed. Inexpensive on price and clean.  The guy even asked when should housekeeping should show up.  I thought that was a good attention to detail.
