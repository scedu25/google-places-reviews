Text: To start off the walls are paper thin, you could hear a fly sneeze. Secondly the television guide is as unreliable as they come, BBC ain't 41 it's 42. There was beetles on the ceiling. We found dirty used under wear right next to the bed. I went to a band competition, left my back pack on the bed, came back with the bed made and my pack sitting where the underwear was, so the cleaning person saw it. I put it in a baggie and took it down to the front desk and the best the man could say was: "I suppose they just left it there" no apology just some half-assed excuse.  one of the other band members in our group found blood on his sheets. I guess they just left blood there. In other words fair reader DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!

Text: Not bad at all. I've been spoiled by the recent updates and other Holiday Inn's but this was a good hotel at a good price.
