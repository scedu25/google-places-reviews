Clements Canoes Outdoor Center - Deer's Mill Livery

Text: We had a good experience with Clements Canoes. They were clean and respectful . They knew about potential hazards to watch for along the route. I didn't give the full five stars because the lower 15-mile pick up location is horrible (as it is for the multiple other groups trying to use the same narrow pick-up/drop-off location). Also, the portion of the trip from the suspension bridge at Turkey Run to the last covered bridge is an obstacle course of tube-riders and swimmers. However, the trip up to the suspension bridge was wonderful.

Text: Very friendly people! Our 2 hour trip onlt took 1 hour, but that's because the creek was still very high. Overall, we had a great experience and a lot of fun!

Text: My Nephew and I wanted to go canoeing and didn't know what to expect.  We got there at 12:35 pm for the 5 mile short run.  We had a blast and want to go back!! The staff was professional, friendly and genuinely glad to see us! They happily explained everything to us, which I'm sure they've done a thousand times! Our driver, Eric, took us to the upper part of the river -- he too was very friendly and talked with us but didn't over talk! He also helped us get into the canoe and shoved the boat away from the bank so we could get going. You could tell the staff really liked their jobs and the people around them!  We HIGHLY recommend Clement Canoes!!  When we are going back, and very soon, we are going for a longer canoe trip with them!  Thank you Clements Canoes for a wonderful experience!!

Text: Good option for canoe  rental to journey down thru turkey run. Not always efficient or well organized. However, can reserve space and once on river, fun trip
