Staybridge Suites Louisville-East
Rating: 4
Text: Very comfortable,  though a little older it has been updated but could use a little more work. The staff is what makes this place really shine though.  Very friendly and helpful. They were always checking on us and engaging,  unlike other places that are cold and disinterested I found them genuinely warm.  One of the management staff stopped and talked to us while we were relaxing in the main lobby having a drink and gave us great advice on some of the sites as well as a perfect recommendation on a Bourbon restaurant for dinner.  Will definitely stay there again in the future.

Text: Very nice and clean. Front desk help were always helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. Room was very clean and smelled great. Breakfast wasn't the greatest but it worked for someone.

Text: What a surprise. Never stayed at this brand so expectations were low. Blown away by the service of this hotel. Irene and Brenda were exceptional staff members answering all our questions and helping us find something out little wanted to eat. Mon-wed they have complimentary food at night and breakfast. Not a 5star restaurant but good and fill your belly after a day of driving. Will definitely stay here again. Very family friendly
