Text: Awesome place! The owner, Denise, takes pride in keeping the grounds clean and manicured. Many sites are shaded and. Restrooms, pool area, and laundry are clean and well maintained. If any issues arise, Denise and Phil are available to handle it. Very friendly and welcoming!

Wouldn’t stay anywhere else when in the area!

Text: Owner met us after hours for a late check-in on a Saturday night.  Clean bathrooms. Easy, no hassle in/out.  The road in is a bit bumpy but that's on Quincy, not Driftwood.
