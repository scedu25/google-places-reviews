Text: Have stayed here 3-4 times over the past several years. Always a good, comfortable stay. This time our room had a strong odar like dog which was strange. There were no rooms to move to so we dealt with it. Management was apologetic and offered me a gift card for my trouble. I do plan on returning.

Text: Great experience!   Indoor Pool and exercise  room. Modern updated room!  Very clean room! ?  Just a very small gripe. No refrigerator in the room.  Other than that, I would definitely stay here again though!

Text: Room is clean and newly furnished,  but no refrigerator or microwave.  It isn't well insulated from noise inside or outside. Decent breakfast.
