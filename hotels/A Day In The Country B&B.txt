A Day In The Country B&B
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I love staying at A Day in the Country.  Don and Linda are so nice, it's just seems like home.  The location is perfect for walking to all the many shops in Berlin and also perfect for riding out into other nearby Amish communities.  We have stayed there twice and will be staying again this month.  We can't wait to hear the sound of horses hooves from our bedroom window!

Text: Very nice and clean rooms.  The hosts (Don and Linda) are great, they are very friendly and know the area really well.  They have also installed new carpet in all the rooms. Also the foods was amazing.

Text: We had the pleasure of staying at A Day in the Country while visiting Ohio recently and we absolutely loved it!  We had a beautiful room.  Everything was so clean, even the bath towels smelled amazing!  The breakfasts were delicious and Don and Linda could not have been more hospitable!  Don is also an awesome tour guide!  We just loved it there!  We were sad when we had to leave.  It is in a perfect location and we will most definitely stay there again if we may it back up to Berlin, which hopefully we will.  Thanks Don and Linda for your part in making our vacation so enjoyable!  It was certainly a pleasure to meet you and we appreciate your hospitality very much!  

Blessings,  

Shannon and Debbie Burchett
