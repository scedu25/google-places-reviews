STONE`S MOTEL

Text: There are no amenities, except for a little outdoor pool. The ice machine doesn't  even work. The parking lot is rough and needs fixing. My sheets had hair on them. The bath towels looked like they were covered in rust or something orange. And the bathrooms were very small. I hate to even give a 1star but there isn't a option lower than that.

Text: This place was absolutely disgusting. Dead bugs in the windows and bathroom floors. Air conditioning took forever to cool the rooms. MOLD in the bathroom!!  The cable barely had any channels to watch. I'd have rather slept in a cardboard box. Don't waste your money by staying here!!
