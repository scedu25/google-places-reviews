Text: Stayed for a week. 180.00$ a week. Found a bed bug and it does have cockroaches. Noisy neighbors kids are out of control. Will be looking for a different place to stay. Cabel is always interrupted. Hopefuly after they finish the remodel it will be better. Sorry. This is my experiance at this place

Text: I've stayed in a number of hotels and motels over the years but this place had to be the worst ever !! Found some kind of bugs between the sheets, not bedbugs. Took pictures of them, clogged filters on AC unit, stains on sheets and carpeting.
Unfortunately I couldn't drive away after having 3 beers and discovering the bugs.
I will report this poor excuse for a motel to the local authorities.

Text: Budgeteer is located in Angola Indiana We came here as a guest and the room we have is not equipped with a refrigerator or microwave and it's been 2 days now without a key. They told us on day one that they would have to get us a key and were still waiting for that key. Had taken our towels to the office and had told them we need clean ones and again were still waiting. On the flip side we ended up with one of the newer rooms. Nice little room for the price BUT they need to bolt down the toilet at least. Was afraid to ask for toilet paper thinking maybe we would get it 2 or 3 days later so just went out and bought some.

Text: It won't let me post without a 1 star...didnt even want to give it that!!! 
The cable was out, there were roaches so bad they were out in the day time!!! The room was a mess and sheets didnt fit the bed. 
When we tried to check out early was told 'no refunds'... Even with the legitimate complaints of roaches and uncleanliness! Very poor customer service! 
Find another place to stay if you need to stay in Angola!!!

Text: House keeping is a joke u have to make your own beds and put clean linen on yourself. Rooms are small, and there are cockroaches
