Text: For 41 dollars you had ice cold air on a hot day, a fridge, microwave, a tv, a comfortable bed and a hot shower. The manager was extremely nice and accommodating. And it was quiet. Will stay here again!

Text: Roach infested in some rooms. Staff is nice but lazy and don't do anything even if asked. Second night there we asked for two towels and toilet paper and nobody came had to ask about 3 times and still didn't get the towels. Is cheap. But you get what you pay for.
