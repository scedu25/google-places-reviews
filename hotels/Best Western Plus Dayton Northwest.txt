Best Western Plus Dayton Northwest
Rating: 5
Text: Just passing through on the way home from a holiday.  Lobby was clean even though there was  huge dustpan left in the reception area just in front of the desk.  After we checked in and got our bags to our room it was still there when we went out for supper.  I had a discount coupon on the cost of the room and the clerk failed to deduct that upon our arrival.  The manager at the desk when we checked out did correct that for me upon departure.  All in all.....a nice stay.

Text: I come to Dayton at least a couple times a year for school. I stay for a week or two at a time. This Best Western has a good breakfast, very helpful and friendly staff, and rooms I have been comfortable in for the duration of each stay. There was one time last year when the heating/ac unit in my room was not working. The staff responded immediately and helped me move to another room where I was made comfortable.
