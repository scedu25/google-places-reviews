Text: Very clean and well maintained. Couteous staff at front desk. Great value on the price of the room.
Walls were a little thin and it was very noisy. But in all a great stay.

Text: I arrived after midnight last Wednesday night. I carried in all of my things including hanging clothes for a 4 day stay.
When I turned down the bed, I found soiled sheets and pillow cases!!
I immediately called the front office and informed the on duty person hoping she would at a minimum bring me fresh sheets. Instead I was offered a different room!! I was exhausted so I stripped the bed and pillow cases and slept in my clothes!! I stay at Motels all the time and this is a first for me.
I am EXTREMELY disappointed that the Manager did not contact me and try to make me feel whole in this experience. I truly thought I would be comped for at least one night of my stay.

Text: Jill, the front desk attendant, was awesome. The rooms could use refrigerators and microwaves. But that was the only disappointment. The room was clean and nicely remodeled.

Text: Requested a ground floor when I signed up. Had to wait 10 min at check in, but I got just what I wanted. Good Price, too. Easy in easy out
