The Oaks Golf Course at Tan-Tar-A Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Beautiful views abound on this wonderful course with oak lined rolling fairways!!  To score well you need to hit the ball straight for unobstructed shots to large mildly sloped greens.  Four different sets of tees to provide a fun experience for a variety of skill levels.  Nice driving range and putting green for warming up before your round!!
