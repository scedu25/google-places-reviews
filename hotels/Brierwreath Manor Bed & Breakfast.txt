Brierwreath Manor Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Had a wonderful time last weekend at this B&B with 5 of my childhood friends. The house is very clean and so adorably decorated. Joe, the innkeeper, is so gracious! Happily shared his historical knowledge of the house and town. Great location, 1 short block from main street shopping. Sitting on the large wraparound porch drinking wine and sharing laughs with these wonderful ladies, was the highlight of this trip for me! I know we will be back again soon!!!

Text: This is the most relaxing vacation I have ever experienced.  The food is amazing and talking with Joe on the front porch in the morning about the history of Galena was priceless. We will absolutely be back!!

Text: The home is very welcoming and relaxing. The innkeeper is very knowledgeable about the area and can guide first time visitors to interesting places to see and restaurants to eat in.  He is fund to talk to in the morning and serves a fabulous breakfast.  Gluten free if you request it.
