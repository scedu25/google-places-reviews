Singing Hills RV Park

Text: This is a great park. Beth and her husband could not be any nicer. We are full timers and its places like this that make it so enjoyable. Very neat and clean park. 2 miles from Mammoth Cave National Park. 2 miles from the interstate. Definitely stay here again.

Text: Whether you're making reservations or checking in the owners were very warm and welcoming.  Unlike some campgrounds we've been in, Eldon and Beth gave us there card in case we needed anything.  Beth also went over the rules and explained things in the area.   Great campground!  Very clean with beautiful grounds.  We would definitely stay here again and would have stayed longer but we have tickets for a show in Nashville

Text: Great place to stay! Well cared for  with friendliest staff around. Very kind people  committed to cleanliness and service. Made us feel right at home and rates were very reasonable. Refreshing to be trusted as they do. We  stayed in site 21.  It is furthest from the bathroom and right next to the turn around/dump station, but neither of these bothered us. We loved to be right on the pond In a wide lot.   We will choose that spot next time too.

Text: A nice quiet spot. Good wifi. Very helpful, friendly owners. Only downside is that they don't have laundry facilities. I would definitely recommend staying here.

Text: Nicest campground owners ever!
Extremely nice couple and very informative. You get a package when you sign in that covers everything from the nearest decent doctor, to where you should evacuate in severe weather, to the closest grocery and Walmart, to complete information on Mammoth Cave and the tours available. There was even a pile of free firewood at the campsite! We didn't use the bathrooms but the owners claim to have the cleanest campground bathrooms available anywhere. Not really any privacy at the sites, but the pond with fountain makes up for it. We stayed overnight in October 2017
