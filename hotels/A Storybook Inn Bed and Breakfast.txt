Text: Very romantic. The bed and pillows were very comfortable with the softest sheets I've ever felt. The breakfast was homecooked with various items (fruit, yogurt, scones, juice, coffee, tea, homemade jams, eggs, bacon, etc.) locally sourced when possible. Coffee, tea, and water always available and afternoon cookies placed in the rooms (delicious). The town is small but there are shops, good restaurants, and things to do near by; plenty of this information provided upon check in. I highly recommend!

Text: Unfortunately didn't stay the night, was there for a tea luncheon, but the food was fabulous, was given a tour of the place and it was a very neat experience!! Parking was a little tight for having 20 people at the inn but other than that, staff was very friendly and helpful!

Text: It is a 7 hour drive for our family, but we make it an annual event. It is in the finest part of Kentucky, a great state with kind and remarkable people. It is a must. Stay in the cottage if you can.
