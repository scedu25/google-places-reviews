Text: Wonderful campground. The staff is very friendly. Nice activities for the kids. The camp sites are nice with paved pads.  Stayed twice this last summer and enjoyed it very much. Will stay again next summer.

Text: Booked a 3 day weekend expecting a heated pool. We get here and are told that the pool is closed for the season and we spent $50 a night to sit in 90 degree heat and have nothing to do with our 2 year old except a sub par playground. Staff was unwilling to even attempt to make it right. Will not be returning.

Text: We are seasonal campers, but we love the owners.  If you have children this is a great place to take them.  They always have activities for them.  It's a nice clean park and the owners take pride in it!

Text: This place is awesome.  The feeling I had as we pulled out from a long weekend of fun was Gateway campground really wants their guests to enjoy themselves.  And we did, thoroughly.  They had things to do from our 10 year old down to our 2 year old. Everything was clean and well maintained. All staff was very friendly and extremely accommodating. We are so glad we found this place and can't wait to come back!

Text: We just spent four nights here... great experience! We brought 3 boys up for a football camp at Hillsdale College and took a chance on this place. Definitely will stay here again. We rented their kayaks, canoe, and even their pontoon. Quiet, enjoyable atmosphere. Nice pool, and lots of things for the boys to do. The fishing was good too. The staff is very friendly and helpful!
