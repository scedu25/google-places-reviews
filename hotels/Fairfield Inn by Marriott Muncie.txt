Fairfield Inn by Marriott Muncie
Rating: 4
Text: Had a nice one night stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Received a rewards upgrade and late check-out easily with the app. Staff was nice and room was reasonably comfortable. Only negatives were some minor mildew spots on the otherwise clean shower curtain and I thought? it was strange that an employee was doing paperwork in the breakfast area during breakfast hours. It wasn't a problem and there was still adequate seating for guests. Will stay here again when the need arises.

Text: Was not satisfied. I was helped by a women by the name of Kelli. She was very rude and unprofessional and had her boyfriend or husband behind the counter. Was very unprofessional. She made me wonder if I should come back. Should look into getting new staff it looks like in my opinion.

Text: We've stayed at this Fairfield Inn twice now, and once at a nearby competitor, dropping a student off at Taylor University over the weekend. Both times, the Fairfield Inn has proven to be of special quality. The service has always been friendly, the rooms clean, and the breakfast great. I would definitely recommend this hotel more than any others I've stayed at.
