Aloft Cleveland Downtown
Rating: 4
Text: Staff were extremely nice and helpful.  My room was at the end and I was able to see the Browns stadium from one window and The Flats from the other.  The bed was comfortable, but the room was not soundproofed from all of the outside noise.  Motorcycles all hours of the night, trains, and boat horns (not sure, but that is what it sounded like). $24 to valet park for the night or $17 to self park was a little pricey in my opinion.
Overall I had a great time visiting and will probably be back

Text: Okay urban space in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Convenient to many sites /events; good location. 
Our room could have been cleaner. The entry/wash area light was on the same switch as the bathroom exhaust fan. Very irritating. Parking is not cheap, but at least it's convenient. The front desk staff was courteous. Decent checkout time  (noon). 
Considerable number of restaurants within walking distance. We will avoid the nearby restaurant Bold. Our experience there with the food was not good.

Text: Here for business and the Aloft couldn't have been in a better location. Definitely a more trendy/millennial vibe to it. But the room was comfortable. Would stay here again.

Text: My hotel room is absolutely beautiful. It's located in the Warehouse District next to the Port of Cleveland.  View was awesome! The gentleman at the Front Desk, I think his name is Spencer, was extremely nice and helpful. This hotel is extremely clean. I've completely enjoyed my stay.

Text: The hotel was super clean. The staff friendly and welcoming. They provided excellent tips for travel and meals. Shampoo and body wash in the shower- very convenient. It would be a 5 but the elevator is inconvenient and confusing - that might be a personal problem. Once we got it figured out- all was good. Check in was easy - check out was easy. Location of hotel was great for walking to sights.
