Text: The staff was great except someone trying to bust through my door at 8:30 am. The room appeared cleaned at first but was filthy. I was told at check-in the police presence was heavy but just to keep the area safe. But with in 10 minutes of arriving I had 2 police officers in my face asking me 21 questions. It made me feel anything but safe. They even told me they ran my plates. For what?? This place could use a lot of work. But at least they have good people employed...

Text: Decent place to sleep, if you don't mind not showering.  Once we got here, our room wasn't ready...not cleaned or anything....  it was midnight!!! Then we get in from an all day rock concert, excited to shower... no complimentary shampoos, which is fine...  but no towels or washragswe call the front office and they tell us they don't have any...so, if you just need to sleep, and not shower, this is your place...  they wouldn't even comp us for the inconvenience.   Which should be something companies do when their customers are not happy.

Text: Room was resonably clean, except for the stale smoke odor.  The rooms carpet was a little worn. The receptionest was very nice and friendly and checked us in quickly.
