The Abbey Hotel & Wedding Chapel
Rating: 5
Text: My boyfriend and I loved our weekend here. The room was well stocked and very clean. The hot tub is a very nice thing to have. The only downside was a slight sewage smell, but we just assumed it was the heavy rain causing a little back up in the drains.  It's also nice to have a little heater in the rooms, as it was around 30-40 degrees during our stay.  We are hoping to come back around the same time next year.

Text: The experience from the very beginning has been amazing. The room is very clean and fully stocked for our stay. The hot tub was hot and ready with a flat screen tv in the room. Not much more we could ask for. Best part of all no kids and the privacy here makes me feel comfortable and free. I would recommend this place for sure. We still have a few more days here and I will be sure to update if anything new happens. So far so good

Text: It's 10:15 and we're packing up to check out now. We came here for the first night of our honey moon, and it was marvelous!!! We're already planding another trip to the Abbey for our 1 year. The hot tub was very clean and VERY relaxing. Our room was clean and very cozy. Batteries were dead in our remote for the fire place but there's a manual way to turn it on and off, I just don't know who to tell about that. Other than that I absolutely loved it!!! Wow derail place full of wonderful memories!

Text: This is our 2nd stay at the Abbey.   Loved it both times.  The room we have this time is nice.  The stool is a bit odd. Like being in a little closet to go to the restroom. Could use a soda machine!

Text: This place was awful and when I first posted a review, the owner (a lawyer, wouldn't you know) sent "cease and desist" letters, charged us for our stay even though we spent a total of 10 minutes in the room (with the 'manager' there with us), and NOTHING was as advertised. 

I'm only writing this now because, from the responses I've read, there seems to be new management and hope to God they are better than the previous. I have never dealt with such a scumbag "business" man in all my days. To be charged $300+ for giving them an HONEST review on TripAdvisor is flat out wrong! No wonder the impression was the this was a nice place to stay- no negative feedback was ever permitted. 

It was even expressed that if any other negative reviews were posted, further legal action would be taken against us. 

If you are the current owner/manager, I would really enjoy speaking with you!
