Knights Inn Sandusky OH

Text: Amazing. Very clean, NO bugs whatsoever (and I mean none), polite staff, and pet friendly! Pillows were super soft. Breakfast is limited but not a big deal especially for the price. I would absolutely recommend!

Text: Always great! I stay at Knights Inn every time I visit Cedar Point. The room is always very clean and I love the jacuzzi jets in the tub. Great for soaking after a long day at the park. The staff is very helpful and nice. Great hotel for a good price!

Text: Room was what you'd expect for the price. Pillows were flat, blanket was scrathy, and the tv was severely dated. Bathroom had a very noisy light. Room was very clean and smelled nice. Bathroom had a jacuzzi. Front desk associates were completely devoid of personality. 10 minutes away from Cedar Point. Continental Breakfast had name brand, quick-grab items like pop tarts and yogurt, also had donuts and fruit.

Text: Very large  and clean rooms. Very quiet. Courteous staff. Close to Cedar Point...less than 10 min driving time. The only ding is that its right next to the railroad tracks but other than that, I'd highly recommend this establishment.

Text: I thought the motel was nice. I read 3 pages of reviews, some good and some bad. One of the negatives was about the train and quite honestly it didn't bother me...I heard it but I was so exhausted that I didn't care. Although we didn't get to use them, the pool and hot tub were nice. The screened in area for the continental breakfast was nice. I loved the uniqueness of the layout of this motel. For the price I would definitely recommend this for your stay.
