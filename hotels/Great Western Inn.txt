Great Western Inn
Rating: 1
Text: So I’m calling around all morning trying to find a place to check in that will let me stay past 11am, without paying two nights. This is like 7:30 am. I get a hold of great western inn and the front desk clerk says it’s no problem just try and check out by two or three. Great Right? No he comes knocking on my door at 11am telling me I need to check out. He honestly could not even remember my face and I could tell you his life story from the conversation we had in the morning. I finally convinced him he had allowed me to stay past 11 but I checked out anyways because I’m already awake. Great deal... not. Pay for a full price night for 4 hours. Stay here at your own risk.

Text: This is a great place to stay, at a GREAT price. The rooms are basic , but clean; recently renovated. Mini-fridge and microwave in the room. Free WiFi. Lots of cable channels. Nice lobby, complimentary breakfast in a nice dining space.
Right off I-70, close to stores and restaurants.
The owner is a really nice guy, and tries hard to be sure all his guests are pleased.

Text: Hopped off the freeway checked out a few of the other hotels , weren't quite up to par. As soon as I walked in the office everything smell new and clean. I got a great rate right away without playing the shell game. My room was also freshly painted clean with a very comfortable bed. The help was very friendly and accommodating will definitely stay here again when passing through.

Text: The room was decent, fairly clean, nice tv, free WiFi. Pet friendly with $10/night fee per dog. Field behind the building was nice for them. No waffles or eggs for breakfast and fruit flies and gnats were bad in the eating area.

Updated my review to 1 star. They charged an extra $20 to my card?! Room was definitely NOT worth the $99 I was charged!

Text: I will be coming back due to the owner. He was so polite and when we were leaving even offered to help us. Was very clean. Also has a bar/ restraunt attached to it. Has yogurt, cereal, muffins, coffee, and fruit for breakfast. Has mini fridge and microwave in the room. Has a washer and dryer, ice machine, and soda vending machine outside the rooms.
