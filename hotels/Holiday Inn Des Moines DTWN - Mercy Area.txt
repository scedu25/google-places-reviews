Text: Near downtown and easy to get to by car. The staff is great and very helpful. The room I stayed in was clean but "well used." you could tell it was passed time for an update. The highway noise is also very noticeable.

Text: I went there for a fundraising event. They rented out the top room in the building. The overall feel and look of the hotel was great and I would definitely recommend holding different events at this location.

Text: Great room! Beds were comfortable albeit kind of small. Pillows were great! My wife and I both wanted to ask where we could get pillows like they had but didn't. Room was quiet and AC was cold! And location was great. Easy to get in and out
