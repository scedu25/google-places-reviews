Text: The rooms are very clean and nice. I had a big room with two double beds. Located very close to the airport. Few restaurants with in walking distance. Had an indoor pool and hot tub. Decent fitness center. 

Update: 7/31/2017 
The gym equipment seem to be in bit of disrepair. The workout benches adjustments are broken and unable to adjust. Most treadmills have broken pieces.(Mostly cosmetic)

Text: Very disappointed. Their shuttle refused to take me to the airport. Apparently they will only go to each airline every 30 minutes. So it left with 2 people and refused to change terminals. They failed to tell me this on the shuttle ride to the hotel, at check in, or check out. There are no posted signs.  On check in, I was told that the shuttle comes right away.  I have now been waiting 30 minutes and this delay will effect my check in.  Would have taken an uber but shuttles came and left, with the promise of a few minutes wait.

Text: Nice hotel. Nice decor, clean and the staff is service oriented. Would have given 5 stars, but half the tiles are off the canopy over the entrance. Rained on me as I entered and when I went to smoke. Management needs to address that. If I get a reply with a plan, I'll change this to 5*

Text: Awful. The room wasn't stocked well at all, the restaurant took for ever and didn't cook my steak the way I asked for it either time but brought me a cold potato both times. The manager who came to the table to offer us a refund was very sarcastic.
