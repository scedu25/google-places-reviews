Text: Enjoyed our stay.  Location is ideal for strolling downtown.  The rooms are clean and quaint with a very comfortable bed.  The atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyed the shaded out door area with the landscaping details and the warm fire pit in the evenings.  The delicious homemade cookies in the room added a special touch.  We will definitely be returning.

Text: We went to Herman, MO for a weekend of winery tours, relaxing and fun.  My friends booked Captain Wohlt Inn since they have stayed there for years and really enjoyed it.  It is a family owned and operated bed and breakfast with nice furnishings, a great outdoor area with fire pit, tables, couches and pretty landscaping.  The beds are comfy, rooms are clean, breakfast was great served family style in the main house and we had a great time.  It is a little more than some of the other bed and breakfast locations but it was totally worth it and we will be back!

Text: Excellent! If you are looking to spend some time in Hermann, Mo, this is a gorgeous bed and breakfast, the rooms, down to the furnishing details were immaculate, and the breakfast was delicious, you could smell the hickory flavored bacon waffling through the halls! Service couldn't be better, with owner offering suggestions and many options to make our stay perfect. 
Thank you!

Text: The Captain Wohlt Inn Suites is a must stay!  We were in the Sammons Suite and were very impressed. 

Brant was a great host. He not only allowed for a very late arrival but greeted us with a fire going in the fire pit and smores. You can tell he takes great pride in his properties and the breakfast that he serves. Our room was exceptionally clean and the breakfasts were very filling and absolutely delish!

Unlike many of the B&B's his is almost like a small little resort. The outdoor area with fire pits, strung lights, and little seating areas makes it very unique. You can stay to yourselves and drink some wine or gather and talk with other guests. It is very pretty and relaxing.

I would consider my husband and I pretty picky people and we definitely had a five star weekend and will be back again very soon.
