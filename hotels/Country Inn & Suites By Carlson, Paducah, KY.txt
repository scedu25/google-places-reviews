Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Paducah, KY

Text: Decent hotel. It's a great location right off the interstate. The rooms were a bit rundown but very clean. The walls were thin so you could hear your neighbors, but overall it was a good hotel. There were lots of breakfast options with their complimentary breakfast. Comfortable beds and lots of pillows.

Text: Unfortunately, this hotel is in need of some TLC and maintenance. The room was adequate enough as we only were there for 10 hours to sleep and have breakfast. The tub dripped and could not be totally shut off, so we simply put a face towel in the tub so we would not hear the dripping as we were tried and did not want to switch rooms. The sink had the same issue but at least you could get it to stop dripping. The hotel is a bit banged up and could use a thorough clean and touch up. The breakfast was good with cereal and coffee for us. The employees were very friendly and pleasant. Not sure we would stay here again and might at least check other options in Paducah.

Text: Gracie, the receptionist, was awesome. Cookies baked fresh and hot breakfast in the morning. The breakfast wasn't amazing but I was still glad it was there. The room in which I stayed was able to accommodate 5 people with 2 queen beds and a couch. The location makes many restaurants easily accessible

Text: Met by Gracie at the front desk. Very nice and informative. Nice clean place. Wonderful breakfast. Nice location. There is a lot around. Actually sorry that I only got to spend one night. As the usual. The shower head wasn't tall enough for me but I have learned to adjust to things like that but they had water pressure and that was a big plus.

Text: Don't stay here if you want to sleep. Walls are paper thin, doors automatically slam if you don't hold the knob. Bed was comfortable but didn't matter since there was so much noise. Also, breakfast was very bland. Just poorly constructed facility.
