Chicago Marriott O'Hare

Text: Room was really nice and spacious. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast buffet was decent and service was great. Only negative was the drunks screaming down the hall for about an hour in the middle of the night. I'd called and asked that they send someone up to ask them to be quiet. Not sure if they did or not. The noise stopped for about 5 minutes then started back up again.

Text: Large hotel catering to business travelers. Helpful staff with easy shuttle service to the airport. The rooms are comfortable. However the bathrooms are a bit small. The door does hit your knees if you are sitting on the toilet and have the door open. No water in the room but complementary bottles are available in the lobby.

Text: PROS: Got an excellent last minute rate using Priceline. Check in was fast and easy and the employees were very professional and friendly. Bed was VERY comfortable and we were able to log into our Netflix account using the room’s TV.
CONS: For a room that could sleep up to 4 people the bathroom was very small. Breakfast was $15 for a continental style and $21 for a full breakfast. Worst of all the parking was $32 per night! They’ve already got you here with your car so what are you going to do about it?

Text: Nice hotel. The have ample parking and easy access to the highway. Staff was courteous and professional. The restrooms in the lobby were very clean and well stocked. I attended The Baby Expo in their ballroom which was clean and well kept. I would consider this hotel for an overnight stay based on my experience at this event.

Text: Quick and efficient location near airport. Ideally located if you have a late flight coming in or have an early departure with 24 hour shuttle service. The rooms were very spacious with highly comfortable beds. Their lounge is very stylish with very tasty appetizers.
