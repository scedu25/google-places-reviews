Text: Wonderful Hotel, we loved every second of being there, from the huge rooms that are more like apartments, to the great breakfast and light dinner in the evening. The staff was always great and attentive. If you needed anything or had questions the staff was on it quickly. Thanks for a wonderful stay.

Text: I moved into the hotel a week ago and I plan to stay for a while. This is a good hotel: people from the front desk are very friendly, positive and attentive to every need of the guests. (Well, within the limits of hotel rools) My husband and I visited a lot of hotels in USA and other countries and I can say that this hotel is one of the most truly hospitable hotels. People from maintenance service are very good and professional. Breakfast is good and the atmosphere at breakfast place is always positive , the staff is very friendly. The only two things which are slightly bothering me is a pour sound insulation; I can hear all the sounds produced by the neighbors from above. And another thing is some obsession from someone from housekeeping service. Every time she comes to do the cleaning, she starts by asking:where are we from.., where is my husband now, where does he work...and questions,questions,questions...I am not ready to be interviewed by someone I don't even know.. and she knows that but it seems like she doesn't care..meanwhile there are no complains about cleaning.
