Text: Neighbors aren't as ok as you may think, very noisy and loud, also it seems drugs are even spread throughout the place.... I went there to stay with a loved one, I don't enjoy being that Cedarwood Trails after a few visits.

Text: Moved in August 2013. Did not even live there a week and my house was broken into. Finally was able to move out in January 2016. It has happened many times to people there and its the same person doing it and the manager knows this. Horrible place and I only moved there temporarily because I had too. So if you want to keep whatever valuables you have, steer clear of here. Oh, and they have a bunch of dumbass rules you have to follow.
