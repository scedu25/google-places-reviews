Text: Good hotel for the price. The rooms are clean. Paint was peeling on the ceiling in the bathroom. We liked the decorations. The staff was courteous. Breakfast was a bit limited. They were out of orange juice the first day.

Text: Both the pool and the room were kinda dirty and not well maintained. The bed was extremely hard. Speaking with other guests, they felt the same way. I woke up multiple times a night in pain and every morning was an excruciatingly painful experience. I would have expected better for a three star hotel.

Text: Rooms were nice. Recently remodeled, but not to the highest quality, but adequate. Breakfast was what you'd expect for continental breakfast. Eating area and pool were nice. The pool was old but clean. Was way too hot that day. Overall I think this is a great hotel. There are awesome movie theaters, bowling alleys, and other entertainment close by.
