Text: One of the more pleasant surprises of my trip. Very clean, great price, well furnished, safe atmosphere, big TV! Shower head was kind of funny but the bathroom was very nice and also very clean. Great place to stay, and as a AAA member was offered an incredibly competitive rate from the pleasant Jaycee, and Andrew at the front desk was very welcoming and informative. Will stay again! 10 Stars!

Text: Room was clean and well-appointed.  Price is always more than I would like it to be, and it seemed a little high considering the time of year I traveled, but the room was nice and our stay was very pleasant.  Breakfast was ok...a precooked plain egg omelet, sausage patties, biscuits, and pancakes.  Coffee was good! Indoor pool looked nice but we did not have time to use it.

Text: Lovely decor. Nice staff. Breakfast was appealing. Check in was easy. Room and area in general had a offensive smell. I can only describe it as burning leaves mixed with the scent of a chemical cleaner.

Text: Breakfast was amazing, rooms were very clean, beds were comfortable & it's conveniently located to many businesses. We had to track an employee down for towels for the pool & when we arrived the gal checking us in was new & wasn't quiet familiar with the rewards system. We had to call the 800# to deal with that issue! Overall experience was nice though! I would definitely recommend this BW to others!
