Four Points by Sheraton Columbus - Polaris

Text: It's very clean, and attractive with good pricing, and comfortable beds. 

However,  when we arrived we couldn't find anyone to help us.  The bartender saw us waiting there and didn't seem to care.  We finally had to go ask her to find someone to help us. The person who came to help us was obviously high on something.  We went up to the room and my light wouldn't turn on.  I discovered it was unplugged,  but the outlet didn't work. In the middle of the night,  we were awoken several times by people in a nearby room making loud noises (paper thin walls). Also,  NO free breakfast. 

Overall,  I'd say,  if you're looking to save a little money,  but cleanliness and comfort are important to you,  this is a good place to stay.  Just don't expect much else.

Text: The room was good. Somehow I was given empty lotion tube in the bathroom. Next day cleaning lady didn't even replace the empty lotion with new one. The elevator was also super slow. Except these issues my stay at the hotel was nice.

Text: Location is pretty decent, being right down the road from pretty much any reasturant you can dream of. There is a gas station within 3 minute walking distance which is nice for quick runs. Hotel itself is okay. Nothing spectacular. its clean and the staff is really nice.

Text: Location was great. Hotel itself was OK - comfortable, but nothing really special. Quality of furnishings was a bit low - the desk in my room was surprisingly flimsy - I doubt it could handle more than the weight of the phone and lamp that were on it without collapsing. There was an overpowering smell of clove in the hallways and my room, which I'm guessing was from a cleaning product, but it made me wonder if it was that strong because it was being used to mask something worse.

Text: Decor is dated - wireless does not work - had a number of issues and when I was able to eventually get hold of management they did resolve (except for wireless) and gave me after drink and some SPG points. They were laying new wood flooring the day after we left so maybe the hotel is being updated - it certainly needs it.  Location is great if you need to visit mall or IKEA.
