Text: New owner has a degree in turf grass management. He really knows what he is doing when repairing the course from previous owners.  Highly suggest going to this course. This will start to be one of the nicest courses around.

Text: Love the Golf Course, new owners are working their butts off to revamp the course and club house. As of this review they are renovating the club house to serve lunch and dinner, which I got a taste of last time I visited: Great food and prices.

What I love even more is: When the new owners took over, there were a few Gaming Machines, and they took them out to open up the space for seating. 

The Course itself is amazing and deceptively easy. Gives a sense of links style while having trees, some holes are wide open with trees about 25ft off the fairway. You can find yourself in trouble pretty quick if you have a wicked slice or hook.

If I lived closer or in Petersburg, this would be my home course and would definitely purchase a season pass, definitely worth frequent visits.
