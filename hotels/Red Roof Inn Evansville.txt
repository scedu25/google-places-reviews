Text: The room was clean, providing exactly what we needed for the night. The staff was professional with check-in and check-out being quick and easy. Plus there was a yummy breakfast in the morning!

Text: Run down and not super fresh.  Definitely located near some kind of sewage facility.  We were in town for my brother's funeral and needed to check in early.  We were told that it was no problem.  Also we needed rooms on the first floor as my sister was on crutches.  Neither thing happened once we got there. 2 women and 4 teenage girls had to go get ready for a funeral in a gas station bathroom while our rooms sat empty.  Lame

Text: Check-in was easy and Andy at the front desk was fantastic. We got there earlier than expected and they were still able to accomodate us. Bathroom and bed were clean and they had good cable, free wifi. We would definitely stay again.

Text: Bed was hard as a rock. Temperature in the pool room was extremely hot. Pool was not heated. Water in bathtub was either too cold or too hot. Front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful
