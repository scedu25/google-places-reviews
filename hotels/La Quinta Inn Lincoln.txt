La Quinta Inn Lincoln
Rating: 3
Text: Newly renovated, but still feels like an older hotel. Most other La Quinta hotels I've stayed at are better. This one is good for an overnight stay, especially if you get a good rate.

Text: The staff were super nice and the hotel had good amenities and location.  However, I was disappointed with the WiFi connection (it kept disconnecting).  All-in-all, a decent place to stay.

Text: This hotel is a diamond in the rough. The hotel lobby was very clean and quite modern and the check in staff was very prompt. No issues getting the room. The room was comfortable and modern and quite clean as well. Despite there being a large number of guests (a family reunion was meeting there) the room and hallway were quiet. Checkout is at noon and the hotel is located close to a number of restaurants and other amenities. Overall a great stay.

Text: Key cards barely worked and had to get them re magnetized about 7 times. Bathrooms were not clean, and one of them had poop stains all inside of the toilet. The pool was dirty and had hair floating in it. The bathroom in our room however, was clean, and the beds were clean too. (Surprisingly.) sleep in your car. You will most likely have a better experience. After an 8 hour drive, we want to relax and settle in, not go chasing up and down the stairs 14 times to get our keys fixed.
