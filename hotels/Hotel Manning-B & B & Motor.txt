Text: Excellent place to stay. Very clean. Bath tub. Only complaint would be the small and outdated tube TV. Not a big deal.

Text: We always stay in the newer hotel out behind the Manning Hotel. The Manning is a very old hotel, and the rooms are very nice, but you share a bathroom with other guests. The newer part is two story and has 2 handicap rooms. I think the rooms were $70 a night. 

We like staying here because it is convenient for getting to the reunion without having to travel 20 miles from Fairfield, Iowa.

Text: It is historic: over 110 yrs old. The atmosphere reminds you of its history. We have been coming here for about 10 yrs and we love it.

Text: A nice enough place, good staff, but I feel it necessary to mention the amount of spiders on the outside of the rooms! I'm not too terribly afraid of them, but when you count more than ten just above your room door, that's a bit much. How hard would it be to take a broom and brush around outside? There's webs everywhere! There were also a bunch of flies inside our room when we first got here. I'd recommend some Ortho at this place. Ew.
