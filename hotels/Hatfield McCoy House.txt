Hatfield McCoy House
Rating: 5
Text: Beautiful home in a small historic town. 
The bed and breakfast is very clean and the rooms all have a unique atmosphere to them. Kitchenette is clean and there is a cute deck on the second level to enjoy the outside. The house is decorated in theme of the Hatfield McCoy fued! The owners are so hospitable and if you need anything they will be happy to help.
Such a cozy and clean place I would recommend to everyone!  Great stay.

Text: This is a nice clean homey place to stay.  The owner also has a concierge service which is very helpful in knowledge of the area.  The rooms and Halls are filled with history of the fued country.  This Inn is close to many restaurants in town.  There was a nice kitchen in which there is continental breakfast, and a great gathering area for those who stay.  It was just like being at home.   Place was great affordable,  peaceful, and more than just a hotel.  It has the charm of home .   Also whoever got on reviews and literally lied about homeless people dead in the street, must have nothing better to do with their lives.  Nothing like that has ever happened here.  Streets are nice and peaceful with many historic buildings.  Don't believe what this person said it is a bold face delusional lie,  made up from a jealous mind.   Check the local records for proof.   I greatly enjoyed my time here.  Owners are accommodating and the nicest people you'll ever meet.

Text: Friendly owners gave us history of the town & house. Made sure we were aware of local laws and ordinances. It was a cozy place to stay. The bunkhouse would be great for traveling with a small group.

Text: Owners were very nice to us. Shared information about the town, trail access, what not to do around there (town cops!), where to eat and set us up with a place to crash for a few days while riding the trails. Limited parking, however the owners try to save spots trucks and trailers. Houses are very tight together in that area, narrow roads. Big change from the flat lands of Wisconsin.

Text: Very casual down home atmosphere! Staying  here is like visiting a museum. The historical home has relics and history displayed in every room. Accommodations are satisfactory and the hosts are very welcoming and pleasant. Just a short drive up the hill to get on the Hatfield Mccoy trail. The whole town is ATV friendly which is cool. We will definitely return to this B&B
