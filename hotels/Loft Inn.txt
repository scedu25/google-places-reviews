Text: After traveling to over a dozen countries in my young life :) I can without reservation say that the LOFT INN is by FAR the Absolute BEST Hotel/Inn/B&B we have ever stayed in!!!

The warmth & kindness shown by Lady Patryce & her family cannot be expressed in the English language...Shalom!

Text: The Loft Inn seemed a nice enough place to relax for a mini-vacation after working an extremely stressful job. I made reservations for four people (my mom, sister, my then fiance, and myself) a few weeks before, but only three of us could go. Upon arrival, the owner coldly told us to sit down. Confused, we thought that maybe she wanted to get to know us. Instead, she informed us that the house had been struck by lightning a few days ago and many of the electronics were broken, including the air conditioning. She looked at us and said, "Are all three of you staying?" Well, yes lady, we were going to draw straws to see who would sleep in the car, but thought it may be too hot (I can't believe she asked us that). She said two of us could sleep in a downstairs bedroom, but advised us to find another place to stay. It was approaching 5 p.m. on a Friday night, and the closest hotels were several miles out of our way. Could she not call us before we drove several hours and wasted so much gas? It is our belief that she hoped we would not show up so she could charge us for the room. The owner was distracted, rude, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Text: We stayed at the Loft Inn during graduation weekend for Indiana Wesleyan University.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, the food was delicious, and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  It is a large 150 year old house, beautifully remodeled, in a lovely country setting. I would recommend it to anyone.
