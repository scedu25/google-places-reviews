Holiday Inn Cleveland-S Independence
Rating: 5
Text: Our beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean and nicely appointed. The Keurig coffee pot in the room only made 6oz. Servings so we frequented the coffee kiosk in the lobby. We had trouble getting the lock on our door to work but we're always able to get it. We were able to walk to a large variety of restaurants in the area, but the food in the hotel restaurant was also good. Homemade cakes and pies even!

Text: The staff truly is determined to make your stay so incredible leaving you feel cherished!  The shuttle bus service saved me money and the staff collectively were like minded in their way over satisfactory accommodations.   Very friendly people and it was truly a pleasure to be here (1st time ever for a hotel).  Very good food , pool and room.

Text: I was very pleased with the friendliness of staff and cleanliness of the rooms, everything was just so. I was also surprised by the complimentary lounge area on my floor, with espresso drinks, teas, and cocoa - it really added a cozy touch! Lastly, the location is excellent, with a large variety of restaurants and the like within easy walking distance.

Text: This Holiday Inn has been at this location for decades. Needs some upgrades but nice place. I go there a lot for workshops. Always have lunch at Michael's-- nice and affordable. Parking ample. Many eateries around hotel. Gift shop very dated! Went to the Mother's Day dinner buffet this year-aweful! Won't do that again

Text: I enjoyed my stay here. There's usually a live band show on Saturdays. Good music and a mixed crowd.
