Text: Drew and Janelle were wonderful hosts, and the food was AMAZING! we stayed two nights in late September, and the first morning we had a delicious quiche and the second was a French Toast that was to die for. (I usually don't like French Toast.) My wife and I will definitely be returning, hopefully soon!

Text: Really enjoyed our time at the Hatchery House! Drew and Janelle are gracious hosts, and  made us feel very welcome. We stayed in the Lewis and Clark suite, and the rustic decor certainly fit the theme. Each suite has its own fireplace, which is a great feature for colder months. The breakfast service was delightful, and was highlighted with homemade banana bread! We will visit again, and hope to see more of Weston's shops and restaurants next time.

Text: My girlfriend and I recently stayed @The Hatchery House Bed and Breakfast. Our stay was amazing and we really enjoyed ourselves. The staff are very friendly and down to earth. The building itself is really neat and has many historical roots within the community. It was by far the best bed and breakfast we have ever stayed in. If your looking for the best place to spend a few nights, look no further than the Hatchery House Bed and Breakfast.

Text: The Hatchery House is a charming B&B just a block away from downtown Weston.  The rooms are big, with comfy beds and chairs.  The happy hour is a great way to get familiar with the house and have a quick snack and drink before heading out to dinner (I'd highly recommend Tin Kitchen).  The breakfast is delicious and very filling as well.  The hosts were very friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be coming back!
