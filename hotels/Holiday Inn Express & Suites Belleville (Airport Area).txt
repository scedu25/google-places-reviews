Holiday Inn Express & Suites Belleville (Airport Area)
Rating: 5
Text: I missed my flight and ended up here. The Girl at the desk was super helpful while juggling many different tasks. There were a bunch of people who had missed their flights and she was dealing with every single one professionally and quickly, and didn't lose a genuine smile the whole time.

My room is pretty big and as I lay in my bed pondering, I am reminded of this moment due to the comfort of the bed. It also looks like there is complimentary coffee, so that's pretty cool. 

Also, there is a shuttle that goes to and from the airport.

Text: We're on a 17 day cross country trip and have stayed in several IHG hotels before. We have 2 small kids and this hotel is very clean, kid friendly and large. Very quiet and spacious rooms. They don't have a weird smell like seen on previous reviews. Smell clean and fresh. Lots of room for a family of 4. The pool, spa and sauna are Great! Wish the other elevator was available to guests and not just the maids. The hallways are very long and parking is sparse unless you park way in the back a bit of a walk but otherwise great hotel!

Text: We stayed a night in mid-September. I really liked the place. The pool is very nice, with a hot tub. The place is clean, nicely decorated and has a glass sided elevator. The room was nice and not a lot of noise from the freeway. I'd stay again!

Text: The room was clean and the visit was good. Our "nonsmoking" room smelled like smoke and cleaning products. We didn't want to be "those guests and just decided to stick it out for the night. The water pressure wasn't the greatest either in the shower. Other than that, it wasn't too bad of a hotel. The lobby was very well kept and looked great. The road to get here had a lot of potholes...I thought my car was going to shatter

Text: I travel a lot for work and always try to stay at a Holiday Inn. This one is my favorite by far. I'm here at least 8 times a year and have never had a bad experience. They are always friendly when I check in, the rooms are nice and clean and the breakfast is awesome. Highly recommend
