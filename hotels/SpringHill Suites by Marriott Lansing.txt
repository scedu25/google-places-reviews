SpringHill Suites by Marriott Lansing

Text: This was an immaculate hotel. I would recommend this place. The staff in every area of this place was great. This is close enough to Lansing and East Lansing and Michigan State University to stay here. It is way nicer than every other place I have stayed within 20 miles. Highly recommend this place

Text: I liked my visit to this hotel for a variety of reasons. First of all the staff was helpful in accommodating us, and the bedroom was nice accompanied by a good breakfast, but also the location had a good proximity to a shopping centre walking distance away, so we were able to get all the food stuffs and items we needed during our stay.

Text: Staff is always friendly, checking in is easy via mobile check in. Anytime I need to add on extras they always have them waiting for me at check-in.

Text: Company trip 2 night/3 days with three rooms.  All three rooms were not cleaned when returned.  Not professional - staff claimed we had all left do not disturb signs on the door.  None of us did.  My hotel room had peeling wallpaper, thread-bare carpet and non-detailed attempts at a remodel.     Air conditioner was very poor and took 24 hours or more for room to cool.   Not recommended.  Not Marriott quality that is expected.
