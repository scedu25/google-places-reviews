Wichita Marriott
Rating: 5
Text: This is a very classy hotel. The front lobby is very welcoming, with lots of couches and tables for guests to enjoy. The rooms are clean and the beds were very nice. We stayed there for a wedding over Labor Day. However, the hotel is 10+ stories tall and one of the three elevators was out of service, so it took a bit of time to reach the lobby (even from the second floor!) Fellow guests raved about the pool and hot tub area. Highly recommend the Hospitality room for weddings--it was a great place for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready and take pictures.

Text: I really like this hotel. Stay here fairly often. Good breakfast, nice concierge lounge although I don't know I've ever had dinner in the restaurant. The hotel gym is acceptable, the location is decent and the staff are friendly. The rooms are comfortable, but would probably benefit from some updates.

Text: I visited the Marriott for an event, and I must say: the service was excellent. Since I didn't stay the night, I can't comment on the rooms, but if you're needing a conference center, look into here! Front desk staff was incredibly professional, and were able to direct me where I needed to go. Kitchen staff who served meals were professional, savvy, and the food was wonderful. Bar service was excellent, lounge was comfortable. I have nothing but positives to say about the conference. With this sort of service, I bet the rooms are just as professionally done. Will certainly stay here the next time I'm in the Wichita area.

Text: Love, Love, Love this hotel!! As a repeat customer here I am always greeted by the door man and front desk staff by name and with a smile. The staff are always smiling, friendly and engaging. Great service in the dining room as well, EXCELLENT Sunday brunch. John was our server for breakfast and brunch on our recent stay and he was very attentive and got to know my husband and I. I was impressed to see that John and the other servers remembered customers drink preferences and greeted them by name. You can tell the people who work here truly love their work and this is more than just a job to them! The hotel is older but rooms are comfortable and my daughter loves the indoor/outdoor pool. I have been staying at this hotel at least once a month for the last year and will continue to do so. Thank you for providing a nice home away from home experience!
