Text: My husband called earlier this week for a reservation. The lady promised to call him back since she was busy. She never did. I called this morning in an attempt to get a reservation. I left a message even though there was not a greeting on their machine identifying it was a KOA campground. 8 hours later i received a call with a message that was garbled.
I give up and will not attempt to contact them again. 
Stayed at this place one time in the past and teenagers kept us up late playing on the playground. Go to Wapakoneta KOA instead folks.

Text: Don't stay! Dirty, expensive, unfriendly help.  If you need to hear the expressway all night this is the place to stay.  If you like dirty bathrooms this place is the sheetz.
