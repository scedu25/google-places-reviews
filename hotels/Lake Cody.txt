Text: I love the lake the one and only thing I do not like about it is there are train tracks close and  trains run through the night and morning.

Text: This is a sweet little vacation spot to get away from it all.  I stopped by recently to have a look around, after having not seen Lake Cody in 35 years, and I was happy to see the place still looking wonderful.  I knew a member of their family, back when I was young, and remember the family as kind, honest and hard working.  I highly recommend Lake Cody to anyone looking to spend a few quiet days, in a peaceful setting.
