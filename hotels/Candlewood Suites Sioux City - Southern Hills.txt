Text: Very nice! Only stayed 1 night but accommodations was great. Very clean and modern.Beds comfy enough with lots of pillows. Front desk very pleasant. Fyi because its extended stay with small kitchenettes in each room, breakfast served however they do have a "kitchen pantry" you can buy food items from also there is a Casey's across the street that serves warm and cold food. Their pizza is really awesome. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Very nice and clean! Me and my husband where hungry and we had a Kitchen in our room so we decided to run to the store to get something to cook. I noticed the hotel has a small grocery store like room with all sorts or goodies. You can borrow movies to watch and they will even lend you a crock pot or blender :) very nice hotel I would highly recommend this place!
