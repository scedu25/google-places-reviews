Text: No microwaves, no fridges, restrooms are small. This hotel needs some serious updating. It's seems so neglected, it has this eerie murder/suicide haunted hotel vibe once your in the dark muggy rooms. Can't feel comfortable and relaxed in the dungeons they call rooms.
Won't be staying here anymore until they bring some life into these rooms. 

Plus side, the staff is friendly and free breakfast. That's about it.

Text: Everyone was so friendly. The hotel is a bit dated but I know a remodel is incoming this year. Regardless, it was completely clean and well taken care of. The pool area is really great! I loved how open the pool area was. Pool was warm and clean. Great job to the staff there!

Text: Nice rooms, friendly staff. Found a used razor head in my room once, but other than that it's been a nice stay! The hot tub and pool are really clean as well.

Text: Beds were comfortable.  Room was cramped and had ants.  They didn't have pancake mix for the pancake machine.  ?  Pool looked nice but was closed for the evening.
