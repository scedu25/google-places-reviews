Text: I think for the price you could do much better elsewhere. We were supposed to stay for a few nights, but ended up switching hotels. Our room was dirty....smashed spider on the wall, unknown stains on the bed skirt, stains on the table, and nothing looked like it had been wiped clean in a while. We went across the street to KMart and got some Clorox wipes and the bathroom counter was green!

The pillows are also very small, the bed was hard, and the walls make a lot of noises! It's not noises from other rooms or animals more like settling sounds. Overall it was not a great experience and we would not stay again.

Text: Good hotel, though a bit dated. The room was clean, though we had to be moved because the first one smelled like smoke. The staff was very helpful and response to our needs. The bed was firm but not too hard. Breakfast was somewhat sparce, but had the basics.

Text: Filthy room, front desk gave a room key out at 2 am to a person not listed on my reservation. Dog was barking inside a room for over 36 hours, Jacuzzi drain was broken and artificial rose petals were sticking out of the drain and jets. Clothes left in the drawers from the last guests, horrible water pressure. Stopped serving breakfast over an hour early. Hotel was robbed during my stay.

Text: Nice, Clean Rooms. Helpful and cheerful staff. Giving 4 Stars b/c it wasn't a planned stay but stop for the night and didn't check in until 2 am and was gone by 10 am but still payed full price for the room.
