Holiday Inn Express & Suites Dodge City
Rating: 5
Text: A new hotel in Dodge City. Had a great night sleep. Very close to many historical sites. Breakfast was really good. Not anything against the hotel but the sidewalks to get to walk to some close places was lacking.
Rating: 4
Text: The staff is pleasant, and this hotel is very new at the time of this review (3 weeks). So why 4 stars? One word, TRAINS...... this hotel is located right next to what seems like an extremley busy train track. If you're a heavy sleeper this may not bother you, but I was woken up multiple times throughout the night.
