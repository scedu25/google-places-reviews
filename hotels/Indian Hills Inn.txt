Text: Great value! Comfortable beds. Nice staff. Good parking for oversized vehicles. This hotel has a restaurant across the street with a very nice salad bar, good food and reasonable prices. There is also a restaurant next door but we were not impressed with the food.

Text: If you're not staying in this 
rv park, you don't know what you are missing! Paved roads, gravel pull-thru sites, with grass in between. Free wi-fi. The kicker is.....indoor pool with hot tub and spa. Restaurant and lounge on premises. Close to convenience and grocery stores, and other restaurants. Give it a try!
