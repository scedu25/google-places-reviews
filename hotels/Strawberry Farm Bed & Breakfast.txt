Strawberry Farm Bed & Breakfast

Text: This is such a lovely place to stay and is quite a change from the normal hotel atmosphere. The price is comparable to that of my usual hotel so I decided to give it a try. The owners welcome you as if you’re an old friend. I don’t know when the home was built but it is old and full of antiques. Lots of beautiful things to look at. Just be considerate. This is their home. They wake up and have coffee with you and serve you a wonderful breakfast, all the while chatting away as if you’re family. Their breakfasts are amazing. The two big dogs are super friendly and truly add to the “at home” feel. Other guests were here too, but it wasn’t awkward at all. The home is large and WiFi is excellent. The owners really will go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable and happy. If I could I would give them ten stars. They deserve it!

Text: We truly enjoyed our stay August 3-8. Our children, my husband and me were very well taken care of, from comfortable accommodations, to the hearty, delicious breakfast every morning. We loved the relaxed, homey atmosphere and highly recommend staying here if you're planning a visit to Muscatine. Linda and Karl are gracious hosts and we enjoyed our conversations with them. Our children loved their sweet golden retriever, Maggie. We hope to visit again in the future!

Text: We stayed in the Linda room with our animals, and it was the loveliest of experiences. The room is spacious and comfortable, the farm is adorable, the breakfast is on point, and Carl and Linda are wonderful hosts. We would stay again in a heartbeat!
