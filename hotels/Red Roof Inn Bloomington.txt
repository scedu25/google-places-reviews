Text: You get what you pay for. The workers are very nice , the bed was comfy , the shower in room 138 had very little water pressure, they have a TV on the wall showing the rooms , well my room did not look anything like that. The walls are thin and the breakfast well... Toast and cereal. Will not be staying here ever again. 
   But if your looking for some places to sleep and you don't care about anything else this is cheap enough.

Text: Atmosphere / Location - Close to I55.  I recall this location being vacant (not managed by anyone) for a number of years.  It's nice to see a hotel chain taking over a 'run down' building and try improving it.  Good place to stop for a quick good nights rest.  A bit noisy being so close to the highway and train tracks.  Makes it tough to get a good night sleep if your a 'light' sleeper.

Rooms - The rooms are nice and clean.  Nothing special.  Perfect for a quick few hours of sleep at a reasonable cost.

Amenities / Service - Typical amenities in the bathroom. Soap and Shampoo.  No need for to much else.

Summary - Looks like Red Roof is trying to bring this location up to their standards.  There was some construction around the building.  I commend them for this as there is a 'nitch' for the chain and what they offer.

Text: Very clean rooms. Friendly staff. They could upgrade the breakfast a little bit by adding eggs or waffles. Other than that I highly recommend staying. Prices are reasonable as well.

Text: Clean room for a decent price. The staff was very nice and the free breakfast was what you'd expect (toast, cereal, waffles, etc).

Text: Wasn't very satisfied with the room or the price. Pretty scared, the hotel was on the nasty side. I really wouldn't recommend. The price was high, for a couple more dollars I wished we would've stayed at the days inn or one of the other hotels
