Text: Always enjoy my stay at this Best Western Logan Inn location.  Staff are friendly and accommodating,  rooms are clean, and the surrounding locations provide for a sense of security and quietness!  The continental breakfast is very nice and the area is clean and inviting!  I stay here at least once or twice a year when I am in the area!  It' my "go to" when visiting this community!

Text: Great motel for an overnight stay. Very clean rooms. EXCELLENT  staff. Very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants. Lots of parking. Would've given 5 stars but the bathtub did not drain while taking a shower.

Text: Asked for a cot, 1230am, got one. Third floor had a party, told the desk twice, then a foot race, didnt tell the desk I took the people to their room and let them see the mom in me. Wasn't pretty but it got quiet. 3am, police escorted them out the doors..Chapmanvill's best western was horrible. Phone didn't work, air conditioner didn't work. Then the people in the adjoining room kept trying to open our door. The guy at the desk was scared to even face these people.

Text: Hotel and rooms clean and comfortable. Very friendly staff. I like? the convenience of a mini fridge and microwave in the room.  Missed out on breakfast but it's? always a plus for me to have that option included with the stay.
