Text: Doesn't seem kept kept up with. Dirt and mold in corners of rooms. Outdated fixtures. Topically looks nice, took a closer look and everything is drab and old. Not worth the price. Not staying here again while in Cincy. Staff is friendly and helpful.

Text: Provided a clean, quiet suite with a great little work station that included a recharge strip for electronics. For the price this is a great place to get a good night's sleep and catch up on some work while on the road.

Text: Friendly staff! Convenient location. Rooms and breakfast were average. Nice that they provided newspapers. TV had no HD picture so watching the game was a disappointment.
