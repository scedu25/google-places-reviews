Text: Very clean and affordable. I would recommend this motel to anyone traveling through toledo, or even someone local just to get away for a night. If you need anything during your stay, the front desk staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating. Always have a great time!! 5 ? ? ? ? ?

Text: Good place to stay if your in area for contractual work. $200 a week for a workers extended stay isn't bad. This isn't a high end motel, it's for people coming to area for work. No bed bugs, clean and quite. You gave to go around about way to get there, but that was the new interstates fault. Pull it up on GPS and it will get you there. The problem with housekeeping was addressed by management,  a new staff is in place and doing a good job. Maintenance is good and quick to respond. Management is good and won't tolerate any problems or illegal activities. If you try and play a stupid game there, you will win a stupid prize. The police really enjoy removing people that cause problems. Also the indoor swimming pool is now open.

Text: The staff was friendly to me.  The woman at the desk informed me that I was being moved upgraded from the room I reserved because the heater/ AC unit wasn't functioning properly, which I appreciated.  WiFi was reliable.  The room was clean, and the refrigerator worked. Bathroom was clean.  There was some grunginess in one upper corner of the shower, but overall an excellent value.
