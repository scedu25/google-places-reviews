Text: Came here for a company training and had a wonderful time! Food is fairly decent (and plentiful) and the installations are generally top notch. It's somewhat far from Chicago though, so don't expect to be able to go out in town at night... (there are some bars on campus, which are just fine)

Text: Have been to the Q Center on multiple occasions. Staff is always very polite. Guest Rooms are small but serve the purpose of the events I attend (typically work seminars). Food is usually decent. Conference rooms are spacious and kept cool throughout the day. Plenty of things to do at and around the location at night.

Text: Q Center is an amazing place that provides almost everything you would want while you stay. Although it is a bit far from any city, you usually do not need to leave unless you choose to.
