Text: Very dissatisfied !!! I paid 220.00 for one week. The room floors were no where near cleaned. Both lamps were broken and falling apart. Toilet flooded and the management blamed me wouldn't give me cleaning supplies, a mop or even towels to dry floor. No plunger in the bathroom. Smelled like stale smoke. Bathtub walls were rotting out and falling apart. I cant believe the owners and managmente are this lazy and trashy. It's really just pathetic how bad this room condition.
