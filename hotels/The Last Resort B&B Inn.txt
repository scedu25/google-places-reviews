The Last Resort B&B Inn
Rating: 3
Text: The B&B was clean, historic and conveniently located near the lake. Not much of a breakfast however as it was a simple continental breakfast without much flare or variety. The price was right and one if the few places you can book for one night only instead of a two night minimum. A step above a hotel but avoid if you are looking for an authentic breakfast experience.

Text: I have been staying at the Last Resort since 1998 I think. My girls were little, then. Now 24 & 27 and now son in law comes and boyfriend and kids visit. We rented the apartment. I had a hard time getting the group to leave and hit the blueberry festival. Mary and Alberto are wonderful. You might just get a chance to hear Mary sing and Alberto jam only if your really lucky. The location is between the channel and the beach on Lake Michigan, 1 block each way! You can walk to downtown over the cute draw bridge lined with red Bigonias in about 10 minutes. P.S. It's always clean and quiet. A beautiful, old, Victorian beast of a house.

Text: This place is wonderful! The owner Mary is just a sweethear. She put a ton of work in this place since it was the first BB in south haven. The Staff is awsome. Rooms are cozy and very clean. Has gorgeous scenery next to the beach. This place is by far one of my favorites to go to just to relax. I will keep coming back every year. It is a must see and place to stay!

Text: Stayed in the Studio, which worked great for our family of 4 plus our infant. Very family friendly rooms. Provided makeup wipes, shampoo, and Q tips. Breakfast was great, light breakfast. Friendly staff, not much "shared fridge" room, so bring a cooler!

Text: Location was prime. Rooms were pretty basic with small showers, worked perfectly for us as we just slept there. The inn keepers were amazing and very helpful. We biked everywhere from this location.
