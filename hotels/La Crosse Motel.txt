Text: Ok for a small town in central Ks. This place is super affordable only 29.00 per night per person. My gal and I stayed for 54.61 comfy beds and great people. Oh the tennant in #113 does laundry for 5.00 a load it seems expensive but with the price of the room your still saving!!!

Text: A lil worn down but not bad. Super cheap for the price too. $25 with tax?! Decent Wi-Fi, fridge, microwave, 2 beds, shower no shampoo. The place to go for a nights stay.
