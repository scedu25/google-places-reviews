Text: If I could give this place .5 stars, I would. The only nice about this place was that they had Direct TV. When I woke up the next morning after sleeping in one of their rooms, my entire nasal and throat area was congested and so was my dad's. We've both been sick now for 3 days. We think there is mold in the rooms or the air conditioners, or even both. I do not recommend this place at all. Especially after staying in their room made me and my dad sick.

Text: Not a bad place to sleep, rooms appeared to be clean and price is fair. They do charge a $10 pet charge which brought the to $69 with tax.

Text: Musty room, really short shower head, uncomfortable bed, partly functional air conditioning... But pretty cheap so that was nice.
