Text: We recently stayed here for 5 days and loved it.  The cabin was beautiful.  Very spacious and cozy.  The area is very quite and peaceful.  We really enjoyed being able to step out back and see trees as far as we could see.  We will definitely be back anytime we need a escape from life.  5 stars all the way.

Text: 5 stars all the way.  I've stayed at the Lake House and Snuggled Inn and they are both amazing.  They are both well-kept and spacious.  Peter is a great guy and was very accommodating.  Suzanne replied to my e-mails promptly and made the process very easy.  I'm only renting through them in the future.

Text: We stayed in the Snuggle Inn cabin this past weekend and absolutely LOVED it!  The cabin has every amenity you could possibly need and then some! (When they say "fully equipped kitchen" they mean it!)  The layout of the 3 floors, plus each bedroom having its own bathroom gave us 3 families plenty of privacy and space to move around.  The patio furniture is large and plentiful and the rocking chairs a nice bonus.  The Cabin was also very clean!  
The reservation process through Peter was fast and efficient, and Suzanne answered all my email questions which helped me to further plan our trip.  And No having to drive out of the way to an office to pick up and delivery the keys - fabulous!!
We will definitely be returning to Back to Nature Cabins!

Text: We stayed at the Lake House and had a great time! The house is well maintained and comfortable. The game room and hot tub are excellent! It's located about a mile to a boat launch ramp on Lake Monroe or 20 minutes to the Lake Monroe Boat Rental.
