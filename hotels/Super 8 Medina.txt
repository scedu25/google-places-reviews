Super 8 Medina

Text: It was easy to find, very affordable, and the bedding was definitely better than expected given the cost. I slept soundly all night. Yes, it shows a little age, but it wears it well. We had to leave before the breakfast was available at 6am otherwise I'd comment on it, but the breakfast area looked fairly nice. About what I'd expect from a nicer chain. I'll probably use this hotel more often in my frequent trips between Columbus and Cleveland now!

Text: First real smelled like urine big time and the staff quickly moved me. The urine smell went away but it still smelled dank and I had housekeeping open my door three times before my requested one hour late check-out

Text: Very clean.  Best deal in the area.  Usually listed as a 2 star.  Should be at LEAST a 3 star.

Text: I was sorely disappointed in this motel.  There's no elevator and I was placed on the second floor.  I have some difficulty with stairs especially if I have to carry items up and down.   So if you have a lot of luggage or physical difficulties be sure to ask for first floor.   All vending and ice machines are on the first floor also.
