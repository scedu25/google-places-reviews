Coachlight RV Park

Text: Office staff are some of the friendliest people you will ever come across, and Mike was very, very helpful with helping me get set up at my campsite since I needed a cable TV splitter.  Extremely nice place with lots of trees and well-kept RV park. One of the nicest RV Parks I've ever stayed at, which is why I return to this RV Park monthly.

Text: I was trying to keep this place a secret so I would always have a place to stay but I should give them their due. The place is quiet, I mean quiet. It's very clean. The people are nice. Nice cable lineup. Nicely shaded spaces. Sites are level. What else can I say? We've stayed there about 8 times as we go to and from the desert southwest.

Text: While passing through the desert southwest I stopped for repairs in Las cruces. Upon exit 140 I came to my spot here at the Coachlight inn RV & motel. At that time it was under a different management. Since the new management this place has turned a brand new leaf gor an outstanding result. Karen the full time manager is absolutely wonderful. The rates are decent and the place is very clean and quit. The sites are gravel and very level. I have seen firsthand this new management realy cares and they are very friendly. The internet is fast, the showers are clean, laundry facilities have greatly improved and the ice machine is full. I can see that a complete renovation is 

 in the motel. The owner is a very nice man and I cannot say enough nice things about these awsome folks. If I ever pass by this beautiful city I definately will stop again. I recommend to all this is a great place. Too bad ill be gone in the summer I hear the swimming pool is going to be filled.

Text: We were here for an rv rally. Management was very nice and cooperative. Our rv site was level, and we were even allowed to wash our coach!
