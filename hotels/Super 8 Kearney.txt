Super 8 Kearney
Rating: 4
Text: It was a good room for the price. The bed was comfortable. The woman that checked us in was polite. The only problem was the continental breakfast. They were trying to rush and get everything put away and we didn't get much to eat. Overall it was a good experience.

Text: Probably the best deal for a Hotel in Kearney. Rooms are old, but have a fridge+freezer+Microwave. Perfectly fine for me who just needed a bed to sleep in that night for the cheapest price.

Me and many others had an issue where none of the keys would work even after being reissued 3 separate times. The only solution they offered was to come to the front desk every time we left our room and wanted to come back in so they could walk to the room with us and let us in with a master key. There were around 5 people who paid for rooms complaining in the hallway with me

I felt bad for the girl at the front desk, because it was a hotel problem, not a mistake on her part. She didn't deserve to be yelled at by people for an issue that was out of her control.

Super 8 needs to provide their employees with the tools required to do their job. That solution is not acceptable at all.

Text: This hotel is a great place for the value. The staff is friendly and courteous. The room was clean, and overall I was pleased with the hotel. This is a nice family run hotel. The super 8 is not fancy, but I would not hesitate to stay there again.

Text: Took three grandsons to pioneer village and spent the night at super 8. Great rate so got 2 rooms. Beds were a little soft but good. Friendly front desk staff, great breakfast with hot items, clean bathrooms, large rooms.

Text: Clean room, decent breakfast. Only reason not  all 5 stars is that you can hear your neighbors due to very thin walls, but for the price very happy with our stay.
