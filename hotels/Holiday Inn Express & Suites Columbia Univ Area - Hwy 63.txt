Text: Very cozy hotel (I've never been to a hotel that wasn't cozy and nice) if your coming to Columbia MO this is where you should stay and they're cinnamon rolls are SO good staff is really friendly.

Text: Visited family staying at the hotel to play at the pool. Beautiful, clean, modern hotel with great staff and wonderful amenities. We all appreciated the complimentary coffee as an afternoon pick-me-up!

Text: The air would cut off in the middle of the night.  Woke up sweating all 3 nights. Attempted to get it fixed after the first night, but it continued to do this the rest of the stay.    Also had peesonal items missing from room; when we attempted to discuss this with management it was never followed up on. Nice rooms and breakfast, but the rest of the experience was disheartening.

Text: Rooms are great,  hotel is clean,  nice pool.  Don't be fooled by the lounge area.  You can't sit there anytime after breakfast.  There aren't any other adequate seating areas for groups of 5 or more. Disappointing.
