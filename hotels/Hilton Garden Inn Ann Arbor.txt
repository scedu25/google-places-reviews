Hilton Garden Inn Ann Arbor

Text: The hotel staff was very friendly and the hotel was very clean. The people above us were little loud stomping around so I wish the sound barrier would have been a little better. Otherwise it was great. I didn't have any hallway noise and we weren't near in elevator ice machine so that was good. The most important thing for me is that things look clean and that was definitely the case here. I would definitely go back again to this location if we were in the area again and needed a hotel and I would recommend it to others.

Text: Nice looking pool and business center, as well as a nice lobby. Had some decor for Halloween and on the 30th the staff were all in matching costumes, which was a festive touch. Breakfast was not included though, so beware of that when their website says they have a breakfast buffet.

Text: I recently attended a birthday party at Hilton Garden in Ann Arbor. The banquet area was clean and the food was good. There was a nice patio outside were we spent the rest of the evening socializing. This would be a great option to consider for a birthday party or small event.
