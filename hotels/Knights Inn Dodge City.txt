Knights Inn Dodge City
Rating: 4
Text: This rating is placed keeping in mind that this is a $45 a night motel.  For this kind of money you have to temper your expectations. It was clean, did not smell and suprisingly had hard floors rather than carpet which I liked. Brand new flat screen TV, probably 42 inch, that was nice. The only thing kept this from being a 5 star at this level for me was that the toilet bowl was dirty and the shower was in disrepair but all was functional. Hot water was good. Would definitely stay again

Text: Not to fancy, for being non-smoking it sure has a smoking smell in the hallway and sometimes in the room.
