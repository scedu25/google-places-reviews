Text: Very nice place, especially for an extended stay. The breakfast needs much more selection but there's plenty of options close. The staff is great and they have other amenities that make you very comfortable. I would stay there again.

Text: When we 1st checked in the dead bolt for our room didn't work. So we went to the front desk & Jeff promptly gave us another room. (Jeff's customer service was consistently excellent.) The room we were given was a very lovely spacious suite. However this morning I had put on new white socks. After 15 mins, they were black on the bottoms. Over all it was a pretty nice hotel but with some issues of cleanliness.
