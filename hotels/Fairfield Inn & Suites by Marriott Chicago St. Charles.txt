Text: Decent place with clean rooms and mostly friendly service. A few things could be improved, however, especially since this place is not on the cheap end:

First, the free breakfast is barely worth the free...homeless people can find just as fresh bagels in a dumpster behind a bakery. Second, people are already paying $199 a night ($109 a night if you stay a week or more) for the cheaper double bed rooms...to charge $3.00 for a small Gatorade, $3.50 ($1.75 a wash and $1.75 a dry) to use small, old appliances where you still need to wait around to add fabric softener (not sure how you can even do a bleach load?) like my mom used to have when I was a little kid (I'm 42) is absolutely ridiculous. I haven't bought anything else yet (and won't have to hopefully) but I shudder to think what you charge for your tiny laundry detergent packs). Your customers are paying good money for the rooms...you can't let them buy a drink at a reasonable price or wash clothes in a dinosaur machine for 75 cents? You'd still be making money even then, but c'mon, you're ripping off your captive audience with those prices.

P.S. Ice machine on our floor broke a couple days ago, which is understandable, but when I called to let them know, I was just told that there's machines on the other 2 floors I can use. Okay, yes, I know, but curious...are you even going to fix the broken one? I'll be here for a couple more weeks at least so we'll find out I guess.

P.P.S. I appreciate the clean rooms and I've never seen any dirty bugs and the sheets always smell freshly bleached. However, I have seen several (half dozen or so) of the Asian (orange) lady bugs in our room this week.

Text: Check-in was fast and the front desk staff was very friendly. The room was clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. The breakfast options were plentiful and the coffee was very good, although if it was hotter, that would have been better. Overnight, everything was very quiet. I would absolutely stay here again!

Text: Very neat and clean lobby and hotel. Parking is a 4 minute walk from the hotel, with the option of self parking or valet. There are 13 floors, breakfast offered every morning, a fitness center open 24/7, and is located very close to the Navy Pier and only a 20 minute walk from millennium park

Text: Clean modern rooms, plenty of electrical outlets for computer, tablets, chargers, etc. Friendly staff. This is my fourth week long stay and my preferred hotel when I travel out here for work.
