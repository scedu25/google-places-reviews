Text: This was my first time staying at this hotel and I most say I wasn't to happy. When I checked in the girl at the front desk Elizabeth was drunk and disorderly. She was slurring her words and I couldn't make out what she was saying. she started to do this weird thing. It sounded like she was telling me she couldn't hear me. Apparently she's never heard of hearing aids. I don't think anyone in that condition should be working in public. the breakfast was great the bed was awesome and I loved the new renovation. I hope I don't see this person isn't working when we return. Seems Like a nice place.

Text: Our hotel room was clean and appeared to be freshly remodeled. The air conditioner worked well and our bed was comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was delicious as well. The room itself was affordable and the staff was friendly and got us checked in quickly. Overall we had a pleasant stay.

Text: This hotel was being updated and refreshed during my stay in October 2017. I enjoyed my stay here, the room was newly furnished and comfortable. The only strange thing to complain about was the breakfast is served on paper party plates with plastic cutlery. Very strange.

Text: There is a pretty decent breakfast as it is not huge, but it has waffles and whip cream which is all I could ask for. I was only in the bottom floor and breakfast is until 6 to ten or eleven o clock, and really nice rooms by the way.
