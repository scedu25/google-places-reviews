Text: I have stayed with my family several times at this campground and have always found the facilities to be clean and well maintained.  If you are looking for a truly family-friendly experience in a peaceful environment operated by Christians, give this location a try.  In addition, it is a great location to have a retreat with your church youth group, within close proximity to Jack's Fork and Current rivers for outings.

Text: We had a great time.  Campground is very clean.  Horseshoe pits with shoes.  Very shaded with pine trees. Bathrooms were clean and showers were warm.  Both electric and water at the camping sites.  Nice hiking trail.  5min to Alley Springs and 5min to Emminence.  They have activities like zipline if you are interested.  Very friendly, Christian atmosphere.
