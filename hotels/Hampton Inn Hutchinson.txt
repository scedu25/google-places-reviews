Text: Very comfortable beds! Not crazy firm like other places I've stayed. Rooms were nice and kept. Staff was super friendly! My son has severe food allergies and staff let me check labels on breakfast items which was super helpful! Some links say hotel has a hot tub as well as pool, but hot tub has been taken out. Had a room large enough for my family at good price. Definitely would stay again!

Text: Staff is very attentive and friendly. Hotel has been renovated with new furniture and carpet, but it doesn't seem like all of the fixtures were replaced. I stayed two two weeks for business, and both rooms had bathtubs that had the top plastic layer peeling off. The rooms are a welcome improvement from how they were before the renovation, but it would have been nice had they spent the extra money to fully update the bathrooms. Otherwise, the rooms have flat screen TVs, new A/C units, and swanky furniture.

Text: Was a great hotel but after earthquake the building and rooms need fixing. And my room was dirty. (Someone else's sock was next to the bed. Eww)

Text:  Well I didn't have a good experience here. The housekeeping staff really didn't understand English which was kind of a problem. Our bathroom had two leaks and they didn't let us change rooms. The air conditioner only half worked.
 They had a full breakfast set up that was suppose to go from 6-10 however they put stuff out at 6 but didn't replenish anything so basically if you wanted to eat you had to do it at 6.
  The good thing I can say is the pool is a salt pool and was warm.  So that's my review.

Text: Good location, a little tricky to find the driveway unless the GPS maps have been updated. Rooms are spacious and clean.
