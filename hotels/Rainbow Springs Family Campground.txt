Rainbow Springs Family Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Nice place, facilities (bath houses) could use an upgrade, but they are in working order with paper and soap. Swimming and fishing available. Overall a nice get-a-way for the entire family.

Text: The owners and staff were nice but hated the campground. No cell service, 4 or 5 cars running loose, dumpsters were over flowing, grass was not cut around camp sites. Definitely not worth the price. Would not recommend.

Text: Dirty bathrooms and showers, unkept sites with tall pricker plants, people staying there were a bit rude and felt like we were intruding because we had a tent. We ran into the owner friday we tried to be cordial but he was very rude back and scolded his employee in front of us. It was awkward and i felt bad for the employee. Only stayed here as a last resort and it will certainly be our last stay there.

Text: Don't stay here if you want to be accused of stealing! While driving into the campground, we were greeted with a bunch of signs such as no boomboxes, no this, no that. After driving around the place looking for a spot to set up tent, we parked the car in front of the office trailer to sign paperwork and pay for the night. This car immediately pulls up behind me but I didn't think anything of it. Anyway, card got declined, so I went to the car to to transfer money on my phone so I don't have to use my other cards. Owner (old man) came over and started scolding us and then proceeded to scold the lady in the register office. He then came back and then kicked us out because we didn't park in the right spot and pointed out that the card got declined and accused us of trying to steal from him. He did all this while the poor employee was behind the counter watching him yell and go off at us. Ruined the whole camping trip... 

I've stayed in a few other campgrounds near loudenville town center (Mohican) and didn't get treated like I did here.
