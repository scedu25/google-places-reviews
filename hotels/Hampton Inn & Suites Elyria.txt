Hampton Inn & Suites Elyria

Text: The hotel pool had no jello mix to flavor the pool water. Their was also a lack of broken glass or riots for that matter. This made the aesthetic appeal of the hotel. I recommend staying in Seth house instead.

Text: Nice newish looking Hampton that has a decent breakfast. While it's close to the turnpike, take your time while driving to it. The GPS actually had us driving in several directions. If you turn into the Best Buy and head right you'll work your way around the abandoned mall and find it.

Text: This is a nice hotel. It appears to have been recently renovated and the rooms are quite comfortable. Depending on which side if the hotel your room is on, you may get some road noise from the highway exit ramp. It is a very shirt drive to the local mall and several eating establishments. Coffeepots remained stocked all day and evening which is important to me. I would stay here again if in the area.

Text: Newly renovated rooms so it's pretty nice inside. It isn't concrete floors so try to stay on the top floor (4th) to avoid hearing people walk around. I've been woken up several times tonight by the people above me. They have fairly sophisticated climate controls with motion detection that aren't easily bypassed so if you like to be able to keep your room nice and cool when you sleep you might want to stay somewhere else. Good location to find places to eat nearby.  Desk is a little small.

Text: Room was great size, and bed was very comfortable. Walk in shower was nice size. Breakfast was a little lacking, particularly the eggs. Overall, great experience.
