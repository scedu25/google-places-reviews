Text: Our fur kids always come home happy after a visit here. Other places we've taken them freak them out.

Text: I was in love and at ease the moment I arrived at Hurd's Hound Haven. The setting is absolutely stunning, the kennel facilities are beautiful and immaculate, the staff is friendly and so helpful! It felt like I was leaving them with family! I felt so relieved after moving here to find such a wonderful place for my 4 legged children! I always feel very anxious because our dogs are not the best behaved and we also have a deaf, blind Boston whom I am always worried about, not this time! They welcomed my "herd" with open arms! I was thrilled and didn't worry a second while I was away! Highly recommend Hurd's Hound Haven, you will LOVE it!

Text: Excellent place for our dog Mickey! We traveled for 12 days in the summer of 2013 and chose to board our puppy with the Hurd Family. Mickey was well cared for and loved during this time. We also have them come to our home to groom Mickey. We live about 20 miles from their facility and it is so convenient to have their mobile service come to our home. I highly recommend Hurd's Hound Haven. It is a family run business that can't be beat!

Text: I like the Hurd family kennel because the people are nice and I am confident in their talents as they handle my dogs very easily.  I have a Rottweiler and a hound that is very protective at home and at the kennel they lead them to their kennels without a leash and they put them out and they can see other dogs and when I pick up my dogs, they are not nervous or they haven't lost weight, etc.
Very easy going and relax atmosphere there and yet very confident that my dogs are well taken care of.
Very nice place, clean and good hours to pick up and drop off.

Text: my name is bentley the cavachon, adopted from south hamilton rescue in jewel, iowa four years ago. my parents are vern and lyn vande brake. 

even tho i am a designer dog, i frequently get out of my fenced yard and head straight for the barn where i bring back delicious mounds of horse manure.

well, it happened that the other day  i'd not only done that but also i ran through the briar patch where the bunny rabbits are burrowing, and i was just covered - with everything imaginable - and some things you just wouldn't want to imagine !

off to hurd's hounds we went !   at the end of the day i came out a different dog. why,  i look so good, you'd think i belonged at west minister with the rest of the show dogs !  

a 5 star rating to britta who did this  expert clean-up bath-and-clip make-over on me.

from bentley the cavachon.
