Hampton Inn by Hilton Champaign/Urbana
Rating: 4
Text: Hotel is nice, conveniently located next to the campus. The room is large and well maintained, with comfortable bed, TV, AC and a desk. The breakfast is not too good, but expected. Gym is very small... Unless it is rainy or super cold, it's better to go running outside.

Text: Check in: extremely friendly service and helpful amendments to my reservations, which the reservations folks had made weirdly. Room: clean, well maintained furniture. But it's the little details that matter: Neutrogena bath products, the soft red backlight that stays on when your room is otherwise dark, the outlets you find everywhere for your electronics, and the nice blackout curtains over the window. I really enjoyed this room. Beds are comfy but nothing exciting. Amenities: standard. Laundry, workout room, snack shop, and breakfast stuff. The breakfast has decent waffles you can make yourself, but I'd otherwise say it's par for the course. Overall, for the rate I paid, a really nice staff and stay.

Text: We stayed at the Hampton Champaign on Saturday night, 9/30/17.  The room was good and we slept well.  I want to give special props to Brittany at the front desk.  We were greeted with a big smile, and she was incredibly nice to us!  Thanks Brittany!
