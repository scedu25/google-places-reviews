Drury Inn & Suites Findlay

Text: This place was great! The room was clean and well kept. There was a nice indoor pool. Amenities included a drink and food voucher card from 5:30-7:00 PM, good for three drinks and unlimited food. For us it was a taco and nacho buffet and alcoholic drinks were included! Our minor sons had virgin drinks. We tipped highly for this nice feature because our service really was fantastic. Another nice bonus was the free hot, fresh breakfast buffet (nicer than most) with excellent choices: real, fresh scrambled eggs and plenty of them, biscuits and gravy, sausage, fresh waffles, potato wedges, fruit, bagels, muffins, yogurt and more. Great staff, no smoking in the whole facility. Good parking, safe area and a Culver's next door. Highly recommended!

Text: We were extremely pleased with our stay. I can't say enough good things about the hotel. The staff was friendly, especially the man serving breakfast. Breakfast was the best I have had in any hotel. There was a lot of variety. We loved the potatoes especially. The beds were comfy and the pillows were so perfect that I am ordering them online for my home. Everything was clean, from the parking lot to the bathrooms. It wasn't noisy at all, even though there were a lot of young kids on our floor. The showerhead was nice and relaxing.at the end of each day. The recliner in our room was much nicer and more comfortable than the room chairs in other hotels. Checkout is easy, you just leave your key in the room and go.

Text: Great hotel. Nice pool and hot tub as well. Our room had plenty of space and a pretty nice bathroom (nice shower head and so on). Also got an incredible deal because we were going to SCUBA dive at the Gilboa Quarry, and this Drury offers a big discount if you're staying there.

Text: Very nice hotel in the upper-mid level price range. Beautiful lobby, super nice staff. We had a suite which was very spacious, with a sitting room with sofabed and trundle bed and a master bedroom with a king bed. The bed and accoutrements were good quality - the mattress was perfect, not too firm, not too soft.

Water temperature and pressure was good. The mini fridge was tiny. There was a microwave and coffeemaker as well as a bar sink.

The pool is partially outdoors and you can swim on either side. There is also an indoor hot tub. The fitness center was adequate with an exercise bike, a treadmill, an elliptical and a set of dumbbells and a bench.

We missed the evening food but the breakfast was good with a selection of hot and cold items. However, other guests spoke very highly of the evening offerings. Additionally there is popcorn and soda available all the time.

This is a great hotel for a staycation with kids! Very happy with everything.
