Text: !994 - The worst place to live, But with NO choice just returning Stateside... NO One would help us, The boy's room litterly had the wall coming apart from the main frame of the trailer, The dog could just crawl in from the front yard... Base housing couldn't help and Knob Noster city hall wouldn't do anything either to get Lakewood to fix anything. Doors off hinges , porch unstable to front door, roof leaked,Couldn't get the heat above 50 in back half of trailer and during the snowy season the temp was " 0 " or below, had to put on every piece of clothes we owned to stay warm and sleep in the living room with a heater.... It was just awful then... Sry to hear it has gotten worse... Someone needs to do something about theses people....

Text: Keep raising the rent, every year I've lived here. But never do what they say the money is for.. raised it two years ago for roads. The gigantic pot hole is still in front of my house. Love my view, but it's crazy bad ownership.  Just a tax write off to them, but it's our home ?.

Text: Worst place to live. Save yourself the money & go elsewhere because it is not worth it.
