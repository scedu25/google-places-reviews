Text: Great hotel. Small but convenient bar. Pool and workout room. Shopping center only 5 minutes away. Good location.

Text: I booked a room through a 3rd party site and have had bad luck in the past, especially with how the hotel staff treated me and/or my family. This was totally different. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and attempted to accommodate any requests I had. The person that greeted me and checked me in was extra friendly and is one reason why I will put this hotel above others when I visit the area in the future. The room provided everything I needed as well. The restaurant provides a full menu and even provides room service. Has a fitness center, pool, and business center. Free parking and WiFi are bonuses. I will definitely look to stay here on my next visit.

Text: Pros and Cons. ..
Pros: kinda secluded, lower price than competition, comfortable beds, recently remodeled with nice baskets to store stuff in. Clean. Close to shopping and restaurants. 
Cons: could hear foot noise above us (not real bad tho), Breakfast is $10 per person, door on bathroom is huge and self closing no vent fan in bathroom (or was not working). Bit of a strange odor in bathroom. 
We propped open the bath door to dissipate steam etc from bathroom. Ugh.

Text: Had an issue on check-in, due to third party booking. However, thanks to the wizardry of Miss Ellen Vasquez (and Harold) at the front desk,  the error was very quickly corrected. In addition to the fantastic front desk sorcery, the property is beautiful, very clean and conveniently located near the Chesterfield mall and amphitheater.

Text: The rooms were very nice-spacious and we'll appointed- and the staff very accommodating. The hotel has an aesthetically pleasing design. The rooms were quiet despite being near the highway. The hotel is near outlet malls and places with good activities for children.
