Linwood Lawn Bed & Breakfast

Text: This is an immaculately restored historic antebellum mansion just south of Lexington. The entire place is so gorgeous and peaceful.  For our fellow nerds, the owner goes through the fascinating history over breakfast. Don is so hospitable and we only wish we would have discovered it before we got married because it would be incredible for a wedding venue. We'll definitely be back. Highly recommend it!

Text: History set in stone.  This beautiful Mansion brings the past to the present.  I have never experienced such  massive beauty.  If only the walls could talk and tell the stories of days long gone.  Tonight I had the pleasure to cater a Fairy Tale  Wedding /Reception at Linwood Lawn. The setting and aura took you back into the 1800's.  The beautiful bride and hansome groom began their journey  from now to eternity in a place that has stood the test or time, though  war,  elements and  time has left some scars...The beauty has over come all this and still stands strong today.  Take a trip to Lexington MO, experience this treasure from the past for yourself.
