Brickhouse of Somerset
Rating: 5
Text: The Brickhouse is a beautifully restored, improved and maintained old farmhouse.  Sandy and Ron, the innkeepers, are very friendly and accommodating, and the rates are more than reasonable. I had a great stay and would not hesitate to recommend this B & B to anyone!

Text: Sandy is the hostest with the mostest! So very thoughtful and a wonderful servant heart for all of her guests. We were greeted with being offered cocktails and were given a delicious taste of a pizza made on their Big Egg Grill Cooker. This B&B is very clean and exactly as described on the website. I would absolutely spend more nights here in the future!
