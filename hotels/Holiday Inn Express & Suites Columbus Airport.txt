Text: Nice, clean, basic accommodations. Breakfast area was a bit small, with wonderful smells from the food we couldn't wait for a seat. No bedbugs!

Text: Stayed at hotel before leaving for CA so we could leave our car somewhere convenient. The gentleman at the front desk came to the door and held it open for us when we parked in the back. He was very kind and always went out of his way. I will stay here again during our next flight out.

Text: The rooms were clean, spacious, and well maintained. We used the pool which was a nice size and very clean. We did not eat the breakfast although I saw several other guests enjoying the feature. The check out time was noon and that was nice compared to the 11 o'clock that I'm use to going by.

Text: Great staff. Hotel very convenient to airport, lots of walking distance restaurants and a grocery store. Definitely recommend staying here if you're in the CMH area.

Text: Hotels do vary, but this was pretty much a perfect stay. AC was awesome cold (especially considering I started it really late). Orange juice was good, even though a smidge on the lighter side. The shower pressure was also awesome. Good times :)
