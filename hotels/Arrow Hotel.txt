Arrow Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: For a supposed "2-star hotel" this place punches above its weight. Very friendly and helpful staff, lots of space with clean rooms and common areas, and a nice historic atmosphere without being pushy. Handily situated. Excellent value. We were there for the eclipse, but the Arrow would be our first choice if we ever wanted to visit anywhere in the area again.

Text: The hotel was in the historic downtown area with a beautiful park across the street. Or rooms looked out over the park and were spacious. It was a little slow to check in and we were disappointed that we were unable to park in they're secure garage but over all the hotel was pleasant, very clean and for how secluded the location is I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. I will be staying at this location in the future and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking to stay in the area.

Text: i live in this wonderful town Broken Bow nebraska. This place is a wonderful place to be and stay. I grew up here as my parents did too. The arrow hotel is a fantastic place to stay safe and cozy. I've stayed here may times myself. In the simple rooms there were already dishes that were white and beautiful. The beds are made after every visit and they look nice.The locks are great. If you use the elevator on the side of the building you have to have a key and at night the front door is always locked. So its 99% safe to me. The big ones are nice. Now down in the Bon Fire MMMM the food is scrumptious fries,Quesadillas,baked goods, good drinks,lots of choices. Every once and awhile I go and they have something upgraded to something better. If you go to Broken Bow Nebraska. I personally Recommend you to stay. I just know you'll love it. I hope you stay here we are all welcoming and kind. Ask anyone. Thank You for reading my review on the Arrow Hotel and Bonfire Grill and bar.
