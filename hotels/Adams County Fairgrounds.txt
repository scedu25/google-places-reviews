Adams County Fairgrounds

Text: This is my goto campground in Hastings.  The office staff is the best and are well informed about the local facilities, restaurants,  and entertainment.  They made my 5 day stay better.  The grounds are very clean and in great repair.  The fairboard has put a camp host in place due to horrible problems last year.  When the office closes this gentleman feels he is in charge.  He would arbitrarily lock the shower room because he saw "unsavory" people on the grounds.  The host also felt I wasn't paying enough to use the shower and I needed to use my RV.  To not do so was my "choice."  I also feel he came to my camp spot too many times to talk with me about these things.  I did demand that he stay away from my camp and leave the shower open until I left.  Each time he arrived he was antoginastic an accusatory.  I will still continue to use this wonderful campground.

Text: I go every year for the Adams County Fair and it's really nothing much. They have the same rides every year and don't add any variety. The employees running the rides are as emotion less as Michael Myers. And the hosts of the ridged game stands try to get you to play their games even though you clearly don't want to. And everything but the rides are overpriced, like come on $8 for a drink that I can get for $1.80. The only reason to go is if it's your first time or for the concerts and dog shows.
