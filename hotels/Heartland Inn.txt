Text: Great service at check in, room clean and tidy. Gave us a late check out. Airport shuttle a great service efficient and friendly. Good car storage. Need to warn customers about change in access to the hotel with major road changes. Recommend this as a good travel motel. Thanks Heartland! We will stay again..

Text: Was here for a family member's hospital visit. The staff was incredibly accommodating and kind, they let me check in early and saved dinner for me on a particularly late night during my mom's surgery. The room was pleasant and very clean. There is an Old Chicago next door, but no noise issues. Even though they were in the middle of a renovation, I was never disturbed or interrupted during my stay. Very considerate! The dinner in Wednesday was simple but homey. Shuttle service to the hospital was efficient and pleasant, but the hotel is close enough for a nice walk as well. Thanks for a great stay during a difficult time, I appreciate it.

Text: Heartland Inn was the best value hotel we found on short notice and had a very positive experience during our one night stay. Staff was courteous and helpful with getting checked in and out in a timely matter. Our room was spaceous and helped to provide a much needed great night's sleep. The only complaint we had during our stay was our room was located adjacent to the pool and the smell of pool water seemed to permeate into our room.
