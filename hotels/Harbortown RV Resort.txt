Harbortown RV Resort
Rating: 4
Text: We stayed at the resort from 8/4/17 - 8/6/17, our overall experience great the staff in the office was friendly and very welcoming. My son had a great time swimming in the pool, hitting balls in the batting cage and we played their putt putt course which was very nice.  Since we like to play golf it was great that a golf course was just down the street.  The campsite itself was nice and beautifully kept and maintained. The grass was so nice we opted not to put out our camper rug as we saw no need to. I read the review about the guy who said he was not allowed to put a pallet and rug down before I made reservation. I called the resort to ask about this and was told we could use a rug if was aerated to allow air and water through which is what we have. If you read the rules regarding rugs you will see that even if you use those style rugs even then you have to roll them up every 2 days if you stay there more than a few days to keep from killing the grass. I do not see where this is an unreasonable request since the keep their grounds so nicely maintained.
So you may be asking yourself why you are reading this review why did I give only 4 stars,  well the train that goes by often can be bothersome at night (more so for my wife than me) and the wood they sell for $6 a bundle and the problem was not quantity but quality seemed to be pine and was still wet which was hard to get to burn and keep burning and gave off a lot of smoke but we made it work. The good about the wood is that they will deliver to your campsite. I did buy 2 bundles because I didn't have any other choice since we do enjoy campfires. I also read in the review about "daily inspections" which what all I saw was trash pick up at 10am both mornings and they did come to our site to clean out the fire pit from the night before so that we had a nice clean fire pit for our next campfire which I thought was nice. I do recommend that anyone reading these reviews to ignore the bad ones and go experience the campground for yourself because other than a couple minor details about the train and wood you will have a great time. We will be returning for more camping, golf and great ice cream especially the peanut butter mackinaw fudge.

Text: Quiet early fall weekend, not very busy.  The campground is nice, with activities such as go kart racing. The swimming pool is closed for the season, overall a nice campground.  Only rating 4 stars because the bathrooms were not kept clean later in the day, very difficult to find a decently clean one.

Text: I am enjoying this resort so far. The only thing missing is the ability to rent golf carts to peruse the grounds. I'm so glad we decided to stay at Harbortown. My kids are having a blast going from the clubhouse,  to the park, to the basketball court and back again ... I would definitely recommend  this RV Resort. The staff have also been very nice. The trains can be a pain when they go by but thats not enough to keep me away.
