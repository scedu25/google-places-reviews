Red Roof Inn Louisville Expo Airport
Rating: 2
Text: Very disappointed with our choice of this motel. Not much airport noise, but the air conditioner, other guests, and passers-by made up for it. We were awakened several times by arguments right outside our door. We never really felt safe here.

Inside the room wasn't any better.  The bed sagged in the middle.  The bathroom door had a crack in it as if someone had put a fist into it. I did have to kill an insect in the bed which was unexpected and disgusting! 

Breakfast was advertised but unless you wanted just coffee and donuts, you had to go across the lot to a Waffle House. All in all, sleeping in the car might have been a better choice.

Text: This hotel advertises 100% none smoking but I could smell strong smoke that they tried to mask with air freshener. One of my kids has asthma and was having a hard time. Luckily we only stayed for about 6hrs over night and left right in the morning.

The only reason I gave this rating 2 stars is because they had really comfy beds.

Text: Close to the highway. Waffle House is right in front of it, which is open 24/7. Rooms are nice and has two beds. The price for rooms aren't too expensive. Room service is great. Everything so far has been great.
