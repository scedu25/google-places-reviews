Wichita Suites Hotel
Rating: 3
Text: Literally just stayed here last night and it wasn't bad at all. My only complaint was the free "breakfast ". I was told that they start serving breakfast at 6:30am. Once we got downstairs for breakfast there were several trays out however only 2 of them actually had food in them.  When I asked the staff (who were friendly) if breakfast was already gone she replied "we only serve biscuits and gravy." Other than that the hotel was clean, quiet and the staff were very friendly. I'd say for the price it's not too shabby.

Text: Wichita Suites is closing the end of Oct 2017.  Reservations are still available we were told, although remodeling & construction is already going on. We were also told the location will become a Candlewood Suites the summer of 2018. Currently, our room is clean and comfortable as always BUT the Complimentary Breakfast and Happy Hour/snacks are NO LONGER available. Will miss Wichita Suites.

Text: Unfortunately closing late October, 2017 to become a Springfield. Hopefully, it'll be just as good. Never had a bad word to say about this hotel. Been using it for business trips for two years now and wouldn't think of another place in Wichita.

Text: The breakfast bar was amazing! Very nice selection of foods, served fresh and hot. The room was very comfortable, especially the bed! The only problem I would say, is that the whole hotel was rather warmer then I would prefer. Other than that great service!

Text: Extremely affordable! Has free breakfast, not the greatest but definitely better than nothing. Whenever I'm in Wichita again, would come back and stay here.
