Text: Staying here tonight to watch the eclipse tomorrow and this is a great place. The room is very clean and comfortable and I love that they let me bring my dog along to stay with us. Everyone is very nice and friendly and it has a nice family feel to the place. I've read other reviews that this place is closing down soon..I hope that this isn't true because I would love to stay here again

Text: We'll definitely be back! I will say the rooms are a bit dated but this in no way takes away from the experience. Everything was clean & quiet, the pool & rec room were wonderful. There is food & shopping within walking distance. I wish we could have stayed longer!

Text: This place was a breath of fresh air. Quiet guests and friendly staff. Originally had planned to stay at another establishment however after finding Id have to wait atleast 5 hours before checking in I found Golden Door would accept right then and there. Nice pool also! Planned on making this a common retreat but just read online its closing its doors soon. Very sad about that but wish the owners a happy retirement.
