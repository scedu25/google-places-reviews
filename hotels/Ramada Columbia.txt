Text: Clean hotel and was breakfast okay. Hot pulsing shower was very nice! The greatest experience we had was with the staff. They were very friendly.   We will stay here again.

Text: You will get a friendlier place to stay for the money.  Close to hwy 70 and a safe environment.  Exactly what you would expect 
from a mid class hotel but location puts it up a notch. Pet friendly rooms (for all you pet lovers) leave a smell that can't be washed off or disposed of.

Text: It was clean and everyone was nice. Had a pool and fitness room but both were small but clean and served it's purpose. Had B&G and Waffles for breakfast. They also let us keep our puppy.  It is right next to the highway so when you are at the pool you hear all the cars. Wal Mart is right down the road. I would stay here again.

Text: It was a very nice, clean room. The building was a little run down and the doors didn't fit right in their frames. The deadbolt on our door was broken slightly and when room service came at nine am, they broke it further by slamming the door open really hard. We also weren't aware of when checkout was because we weren't told by the front desk and we assumed it'd be at noon like most hotels (our mistake, it's actually at 11) but when the room service came back at 11 to clean, they were rather rude about us still being there even though we weren't aware when check out was. Admittedly we should've checked when check out was but the staff should've also handled it better than yelling through the door at us that "if we're leaving, we need to leave". Otherwise it was a good experience.
