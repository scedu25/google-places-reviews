Text: We used this gorgeous hotel as our wedding hotel. My bridesmaids and I stayed in a suite with 2 queen beds and a separate sitting room with pull out sofa the night before the wedding. The room was very spacious and had enough closet space for all 5 of our dresses. The beds were comfortable and clean. The breakfast in the morning was great and the view from the sitting area is beautiful. On our wedding day the staff went above and beyond to provide us with a great experience. i was able to leave room keys for my day of coordinator and my husband at the front desk so they had access to the suite. When my husband went to check in to our wedding night hotel they upgraded us to a presidential suite for free! The presidential suite was amazing and over the top for our special day. Thank you so much to all the staff on September 21, 2017 who helped us have a relaxing stay!

Text: This hotel is exceptionally well run. The hotel itself is kept in pristine condition, inn side and out. The staff is absolutely fantastic... to include everyone. The front desk are some of the most highly competent I've dealt with in guest services, and I do so often. Highly recommend this establishment for any size party and any occasion.

Text: I arrived to take a tour of the hotel. The staff was amazingly friendly. The lobby was packed with tables and felt crowded. The decor was dated. The rooms were very nice, and I loved that every room has a separate sitting area with big TV's in both areas.

Text: I didn't stay overnight, I was picking my daughter up from staying the night with out of town relatives. The lobby was gorgeous and clean. Behind the 2 sided fire place in the lobby was the dining area. Beautiful and comfortable feeling. Rooms were super nice. They stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. Chairs were comfortable. I didn't feel the beds so I cant comment on that. The towels were pretty rough. But I've never stayed at a hotel where they weren't.
