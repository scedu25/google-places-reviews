Text: Sad that you don't allow pets over 50 lbs. We are traveling next week and your hotel would have made for a great overnight stay. Sorry you lost my business.

Text: The room was great. The facility was good for a middle of nowhere hotel. However a few things were strange, like the fact you had to get a physical key (like a metal key) from the front desk to access the pool.

Text: A little hotel standing by itself. The room was nice and there's not really anything to complain about. We were a little paranoid about our car getting broke into due to the location though.
