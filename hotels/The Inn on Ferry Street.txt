Text: What a unique place! The inn is a collection of three beautiful, old houses right off of Woodward in midtown. The presentation of this place is very ornate and charming. Included with staying here is a shuttle with a 5 mile radius which will take you anywhere downtown and 24 hour pickup. This place is a must see with great charm and allows for great flexibility for where you want to go.

Text: Had a great stay at the inn. Classy old houses renovated to the old style but updated to a functional hotel. Clean, close to downtown amenities and friendly. Free parking and shuttle are a huge plus. Would have liked a fridge, but ice from the front desk in the sink worked for beer. Would stay again for sure.

Text: This place is amazing. The grounds are just beautiful,  a shuttle that takes you to anywhere you need within 5mi but everything is within those 5mi. Staff is amazing. Will definitely be returning in the future.
