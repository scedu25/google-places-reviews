Text: This used to be an Embassy Suites. It needs an update to furnishings and carpet and decor. Beds were comfortable, and it was quiet. Staff was helpful. Ok for business travel, but I would want a nicer place for the family.

Text: Very nice hotel, but a bit misleading. The gym and lap pool (there is another pool that's not a lap pool in the hotel) advertised is actually separate from the hotel. If planning on working out with anyone under 18, you'll have to go elsewhere as anyone under 18 is not allowed even with parental supervision. Other than that, great hotel! The rooms are very spacious and clean. Room service is also very fast and attentive. Overall, great hotel!

Text: We went in to meet with a banquet coordinator about using their banquet hall for a wedding reception. The banquet hall is across the street from the hotel, and in her e-mail we were told to meet her at the hotel, and we would shuttle over. When we arrived at the hotel, she was not there. She was at the banquet hall. Probably an honest mistake, but still annoying none the less. The coordinator was polite and answered all of our questions. The room looked like a cafeteria, and would take a lot of decorating to make it not look like that. But it does have a beautiful view. Overall, it was too pricey for our budget, but they were polite and helpful.
