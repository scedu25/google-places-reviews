Text: Bathroom clean, no hairs on the floor. Shower pressure is wonderful. The room size is great. Comfy beds, linens were clean. The complementary breakfast is unbelievable! I haven't been to a motel where they offered two hot breakfast options. I am very pleased with this stay. And I might add, our check in was smooth. We asked about things to do being a tourist and she was more than accommodating. I do recommend this motel especially if you stay in Galena Illinois.

Text: We had a wonderful stay. Our room was clean and it even smelled amazing. The continental breakfast was delicious. The man that check us in was very nice. And the ladies that checked us out was just as nice. We have already made plans to go back in December.

Text: Staff is awesome, very accommodating. Not a bad breakfast. Stayed in room with heart shaped Whirlpool tub and fireplace. Loved the small deck facing wooded area. Close to shopping and restaurants.

Text: This hotel has everything we wanted and we would love to come back sometime!  Pool was clean, towels provided, water warm.  I love going back and forth from the inside to the outside while in the pool.  BTW, it is SALT water, not chlorine!  Love that!  Room was very spacious and even has a balcony to sit outside.  Decor is lovely, I highly recommend.

Text: We stayed here 2 nights.  The hotel was very clean.  The rooms were decorated in log cabin style,  they were clean, and homey.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The breakfast was very good.  Different items each morning.  Rooms had a balcony, which was really nice.  The town of Galena was 1/2 to 1 mile from the hotel.  Very easy to get to.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.
