Text: I was actually disapointed at my stay here. We drove 7-8 hours from our trip to get sleep here at night. The room was simple and yes it was clean but we were put on first floor all the way on the back. The person on top of us was loudly stooping we couldn't really sleep and their was people coming in and out form the back door. All we keep hearing was the back door slamming from everyone constantly coming in and out. I honestly don't understand why because the front desk told us it would be lock at that time. For the amount of money we paid I expected so much better. ?

Text: I was fortunate to find this hotel after a long drive and two weeks on the road. Staff were pleasant and the room was one if the cleanest I've ever experienced. Pristene and nice amenities. The accommodations we're excellent.

Text: Beautiful room, comfortable beds, roomy bathroom /shower. The overnight desk clerk was kind and funny also, which always makes a stay better right from the beginning.

Text: This hotel was extremely clean and comfortable. The staff were kind and helpful when needed. I would not recommend staying here if you do not want to drive- I stayed here for a trip of Columbus wanting to avoid the city, but did not mind driving the 20 miles or so to do shopping and dining. If you do not want to drive that short distance, do not stay here. It is truly in the middle of no where, although there are fast food and gas options nearby if needed! The hotel overall was very clean and nice, I will stay here again if I am in need! Great quality overall.
