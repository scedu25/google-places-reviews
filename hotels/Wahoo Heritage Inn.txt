Text: My husband and I stay there every time we go to Wahoo to visit my grandma. I have to say that they're some of the sweetest people that work there. We have a service dog and they always make him feel welcome.

Text: Decent sized room. Comfortable bed with a TV. Has free WiFi. The continental breakfast wasn't anything to get excited for. If you are looking for an alright over stay then I would recommend this place. Nothing special, nothing terrible.

Text: It was 5 stars up until breakfast. The room was clean, the bed was super comfortable, and the room was priced Right. The TV is a bit low on the counter but didn't watch it much. Breakfast was bad. Not much selection and the OJ was sour.
