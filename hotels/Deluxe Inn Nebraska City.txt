Deluxe Inn Nebraska City
Rating: 1
Text: Room was clean but WAY over priced. NO coffee in room, no Kleenex ( I had a bad cold and used the toilet paper, roll was almost empty and no more in room ), breakfast wasn't until 7:00 AM, we didn't stay to see what it was, had to get on the road, very noisy room from roadway. Would recommend staying in car or another motel.

Text: Pros - Room had been updated and very clean.
Cons - no coffee in room and no breakfast in the lobby until 7 a.m.

Price is a little high but when you are desperate you can't be picky.
