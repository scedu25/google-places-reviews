Holiday Inn Express & Suites Emporia Northwest

Text: Definitely feels like a newer hotel with nice finishes for the price point. The staff has been pleasant, and the breakfast had good options. Is in a good part of town to have several restaurants to pick from. Is definitely a good value.

Text: Customer service is great.  Hotel is nice and very clean.  Only negative feedback,  I didn't get much sleep because the person next door snored so loud it was hard to get well rested.

Text: If I could take this hotel with me everywhere I go I would. Friendly staff, clean room, and the best bed I slept on in my three hotels I stayed in on my recent trip. Shower was great and I put a lot of emphasis on the firmness of a hotel bed because of my bad back. Gas and food choices abound in the area. Great place to stay!
