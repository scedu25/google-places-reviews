Text: If you can find nicer or more helpful personnel, I would have to meet them to believe it. Helped us get setup and connected. We needed to check out around 5 P.M. so I planned on paying for another night. He would only let us pay for the two nights we were there. VERY helpful. Great place. I highly recommend.

Text: Camp sites are way too small no laundry facility and even though there is a small playground...not a place for kids.  However if you are an on the road worker this place will do.
