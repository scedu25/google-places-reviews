Sycamore Valley Farm Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Tina and Matt were the best hosts we could have asked for! Everything was beautiful and well looked after. Breakfast was that wonderful hearty farm meal we expected, and to top it all off, they were the most welcoming and lovely people to talk to! This was honestly the most wonderful stay we could have asked for!

Text: My wife and I spent 4 days here for my 50 year High School Reunion and have had the Best Time along with my 3 sisters. We would highly recommend Sycamore Valley Farm Bed and Breakfast to anyone planning on visiting the area. Their daughter Kaitlyn has a sandwich and Old Time Soda shop on Main Street which is Fantastic. Wonderful people-food and very relaxing. Kenny @ Deloris Woodard- Cedar Lake, Indiana
