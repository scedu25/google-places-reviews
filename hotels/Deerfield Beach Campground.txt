Deerfield Beach Campground

Text: This is a very no frills basic stop over campground. The majority of sites are permanent residents and not all of them are very well kept. The road is rather rutted. The owners are not on site so it is self check in and leave your payment in the box provided. It was hard to determine where the sites were and to find one that didn't have things laying on the ground. It is super quiet and this was our place of one day rest in a week of overnighters so the quiet was appreciated. The site was pull through only because there was no one in the adjoining site. We were able to leave the car on the tow dolly. There is no grass, only weeds with lots of grasshoppers which was fun. There is a picnic table we could have pulled over but there was a very large animal trap on it so we didn't. We had full hook ups with 50 amp and good water pressure. Appears to be well water and the taste is bad, bring bottled water. No WiFi and Verizon signal good. We stayed two nights June 25-26, 2017 and paid $15 a night with our Passport America discount.
