Text: This hotel was really disgusting. I DO NOT recommend it. The bathroom had hair in it. There was liquid on the toilet. And the whole bathroom was disgusting. We felt so nasty that we went to another hotel to take another shower because it was so gross. I repeat I DO NOT recommend this hotel. And the room smelled horrible. And  after all that all they could do for us is give us $20 off our room.

Text: This hotel was very clean and the staff was exceptional.  Some areas of the hotel (ie the pool) were not available due to a recent tornado damaging the building and the repairs were still in process.  

We were in the hotel while attending a wedding and they accommodating when our group used common spaces to gather and visit during our stay.

Text: Excellent stay! Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean and very nicely decorated. We had our dog with us and the hotel grounds were so nice. We appreciated how nice the grassy area was and how well kept. I would recommend this hotel

Text: Great hotel in west central Kansas when traveling I-70.  Easy access from highway with excellent parking space with easy access.  Good breakfast with fair seating space.  Quiet night's rest.  Small fitness room, but quality equipment.
