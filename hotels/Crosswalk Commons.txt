Text: Best place to live near the north part of Purdue campus! I love the free van best, to Walmart everyweek, and to Chinese store every two weeks! Furnitures are new. Staff are friendly and helpful, welcome to international students especially! If you are a first year international student, you will find Crosswalk a perfect place to start a new campus life!
