Text: Great hotel. The staff is extremely friendly. The breakfast was wonderful. The only recommendation that I could make is to have salsa. Other than that one small thing, it was a great stay.

Text: Room was great, clean and comfortable. Amenities throughout were up to date and well maintained. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Only drawback was no microwave in room. We have a child with special dietary needs and a microwave would've been helpful. Fortunately, staff was great about letting us use microwave in the pantry.

Text: Very friendly and engaging staff. Very cool remodel to look lodge-like. Rooms clean and nice decor. Taxes and fees are brutal but guessing that's beyond the hotel's control. Breakfast nice but typical microwaved eggs.
