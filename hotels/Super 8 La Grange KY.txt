Super 8 La Grange KY

Text: First of all, they double booked us. I requested to add one more night in the same room. They added a different room for two nights during the same time. They then made us run around on the phone for nearly 4 hours attempting to resolve the issue. They were continually rude and understood little English. Upon checking in, the situation had still not been resolved. The desk clerk told us she would fix the issue and I would pay when I left. The manager called multiple times to the room, had housekeeping harass us, and eventually came pounding on the door the next  day because the situation in fact was not resolved. He then attempted to charge me over $20 over what I had already paid for the previous night, which was booked at the same time. The last day, the manager and housekeeping repeatedly banged on our door from 930am until checkout at 11am. 

In addition, there were three large stains on our mattress, the room was filthy, and when we told them our toilet was clogged, they simply sent a plunger up the elevator to us to fix ourselves. However, there are no refunds. I strongly suggest paying the extra $10 to book somewhere else.

Text: Great rooms and staff. BAD information on website says RV & large vehicle parking. NONE AT ALL. Had to back into busy cross traffic to get out.
