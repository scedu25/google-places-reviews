Text: My buddies and I have travelled 28 states over the years on our Harley vacations. Have stayed in all kinds of motels. This Super 8 is the best kept Super 8 I have experienced. Great staff as well. If ever in the area again I will stay here.

Text: Overpriced.  I have spent thousands at this place and they would not refund my room after literally making the reservation.  Manager is completely rude and unreasonable.  Will not be staying here again.

Text: Basic hotel. Owners constantly complain about everything. Not worth the drama.
