Text: This place is a joke. They have people that poop in the showers. Arcade room is nasty. There are things everywhere. People are to clean up the dog poop. But don't your dog can poop right next to someones tent. Management is a joke, rude and will talk down to you. You have a couple of nice people here but over all if you don't deal drugs DON'T STAY HERE.

Text: This is just far enough outside of the city it is still very peaceful day and night.  Even right next to the highway, the traffic noise dies down around 10pm, and its so quiet at night, really feels like youre in the country.  I can hear the waterfalls running from over 100 yards away with my 5th wheel windows open.  The onsite manager is above and beyond helpful.  He is honest & trustworthy.

Text: Needed a plan B place to spend the night. This is by far the worst campground I have ever seen. Roads bad, all permanent residents packed in like sardines. There was 1 possible spot to camp, but we opted to drive an additional hour, in the dark someplace else.  Terrible campground.

Text: The owner of the  campground  needs to  step up and take notice of the  the problems there and do  things like updating electric  sewer and roads along with the overall appearance  this use to be a really nice place until it was sold by previous  owner  the pictures  are old and the property  does not look anything like it use to
