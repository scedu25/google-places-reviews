Scottish Bed & Breakfast

Text: Staying here was like staying with a relative.  We were asked what we would like for breakfast and if 9 am was ok.  The attention to detail in the room is beyond belief.  We had an electric fireplace which felt so lovely on a cold night.  I look forward to staying here again.
