Text: For a quick cheap room it's fine. But when I checked in I didn't have towels in the room, and there was hair on the bathroom floor. On a plus note they do use good laundry soap because I have sensitive skin and I didn't break out. Over all the room was fairly clean. Although the room was somewhat stuffy, nothing that cranking the A/C didn't fix. I'm not a super picky person so it was fair over all. The manager gave me a good deal

Text: This is a cheap and run down hotel that is close to all the major fast food joints and is fairly cheap considering a view from the outside looking at the place of business.

Text: The service seemed good at first. They were nice. But then they got confused with the priceline payment system. Which is there deal, not the costumer's. But they wanted us to deal with it anyway. Then, we got into the room and it was so hot in there. The a/c took a good couple of hours to take effect. The rest of the night went smoothly. Then, when we were getting ready for the day at 9 am, the cleaning lady just walks right in unannounced. Check out was at 11 am. Very bizarre. She walked out without apologizing. Overall bad experience.
