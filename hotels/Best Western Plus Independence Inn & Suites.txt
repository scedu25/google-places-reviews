Best Western Plus Independence Inn & Suites

Text: I really enjoyed my stay. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. There was plenty of room for my family and all of our stuff. We even had a concern and the front desk attendant was right up to help with it immediately. I wasn't impressed with the breakfast, but to be fair, I never really am. Overall, I was really happy with the stay.

Text: Love the property! It's beautiful! Rooms were decent. Need some cosmetic work as there was holes in the bathroom (not a big deal). Water pressure in 2 different rooms we stayed in were not good. The pool was not heated but we are from the south so maybe it was just us? My girls are 5,3, and 1 and couldn't swim long because it was too cold. But our overall stay was nice!

Text: Best one could hope for in farm country.  Quite clean soft comfortable beds.  Tubs are a little small but the pools not bad.

Text: Hotel was under construction, which could have been okay but it continued later in the night then it should have and started early. Also, asked for a late check out, was told 1pm (we could tell there was almost no one else staying at the hotel) but at noon a lady from room service walked right in despite the sign saying not to disturb, and we got a call from the front desk confirming we asked for a late check out but basically we needed to leave... Very disappointed. Also, internet didn't work, and the breakfast was not great.
