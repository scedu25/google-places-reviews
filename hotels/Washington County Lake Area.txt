Text: Beautiful country lake and location, quiet, pretty, lots of good views and wildlife, as well as good opportunities for camping, fishing and any other outdoor pursuits. Not too bad a haul from St. Louis, without the crowds of other similar spots in southern Illinois. Staff is friendly and works hard, but state cuts have hit them hard and I always worry about the future of this very nice retreat from the day-to-day world. Visit, take a walk, a run, a bike or a boat. Have fun!

Text: We rented a cabin for 2 nights. It was right on the water. Only 2 cabins on site but they are nice. Cabins include 5 beds, air-conditioning, heat, power hookup, and table and chairs. Fire pit, grill, porch, picnic tables, and plenty of parking. Water,restroom, showers on site but not in the cabin. It wasn't a problem for us. Especially at $45 a night. You can't beat it. We will be back!!

Text: Great state park for tent camping.  Some nice spots right on the lake all with fire pits and tables.  It is a small lake and much more quiet than some of the larger lakes nearby.  There are boats to rent, a decent little bait shop and lots of places to picnic.  Well maintained and mowed nicely.   10HP limit on lake and no swimming, just fishing. 
I like to do a little cyclo-camping here.  Not as flashy as the big lakes but a nice quiet get a way.
