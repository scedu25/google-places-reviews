Text: We have not stayed here yet (I can update about the stay once our reservation comes up) but I just finished booking a room with Jessica who was SO nice to work with that I wanted to make sure she got the recognition she deserved. She was very pleasant on the phone and quickly helped us book the correct room for us. I was a bit of a difficult customer but she was able to work with us to get a different room than the ones that were reserved in a block (2 queens were reserved and I wanted to see about changing to a king). Then when I got the confirmation email and had questions about the rate change for the different days she worked with us to get a slightly different rate. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the booking process. She made it very pleasant and was incredibly nice and caring making sure we were satisfied with our reservation. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because we have not actually stayed at the hotel yet. Thank you again Jessica for making the booking process an extremely pleasant one!

Text: This holiday in location it very convenient being just off the freeway. There is plenty of nearby entertainment as well. The rooms had quite a northern European feel. They were quite clean. Booking the rooms was a bit stressful. We booked 3 rooms. The online price was about 20% less than booking in person. Even over the phone the rates were different. I would have a bit if you decide to stay.

Text: There is a pool and small fitness area. It's about 10 miles from the city center, but in good proximity to an outdoor mall. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Nothing fancy, but affordable and just what we were looking for.
