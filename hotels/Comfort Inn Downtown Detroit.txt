Comfort Inn Downtown Detroit

Text: Breakfast offers quite a bit of food. Front desk is very nice and offers to help with a lot like taxis and bus service. Room was really nice. Only downfall, the room was next to the elevator so we could hear it closing all night.

Text: Staff was very helpful and courteous.  Dirty cleaning cloth left on the floor made us suspicious about how clean everything was. The Jacuzzi tub didn't work properly, sprayed water straight up. Not much of a view but we didn't expect one. Continental breakfast was good enough for us. It was a mile and a half from Comerica. So it's walkable. I'm glad we walked during the day and not at night though. May not have felt safe.

Text: I've satyed here probably ten times over the past ten years. This hotel recently went through a total renovation and the quality has improved ten fold. It is well worth the affordable price now

Text: Nicely renovated, but loses its status as one of the best places on a budget due to the price hike after the changeover from Regency to Comfort Inn.
