Text: Love this Motel 6. Check in both times late at night. Night clerk friendly, polite and considerate. Inexpensive and clean.  AND my furrie pommy always welcome, no hassle, no extra pet fee.

Text: Nice place... I was greeted as soon as I entered the lobby and was called 10 minutes after I got in to my room.  I don't get this service for $150 a night, let alone at Motel 6's I've stayed at... This will be where I stay in Iowa from now on.

Text: The outlet by my sink did not work.  They did not clean my room on Saturday so I did not have a clean washcloth to wash my face on Sunday.  It was a clean enough room and quiet enough to meet my needs.  The shades were got the room dark enough to sleep alright.

Text: Although the staff was very friendly, the room was filthy.  The floors were dirty, the entrance door looked like it had been banged in, paint was half on. The bathroom door wouldn't shut.  Bathroom floors had dirt all over them also.  We arrived very late and it didn't feel safe so I couldn't sleep well.  Also worried about bugs on beds due to dirt on floors.  
I work at a great, well kept Motel 6 and know this is not acceptable for a Motel 6.  With the simplicity of the rooms you'd think they could easily keep them very clean and kept up.
