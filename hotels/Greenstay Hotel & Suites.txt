Text: Awful awful awful!! I booked the room at $66.00 per night per room. When I arrived they made me pay $100.00 per room for one night for two rooms! I showed her where I got the rate! She told me to check in and she would look in to it. I came back when she told me to and she would not give me the rate I booked at. I told her I wanted to cancel my room and she wouldn't do it because I had already payed. She in no way wanted to make it right! Horrible management! Do not support crooked management!!

Text: This hotel is great!!  It was well maintained and the owners were doing upgrades to it when we were there.  The room was spotless and the pool was nice.  After we checked in, the lady at the front desk called our room to make sure everything was OK with our room and wondered if we needed anything.  The breakfast was a nice surprise and it was very convenient as it sits on Route 66.

Text: Nice clean environmentally conscious budget motel. Clean room, comfortable bed, nice shower and an animal on each room number. Solid basic breakfast with hot and cold options. Nice staff. I'd definitely stay here again.

Text: This hotel was very nice for the price. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the staff were helpful. The only negative thing that I would have to say would be that it wasn't a super quiet hotel. We could pretty much hear anything that was happening in the parking lot.

There is a heated indoor pool and a complimentary hot breakfast in the morning until 10 a.m. Also, random but notable, the water pressure in the shower was awesome.

Text: The hotel was amazing. The room was so clean i didn't want to mess it up. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. They really catered to their guests. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who's staying in the St. James area!
