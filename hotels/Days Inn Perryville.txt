Days Inn Perryville

Text: We stayed there for 3 day's for our son's wedding. Our room had dirty towels still laying on the floor in the shower area. Had no coffee pot, out of 8 outlets only 1 worked. Had 1 set of complete towels.
The ironing board cover was so dirty and nasty, we couldn't even press any wrinkles out of my husband's shirt for the wedding. Their breakfast bar, no coffee and very little type's of breakfast food. Won't ever stay there again, on our next visit to Ste. Genevieve area.

Text: Nice room, clean, front desk staff very friendly. Pool was nice too. Feels like a secluded getaway on top of a hill with not much around.

Text: One place you must visit while in Savannah. The docent was great, she had many facts and stories about the residents and the house.

Text: The service agent by the desk, was nice enough to let us choose our rooms. She was very nice. Only downside was the location and construction going on next to the hotel.
