Text: The location was great right off the interstate. The service was bulls**t the key to are door stopped work both nights so we had to wait for someone to come let us in when they could. The first night are room was gross we found someone else's blood on the bathroom wall and shower curtain. Then gave us a different shower curtain ( that they made us change or they said we would have to wait until morning). Then the day we left as we were walking down the hall we see cockroaches climbing the walls. We will never stay there again and if people ask if they should stay there I will tell them hell no.

Text: The hotel was clean and we'll kept. But when I'd asked on the phone for a room on the first floor they apparently didn't hear that. Or the request for a room that was handicap accessible. But we did get a good rate on a suite that worked (last room available on the first floor). The shower was nice, until the hairball in the drain floated up to say "hi". Breakfast in the morning was good and the area was kept clean. Staff was friendly. 5he beds were comfy.

Text: Pleasantly surprised.  We have been stopping here for several years after a trip up to MT. The last time we stayed, it was dirty and not very pleasant. We almost decided not to stay here this year, but I'm glad we changed our minds. The room we are in tonight is beautifully appointed,  clean, smells nice, and an overall pleasant experience.
