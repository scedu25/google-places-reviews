Text: Great experience!   Attended wedding rehearsal dinner-reception-morning gift opening for 2 night stay. Staff was all accommodating in everything we needed even with last minute additions. Guest room was pet friendly and really clean. Will return if need arises and recommend.

Text: By far my favorite hotel I've ever stayed in! We had the king suite and it was well worth the $! Bed was super comfortable, room was clean and the jacuzzi was awesome! I was excited to see they had a pool table too. Hot buffet breakfast was really good too! The staff was incredibly kind and went out of their way to be helpful! I wish I had caught their names lol I think the only thing I can say that wasn't 5 stars was room service we ordered from the restaurant. They screwed up our order and both orders of fries were soggy but besides that we will definitely be back!!

Text: We go there about once a month for their fish fry, the fish (cod) is always really good and the dill sauce is excellent. The fries are always piping-hot and the wait staff is courteous as well. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because sometimes it takes a lot longer to get refills on the food. I understand if it takes longer when they are really busy but it's not always the case.

Text: Good handicap ability . Clean rooms. Nice staff. We would stay again and recommend it to travelers. We booked based on reviews. Indoor pool was great . We did change rooms when we arrived to ensure we had handicap bars in the bathroom. We went from a king room to a queen. The bed seemed like a double. It was comfortable but small. I would definitely recommend this hotel
