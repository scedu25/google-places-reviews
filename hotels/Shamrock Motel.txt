Text: Owner was very very nice. Talked for a little bit and he had just bought the old motel and is in the process of remodeling so it isn't perfect but you can definitely tell they are trying to make it a nice place. The room we had was very clean, it had new furniture, brand new bedding, and brand new carpet. It did have a scent, but after the AC was on for a few minutes it was gone. Outside the flower beds were empty, but obviously in the process of being filled. New asphalt seal on the parking lot. More small things that the average person might not see. But it is definitely an old place. Only thing that was a bummer for us was it didn't have a coffee pot which isn't a necessity, but we asked and he said it's on his list of things to do. We were happy with our stay here and will be back!

Text: Bedbugs found, told owner who said he had a room that had just been cleaned and sprayed for the bugs and also had new mattress and box springs. This room was also infested. Nice owner but he needs to spend the money to get rid of the bugs. I won't be back.
