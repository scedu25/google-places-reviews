Mill Street Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Mill Street Inn is like 4 small apartments that can used by 4 separate guests or 1 house for an entire family. It's extremely clean, warm, and the stable room underneath is perfect for unwinding by yourself or hosting a small gathering. Should your travels bring you to north central KS, this a great place to stay.
