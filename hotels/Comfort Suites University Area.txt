Text: At 3:30am on 9-17-17, Timothy, at the front desk, was wonderful. We had to travel farther than expected, so it had been a long day for us. Timothy was wide awake, ready to do his job and very pleasant. Thank you Timothy, for making 2 very tired people feel welcomed.  Marsha Schrader

Text: During my stay at this hotel there was a power outage that lasted several hours.  I am a female that was traveling alone for work and felt this could have been a very scary situation for me.  The staff at this hotel did a remarkable job making sure all the guests were safe.   They walked the hallways with flashlights the whole time the power was out.  They remained calm and did not become short with guests when we were asking questions. They had a smile on their face the whole time.  They also bought us all pizza!!  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
