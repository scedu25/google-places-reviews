Staybridge Suites South Bend-University Area

Text: This staff should seriously give lessons to every other hotel on how to convey warmth to customers. My husband and I were amazed at how friendly and considerate everyone was. The meals were prepped in advance, there was a ton of options to choose from for their social hour and for breakfast. Everything was perfect, down to the smell of the lobby (pumpkin spice). Seriously, this is one of the most thoughtful places I have ever been to.

Text: Very nice and clean hotel. Was welcomed with dinner and a drink and they have a nice movie room with a big screen, that's a first. Rooms were very clean and the staff was great. Would stay again.

Text: Love their hot breakfast!!! 
Wish it started at 6am instead of 6:30am but definitely one of my favorites. 
Friendly staff and safe environment.
