AmericInn Hotel & Suites Webster City
Rating: 3
Text: Spent two nights in an upgraded room, as we're frequent visitors in Webster City. The suited was at the top of the stairs. Nice, large room. Too bad it's right above the lobby and the associated noise. Neighboring room came in about midnight, complete with at least five loud trips back and forth to the parking lot with doors slamming along the way. 6am rolls around and the free breakfast is bring prepared. Complete with slamming cabinet doors by an employee and dragging chairs by guests. The breakfast itself, while free, was underwhelming and borderline unsanitary. The sausage gravy, for biscuits and gravy, was in a large bowl, covered by a paper plate to keep it warm... Not in the hot plate as it has been during past visits. The one ice machine for guests was also in need of repair. No ice during the three days/two nights of our visit. Same issues both nights/mornings.

Text: Good clean spacious rooms. Small town feel. Super nice receptionists. Decent breakfasts. Some flies in the morning but I think that's a general problem for the area. Overall would recommend staying if in this town.
