Text: There dogs ran freely and kept getting in the food.  They are not connected to any of the rivers.  Their showers and bathrooms were great compared to others.

Text: The owners are super nice, friendly and helpful. The camp sites are a little tight if you have a large rig and the roads are pretty rough, but for smaller rigs and tent camping or renting a cabin, it's definitely the place to go in Eminence.
