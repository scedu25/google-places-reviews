Text: Nice place with great staff! Close to lots of family fun. Exactly what I had hoped to see and find. Science with the geology of Bluesprings Caverns and the area then history with Pioneer Village in Spring Mill State Park is perfect for us. Area also has hiking and nice pool. Couldn't ask for better!
