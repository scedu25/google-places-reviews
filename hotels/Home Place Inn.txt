Text: personally they dont deserve 1 star zero is more like it. They denied me and my service dog access. without documentation. By federal law you can NOT ask for documentation of any kind its ILLEGAL  the manager was rude and now both manager and owner could face huge  fines and possible prison time. this place is not worth staying at they are filthy and nasty unprofessional people they will argue with you my advice is to stay away from them
