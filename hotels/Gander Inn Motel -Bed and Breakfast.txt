Gander Inn Motel -Bed and Breakfast

Text: Absolutely phenomenal experience! Dave and Trish were helpful and kind every step of the way! We hosted an anniversary party there so had to set up tables and get everything prepared, Dave was more than happy to pitch in. They went above and beyond all expectations in every way possible. We are definitely planning on going back and highly recommend this place to any one else finding themselves in the area!

Text: Charming, homey, comfortable, generous. We intended to stay one night and ended up staying three.

Perfect respite with access to a patio, tree swing, community pool, park and lake.

Loved our stay and enjoyed visiting with owner, Trish.

Text: Very nice for the price, came for a Convention, I don't think they were ready for a big crowd. No breakfast at a bed and breakfast motel was a little concerning. Our next door neighbor's fridge was taken from room while we were gone. But other than that it is very nice and very beautiful place
