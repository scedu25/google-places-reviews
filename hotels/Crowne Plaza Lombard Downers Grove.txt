Text: Old hotel that is nicely remodeled to look very modern. Clean, spacious rooms and bathrooms. Rain showers are amazing. Second shift gentleman on Oct 14 was friendly and provided excellent service (can’t remember name). Best Hotel in Lombard/Downers Grove area! Stop looking around and stay here! You won’t be disappointed by their excellent service and cleanliness.
