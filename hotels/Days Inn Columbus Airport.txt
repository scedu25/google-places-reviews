Text: Found bed bugs in bed. I told front desk and brought them live ones from that room to show as proof. They gave me a different room and plastic bags to put our belongings in(Luggage.Coats ) to contain any bed bugs that found there way in our stuff. That new room seemed okay but we didn't sleep comfortably because of incident.  It was Sunday so head manager was not it. I will call Monday to see if they will refund me my money. Basically left to fend for ourselves. Arrived home, put bags with our stuff in garage to clean and inspect next day.  Lesson Learned.  When going to hotel next time before settling in inspect mattress under sheets, Look for bed bug stains on sheets and cushions. Bring bed bug spray to spray on luggage and perimeter of bed. There is no guarantee but you are doing all you can. Also bring in only what you need into room. Leave everything else in car trunk. I realize this can happen at any hotel, I wish that hotels would teach cleaning staff what to look for when making beds . Also , putting bed bug detection traps behind headboard on floor and housekeeping once a week check traps. Hopefully, there is a hotel manager out there who is reading this and will implement a better bug prevention program.

Text: The hotel itself looks a little dated on the outside but the lobby itself is fairly nice. The rooms were clean and had the usual (TV, AC, etc.) The bathroom was fairly big for the price we payed for the night and the beds we're fairly comfortable. Has an indoor pool and hot tub. Obviously, it's not a resort or anything like that. You're in Columbus, not Colorado. But if it's a roof you need over your head, close to the airport and downtown Columbus, I'd recommend this hotel for you.

Text: I've stayed here a few times and it's always been a pretty good experience. The staff has never been particularly friendly but I am staying there for convenience, not for pleasure. The free shuttle to/from the airport and free parking while you're gone is wonderful. They schedule your pickup when you check in and the ride to the airport is less than 5 minutes. Very reasonable for the price. I would recommend.

Text: Very seedy hotel. I was as far as it was possible to be from the front desk, in Building "C" at the far, far, far end of the long, dark hallway. My room was like some bizarre, dystopian dream. Nothing really matched. The wallpaper had been hung at random, and overlapped. (No effort had been made to install it properly.) There was dried vomit on the floor of the elevator, and holes punched in the walls. The drapes over the windows in the main hallway had half-collapsed and were hanging drunkenly. The towels were probably bought from a prison supply company - tiny and very coarse. It was so bad that I had to laugh. For $20 more, I could have stayed at the Hampton Inn.

Plus I had terrible, heart-pounding nightmares toward dawn. This place would have been a great set for a horror movie. I think it might be haunted.

The only upside was that the staff was nice.

Text: Great hotel for the price and close to the airport. They were busy when checking in, but the staff was still very nice and accommodating. The breakfast could be improved as it is simple cereal and toast. We will stay here again if in the Columbus area.
