Baltzell Motel
Rating: 5
Text: This is a newly renovated motel. The rooms are filled with every thing you could possibly want.  Kitchenette with microwave, stove burner, sink with disposal, 2 cabinets on the wall and under sink. Tiled walk in shower with a large fountain showerhead. Great water pressure.  Vanity area is separate from bath area. Refrigerator with freezer,  coffee pot, large dresser, large desk with chair and lamp, phone, very comfy chair and foot stool, and a bedside table on both sides.  The bed is very comfy and has a ton of pillows. Bedding is really pretty...not the normal hotel stuff. And a huge 55"flat screen tv with HBO. Carpet is new. Rate is very reasonable for all you get. Definitely will come back.

Text: This motel was the nicest motel I have ever stayed at. The finishings were beyond belief. The Temper-Pedic bed put my Sleep-Number to shame. It far exceeds a Hilton or Sheraton. The low cost rate was hard to believe for the high quality of this independent family-owned business. On a rate of 1 to 10, I would give it 100!.

Text: It was a decent stay for the money... The rooms were decent... Beds were super comfortable just felt since I have done the job myself that the housekeeping was a little disappointing  but all pretty minor things... All in all a decent stay

Text: I'm in a hotel/motel more nights than I'm home. The Baltzell Lodge is an absolute find. Completely renovated. I'll just go down the list, 55" 4K TV, Tempurpedic beds, kitchenettes in most rooms, fully tiled walk in shower, large desk with chair, recliner with ottoman, vanity area with sink. fridge with separate up top freezer so your drinks aren't accidently frozen in the morning, microwave. Free FAST Wi-Fi that is keeping up flawless with a game I play that demands it. Great bar and grill next door. If this was your guest bedroom at your home, you'd have to argue to keep your family from trying to constantly visit. Here's the kicker. All this for around $50. If you are in Great Bend and stay anywhere else, you missed out.
