La Quinta Inn & Suites Rockford
Rating: 5
Text: I frequently travel to Rockford on business, and this hotel never disappoints me. Why do I love LA QUINTA? #1 on my list is SAFETY & SECURITY and this hotel scores a 5. #2. AFFORDABILITY-As a small business owner I appreciate the fair pricing. #3.) VIRTUAL OFFICE- I’m able to use the printer, send faxes, and even borrow white out! Not needing to drive to a printing center increases my productivity & lowers my expenses. #4. NO PET DANDER! I’ve stayed at hotels that appear to be clean, but as soon as I laid on the linen my allergies would flare up. This is the only hotel in Rockford that I’ve found that doesn’t have pet dander lingering in the linen or rooms (at least not on the 3rd floor). #5. The beds are comfortable after a long day of driving and selling. This is the only place that I will stay while in the Rockford area.

Text: It seemed nice in lobby. Clean and updated. Walking  to the room the carpets are stained and worn. There's a smell. Once in room it's pretty nice but bathroom doesnt seem like it was cleaned good. The pool has bugs floating n water isn't clean. No hot tub.  Wash machine is broken and told the hotel they owed us 1.50.front desk guy at night is rude and didn't want to bother with us. Rude. There are dogs barking and keeping us awake. I will deal with manager tomorrow and update.

Text: Breakfast was good. Beds comfortable. Room was just big enough for my wife & I and the 4 teenagers. Would recommend.

Text: For the price, it's certainly not a bad place to stay. I tend to shop for slightly nicer places, but it served the purpose. No room service which was a bummer.
