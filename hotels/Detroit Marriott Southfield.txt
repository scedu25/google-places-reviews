Text: Great place to stay for business/conference travelers or family vacation. Good customer service. The bed's and extra long pillows are incredible. Really enjoyed my stay. Coming back soon.

Text: On the lower end of the Marriott range in terms of quality and hard goods, but standard is still definitely there. Room is clean enough but definitely looking aged. Staffs are attentive and courteous, but nothing above and beyond what is to be expected as the minimum requirement of the chain. WiFi is fast, certainly enough to stream 1080p live.

Text: The pool was over-chlorinated, and the pool deck was too slippery with no non-slip surface. The room was beautiful and comfortable and had everything I needed. Staff was helpful and breakfast was great.

Text: Concierge is extremely helpful. Rooms are fairly modem. No in room safe. There are some nice finishing touches(coffee cabinet), but also room for improvement (loose fitting GFCI receptacle, finish worn off bathroom handle, dirty air conditioner filter). The in house restaurant has nice food, morning buffet has a moderate selection, warm eggs. There is a pool it closes at 11, I didn't use it.

Text: Worst Marriott in the US. Newly remodeled rooms are a throwback to early Motel 6. All cheap vinyl floors in rooms (no carpet anywhere). No drawers to put your clothes in. No towel bars to hang your 2 wet towels on and those are the new rooms. To top it off Rodney the General Manager says they are going to make all Marriott's this cheesy. Just horrible. Front desk staff is really indifferent to your needs. Put us in a handicap room and didn't even ask. Cared less. Free is too much for this loser.
