Text: Clean sheets but no hot water from the bathroom sink. The rate was great and staff better. If the 3 star seems rough it is not meant to be.

Text: A little dusty and the beds were a bit unbalanced, but it was nice and warm. The wifi is good but you have to ask after it,it's not listed anywhere.

Text: It is a older hotel, but clean.  Older gentleman, who I think is the owner, is very helpful.  I needed some insight on the best places to dock my boat.  I love to fish and this is the best place for your money to be.  Easy in/out parking for my boat.  I will stay here again
