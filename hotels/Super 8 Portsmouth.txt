Text: The review from Elijah Allen said it best. If its late and you have no place else to stay it will serve its purpose but if you have other options then I would suggest you stick with them first. room does appear to be clean but if you look closer then you'll notice the bedding hasn't been replaced since the last few guess. Also I agree that this place definitely has a shady aspect to it and don't leave any valuables in your car if you can avoid it.

Text: Nice hotel and very clean. Some of the minors issues were two of the lights in the room were out and the light in the shower area was very dim, like taking a shower in the dark. The commode wouldn't flush as well..smh overall, it was okay.

Text: We called a week ahead and reserved a room for my sister's 18th birthday. They told us we had the pool to ourselves from 5-7. At 6, they began letting everyone in anyway. They never communicated with us, we had to ask what was even happening. The staff was nice, but the pool maintenance man thinks 80 degrees in a hot tub is 104. The pool water pours into the hot tub, constantly cooling the water. Just take a hot bath and stay home.

Text: Parking is a little weird. But the rooms seem clean and tidy. I haven't had much interaction with the staff but they seem nice.
