Text: Country Inn is a nice place! Right near the freeway. They have an assortment of rooms, excellent selection at free continental breakfast. I stayed here for a week with no complaints.

Text: Stayed one night after a late Spartan game. The front staff was nice and we didn't stay for breakfast. We had a Jacuzzi room and even though we didn't use it, the room felt damp and humid. The toilet hadn't been cleaned in a while because there was hard water stains and grime around the top of the bowl. There weren't any great soaps or shampoos but it was nice to have a small fridge in the room.

Text: Wow, aweful, yes it's really that bad. The rooms are large with almost no lighting, the walls are paper thin and your neighbors conversation can be heard word for word. The tubs are stained black on the bottom and there was a bonus spider in ours. Breakfast was nice, the coffee was good, but the staff didn't seem to care much about the condition of the facility. The manager was completely unsurprised that I wanted to cancel the remainder of the reservation. He did not even ask why.

Text: The staff was very Friendly and the rooms were quite large. But they could do better with the TV, and I would recommend this for anyone who is traveling with a family. But if u have a large group(20+) the bacon and eggs will have to be replaced quite often
