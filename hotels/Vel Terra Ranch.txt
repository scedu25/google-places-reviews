Vel Terra Ranch

Text: We spent some time at the ranch to get out of Chicago for the weekend and had a great time.  Sharon was a welcoming host and the other campers were kind and helpful.  The property is impeccably kept, and the coin-op showers were wonderful.  There was a little more road noise than anticipated (jake braking), but getting away from the light pollution and remembering what it's like to just gaze into the stars was magical.  We will be back!

Text: Loved this place & highly recommend it! Very quiet, clean, well kept campground. Other campers were nice, helpful & respectful with no riff raff. I looked at several campgrounds in the area & kept coming back to this one & glad we chose it. It had everything I was looking for..smaller location with showers where the owners are on site & that was just a short drive from the Galena area. Looking forward to returning here!
