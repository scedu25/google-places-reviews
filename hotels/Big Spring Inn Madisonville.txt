Text: Staff was friendly. Room was roomy and clean. Comfortable. Beds set very high. If I was much shorter I wouldn't have been able to get into mine.
Definitely a no-frills motel. No pool. Continental breakfast was 2 kinds of cereal, 2 kinds of rolls, and coffee, no bread, toaster,  juice, etc.

Text: Currently staying here while working locally for the week. The hotel is great, clean, and very affordable. The owners are very kind and attentive, and I saw them cleaning rooms at 7 this morning, that says a lot about their commitment to their business.

Text: These renovated rooms are the best bang for the buck I've stayed at in a very long time. Exceptionally nice & clean for the money!

Text: They have bed bugs. I was in town to visit family. The Baymont where I usually stay was booked. I read the reviews to this hotel and thought i had found a great deal since their rooms were newly remodeled. Until i woke up the next morning covered head to toe in bed bug bites. I'm horrified. Do NOT stay here!
