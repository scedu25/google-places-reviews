Text: Celebrated a wedding here and spent the night! Great room and fantastic shower although the hot water kept going out. They helped make the special day fantastic! I would definitely stay again.

Text: I enjoyed our stay here. My wife and I came here with our 3 dogs. The rooms were clean and the first floor rooms have access to a nice courtyard. There is also a nice little park across the road.

Text: It's a nice hotel.  It's on the expensive side, and I had to call the front desk because people were partying hard in the middle of the night.  You can't beat the location -- within walking distance of everything.

Text: The service at Cutler's is always slow. The food is ok, but overpriced. Have had to send food back to the kitchen there before for various issues.

Text: Service was good though I'm not sure I would describe the experience as exceptional since I don't recall any specific things that caught my attention as being "wow".
