Text: They need to enforce rules when it comes to children being unsupervised. Lot rent is super high. Need to get on the problems that they are notified by current paying renters who are not ever late or behind on rent. The staff in office well some are cool others well they think they are above and better then the rest...

Text: This place is okay. There is a lot of drama that goes on around here. Lot rent goes up every year, it's ridiculous.

Text: Been spiffed up this year.  Too many restrictions, not enough extra parking for visitors, no parking in streets or grass.  Each street should have a parking area that is paved.  Welcome Center finally improved but you can't rent it nor enough space left for tables after new furniture brought in. I hear new rules for renting in 2017.
They did help us when a family emergency happened earlier and did not tow anyone helping.
