Text: We checked in really early in the morning, checking out in just a few hours. Stayed long enough to get a few hours sleep and take a shower. The gentleman working gave us a deal on 2 rooms (yay!). Both rooms were spotless and the beds were extremely comfortable. Would recommend this motel to anyone looking! Thanks again!

Text: Staff was nice and I slept well here. Nice place if you are there to fish Kentucky Lake. Can plug boat in to charge overnight. Cannot beat this place for the price.

Text: Pros: They let us check in 1 hour early. The bed sheets ate clean and white. They have a big enough size flat screen in the room along with little microwave and little fridge. 
Clean swimming pool (the water is clean). Walking distance from a gas station and restaurant. 

Cons: big spot in the wall that needs to be finished painting. The bottom of the bed mattress needs to be cleaned, it was white stuff on it. House keeper didnt look behind dresser or under end table it has hangers and used lotion under and behind them. The floor in the bathroom needs to be grated it feels nasty and needs to be cleaned. Used roll of toilet paper left. No information book in room and they do not have one when I called. 
Pool needs to be managed better. Little boy around 7 years old swimming by his self and almost drowned if I didn't save him. No mother or father around. They do have breakfast which is just  (waffles, apples, toast, glazed doughnuts, yogurt, raisin bran cereal and corn flakes) that's pretty much it.
