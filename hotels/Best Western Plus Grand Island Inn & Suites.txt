Best Western Plus Grand Island Inn & Suites
Rating: 3
Text: Overall, this is a very nice hotel.  Lobby & rooms are nice.  Breakfast offers a decent variety of hot & cold items.  The negatives are that the bed was way too soft for us and the air conditioner was very loud.  Also, we were awakened at midnight to the people above us screaming/arguing & the guests next door left their TV on all night.  However, we did not call the front desk & presumably these were isolated guest-related instances.  I wouldn't deter anyone from staying here but we won't be returning guests.

Text: This hotel was wonderful. The staff was amazing. The breakfast was phenomenal. Plus their pool is open long enough for adults. It's hours are 6am to 1130pm it's fantastic. I would definitely stay here again and recommend anyone coming to grand island stay here.

Text: Unfortunately we were not able to get a room for the night when we drove through Grand Island. It was the night after the Eclipse, so it is understandable. The person on duty at the desk was nice and called a couple other hotels in the area to check if they had rooms, and we ended up going elsewhere. Friendly staff and the lobby was very nice too.

Text: Very nice motel.  Rooms and lobby were clean and up to date.  The breakfast area was nice, and the food was very good.  Nice pool and hot tub. The only downfall was the fitness area.  Just need updates.  Overall very good experience and the staff were quite helpful.
