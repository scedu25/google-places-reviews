The North Star Inn and Cafe

Text: Don't be dissuaded by the outside appearance.  This is a quaint, charming place  at a very affordable price. Very cute rooms with kitchenettes, so nicely decorated you can overlook the stained carpet. The staff and owners were very kind and helpful.  We checked in and found snacks, water bottles, family card games and a welcoming card in our room. So hospitable! We were disappointed that the cafe there was closed on Monday because the menu in the room looked appetizing.  We saw the inside of the cafe when we checked in, and it looked nice.

Text: What a wonderful place to stay, we stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon because Irma chased us out of Florida, the owner was so nice and accommodating and the restaurant was very good too! We will definitely make it a point to stay here again! Highly recommended!!!

Text: Small, but quaint.  There was a cute welcome package waiting for our kids, which was great!  The rooms were cute and good for a one night stay.  The a/c unit was quite old, which and didn't work very well.  The cafe was very cute and the staff were very friendly.
