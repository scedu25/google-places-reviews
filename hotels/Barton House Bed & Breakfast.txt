Barton House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I selected the Barton House BNB over the Internet and we couldn't of been happier with our selection.  Linda & Jerry were the nicest people and the BNB was a delight.  It was quiet, clean and tastefully decorated.  The breakfast table was set with white and blue china, crystal stemware and we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. The Goforth's dog Percy was well behaved and loveable.   We would definitely stay with the Goforth's again.

Text: What a delight to find the warmth of this Bed & Breakfast with all the care and attention of Linda and Jerry, AND be greeted by Percy, their docile and amiable "house dog".  As a dog lover, I couldn't get enough of this wonderful boy.  We'll be back!!!
