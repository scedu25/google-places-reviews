Text: Have only been here for two days and it's been great. The staff has been wonderful and have acted very quickly on any requests we made. I would definitely recommend Extended Stay America in Omaha West for your long or short term stays.

Text: Furniture is a little dated but everything was nice. All was clean and there was plenty of space. The breakfast was a little lack luster but when you have a full kitchen to make what you want it's not too bad.

Text: Not very happy with our stay here so far. Our rooms are nice but the beds suck. The pillows feel and sound like they are stuffed with plastic bags. There is no house keeping here. The lady at the front desk wasn't very helpful. In my opinion it wasn't worth the money that was spent to stay here. Very unhappy!! I found bugs in my room!! They moved us to a different room and the room was just as nasty as the first. We will never stay here again. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone.

Text: Visiting a friend staying at this location. It was not very clean and the stairwell smelled of mold, dirt, and something rotten.while the front smelled of paint but nothing looked freshly painted. Definitely not a place i would feel comfortable staying overnight
