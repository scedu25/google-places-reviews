Park Inn by Radisson Morton
Rating: 2
Text: It was an okay stay. For a shorter duration, it would have been fine. Rooms may now be non smoking but they still smell of smoke. Kept the window open the entire stay. Made it tolerable. Floors could have used some vacuuming. Overall a just below average place and works fine if you are looking for a quick place to stay.
