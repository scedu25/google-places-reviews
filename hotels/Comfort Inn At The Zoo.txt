Comfort Inn At The Zoo
Rating: 4
Text: The location directly off the highway was great. Very close to the zoo, which is very nice after a long day walking. The room was nice, but the electric outlet in the restroom was not working meaning no hair dryer or coffee pot (without moving a lot of stuff). The breakfast was good with lots of basic choices. Biggest downside is no elevators. After multiple hours driving to get there (from Colorado ) and then more time walking around the zoo lugging stuff up stairs was the last thing I wanted to do.

Text: Room was clean. Service was good. Pool is a little small, but big enough for small kids. Breakfast was typical. It's very easy to get to the zoo, or hop on the interstate.

Text: The location doesn't get closer to the zoo. The accommodations we're as expected, clean and adequate. The breakfast was above average, and is what brings me back to this hotel. A very enjoyable stay!

Text: Room smelled really bad, and if there is an elevator they hid it really well. Pool is surrounded by glass right in the main entry, awkward!? Pool was also unbearably cold.
