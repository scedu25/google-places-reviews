Text: Overall a good hotel, clean, decent amenities, with a good location. The front desk is rather difficult to deal with when requesting anything. The front desk woman I spoke with has repeatedly been rude, difficult, and quite unwilling to provide requested extra towels/ blankets/ soaps. I finally got some of my request which I had to retrieve myself from the front desk since no one would bring it to the room which was annoying. The assistant manager did kindly resolve a reservation issue upon check in and did exchange my room after a concern. The regular front desk woman was not initially willing to get me a different room but thankfully the assistant manager was much nicer and easier to work with. Overall I would recommend this hotel although I dropped stars due to the rude and difficult to deal with front desk woman. Aside from her I have no current complaints.

Text: We had to stay there for about 4 months due to a house fire.  In those approximately 120 days there, we received the best possible care from everyone on the staff.  So if you can stay at 1 hotel for that long and never have a problem, you know that this is a great hotel!  The staff was amazing, nice, professional and accommodating.  Our room was always cleaned very well and every area of the hotel was very neat and clean.  Everyone that worked there was so nice to us, the staff went above and beyond.  I have never seen such a hard working group of people.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  It is an absolute and most deserving 5 stars!
