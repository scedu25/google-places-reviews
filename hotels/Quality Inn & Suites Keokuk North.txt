Text: Wound up in Keokuk by accident and so glad we did. We've stayed in equivalent Choice Hotels all over the US and never encountered an employee as friendly and helpful as Kat. Quality Inn in Keokuk had everything this traveling duo needed...laundry room with 75 cent washer, great pool and jacuzzi, large room, decent shower head, and a quiet, and restful night sleep.
