Canoe Corner- Cabins at Stockton Lake
Rating: 5
Text: This is a great place to stay--a rustic  cabin feel while being well stocked and comfortable.  It is walking distance to the lake with lots of outdoor activities close by.  Or stay in the cabin in front of the fireplace while cooking food in the modern kitchen.  Nice linens furnished, comfy beds, cute decor, large screen TV.
