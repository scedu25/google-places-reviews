Text: I stayed in Room 1208. The room had a queen sized bed, chair and ottoman, desk, mini fridge, TV, dresser, and a few lamps with enough room for three to maybe people to stay there. The bathroom had a tub with jets and shower head with multiple settings. Continental breakfast was included with the room. It held quite the selection: scrambled eggs, breakfast sausages, fried potatoes, toast, bagels, waffles, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, and oatmeal. Not to mention, breakfast also had a variety of juices, tea, and coffee. The front desk was willing to help, even into the wee hours of the morning. The accommodations were great and would recommend it.
