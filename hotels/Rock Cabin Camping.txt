Rock Cabin Camping
Rating: 5
Text: This place is the absolute best! The owner is very accommodating and knowledgeable. He strives to make sure you have the best time. The cabin was in a great location- close to everything, yet very quiet and a nice view of the stars at night. It has all the amenities: fire pit, charcoal grills, firewood on site, A/C in cabin, bathroom/shower, mini fridge, microwave, DISH TV, flat screen tv, towels and sheets are provided- this place has everything. This is the kind of business you want to give your money too and even great prices. Owner is a hardworking and genuine. One of the top establishments I have ever had the pleasure to experience.  

I really wish I took photos of the place before we lived in it for a few days to really capture this place in its essence. Old original stone with shiny geode looking gems on the outside and updated and modern on the inside (clean and new, very modern, check out the remodeled photos on their website and you'll see what I'm talking about). 

I highly recommend this place.

Text: Close to Mammoth Caves and the owner is super nice. Not a great campsite, but it was a good base camp for the area. Wi-Fi didn't really work and the sewer connection was an open connection without threading. Good rate for the area.

Text: Cute, small cabin with air conditioner. The cabin is clean and has the basics you need for a comfortable stay; bathroom, shower, towels/linens microwave, small fridge, and satellite TV. Charcoal grill and a campfire ring available for your use. The owners are very friendly, helpful, and kind.

Great location for easy access to Mammoth Cave and surrounding attractions. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: I loved the cabin and the management. It was a very family friendly atmosphere and felt like home. We go every year the prices are great and the service is even better! Also the location is perfect, close to the park and far enough away from town that you get the outdoor experience. I would highly recommend this place!
