Pere Marquette Lodge & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very clean and service was great. The front desk staff was friendly. The food we ate at the lodge was enjoyable as well. I would definitely recommend this lodge to anyone looking for a place to be outdoors along the river. The grounds were clean and as always, the hiking trails were superb!

Text: Visited the restaurant only. Very classy yet a country log cabin feel. Food was delicious, I got the pot roast meal. The surrounding area was very nice and was beautiful to drive down the river road during this cool October weather. Would definitely visit again.

Text: I go up there a few times a year with my husband and dog to hike. It's located in a scenic area, just north of the adorable town of Grafton, IL. I've only stayed in the cabins before, which were cozy. They've got a nice dining area and their staff was helpful. They frequently host events in their large lodge area and there is also a winery and pool/hottub. It's great for a day visit or a weekend visit.

Text: Went for lunch on a Sunday. Food and service were passable but not exceptional. Dimly lit, tired atmosphere even at noon. I'm not sure what audience they're trying to target... Old people with young children? Fried chicken served family style is okay. Instant mashed potatoes, salty gravy, canned corn, slaw from a bag. Reminiscent of a weeknight dinner at your friend's grandma's house. Four stars only because of the nostalgia factor, live music in the lobby and picturesque setting. The place could be so much more than fried chicken. A winery? Brewery? Distillery?

Text: My husband and i came to attend a wedding at the Lodge. We arrived at 6am after a 14 hr drive and were met by a very nice staff member who checked us in. Our stay there was very comfortable and the all the staff members were great. The rooms are very clean! I ate breakfast at the restaurant in the lodge and had a wonferful server and great food. The trails near by also provide a wonderful hike. I have only positive things to say about our time there!
