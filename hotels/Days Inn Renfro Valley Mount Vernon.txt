Rating: 4
Text: Needs a true Handicap shower roll or walk in.  Tub side was shorter than most.  Good grab bars.  Also a.true sitting chair and ottoman.  Beds like most hotels are so High off the ground impossible to get into. Plus I need to sleep.sitting up.   Staff is nice.rooms are clean price is reasonable.  If they had chair and walk in I would give them 5 stars

Text: Great place needs updated definitely some of the stuff in their rooms are from the 80s maybe prior to that. They are pet friendly which is nice when you travel with your pets but they don't have a dog walk area. One recommendation I would give to the owner is update your rooms to this century and put in a dog walk somewhere preferably not near the interstate. Other than that the hotel is decent reasonable priced. I kind of checked in last minute due to a mix-up at my other place that I was going to stay and they found me a room right away even though they were sold out the next day.

Text: WHO WRITES THESE REVIEWS??? 
This particular Days Inn is absolutely disgusting and has people just hanging out, outside their rooms at all hours. 
I checked in on a Sunday evening and was literally too scared for mine and my baby's safety to stay over night. 
Ps- Walk barefoot in any one of the rooms, then tell me those rooms are clean.
Sleep in your car instead, you'll feel a lot safer.

Text: Although the freeway is right there and the walls are thin, if you turn the air on, you can't hear the noise. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was really friendly. I was quite happy with my stay.
