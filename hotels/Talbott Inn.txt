Talbott Inn
Rating: 4
Text: The Old Talbott Inn has both a historical building built in 1779 and a newer annex. Its also home to the oldest bourbon bar in the world. We stayed in the historical building. Its pretty cool understanding how old it is. The bourbon bar doesn't have as much a historical feel as much as you might expect. Tips: The Kentucky Hot Brown in restaurant is to die for. The Inn is rumored to be haunted:) Keep your expectations for the Inn equal to the age of the building.

Text: Have to say that room was quite comfortable and I was relieved to see the safety of bathroom since I do have disabilities.
A little short on parking space (you park on street here overnight).
The breakfast at Talbott was excellent .. especially with my hot tea!
There is an elevator too .. so it was easy to get my suitcase to room.

Text: Loved the historical setting.  The inn has continuously served food for 160 years! Sandwiches at lunch were delicious and well priced. Atmosphere was very nice and servers very helpful and pleasant. Ask the hostess for the written history on the place... very interesting!

Text: We were one of the first people to stay in the newly renovated rooms at this divine place.  It is an upscale boutique style hotel in the middle of a charming town. For the price, it is comparable to any chain hotel but a better all  around experience.  The hotel offers a freshly prepared breakfast at the restaurant that is plenty with hardy portions.  The rooms are nicely appointed with the most comfortable beds and pillows. I mentioned that to the owner and she gave me the history of how the beds were bought and chosen. The linens were a high thread count and the bathroom finishes were exactly what you would expect in a 5 star hotel.   We went back in the spring with friends from Michigan and they were also impressed. It's a darling place and the perfect place to visit after a day on the Bourbon Trail.
