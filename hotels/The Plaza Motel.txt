The Plaza Motel

Text: Traveling through town for work and we decided to call this home for the night. Customer service was great. Staff was very helpful and friendly!! Rooms were big and price was fair. The only thing I can say that could have been better was the cleanliness of the floors in the bathroom.

Text: I went to the Plaza Motel last week and I'm very glad I did. The staff was very kind and always willing to help, and not to mention the food tasted great. I will be visiting The Plaza Motel again in the future.
