Holiday Inn Express & Suites Ames

Text: I stayed for 2 weeks. The staff was great. Very courteous and friendly. The entire area was clean including the room done daily. Breakfast was delicious and ready by 6. Pool was closed for a few days. Didn't like that traffic used the parking lot to get to the gas station next door. Some of the cars drive too fast so you need to be alert. Otherwise I had a great stay.

Text: First thing I noticed walking into the room was a big spider on the wall. I trapped it under a cup and left a warning note for housekeeping. Second thing I noticed walking into the room was the hot, stuffy, musty smell. The bed, pillow and sheets were clean and comfortable. I had a meeting at 8:30am so I hit the restaurant up around 7am and ordered food. Not sure what the problem was but 45 minutes later they still hadn't delivered our food. Ended up having to walk out hungry to ensure I made my meeting on time. Pretty disappointing stay...

Text: Super friendly and accomodating staff quickly changed my stay into a 5 star experience. My desk had a chair that was too short and uncomfortable. The lever appeared to not be working properly. Sheila was concerned that a chair from another room could have the same issue, so Ame brought up a chair from the boardroom and stayed to make sure it worked for me.  Well above and beyond expectations!
