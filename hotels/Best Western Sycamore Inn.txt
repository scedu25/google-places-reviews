Best Western Sycamore Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We love staying here!  It is conveniently located near uptown Oxford and Miami University. The swimming pool and hot tub are definite pluses and fresh popcorn is popped each evening.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. The business area is near the front desk, so help is immediately available.  This is a very good place to stay.

Text: My wife and I stayed in this property two nights and found it is a price performer.  It is equivalent to Best Western Plus hotels we have stayed in. The staff was cheerful and welcoming, especially Kim and Monica. The "continental" breakfast was excellent quality and as extensive as full breakfast at other hotels. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and fresh. Ours was like new. It's four blocks from uptown so it's quiet. We appreciated the many power outlets , too.
