Text: This is the first time we stayed at this hotel chain.  And let me just tell you, it was amazing!!   The staff is so helpfully and very nice.   My kids loved the pool.  You can swim under a glass wall to the other side!   The room was great!  Nice and clean.  The bathroom and shower was very nice also.  The breakfast is amazing.  This morning we had home fries, sausage, eggs, biscuits, gravy, make your own Belgian waffles.  All kinds of cereal and donuts and oatmeal.  Oh and make your own breakfast burritos.   The kick backs are amazing.  We had tacos last night along with chili, salad and nachos and hot dogs.  With 3 free adult beverages and free soft drinks we will most definitely stay here again!!  Thank you all for such a wonderful stay!!

Text: Room was wonderful. Breakfast was good. Was in room during day, heard no knock by housekeeping. Went to hallway for her to service room and all she would do is give me fresh towels.

Text: As with every Drury I've stayed in, it has been wonderful! Nice, new location, clean rooms and lobby. Food is ok but free so you can't complain. :) Many restaurant choices nearby, several within walking distance. I will be back.
