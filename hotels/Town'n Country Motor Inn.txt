Text: This place is a little throwback from the 70s. I enjoyed it. Cute. Maid service didn't show up for the weekend and there is some small repairs needed but the stay was still enjoyable :) older beds, 70s look, paint, sheets etc. Pool available but closed due to needing repair. However... The beach is right around the corner and all is well on the world.

Text: Really bad place for over night. Dirty environment, unusable swimming pool etc. And the worst thing that they will asking for higher price when you check-in than what they told you when you book it. Worst motel experience ever.
