Text: Room and bathroom were very clean. Furniture had gouges on dresser. We had king size bed and it was very comfortable. The air conditioning unit was quiet. Very close to a lot of restaurants and I 80 but it was quiet. Would definitely stay there again.

Text: The office staff was very friendly. We were able to get a first floor room. The person upstairs walked around somewhat loudly, but it wasn't too noticeable. Very nice sheets and comforter. Good location. It was on a main road and easy to get to restaurants.

Text: This was not a good experience! We pulled off the highway in the middle of a bad storm, so chose the first hotel we came upon that accepted pets. The room seemed okay. The next morning we packed up, but our cat was hiding under the bed. While coaxing him out, we found an empty booze bottle, alot of dust and other unidentified debris. We did not complain because we just wanted to get back on the highway. Days later, we noticed the cats had fleas. These are indoor cats, so the only place they could have gotten fleas is from that hotel room. The clerk was not friendly. I guess you could call this a flea bag hotel.
