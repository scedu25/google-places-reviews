Les Lavandes B&B
Rating: 5
Text: The owners are great! This was my first B&B experience and I have to say Myrta made the experience one of a kind. Tea with 5 very yummy deserts and breakfast was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet getaway.

Text: Cute B&B with nice rooms and superb food. High tea with Swiss influences was delicious upon arrival and breakfast was gourmet and filling. Great coffee and conversations with the hosts. Located within 15 min drive of Hermann. Close to Katy Trail.

Text: Richard and Myrta are the sweetest folks you'll ever meet, and they cook up an amazing storm of breakfast, traditional high tea, and even dinner upon request (almost unheard of for a B&B) that would give a lot of high-dollar Swiss chefs a serious run for their money. It's a can't-miss for the Hermann, MO area!
