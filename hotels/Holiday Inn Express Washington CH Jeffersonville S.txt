Text: Clean rooms. Quiet. Good breakfast. We forgot our playyard for our 9 month old to sleep in but they had a portable crib we could use. Horrible mistake! The slats/bars on these are wider than a normal crib and immediately his leg got stuck...repeatedly. My husband rigged up a towel over the entire side but that still didn't make me feel very comfortable. I relayed this safety information in an email and never had any sort of reply. I honestly can't believe these are being sold/used.
Pool is nice but the water fountain hasn't worked every time we have been there the last 3 years.

Text: Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, wonderful staff. View is of a field. But at least no one is staring into your room from another hotel! Loved that there was a fire going in the fireplace.

Text: Amazing!!! We had one night reservation cause the hotel was booked for the rest of our stay we wanted. Morgan & Jeff, the general manager, kept watching for cancelations. They were able to piece together 4 more nights for us! We were in town for a family emergency & every morning Jeff asked how things were going. You don't find good customer service along with compassion hardly ever!! I would highly recommend this hotel. Clean, friendly staff & people who go above n beyond!!!!  I would like to thank them for everything they did!!! We always stay here when we're in town & will continued to do so!!
