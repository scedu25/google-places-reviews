Wingfield Inn and Suites
Rating: 5
Text: The Wingfield Inn and Suites in Elizabethtown is a nice quaint hotel located close to Louisville and right by plenty of good restaurants that you can get a discount at when you stay in the hotel. It has a small but nice and well-kept gym good for staying active on the road. The rooms are very well-kept and the beds are quite comfortable. The hotel also has a garden atrium by the pool which is very spacious and nice - a great place to spend some time if you're at the hotel but want to get out of your room for a bit. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Very good hotel, but if pricing is added into consideration it's bumped on up to excellent.  Nice large clean rooms with above average beds in the comfort department. Friendly helpful staff. The indoor pool/atrium was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this place to others and I'll definitely be staying there myself when I return to the area. Tbh, the only reason that I would consider staying at a different hotel in Elizabethtown is if room availability is an issue.

Text: It's an okay place for those who are on a budget. Breakfast buffet actually was pretty good. Overall cleanliness was what I rated 3/5. Not quite gross, but not clean either. We also both woke up with back pains. But the area is quiet and there is Texas's Roadhouse right next to the hotel, we had a great inexpensive dinner there. I probably will stop here again on my next trip.

Text: Awesome staff! I have an electric car and the manager Todd was extremely helpful in making sure I was able to charge. The hotel itself is above average but the incredible staff make it an excellent choice. Will definitely be returning if I'm in the area.
