Text: Nice hotel.  Only negatives were the very high chlorine levels in the pool and the AC didn’t cool our room well.  I would stay at a Holiday Inn again though. Everything else was satisfactory.

Text: Great experience, friendly staff. The hot continental breakfast was great, pancakes, biscuits, sausage, gravy, eggs along with the usual pastry, fruit and cereal. Kid friendly, my kids enjoyed the pool as well. Room was nice, front desk was quick to respond to requests.

Text: My King suite room was marvelous. The hotel is small but that does not mean they don't provide service. The breakfast lasts 4 hours and was great.

Text: I heard the interior was recently remodeled and it showed! No complaints about anything. The bed and decor were top notch and the complimentary breakfast and wifi were welcome!! The blinds worked great to create a pitch black room. The location to the interstate and food were also advantageous.
