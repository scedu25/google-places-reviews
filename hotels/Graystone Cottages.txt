Text: Very nice, very quite, almost scary but a nice place nevertheless. I would tell people to stay here and being away from the city lights make the stars really come out. Very beautiful.

Text: This was the perfect getaway. It was in a great location, close to stores and shops but still in a quiet neighborhood. It was so clean and everything looked new and fresh! We loved it and will recommend it to everyone!
