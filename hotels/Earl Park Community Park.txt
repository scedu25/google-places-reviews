Text: The tractor and truck pulls were great, like always. This year was the first time we went to the demolition derby and it was great.  The car show had more cars this year than it has had for about 3 years. The only thing I didn't like was that people had reserved seats for the demolition derby before 9am. That's not fair. I know it's free. But I think it should be first come first serve. I got hit in the stomach by a  rock and now I have a lump and big bruise. Next time I'll reserve my seat that night so this doesn't happen again. I'm 60 and my husband is 65 and we enjoy coming to Earl Park. We drive 1 hour to get there.

Text: Nice inexpensive place to camp, only  $15.00 a night. 
Also they have an Earl Park Fall Festival over Labor Day weekend with free parking, free entry and free Bluegrass music. Also have a Flea market the whole weekend. Kiddie carnival and food vendors.

Text: Great place to stop for a picnic on our way to Chicago. A lot of tables, a  shelter, and a great play area for kids. Clean restrooms topped it all! Well worth the stop!
