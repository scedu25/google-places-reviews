Trumbull and Porter Hotel Detroit

Text: I love the look, feel, vibe, flow, mood, everything about this hotel. Would for sure live here if they would let me. I don't live in Detroit but maybe I want to live there for a month just to stay here and soak it all in and write the best stuff I've ever written because it feels inspiring and sweet just to be here. Restaurant was extremely sweet, late night check-in person was good people, I just really really liked it and I know I know I'm not playing it cool right now but I have a huge crush on this place.

My second time staying:
Stayed at Trumbull and Porter for the second time last weekend. The weather was the worst, but everything about this hotel was the opposite. I would like to give everyone who works here a million roses and a large gift card to their favorite clothing store. I just feel like I'm living my best life here and I can't quite put my finger on why. It might be because of the way, way above average decor or the efficient layout or the outside seating. I wanted to take the robe home with me but I felt bad - so you know this place is special because I collect hotel robes.

Text: We stayed one night here at the Trumbull and Porter Hotel in Detroit. It was much different than any hotel we have ever stayed at. It has a much different and unique feel but in a good way. We had a door that went out to a patio with a large grass area. This would be perfect for kids. It had a clean and comfortable bed that my husband loved. The parking lot was gated, and we appreciated that. It was less than a five minute drive to the little Caesars arena. Checking in and out was quick and easy. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant but it looked very nice and had lots of options. We would defiantly recommend this hotel to others!

Text: Trumbull and Porter was a beautiful modern hotel with an awesome on site coffee shop as well as restaurant and bar. The staff were friendly and very efficient at check in and check out and provided us with extra towels and toiletries when we needed them. The room was very comfortable and the modern yet still cozy furnishings will appeal to your inner Scandinavian. The room also came with great terry cloth tones to enjoy during your stay. Classy!

Text: Functionally chic.  An added asset to the comfortable atmosphere, pleasant staff and affordable room rate in the Corktown area adjacent to Detroit's downtown district.   Treat yourself to a jewel infused weekend retreat with walking distance eateries and attractions.  Or dine in the Red Dunn Kitchen where you will be sufficiently fed amidst an array of brews, wines and a variety interesting dinning delights.  Book your stay soon; as a holiday treat or a small getaway.
