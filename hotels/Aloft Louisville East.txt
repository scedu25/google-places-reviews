Aloft Louisville East
Rating: 4
Text: Very good service and nice hotel with good amenities. Rooms were decent, but small.  I'd stay here again if given the chance and I preferred it over Holiday Inn where I normally stay.

Text: Hands down the best customer service I have ever had at any hotel. I have stayed at some pretty well to do hotel and Aloft (here or DC, Wisconsin,  New York) is always professional and friendly. It makes for a pleasant stay.

Text: We had a great stay here. The lobby was very welcoming and full of energy. We both said we would have hung out downstairs if we'd had more energy. Many Tv's, music and various board games. The room was just what we needed. Clean. Spacious. Super comfy bed. We awoke well rested and continued our journey.

Text: Typical Aloft. Modern design, compact but efficient rooms, and good amenities. Lobby and pool area looked nice. Room has safe, coffee maker, fridge, and a miniature ironing board. I had to close my blinds as one window could be seen into from elevator area and the other window was easily visible from patio.

Text: We were there for a party and used the patio, outdoor bar and adjoining meeting room. The staff was very helpful. The facility itself is new, very contemporary and has a great vibe. There's live music on the patio on weekends. Just seems like a friendly gathering spot for a laid back evening.
