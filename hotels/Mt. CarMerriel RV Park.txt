Text: I would like to start off that the owners are my parents. This is a family owned business in a small town. Most guests are long stay guests but occasionally they have overnighter. This makes most of the guests very nice to be around. I feel like this is a quiet and peaceful place to come back to when you are done with your activities be it work school hunting visiting family etc.... Oh and there is free wifi and cable included in the rent. :D
