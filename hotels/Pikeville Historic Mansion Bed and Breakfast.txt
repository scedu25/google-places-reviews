Text: Is this place even open?  I've called so many times I've lost count and can't leave a message because the mailbox is full. I then called the Hampton Inn as directed by the phone message and was informed they don't make reservations for them any more. So, I then went to the website, as directed by the phone message,  & made a reservation but have never received a confirmation. So, I sent an email. No response. This is really poor business practice and very unprofessional.

Text: The hotel was so nice! We really didn't stay there but we had family stay there and we went to see them. It had a true old timey fill to it. There were fireplaces and old antiques inside the rooms. The rooms were very tidy and clean. The lady at the desk was so polite to us when we walked in to the door. Our whole family said that the hotel was great and everything about it was great. Also the same person that owns the Hampton Inn in which is just behind the bed and breakfeast so you get to use that pool. If you are anywhere in the Pikeville area I would definetly suggest this hotel for all your needs for your stay!
