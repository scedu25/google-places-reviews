Embassy Suites Lincoln

Text: So far everything has been pretty great. The breakfast is amazing and they have provided great service while I've been here with a conference. The housekeeping isn't the greatest though. First night in we had a towel hung that looked like someone who had been eating Cheetos had handled it. Not that it's a big deal, but when they replaced the shampoo/conditioner on the second day they had mismatching brands set out. They also didn't take our trash out for whatever reason. Overall, it's a pretty great place, but for the price, I guess I would have expected a little more out of housekeeping.

Text: Rooms are excellent as well as the lobby scenery. The happy hour is fun and exciting, which also offers snack foods. The breakfast is wonderful. The restaurant in the hotel is not very good.
