Text: The owner is super helpful whenever we had questions. Great place to stay to go on Shawnee Wine Trails. We will definitely go back and stay here again!

Text: Such a wonderful experience! We take a girls wine trip every year and have tried out many cabins, this was the best by far! Very clean, updated with all the household supplies you would need!  If you plan on doing the wine trail this is a really good location as it is close to several wineries so you can start far away and end up close to the loft. Highly recommend!!

Text: Awesome experience. Walking distance to Alto Pass Winery, walking distance to overlook to the Bald Knob Cross, walking distance to Grammar's for breakfast ;)
Donated a toaster in case you want to stay in. 
Nice closed patio if you have the back unit, big windows and a covered front walk with a couple benches if you have the front unit. Plenty of room, quite. Quaint little town.

Text: Just spent a wonderful weekend here.  You won't regret it!  My friend and I originally had reservations here a year ago, and had to cancel due to a death in her family.  Owner was incredibly accommodating and invited us to rebook using credit. We did, a year later (early Oct.), and this is just so quaint and cozy. Attention to detail in thinking of things guests might want; eclectic lighting, great shower head, everything you need to cook, and amazingly soft beds. To top it off, he made himself very accessible on phone for any questions and as it turned out, we had difficulty finding it (it's a GPS-challenger!) but he directed us in with a great welcoming nature. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
