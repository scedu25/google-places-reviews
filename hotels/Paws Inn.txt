Text: I'm completely pissed off. I asked them if they could take my dogs on Memorial Day and they did. I asked for the price over the phone because I wanted to budget for the day. I wanted to be sure I had enough money for what we were doing. I was quoted 32 dollars for the whole stay since they told me because it was a holiday I couldn't pick up same day. I said ok that's fine they can stay there the day. But when I pick them up she tells me it's 42 not 32 because there's a fee for dropping off on a Holiday of 5 dollars. But for both dogs! I wasn't aloud to pick them back up. Not going back.!! We gave them enough food for a feeding at night and one that day. It was basically all still there. I'm irritated because they didn't feed my dogs and over charged me for it!

Text: I recommend this place for boarding animals. We have been using them for two years now.  They have fair rates and walk dogs often.  My cats are also happy to be there.  Their facility is clean and up to date verses other places in junction.

Text: I have not been satisfied with the customer service at first I enjoyed taking my dog to be groomed but then after two weeks the customer service rating dropped. 
I would call to make an appointment and the secretary would forget I was on the line hang up or  put me on hold to check schedule and forget and hang up. Just horrible experience more than twice.
