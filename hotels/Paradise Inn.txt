Text: For what it is, this place is great.  It's not a 5 star hotel.  It's not a Best Western motel.  It is a cheap, old, kinda creepy motel.  But, when our car broke down and we had to walk to a motel with the babies, at night, in the rain, this place was just fine.  Old, yes.  But Clean, No odors, No Bugs.  For a cheap little motel, that's really all you can ask for.
