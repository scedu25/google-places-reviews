Text: I have stayed here numerous times over the years.  I've always found the owner an employee's personable.  The rooms are hotel rooms you sleep an shower in.  They are in good shape for the age of this motel.  I've never had any problems with any rooms.  I'm pretty sure if there was Natu the owner would fix it.  The pool is is needing work so it is closed.  But it's still a nice place to test your eyes.
