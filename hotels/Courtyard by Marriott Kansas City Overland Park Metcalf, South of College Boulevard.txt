Text: Overall they room was fine. Clean, spacious, and work the amenities one would expect. The fridge however, was very loud and made sleeping a little difficult. This issue was most likely isolated to our room, but it did detract from our enjoyment during our stay.

Text: The experience there was the best I have ever had. I thought this hotel went above and beyond what they had to. I was expecting the hospitality like I received. I think this place deserves 10 out of 5 stars!

Text: When checking into hotel (booked through a third party) we were given the option of which suite we wanted. Only downfall was the ice machine was right outside of our room. The rooms were clean and comfortable although if there was a ceiling fan it would have helped keep the room cool. We received complimentary breakfast which was good.

Text: Good place. Room was clean for the most part, there was a stain on the rug, but not much can be done about that. Breakfast was good, one day however they were out of food and out took too long to get it restocked. I ended up having to leave without breakfast.
