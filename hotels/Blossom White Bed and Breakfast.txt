Blossom White Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I spent our honeymoon here. I don't think there are any words in the human language that could properly convey the experience we had here. It was purely magical, a dream come true! Brenda (and her husband) were the perfect hosts. They were warm and friendly. If my husband and I ever had plans that may have interfered with breakfast or the evening dessert, Brenda was more than accommodating! We loved our visit *SO* much that we even extended our stay another day AND Brenda invited us as her guests for dinner. Throughout our stay, we enjoyed wonderful conversations with Brenda and George, amazing food (the best I have EVER eaten - seriously, Brenda should write a cookbook!), a very relaxing and romantic atmosphere, a clean and magical (the best word I can use) Master Suite (so incredibly worth it, anyone who plans to stay here should really book the master), and friendship. I would give Blossom White 10 stars if I could. 

And did I mention the food?? So savory. So satisfying. Everything I have eaten since then seems so dull in comparison. 

We even plan on coming back for our first year anniversary!! 

Thank you Brenda and George for the  *perfect* honeymoon!

Text: The Blossom White offers a luxurious retreat off the beaten path in historic Nauvoo, Illinois.  The house is located in a gorgeous wooded setting.  The master suite is luxurious in space and comfort with many extras.  We enjoyed a delicious chicken marsala crepe dinner in the intimate Bistro set for two.  Breakfast the next morning included multiple courses using homemade and healthy ingredients.  Brenda and George are gracious hosts with interesting stories about the area and their personal careers.  After watching the total solar eclipse earlier in the day at a crowded county fairgrounds, our Blossom White experience was the perfect way to conclude a truly unique day.

Text: We stayed here for a couple of days in July 2017. It was fantastic. Brenda & George have put together an experience that's almost unbelievable. The house is gorgeous, spacious and comfortable. The food is spectacular. They are both nice to just sit and visit with. Definitely a once in a lifetime experience.
