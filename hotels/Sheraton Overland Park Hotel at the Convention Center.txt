Sheraton Overland Park Hotel at the Convention Center
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was great. From the moment we valet the car to the moment we checked into the hotel everyone was super friendly and super helpful. They were even really accommodating with our dogs. The hotel is very dog friendly. The food and drink prices were reasonable and the location was really convenient for doing multiple things within the two-state area. I would definitely stay there again and recommend friends to do so as well.

Text: Our organization had a hotel-hosted happy hour with some of the hotel staff that we will be working with for our event. The entire event was lovely and, as usual, the staff we met up with was courteous and friendly, creating such a relaxed environment. I love our opportunities to coordinate with the Sheraton staff!

Text: My stay at Sheraton Overland Park was amazing. The lobby was elegant and beautiful as was the Club Room I stayed in. The amenities offered were plenty and top notch. The staff was very polite and warm, as if to welcome you home.

Text: The convention center is very nice and can hold large and medium-sized events. All the events I've attended were setup well, the audio/visual was appropriate for the venue and activity, the staff was friendly, the rooms and halls were clean, and everything appeared to run smoothly. The parking is convenient as well, and I have never been charged for parking. I like this convention center. I haven't stayed in the hotel.
