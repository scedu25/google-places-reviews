Larry's Cedar Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Had an amazing time staying here while visiting Bennett Springs. Staff is very helpful and there is a store just a short walk away that has great coffee and fishing supplies. It is also very close to the park about ten feet behind the cabin is a sign marking the park property and you can be at the spring in under a minute. I highly recommend Larry's and hope to be back soon.

Text: We have been staying at Larry's for more than 40 years now. Our kids have grown up there. Have seen many changes in the facilities, all good. Service is very accomodating...staff are like old friends who are always glad to see you. Would always highly recommend Larry's to friends who want to do some serious trout fishing.

Text: I have been going to Larry's for probably more than a decade. The family who runs it is very personal and accommodating. This is primarily here as a fishing retreat for the park, but it is kept well maintained, has good hvac, has wader drying racks, cable, wifi, and is right near some quick supply/food options.

Text: The closest place to Bennett Springs State Park, outside of the actual state grounds.....within walking distance.
