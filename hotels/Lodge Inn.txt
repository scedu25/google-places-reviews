Text: The only downfall to this hotel was the cleanliness of the bathroom. But I am a neat freak about those things. There was sugar on the bathroom counter and some dried coffee. There was only a comforter and a sheet on the bed and the bed was a little too firm for me. The staff was very nice and friendly and from what I could tell it is family owned. Overall a nice hotel to stay if you are looking for a quiet resting place.
