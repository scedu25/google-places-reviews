The gal at the desk was so incredibly fabulous we wanted her to come home with us! Breakfast was fresh and choices galore! Hot hot water! And quiet rooms. Stay here!! Better than the big chains across the street!!??

Text: Been staying at this hotel for many years, and found it to be, pound for pound, the best value around. Always clean and comfortable. Staff and management are friendly.

Text: I really wanted to post a good review of this hotel with it's cozy little rooms, but we had a dress stolen right out of the closet! There's a reason they have several signs stating "not responsible for lost or stolen items" because they obviously have a problem at this location. We stay in Lexington a lot, but this was our first and last time at this hotel.

Text: This Microtel Inn was centrally located in an area where you could find any number of restaurants or eatery's. The value of what you get for the price was very good. Breakfast was enough variety and quality to get you out the door and on your way sightseeing.  For anyone on a budget, this is well worth reserving.

Text: Microtel is my go-to on road trips but I was not at all happy with the accommodations here. Our room was dirty, outdated fixtures, and it was... moist. They really need to get dehumidifiers in the first floor rooms or something. The carpet felt dirty because it was damp. Breakfast was barely edible, the amenities left a lot to be desired, and to top it all off our car was damaged in the parking lot. For what this location cost, I expected better.
