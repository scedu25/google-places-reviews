Hampton Inn Middletown

Text: We stayed at Hampton Inn Middletown for one night and it was excellent.   The hotel is very clean.  Our check in was quick and easy.  There were even chocolate chip cookies at check in!  Beds were comfortable.   At breakfast the next morning the hostess was welcoming and even brought me out some scrambled eggs because I didn't want a western omelet, which was what was on the buffet.   The location was convenient for going to Cincinnati the next day.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Nice people.  Clean, yet not chemical smelling.  Colors of decor (especially as compared to Dry Ridge Ky) were pleasant.  Love that this Hampton has exhaust fans in their bathrooms (some don't). Also appreciated that the Housekeeper didn't tuck the TOP sheet under the mattress when she made the bed.  Saved me time retucking the bottom sheet in after turning down the bed at night, and saved the back pain that goes with it.  
My only dissatisfaction would be the breakfast.  The cut fruit all tasted the same, and not good.  Tastes like it may be soaked in "something".  I don't care for Hampton's brand of coffee...especially the decaf. They should provide a granola to put on yogurt.  Wish that they had more healthy (Greek) yogurt.

Text: Had to switch rooms 3 times, but Heather was very helpful with that. Our 1st room was nice, but the bed was too hard and too small. The 2nd room was also nice, king bed on 1st floor, nut no security curtain in window. Third time's a charm. :-) Hotel is easy to get to, and Walmart is right across the drive way. Restaurants are nearby. Hotel has a heated pool, but no hot tub. Continental breakfast, but not set up for gluten free patrons (I'm gluten sensitive). Hotel is smoke-free. :-)

Text: Very nice place. New, clean and comfortable. I would have given it 5 stars but breakfast was not so great. They were out of items, things were not replenished, and selection was not the greatest. Tables were not wiped off.

Text: Staff is friendly and helpful. Beds were a little too firm. Everything was clean. Asked if we can change rooms and they were able to do so without any problems.
