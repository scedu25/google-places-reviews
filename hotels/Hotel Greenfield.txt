Hotel Greenfield
Rating: 3
Text: Hotel Greenfield is a quaint updated motel in Greenfield IA. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable. For the price I would expect a better than continental breakfast but it was really limited. Staff was very friendly and as helpful as they could be. If you're in the area you'll enjoy your stay. I expected a bit more for the price though.

Text: Great historical building revived into a nice place to spend a night or two in Greenfield. Staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home, rooms are filled with antique furniture, but includes snacks, fridge and microwave. Only drawback is most rooms are upstairs, with no elevator, but they are clear to ask about mobility when you make reservations. My second stay, and won't be my last, I'm sure!
