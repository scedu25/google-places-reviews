Text: Awesome place! Very clean and plenty of room for swimming, cliff jumping, zip lining and rope swinging. Heavy crowd from noon until 3 and then people begin dispersing. No showers for camping or we would have stayed a couple days. Fishing lake is nice and well kept though only caught one fish from a supposedly stocked lake. Went on a Wednesday figuring the weekend crowd would be massive at such a cool place.

Text: Brought 6 young teenagers here and they all had a great time.    Food truck was a huge hit.  Camp "store" had everything you could need in case you forgot something... sunscreen,  bug spray, floats, headache meds, etc.  

Really a great time.   I really appreciate the no foul language rule.  Everyone had a really great code of conduct versus other places where I feel like it's not family friendly with the profanity and overall poor behavior.    Will definitely be back!
