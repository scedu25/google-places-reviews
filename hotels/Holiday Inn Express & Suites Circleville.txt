Holiday Inn Express & Suites Circleville

Text: I slept here for two nights during my training. Even though I came late at night registration was a breeze in the courtesy desk person was wonderful. The beds are nice and comfortable and the linen was clean and smelled fresh. They have a continental breakfast in the morning and my go-to was sausage biscuits and gravy and two pancakes from the pancake machine can go bad with that. the only issue I have is that the parking lot spaces are too small. got a ding  in my car door because the spaces are too small.

Text: We stopped in at 6am and needed a fee hours of sleep. We had stopped at three towns with no luck. Thankfully this hotel had an open room. They young man at the desk hooked us up with a nice discount since our stay would only be 5 hours long. We had a super quick breakfast and got some sleep. The room was very clean. I always sleep with a fan but we didn't take anything into our room. But the bed was so comfy I was able to fall asleep on the super cloud-like pillows. We love staying at Holiday In Express and wish we had more time here.

Text: This hotel is the best option in the Circleville area. Front desk staff are friendly, recognize loyalty status, and provide upgrades to members when possible. The hotel has recently undergone a full remodel that includes new furniture and room amenities. The common areas are clean and well maintained. Breakfast is reliable and typical of this chain. I recommend this location in the area without hesitation!

Text: As always, you can count on Holiday Inn Express to provide clean rooms with all the amenities you need. We come here every year during a local festival. Three times - three good experiences.
