Holiday Inn St. Louis - Forest Park
Rating: 3
Text: I came here for a business conference.  This is an older hotel that has been completely renovated.  The rooms are super quiet as the walls are real block.   It has a bar inside the hotel with no outside access which is nice.  The staff was beyond nice.  The hill neighborhood offers many food options.  BUT: I'm pretty sure myself and my travel colleague got food poisoned at the breakfast, but that is hard to prove. The biggest downside is the area off the freeway.  The Red Roof Inn behind the hotel is a known trafficking hotel.  Girls and their security are all around the street day and night.  When I left for the airport at 3:00 PM there was a girl resting on my car.

Text: This hotel is always clean and the staff is always friendly. With the attached restaurant, it's so convenient to grab breakfast before starting our day of site seeing. Plus, you can't beat being so close to Forest Park and the major highways. We never stay anywhere else when we come to St. Louis.

Text: My favorite place to stay in st louis.  Very close to everything you want to do.  Great friendly staff.  Right on the Hill near some of the best food you will ever eat.  Close to the Zoo, close to downtown.

Text: Friendly staff. Rooms are nice with recent modern furnishings. Be careful leaning back in the rolling chairs; they will drop you on the floor.

Text: The hotel is easy to get to with plenty of parking. Rooms were clean. The hardware on the sink was poorly installed and I had to fix the sink plug so it didn't stay closed. Front desk was friendly with me but gave my coworker issues when he tried to fix a problem with his reservation. The issue was resolved.
