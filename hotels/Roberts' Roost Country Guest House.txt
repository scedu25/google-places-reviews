Text: We spent three days here last week and loved every minute of it. The hosts couldn't have been nicer. The amenities are excellent, including breakfast fixings. It is truly like being at home yet on one of the prettiest properties I've seen in a long time. I took so many photos of the property and wildlife. If you're looking for a relaxing, quiet and scenic get-a-way this is the place to be. We will be returning guests!

Text: This is the perfect place to say if you are visiting Savanna! The owners are wonderful and you will certainly have a delightful stay. You will be close to all things related to wildlife -- perfect for waking up and being able to start your day with hiking, birdwatching, or boating. Plus you could have a Bald Eagle right outside your window. Highly recommended!

Text: Such an adorable house nestled in the rolling hills. Adjacent to woodlands and corn fields. Quite well landscaped and quite cozy. A very tranquil experience.
 
A intimately homey atmosphere, inside and out! Delightful décor and comfortable bedrooms! It was pleasant watching the birds at the many feeders around the property. Breakfast was splendid. Adored the homemade muffins and farm fresh eggs.

Text: Toured Roberts Roost. Nicely decorated, very comfortable, Connie and Dennis pay great attention to detail in the house and in landscaping the yard. Like that it is in a gorgeous country setting yet not far from the highway. Close to both Savanna and Mt. Carroll, and Clinton IA is just across the river.
