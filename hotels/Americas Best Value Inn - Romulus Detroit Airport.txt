Americas Best Value Inn - Romulus/Detroit Airport

Text: Really wish there was a 0 star rating.  This place is a nasty dirty, smelly and unclean hotel.  1st room that I was sent to stunk of old stale cigarettes and when I turned on the air conditioning for air flow the smell was even worse.  I notified the front desk and they provided another room.  The next room still smelled bad but was not as bad as the previous one.  Desperate for sleep and unable to get another room elsewhere I had to deal since I needed sleep.  Had to kill a couple bugs.  Notices the toilet was not clean.  Still has urine spots from previous guests.  Then I checked the bedding.  Sheets we not changed.  They just made it back up with dirty sheets.  Upon inspection, there were hairs on the sheets and you could see that they were slept on due to the crumples and wrinkles. I slept on top of the bedding to minimize the grossness but it was still gross.  I put my suitcase and other still way up high on the metal rack in the vanity area to minimize exposure to where insects may possible crawl over my stuff during the night.  I could not wait to get out of there in the morning.  I never thought I would be excited to wake up and get out at 2:00 am.  I would have spent $100's more just to find another room but they were not available.  I will never stay in a place like this again.  I recommend if you're looking for a place to stay comfortable to look elsewhere.  If my family was with my I would not have stayed under any circumstance.  It was just me this time.

Text: We stayed here Friday, September 29 before an early flight the next day.  I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff was, how clean and updated the room was (I liked the fact that each room is a separate unit - you park your car in front of the door) and how amazingly good the breakfast was.  I wasn't expecting such a diverse selection of options.  We will definitely stay here again for our next flight out of DTW.

Text: We stayed here on the night before our flight. We didn't sleep at all.  The room beside us was a party zone - and the party started after 11pm.  It continued to wake us up and we called the desk 4 times for assistance. Twice they sent someone to knock on the neighbour's door- and had a 2 way radio conversation with the front desk outside our door while running the diesel van outside our door (safety precaution no doubt) waking up our kids at that point.  The neighbours didn't answer the first time so they did nothing.  The second time they opened, he joked with them about " behaving" and then they got louder as no consequences were described (i.e. eviction, paying for our room as per other hotel policies).  They passed out at 3:00 am and we were up at 6:00 am for our flight - so 3 hours of sleep?  The management was UNRESPONSIVE.  We left a message the day we left asking for a phone call or email - nothing.  We asked again when we returned to our car a week later - no response.  We emailed the company and only then got a response.  We were compensated 20% - a joke by all measures.  Truly disappointing and I would never, ever stay there again.  The room was also very dirty - we did a bed bug check (always do that) and although no bugs, the cracks and crevices of the room were disgusting and untouched by any cleaner.  There was a white powder all over the bathroom floors as well.  So unimpressed with the unresponsiveness of staff - sometimes things happen but you work to fix it - not ignore it.

Text: We stayed in this hotel on 9-22-17.  The room air conditioner did not work, the room could use a good cleaning and the bed and pillows could definitely use an update.  We left on 9-23-17 with little sleep due to the loud air conditioner.  I accidently left my YETI cup behind.  I had placed on the windowsill to hold the curtains together.  I called from the Ariport and wanted them to put my cup somewhere safe until I returned.  The lobby clerk said she would have the manager call me.  She never did.  When I returned no one would locate my cup.  They told me to call the manager again.  I called the next day and she said they did not have the cup.  I said I called right after I left the hotel, how could they not have the cup.  She said there was nothing she could do and she did not get my message and that the cleaning crew probably just threw it away.  I find that hard to believe.  Someone is enjoying my expensive CUP.  I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I HOPE OTHER TRAVELERS HEED THIS REVIEW.....
