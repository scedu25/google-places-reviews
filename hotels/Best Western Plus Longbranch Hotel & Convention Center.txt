Best Western Plus Longbranch Hotel & Convention Center
Rating: 5
Text: Best Western Longbranch in Cedar Rapids, Iowa provided a respite for our family during the funeral of my mom. We rented 25 nights of rooms and the stay was flawless. From the provided breakfast, the lounge, restaurant, additional rooms. the desk staff, swimming pool, atrium and our rooms I had very happy compliments from the entire family. Want to thank them so much. Made it much easier for our family to cope with our loss.

Text: More than ample parking. Extremely simple check in, and very accommodating staff. Everyone that works here is quite friendly, and there were no issues. This is the best Best Western I've ever been to. The breakfast bar is pretty amazing. The fruit is fresh, and the eggs are real as opposed to many other places. Very large hotel with a lot to do (game room and pool). The bar is great, with very good food and decent prices and friendly people. That also do karaoke, which is great. I travel a lot and this hotel is at the top of the list.

Text: It was a nice little spot. Good pool. Great list of amenities, all satisfactory, none of them extravagant (though the couch in the lobby was quite comfy). My wife and I prefer things simple and seek value above all, and this was it. One of the lowest prices in town, with no major sacrifice. We'll visit again.

Text: This hotel is clean and well appointed.  The staff is courteous and hard working.  We were very comfortable in our room and in the hotel in general.  Breakfast was very good and the staff was some of the best we've ever run across.  One BUT...if you are truly wheelchair bound your room will meet your needs, however, the parking lot is not safe for loading and unloading with a wheelchair ramp.  The slope is dangerous and the area is too small for safety sake.

Text: Nice place to stay. Rooms are pleasant. Nothing fancy. Comfortable beds. Working, controllable environmental system. Sufficient storage. Bathroom small but plenty of flat surface storage area for kit, etc. Light switch on outside of bathroom - where it belongs. Buffet breakfast simple. Covers all the basics - not fancy. Breakfast lady very nice, friendly and helpful. Overall, just a bit on the expensive side. Would stay again and would recommend to others.
