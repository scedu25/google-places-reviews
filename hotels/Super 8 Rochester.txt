Text: Came in for late check-in, tired. The desk clerk ignored for a good 5 minutes while she finished whatever she was doing without greeting us or even acknowledging we were there. It was clear she knew we were there. The hallway outside our room smelled STRONGLY of pot, but if we opened the window, we got the terrible fertilizer smell from outside. Wouldn't really recommend staying here.
