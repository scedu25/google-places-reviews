Red Roof Inn Rockford
Rating: 2
Text: The rooms are set up nicely and well maintained; however, the first night of our 3 night stay we noticed blood on the inside and outside of the bathroom door so the next night after we returned from a family reunion the blood was still there, but the room was straightened up and cleaned otherwise. On the third morning we went ahead and let the office know and they said they would make certain is was cleaned off the door. We left and spent the whole day with family and returned at 2000 to find the room straightened up, yet the blood was still present on the door.

Text: While hotel is no smoking the room had a heavy odor of smoke. However room was clean and furniture was in good condition. Up graded superior room for $5 more was well worth the cost ( has fridge a microwave and is larger). Hotel has strange practice of charging everyone $1.50 per day for using the in room safe and then crediting you that amount when you leave if you say you did not use the safe. Good location near I 90 tollway.

Text: Located in an easily accessible area of the Rockford business district, the Inn was easy to find and close to many other useful businesses. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. Service was friendly. We will be staying here again.

Text: Got ripped off by a third party booking. Paying for an extra 12 days. No refunds, no contesting and red roof acts like there's nothing they can do even though they are partners in crime with these online, redirecting, misleading scumbags. Now they are going to re-rent my room to someone else while I am still paying for it. As far as I am concerned they are just guilty at committing fraud as the people online. Oh and did I mention that the hotel was mediocre at best.
