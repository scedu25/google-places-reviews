Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark
Rating: 4
Text: We had a lovely time. Pros: The customer service was very good. Friendly staff. The pool was nice. Room service was tasty, bit expansive but not for Hilton room service in general. Location was wonderful. The public areas were beautiful and well maintained. The corner store was a neat feature. The fitness center was one of the best used. Cons: The room was not cleaned well when we got there. It took a long time to get our bedding changed from Down (feathers) to not Down. The rooms were a bit outdated and the services still list a laundry that doesn't exist anymore. A water heater or something was dripping down our window all night and the sound was annoying. Overall we were quite happy.

Text: The room s are dated but comfortable. Nice clean bathrooms and sheets. The shower was a bit hard to keep flowing through the head. $1.75 water from vending machine. Nice view of the STL Arch on the east. The ballpark to the South and the city to the West. Was not excited about the $17 breakfast buffet. Limited parking downtown forced you to utilize $20 overnight parking. There is a decent gym with good amenities and room temperature water. Overall, it is a decent hotel, I had a 3 night stay for a technology conference.

Text: The hotel looked very nice! Wonderful lobby with a Starbucks. Three main reason for my visit was for Three Sixty, the rooftop bar and restaurant. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available. The views are incredible! Amazing view of Busch Stadium, the Gateway Arch, and the rest of downtown. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but I had a few drinks at the outdoor bar. Three drinks were moderately priced. 10/10 would highly recommend coming to Three Sixty. Even if you don't eat at the restaurant or have a drink at the bar, the views of the city are well worth stopping by to check it out!

Text: My husband and I were gifted 3 nights at this hotel for our anniversary weekend which was great because if it was up to us we would've been out of there after the first night.  There was only 2 staff members that were not in a bad mood the whole time we were there.  As for the valet service just park your own car in the parking deck a block away.  I valet my car so that it is easier to get to not so that I have to walk to the opposite side of the hotel to pick it up.  Don't get me wrong the view was amazing but that is the only good thing this hotel has going for it.  My mother had called to order us a meat/cheese tray, chocolates and a bottle of wine to be delivered to our room as an anniversary gift.  The only thing we got was the meat and cheese tray and they charged us for it even though she paid for it ahead of time.  They did correct this after we brought it to their attention but we never received the rest of it.  I would suggest staying at one of the many other hotels in the area if you are going to St. Louis but if you do stay here make sure you pack your own toilet paper unless you like using sandpaper on your sensitive areas.

Text: For $200 a night, too many things went wrong including a sewage backup in the bathroom. The fan in the bathroom was caked with dust.

The beds were nicely made and comfortable. The room was cool in temp which is how I like it. Only downfall was the loudness of the air conditioner when it kicked on. My friend lost alot of sleep because of it. 

Most staff were nice and attentive.
