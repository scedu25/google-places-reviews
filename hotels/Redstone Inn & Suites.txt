Redstone Inn & Suites

Text: Beautiful home with tons of charm. Robert is very gracious and accommodating. The place has a magic vibe and rich with history that sets you back in time. Walking distance to many wonderful shops and places to eat and drink. We  will be back as our goal is to feel the charm of every room in this glorious house. If you like a setting that takes you back in time and has a home feel this is it.

Text: Lobed our suite for the weekend. Very large and secluded. Bath room could use an upgrade on a couple of things. The overall experience was great and we'll worth it. Breakfast was good both mornings with a story about the house from the host.
 Very interesting story about the copper family.

Text: The hotel needs badly to be renovated and updated. Wall paper held up by tacks and thread bare bath mats are not acceptable. Also dust everywhere

Text: Hospitality was amazing and the the inn was obviously dated, but that is what makes it unique. Only problem were some bugs in the room, but none major. Otherwise, good breakfast and good experience.

Text: A beautiful old house, steeped in history. Some quirks that come with the age of the building are easy to ignore. Thanks to Robert for being a kind and welcoming host!
