Text: I live in Holiday Mobile Court South and I love it. The neighbors are wonderful and it is very quiet and peaceful. Tina the manager, helped me find the perfect home and worked with my budget so that I could afford it. It's $100 cheaper than the two bedroom apartment I used to rent and I am buying my own 3 bedroom, two bath home, with a fireplace and a whirlpool bath, not to mention all the beautiful built-in appliances and laundry room. Theres even a covered 12 X 24 covered deck on the side which is lovely in the summer.  Tina and Greg are always there to lend a hand. I feel like I've finally come home.
