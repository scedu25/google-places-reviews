Text: The people who run the campground were very nice. Google maps showed us arriving down the street from the campground. The restrooms and showers were extremely well kept and very clean. The grounds were well kept. The price is a bit cheaper if you pay by check or cash..

Text: This was our first visit here and definitely won't be the last. Very well maintained and so quiet and peaceful. Out in the country, always a beautiful breeze. Sites are very spacious, full hook ups, fire pits & picnic tables. Washer/dryer, bath house available as well!! There is a Walmart a couple miles away which is a plus in case you need something! I saved the best for last, the staff--so warm & friendly. Linda you are an awesome host!! Can't wait to see you again! Very dog friendly, our ROCCO had a blast! We traveled in a fifth wheel.
