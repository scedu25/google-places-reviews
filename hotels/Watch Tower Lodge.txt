Text: This place is simply breathtaking and beautiful! We had our wedding here on July 2ND 2017 and it was perfect! It's historic building with a radiant presence! You don't have to do to much decorating because of how majestic it is! Beautiful hardwood floors, stunning pillars, astonishing rock walls and ceiling to go with wonderful fireplace! It's a wonderful atmosphere that is so roomy enough to fit a big wedding in! The outside is just gorgeous with a view that will take your breath away! Just all around perfect and wouldn't couldn't of asked for a better place to become husband and wife! To be honest for how long it's been around it's still kind of a hidden gem cuz a lot of our guests that have lived in this area had never been here and we're very impressed and loved the location that made everyone so happy and joyful! Highly recommend this place! We would give it 10 stars if it would go that high!!! The staff here worked with everything we needed and went above and beyond their customer service!!!

Text: We had our wedding reception here. It was absolutely beautiful. We were able to bring in our own caterer and alcohol which helped on the budget. There's a kitchen with refrigerators and stoves so the food can be made hot and fresh right there. You have to reserve it early, though, as it books up quickly.
