A&E Camping Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Enjoyed an overnight campout with our Scout Troop after a day of tubing at Mad River Mountain.  Eric at A&E was very accommodating of the Scouts and was willing to help us out with anything we needed.  We were only there for one night so we didn't have time to explore very much, but the bath house was clean and the campsite served it purpose.  Thanks A&E!

Text: Called inquiring more information regarding rental that is NOT listed on their site and pretty basic questions. ex. "is there a charge for an additional person above listed lodging price", "Are your cabins still available to rent as allot of cabins are already closed for the season", "do you have any available for *specific weekend*" only to be hung up on upon asking said final question. was seriously interested in renting a cabin for the weekend; now i will NEVER consider lodging at a place with such terrible customer service.

Text: Came here for our first anniversary. The price is fantastic for all the outdoor fun they offer. You can swim, paddle boat, play on the playground, fish, hike... Lots of fun to be had. The cabin we stayed in was very clean and well kept. The only thing we wish was different was if the cabins could have been a little more secluded.
