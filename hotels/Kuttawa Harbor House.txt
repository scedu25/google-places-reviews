Kuttawa Harbor House

Text: The house and grounds were beautiful. Since it doesn't sit on the lake you don't get an unobstructed view of the lake. The girl that showed us around was very nice and gave honest answers.

Text: A beautiful location for sure! But for my daughters biggest day, her wedding. The promises by Phil the owner and the staff were not full filled! I highly DO NOT recommend using that facility for an evening wedding!!
I'll agree you can't control the weather and we knew and were prepared for that unknown. The Kattawa House should be prepared for "worst" as well! A power outage occurred thru the area 2 hrs before event start. The House facility has no backup generators, emergency lighting, exit lighting or emergency plan!!! No battery powered lighting was ever offered or provided by the owner or staff. It was a fiasco!! No lights, no A/C and NO HELP!! This facility having NO backup plan for ZERO electricity will ruin your event no matter what time of the day or season. We paid a hefty price $$$$ and got crappy memories! Don't waste your $$$!!!'

Text: The bartender sucked, but the drinks were fairly priced and the music was good. I liked the outdoor patio a lot.
