Text: Well to start, I'm not a picky person. I do like it here though it's quiet the other people are nice and the staff has been amazing to the whole family. Maintenance always does that little extra and if they can't they'll put in the word to get it done.

Text: We moved in about two weeks ago and the staff have been super friendly! We just had a problem with our garbage disposal and not even 30 min after I told them someone was here to fix it. The place is really nice and its very quite here. We are across from the play ground so I figured there would be noise from the kids playing but they are usually home before 7. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone lookong
