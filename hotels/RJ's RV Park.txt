RJ's RV Park

Text: Do NOT consider this one. We stayed one night in our 38' 5th wheel. I tell you the size to give you an idea of the space/height needed. It's got pot holes, is badly overgrown, the picnic table was rotted, and the whole area was terribly unkept. I cannot critique the facilities, but bet they too are below standard, using 'standard' liberally. The only upside was that it didn't have feral cats. I hate to give this place such a dismal review but, I hope this saves you a very bad experience

Text: It's not the nicest place I've ever stayed,  but the price is right, it has large pull through spaces,  shade trees, and they were able to accommodate us last minute.

Text: Staff was helpful and friendly. The sites were okay, the wi fi was weak. The grounds were in an unkept state, the bathroons were dirty and not nice. For the price we were willing to stay as we didn't know where the next available RV park could be found.

Text: Was the most unclean facility we have stayed at! Absolulty gross restrooms, full full unusable toilets, the in washers smelt and had clothes in them all night just sitting, and pool had nasty green stuff on bottom. No wifi and no cable tv. Would not stay again!
