Text: The owner was absolutely accommodating for our stay; we were a little nervous about the office being closed after 5 p.m., but after calling a little before we arrived, she was there to take care of our check-in - even in the very late evening.  SO friendly.  It felt less like checking into a hotel, and more like arriving at a friend's home after a long roadtrip.

The room was very clean and inviting...we were quickly crashed out amongst a sea of pillows. Ha!

We stayed in the area for three nights, and the peace & quiet here was very welcome.  We didn't utilize the snack room much, but it was nice to know that we could have!  

Will definitely be staying here again next time we are in town!

Text: The rooms are very nice. The only complaint I have is the double room. My company will not allow us to have a single room, so I always have to room with another full grown man. Twin beds are not very comfortable for a 6'4" guy, and two full grown men in the little room is not ideal. Other than that, this place is very clean and feels like home.
