Text: The staff was great. They were very friendly and accommodating. The building was clean and the breakfast was good. I enjoyed the fresh fruit. The rooms were nice and comfortable; well stocked with towels and cloths. I liked the options of firm and soft pillows for each person. Overall a great stay for the price.

Text: Room was large, clean and nicely decorated. Needs were comfortable and the blankets were surprisingly fluffy and warm. Continental breakfast was great with pancake machine and other options. Very nice lobby area. Hotel is right next to convention center that I was attending a party at.
