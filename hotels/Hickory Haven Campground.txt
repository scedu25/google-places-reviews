Hickory Haven Campground

Text: Nice place. Convenient location. Has 2 outdoor playgrounds. Also has a trail to walk or ride bikes. The shower rooms are also the bathroom. There is no separation on the floor between the shower floor and the toilet area which is very unsanitary. The floor doesn't slope toward the drain so you are standing in water that covers the whole floor.. We were there during the rodeo so with so many people it got quite disgusting. More frequent attention of the bathrooms is required.

Text: I have been to several campgrounds and this one will always be my favorite! The two elderly people who care for it are so friendly and helpful. They have an awesome fishing pond in the back 40 which is just chuck full of crappy and it has lots of trees and grass it's quite beautiful and quiet!
