Wildcat Off-Road Park
Rating: 5
Text: Me and 5 friends drove 12hrs. There was somebody there sleeping in his truck(office was closed at 430am) waiting for us and answering the phone when needed to make sure we got there ok and showed us where out rental place was. That's says a lot right there. Trails weren't quite as expected but still we had a lot of fun. Some were challenging but we liked that. The owners saw us sitting outside and came up and introduced themselves a different night.  Pretty cool people. Asked what we could do to make our 4 day stay better in the future. I would highly recommend going at least once. It's beautiful down there. If it weren't so far away we would go more often

Text: Can't rate the actual trails because I was unable to go more than 1/8 mile on all 4 off the main trail heads. Even the main trail through the part would require a rock buggy to get through. I showed up in my 2003 Jeep Rubicon an hour before the main park opened and was instantly greeted by a super nice man with a rocking mullet. In fact the only reason I give the review 3 stars is because if that guy. I want to believe the park is better than that. Maybe if I had showed up in a SxS on a drier day with a group it would've been a lot better. I stayed for 45 minutes and literally drove as far out every trail head before I had to turn around for either a huge Sand hill or a rock garden.

Text: Took my wife who is new and my 5 year old.  Had a good time.  My only issue is that the bigger mud vehicles like jeeps carve some deep ruts, but that is to be expected with all type of units allowed on the trails.  If you are trying to teach someone, watch out because a seemly easy trail turns difficult very quickly.  Overall, it is a great place and we will be back.
