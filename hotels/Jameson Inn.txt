Jameson Inn
Rating: 1
Text: Our family needs t-shirts saying we survived the Jameson Inn in Seymour, IN. Could not get out of there fast enough and almost left after just an hour or so. Stopped just for an overnight on our way home from vacation and this was the only hotel not booked and now we know why. Weird smell, dirty, slept on our own blankets, and I'm pretty sure there was a guy in the next room with a prostitute. Never again!!!

Text: Everything was nice and clean.  The staff was very friendly. Only problem was breakfast was suppose to be served from 6-9 and we got down there at 7:30 and there was no breakfast

Text: Use to be a Super 8 when my wife & I stayed there. Not exactly sure how long ago that was maybe 5 or 6yrs ago, wasn't that bad. Was quoted on 8/1/15  $45 (trucker rate) take the pet w/cha. It's alot better vs sleeping in your truck. Truck&Trailer parking
