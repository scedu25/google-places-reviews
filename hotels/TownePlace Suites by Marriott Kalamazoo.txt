Text: Stayed for a week it was nice and cozy.
I loved it until my 3rd night someone in the room above me made so much noise woke us up through out the night and we had to be up early for work. Called the front desk complained seem like they got worst with the noise. Other then the person or people above us it's a great place????

Text: Great experience. Rooms were nice, new, and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. They have plenty of information about local dining and attractions in the lobby. Breakfast I'm the morning was fairly good as well. I would certainly stay there again.

Text: Excellent, comfortable, very clean, spaceous rooms, and well stocked with necessities of home, and business needs. Right of expressway. Not far from Crossroads mall, or West Main area. My favorite place to stay when I come back to Kalamazoo.
