Text: My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. We stayed in the Duke's Dungeon. I cannot recommend this place enough. It was beautiful, quiet, and we loved the decor. The staff was very friendly as well. The breakfast was great; the frittata was the best I've ever had. We were very pleased with our stay and will definitely be back!

Text: We were disappointed with our stay here. We decided on a two day stay. The second day we actually left to find something to do and food because it really wasn't worth staying on the grounds. The staff is wonderful and do whatever they can for you. Super friendly. The castle itself is nice. The room was quaint. The food was not good at all. Very little choices at that. We just really feel that if there was attention to the little things it might have been better. We took a hike in the limited trails on the grounds and there were old worn benches, tables etc scattered around the property. There is absolutely no internet or wifi service without driving a distance. There are a LOT of board games if that's your thing but outside of that there is absolutely nothing else to do here. Neat place to visit but if we knew we would have just done that.

Text: We had a wonderful time. The inn keepers and staff were friendly and helpful. The food was great and the atmosphere was friendly. We enjoyed playing the games. We enjoyed King Arthur's room and the quiet relaxing view of the garden from the balcony for our anniversary. Thank you for a great time. Jeff and Anita Laurel, Maryland
