Text: It was quiet and had comfortable beds. It also had a nice array of breakfast items, but the hot food had no flavor!!!. We were really bummed that the hot tub was not working! It would have been nice to know that it was out of order when I called to see if they had a pool area!!! I have a bad back and after a 3 hour drive, I was looking forward to a hot soak!!! If they would have been upfront about pool area and had better hot food I would've rated this place higher!
 Update. Whilst checking out I mentioned we were disappointed that we were not informed of the hot tub not working. The girl working apologized and gave us a small discount. I would rather have had a working hot tub, but it was nice of her.

Text: The only issue I had with this motel was their toilet.  Lift some weights and get in shape because it takes a substantial amount of muscle to press down the flush lever.  Other than that, I enjoyed my brief visit.  The thin girl with the high voice at the front desk was  a pleasure to do business with. The grizzly gray-haired biker that hangs around the lobby and cuts cardboard would not make eye contact.  I wanted to engage him in conversation because he looked like an interesting fellow.

Text: Employees were very nice and helpful. Room was clean upon entry and was quite tidy/cozy with all the amenities you would expect from your average modern hotel (mini fridge, flat screen TV, coffee maker, etc). For a single night stay, it was perfect.

Text: Very friendly staff. Hotel is dated, but clean. Nice breakfast, comfortable bed! No elevator unfortunately, but it's at least not a huge flight of stairs. Relatively near restaurants and shopping.
