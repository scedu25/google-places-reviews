Text: Very spacious rooms. Never been in a motel room like this, even the bathrooms. Clean and has a decent size fridge and freezer. The only thing is beds are a little too firm.

Text: Wow, experience was awesome. I don't stay at motels much but this one was seriously clean. The bed is awesome! I have never slept on such a comfortable cozy bed where your body just sinks in the mattress. They have a little diner on the side of the building and the food is so good!! I order a $7 burrito & it was the best I've ever had!! Hot showers/clean clean bathrooms/bathtub!! This motel is "A MUST" friendly Chinese owners...AMAZING AWESOME EXPERIENCE OF THIS town!!
