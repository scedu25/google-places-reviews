Text: After reading great reviews and finding my usual b&b booked up, I thought I would give Atwood house a try. I called and spoke to Bill. He wanted to know my name and why I was coming to Chillicothe? He said he wanted to make sure I wasn't coming because of the Easy Rider Rodeo because he didn't want wild trouble makers in his B&B. To assume that people who ride motorcycles are trouble makers seemed very rude. Many of us are hard working suburban couples. Then when I didn't book, he called me to lecture me for not following through and booking!! Snotty man with airs about himself and unless you want him to babysit you while you are there, you might want to think twice. Certainly don't tell him you ride a motorcycle!

Text: We absolutely adore this B&B! Warm, friendly, & the breakfast was to die for. We can't wait for our next trip to Ohio for another stay.
