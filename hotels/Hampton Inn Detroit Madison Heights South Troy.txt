Hampton Inn Detroit/Madison Heights/South Troy
Rating: 4
Text: Nice hotel, the room was conducive to conducting business. The bed was quite comfy, and power receptacles were plentiful. Being in an industrial area it was pretty quiet. Though I didn't get a chance to stop, there was a restaurant themed on Twin Peaks at the end of the block; I'll have to visit to find out who killed Sarah Palmer the next time I'm in town.

Text: An relatively old hotel in Madison Heights. Good location near freeway but not on freeway. Rooms are old style. The chair had some dirty sticky substance. One of the table lamp was not working as well. Expect a better maintenance and cleaniness

Text: Desk staff always professional and welcoming. Cookies are out promptly at 530pm and warm. Breakfast area has a decent flow to it, but at times can be packed with nowhere to sit. Rooms are big, clean, I like the sheets and pillows here. I wish they had an indoor hot tub. outdoor swimming season is so short here. Fitness room has free weights as well as the normal treadmill so I can get a good all around work out. This is my go to hotel when in detroit central
