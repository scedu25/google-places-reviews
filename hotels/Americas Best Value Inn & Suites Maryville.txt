Americas Best Value Inn & Suites Maryville
Rating: 4
Text: This was the best value for the dollar motel in our ten day vacation. We upgraded to a big extended day room for only $20 per day and had a very comfortable big room. The staff is friendly. The location is very convenient to the bypass highway and very quiet. Breakfast wasn't the best, but I said the motel was the best considering how much we paid for it (2 nights for the same price as 1 night at a Best Western or Drury motel.)

Text: I rate on value. I love the staff. I will not stay at a place that does not treat you like a customer. I was treated very, very well. The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean. They had a full selection of TV channels, free WiFi and the breakfast was good. Best Value in the area!
