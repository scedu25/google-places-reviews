Holiday Inn Express & Suites Zanesville North
Rating: 5
Text: Stay here every year on our way to and from the Indy500 and various other locations too throughout the year. Look forward to it every time! Staff is always amazing, you could eat off the floor in the rooms, super clean compared to anywhere we have ever stayed! So much so we won't stay in even Hilton's anymore!!! Good breakfast with lots of choices! Even picky kids were satisfied! Coffee 24/7!!! Clean pool area! Choose express and suites where ever we go! NEVER DISAPPOINTED!

Text: This is by far the best hotel in the area. Locally owned and operated. Very clean, breakfast area always stocked well and neatly kept. The staff is second to none. For an enjoyable stay in Zanesville this is definitely your best choice

Text: Wasn't the nicest HI express I've been to. Help was pleasant but building was worn. Water damage in room, desk chair had holes in it, second TV [in a suite] didn't work. OK but not the greatest.

Text: Real nice staff and good hotel in a good area. Rooms were nice size, a bit pricey albeit for the accommodations. Had a pool and hot breakfast in the morning so yeah
