Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott North Platte

Text: Very nice hotel conveniently located right off the highway. The room was clean and well maintained. The bed and pillows were comfy and I can be picky about the pillows. I also liked the fact that there were restaurants nearby you could walk to. The price of the hotel was reasonable also.

Text: Nice hotel right off the interstate. We were passing through so that's all we needed. Clean room, nice bed. Easy walking distance to several restaurants. Nice breakfast bar. Pleasant staff. Overall a good stay. What I would expect from a Marriott property.

Text: We were greeted by a very friendly staff.   We loved our room, the bed was so comfortable.  Everything about this site was very clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent, and again the staff was friendly and busily keeping everything clean and tidy.  Walking distant to 2 great restaurants.

Text: As always the rooms are very clean and comfortable. If I had one request... I'd like to have biscuits and gravy at breakfast. The fruit was very fresh and tasty. Always love the waffles. Thanks!

Text: It was fine. Rooms clean and comfortable.  We used our points and it was not as nice as some we've stayed for 10000 pts less. Air conditioner was loud along with hearing road traffic. Staff was very nice and good breakfast.
