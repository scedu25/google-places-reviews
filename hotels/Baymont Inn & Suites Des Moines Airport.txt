Text: This was pretty good place. There is 2 pool tables, a pool, and a hot tub. The hot tub however had a ring of gross around the outside on the wall. It was so thick it would have had to of been scrapped off. Way past scrubbing. It was gross! The pool tables were fabulous as long as you got their early enough to get one before the truck drivers came in or they would take both pool tables over for 6 or 7 hours until it was 1 or 2 in the morning. The pool was nice though!

Text: Accommodations were very good, beds were comfortable, clean rooms, staff was very friendly. The only thing that definitely needs improvement is the breakfast, they had a nice selection of food but the eggs were rubbery and they need more selection in the fresh fruit department. All in all would recommend it to friends.

Text: We have been making this Baymont our place to stay when in DesMoines to visit family. The rooms are quiet and the breakfast is one of the best provided by various hotels that we have tried. The price is reasonable and we will continue to stay here as long as they maintain the level of service and comfort that we appreciate so very much!

Text: Didn't feel comfortable sleeping there. Feel like the sheets wasn't change, for someone like me who doesn't have sensensity skin I felt very itchy sleeping on the bed. I will give this inn a two star just because of the price. I wouldn't come back though.

Text: The hotel staff are courteous and helpful. Room service does a thorough job. It's close to the airport. The breakfast is well stocked with cereal, oatmeal, juice, milk, bacon, eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, milk, and the option to easily have waffles and pancakes. There is more at breakfast too. I'd come back here again.
