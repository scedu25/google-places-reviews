Text: Forget it. I was ticked. My mother is handicapped.  The "handicapped" room was a tub with a fold down bench. She could not get in and in trying fell and hit her head.  The wifi did not work and when I complained they told me my computer was not working- which it was not the problem.  I would give this motel one star if staff had not been so friendly and breakfast was good.  But again...no

Text: Amazing stay! The breakfast went above and beyond not only did they have a waffle maker but topping such as whipped cream candies fruit and a variety that was much more than the average breakfast at hotels. The service was professional and they helpful. Very clean room.

Text: Great location near the airport. The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter were both nearby. Only an hour away from Dayton and the Air Force Museum. Small bathrooms but otherwise a clean hotel with a nice indoor pool and hot tub, and the usual "breakfast included" fare complete with waffle iron, steam table eggs and bacon, juice machine and much needed coffee. Friendly staff...

Text: I didn't stay there, but met family. The staff was nice. Breakfast I ate with my family and was fine. Not a huge selection but what was out there was good. Rooms looked clean and beds were reported to be comfortable.

Text: Clean and quiet rooms with choice of wired Internet connection. Good breakfast. Paid for a king room but was downgraded to double bed room due to overbooking because I was not a loyalty program member. Disappointing.
