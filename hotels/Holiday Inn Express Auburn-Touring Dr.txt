Text: Who takes time to leave a review on a low to moderate hotel? This guy! That's how good our experience was. The king bed was comfy and room was kept well. The breakfast blew us away for the class of hotel. Fresh pancakes, egg white and veggie omelettes, fresh cinnamon rolls, hard-boiled eggs, biscuits & gravy and of course your staples: bagels, toast, 4 cereals, fruits, muffins, scrambled eggs, 2 types of sausage, 3 types of coffee and multiple creamers, hot teas, juices and oatmeal. It was enough to impress me to make this review!

Text: Weak shower in our room. Cable kept cutting out. Good wifi and lots of options at breakfast. Wish the fan would stay on on the AC instead of turning  on and off. Stayed a few nights. Overall, fine.
