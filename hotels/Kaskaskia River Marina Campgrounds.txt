Text: This place is under new ownership and runs smoothly with great friendly service.  Lots of repairs were made and they have very reasonable prices.  Give this place another try and you'll find it very well managed and relaxing atmosphere with great river view.  Also, the marina has a new kitchen grill that serves some very fresh dishes and are tasty indeed and they have a friendly bar to relax and enjoy some great live entertainment. Or, try the new Tiki bar located next to the boat ramps it's an awesome place to spend your afternoon listening to some great live music and being entertained by the enormous boating crowd that comes in every weekend.  Very fun place to stay!

Text: The restaurant is a simple grill with surprisingly good food.  Better that what I expected for fried foods. The staff, however, is very small, so be prepared for a long wait on a busy night.
