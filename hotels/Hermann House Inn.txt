Hermann House Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This is a fantastic place to stay, the room was beautiful and so comfortable, and located right in the heart of Herman. Can easily walk anywhere downtown or take the trolley to the vineyards. And the owners are the sweetest and kindest people.

Text: Their rooms are apartments, very clean and comfortable. The cleanest B&B we have ever visited. Nice owners, right in town for walking to everything and catching the trolleys. Will be coming again soon!

Text: The Hermann House Inn has so much to offer.  We stayed in a cozy, two bedroom, apartment-style  suite.  The beautiful kitchen had everything we needed for cooking and preparing a few meals, and the comfortable living room felt like home.  What a great place to relax with everything we needed and more! The large Jacuzzi tub was  a special treat!  The service and hospitality was commendable!  If you are looking for much more than a room, the Hermann House Inn is the place for you!!!

Text: Love this place. Everytime I am in Hermann Mo I rest my head here. So comfortable, it makes you feel right at home. Stay here and you may not want to go home. Last time I stayed here we had to extend our stay a night because we were too comfortable.
