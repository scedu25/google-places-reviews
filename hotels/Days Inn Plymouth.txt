Text: The hotel is just good for traveling if you are on a tight budget. It's one that a construction worker or company provides if they are paying for your trip... And if you company puts you here there on a budget. But it's somewhere to lay your head. Its gotta be a privately owned hotel because the way the breakfast is served it seems like they are trying to conserve on everything they can. The pancake mix gave me the  impression that it might have been mixed up several days ago and they will continue to use it until it's gone. The jelly packages we're super old because the jelly was really really gooey like it's been there for months or even years.

Text: This place smell like marijuana told front desk they did nothing.. this place is ran by a bunch of cheap asses. There's people in back looks like there selling drugs. Sleep in your car across the street at the McDonald's you'll have more luck you don't have to worry about smelling like drugs and getting possibly robbed..
