Text: Staff was fantastic. Breakfast and dinner weren't bad. Maybe a little attention to detail in the rooms - like the bathroom door had seen much better days.

Text: Clean rooms and pleasant staff.  Rooms are dated and beds are just okay. The breakfast area could benefit from more high chairs (they only have two) and a couple of boosters to better accommodate families.

Text: The included evening menu selections were fantastic, and free popcorn was a nice treat. Good coffee and breakfast was better than most hotels.  Decent wifi, clean room, comfortable beds, nice pool area (although my boys said the pool floor and walls were rough on their feet).  Friendly staff. A nice stay at a nice price, liked the perks, would stay again.

Text: I've never had a bad experience here. The rooms have always been clean and the staff courteous. The facilities are nice as well as it having a close location to any stores that might be needed. My only complaint is the thermostats. You can set the ac to 66° and the fan to high, but not to keep the fan steadily blowing. I need to noise from the fan to sleep well, it gets too quite with the fan turned off.
