Text: I stayed here for a conference and was very pleased. First off, the food was amazing. From the breakfast buffet in the Cafe, to the dinner options at the lobby bar, everything was tasty! The conference/event food went way beyond my expectations! The hotel shuttle is convenient for visiting the area, but only goes 5 miles from the hotel so if you stay here and want to visit the city, you'll need a rental car.

Text: Clearly for business people with money.  The layout off the room was odd Ann's missing essential amenities.  The bathroom sink is outside of the bathroom.  Common folks like me enjoy having a simple refrigerator and microwave.  Staff was wonderful and everything was really fancy looking.  If not for the logistics of the room I would have given a 5.  Oh the sheets... the bed and sheets were amazing.  They were so awesome!

Text: Great customer service all around. The cafe for breakfast is great. The gym was amazing but closes at 10pm. Indoor & outdoor pool. 3 stars for cleanliness of room. Unwanted hair in bathtub and excessive dust in room. Room was spacious but in need of being updated.

Text: I stayed here as a coordinator for a business group. My room felt luxurious, and the staff were very attentive. We used the shuttle to get to and from our meetings and dinner and never ran into issues. The fitness center attached to the hotel and free for guests is a fully appointed gym, with two pools, ball courts, and a full suite of equipment. I would strongly recommend this hotel.

Text: Tub was dirty. They took our mini fridge out the room. They said it was 15$ a day to rent. Carpet dirty. Our mini fridge was sitting outside our door and we ask about it and they gave us some bogus story. After being on hold for 15 minutes. My family chose this hotel for our reunion. NEVER AGAIN. THE BREAKFAST WAS EXCELLENT.
