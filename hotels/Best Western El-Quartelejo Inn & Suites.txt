Best Western El-Quartelejo Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: I checked in with two friends later in the night on 9/16/17. The front desk was very accommodating, the lobby extremely clean and our room very comfortable. Although the hotel has been there for a number of years, this property looks like it was recently constructed.

Text: Hotel was very satisfactory. Breakfast was good. That part of town smelled like a feed lot but I guess they couldn't help that. Maybe the wind was the wrong direction.

Text: Clean and quiet. I was hoping for a little better hot breakfast options but it wasn't too bad with just eggs and sausage. Also had waffles, bagels, etc. Staff was friendly.
