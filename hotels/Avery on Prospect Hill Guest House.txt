Text: I am not a huge fan of B&Bs because I have had mixed results, but my wife is a bigger fan. These guys were awesome! Best B&B experience I have ever had. Great breakfast and the service was amazing! I think Todd filled my coffee cup 7 times :P.  Room was clean and decent size. Quick 5 minute walk to downtown.

Text: My husband and I stayed this past weekend.  Candy and Todd were absolutely wonderful, and some of the nicest people we have ever met. Breakfast was amazing, and the house was very comfortable. We can't wait to book another mini vacation and go back!

Text: Wonderful location, just off the main strip in town enough that it's nice and quiet but only a short walk from everything. Amenities were very nice and the owners are very knowledgeable and helpful.

Text: Craig and Leslie are a wonderful couple that care for their guests in so many ways. While there this weekend my wife and I experienced car trouble. Craig helped charge my battery and gave me a wrench to take home to work on the car if need be. The food was excellent and the conversation even better. Thanks for making this another great trip to Galena.
