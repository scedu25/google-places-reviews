It'll Do Motel

Text: I got the little girl sounding voicemail too... lol.  But someone called me back quickly.  Big room, clean, and in good condition.  And the bed wasn't hard as a rock...yay!  I wish it had a freezer in the fridge, but otherwise, as the sign said, it'll do. Thanks!

Text: I had no choice but to stay here because a blizzard rolled through and I was stranded.  When the hotel lost power due to the winter storm,  they had no generator.  Really?!  So the only way to charge my phone was with my car.  I wound up staying in my car longer than the room which was fine considering the room smelled like feet and fish.  At least it had hot water,  hence the 2 star rating.

Text: It was a pleasant stay as we were in the basement of the convention center which had 3 bedrooms, a nice living area, a refrigerator and stove and a nice bathroom.

Text: I'm out in this area for business and I had to stay here out out of necessity. I was a little deterred by the name, but I found this motel to be fantastic! It's more like little condos/apartments than a motel. The WiFi and the TV isn't great but everything else is. It's clean and the rooms are very large and come with a washer and dryer! Coffee and fridge too. All at a very very reasonable rate. I'll probably never be in the area again but if I am I'd definitely stay here again
