Holiday Inn Cincinnati-Riverfront
Rating: 4
Text: After coming into town and booking at a undeseriable location where we decided not to stay; we found this hotel. The staff was incredible and even though we booked at the last minute, they were able to get us a room and front desk staff provided breakfast on them because we had to wait a couple hours for check in because a room wasn't available at that exact time. The room was clean, upgraded, and we loved the location. Perfect for our overnight stay to enjoy Cincinnati!

Text: The hotel is nice, however the room had a smell that we couldn't get rid of. For the price we paid there should be nothing wrong. My eyes was pleased however my nose was not!
