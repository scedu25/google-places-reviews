Disappointed with "campground".
Small office, over crowded with people(that wernt guests) Believe i heard them refrence to the crazy people all being where "they" chose i should park. Would avoid if at all possible. Otherwise clean small quite park somewhat maintained.

Text: Older RV park with mostly long-term residents--we did feel a bit out of place passing through in a Class A.  The park seemed safe and was in a decent section of town with convenient access to Arnold.  Our site was nice but the roads were in serious need of repair. Hookups were fine (no cable, lots of trees so satellite wouldn't work).
