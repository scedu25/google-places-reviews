Holiday Inn Cincinnati Airport
Rating: 3
Text: This is a nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The lobby is impressive with a large water fountain. There is a better than average gym, pool, and hot tub. The downside is that it is older and if you don't have a car there is nothing around within walking distance to eat or shop. The rooms occasionally smell of smoke or other.

Text: The whole atmosphere is very warning as soon as you walk in there is this amazing fountain. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food was amazing! My bed and pillows were so soft it felt like I was sleeping on clouds. I enjoyed my stay here.

Text: The rooms were good and the convention center space and board rooms available were great to use. The service from the staff was great as well. The amenities were accessible and nice to is as well. My only complaint is the ants. I had a few ants in the room and while out and about in the public spaces.
