Text: Very clean. Staff is polite. Room was decorated nicely. Although I was given key to someone else's room by mistake when I first arrived, it was immediately remedied.

Text: This is the worst motel I have been in in years! The hospitality crew doesent clean the rooms(found old food in the fridge). And when I washed up, the sink wouldn't drain, I wound up with a puddle on the floor!

Text: The pool was closed, the air conditioner in our room barely worked. And we didn't have cable. So it was a boring stay. The rooms need a real good cleaning too.

Text: Omg God id rather sleep in the parking lot, the floor boards have black mold on them the door doesn't lock, there roaches everywhere, the floors are fake hard wood and looks like they been laid 40 years ago, the pillows are yellow not white, the plugs don't work ,they don't even have enough plugs in room, I had to move fridge over by sink so I can plug it in, fridge has mold all over it, and mirror has drywall dust all over it. And that's 10 percent of the problem, oh and not to mention when we got our room the lady sent us to a room that already had people in it, then we go back up front to tell her and guess what?  She's sitting in there so called breakfast room smoking a cigarette wth? And dead bugs all over the floor.
