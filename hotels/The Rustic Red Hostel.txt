The Rustic Red Hostel

Text: This place is a hidden gem! Don't let the outside appearance fool you, swing in there and check it out. It's clean, comfortable, and very large inside. Can shower and get a good night sleep for $15. Also they have a kitchen area which is handy. With all you get there, its hard to beat

Text: Very clean, WiFi, showers, nice common area, and a back deck overlooking a beautiful stream. Great value for $15/person a night! The couple managing the hostel were incredibly nice and gave us tips on the couple local restaurants and good hiking trails. Very appreciated

Text: Awesome experience. We are here climbing in mid October and it's in the 30s overnight. The hostel is a great and cost effective alternative to camping out back at Miguel's. The have showers and coffee in the AM.

Text: This place is really clean. The blankets are soft and they have a beautiful deck. Oh and showers (don't have to use tokens, it's included when you pay) and the great thing is it's only $15 per bed!
