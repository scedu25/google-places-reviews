Text: The pillows are so small, they seem old so they are folded over, making them 12×12 pillows...on a king size bed being a person who likes pillows we called for more. After receiving 2 extra, we ended up going to Walmart and buying our own pillows for the second night stay. Also when arriving back to the hotel on the second day, our bed had not been made or towels replaced, called the front desk and they apologized and brought us new towels. It's still nice to have the room cleaned up and vacuumed, with bed made. There is tears in the carpet, a large stain on the floor in front of the bed, we have stayed here many times and his will be the last time.

Text: Off the beaten path. Major maintenance issues. Tall stairs (no elevators) All hallway doors have loose and worn door handles. Nothing is commercial grade... My first time here - the restroom lights did not work. The room was above the boiler and laundry (very noisy) My second time here - replaced the door handle and fixed toilet leak myself... My third and last time - cracks and patches in the bathtub floor. Carpet stains that lift the carpet ---- Why did I stay here?...company paid for it ---- Why and a 2nd star? Very quiet, lots of cameras, close to shopping area. PLAN ON CARRYING EVERYTHING UPSTAIRS

Text: This facility needs some major renovation. Cracks in sinks, holes in walls. mattresses had significant depressions and poor support. Breakfast of frozen eggs was nasty.  Personnel were nice, given the poor upkeep by owners.
