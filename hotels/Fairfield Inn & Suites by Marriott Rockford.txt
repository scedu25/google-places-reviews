Text: Clean rooms, friendly staff, one star taken because of the breakfast. Just kind of a sad spread for food, and it wasn't very good. Everything else was great! Very comfy beds!

Text: I have had had multiple 1-4 day stays at the Fairfield Inn in Rockford since Jan 2017 for business. The hotel is clear, modern, with competent friendly staff. Breakfast buffet is consistently excellent. Location is excellent with many restaurants nearby. I highly recommend this hotel especially for business travelers!
