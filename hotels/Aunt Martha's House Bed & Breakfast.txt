Text: Beautifully appointed rooms with comfort in mind! The beds were very comfortable and the room we were in was quiet and relaxing. Aunt Martha's breakfasts were supreme and she makes each guest feel right at home, as if they are family. The rates are very competitive, and with all this comfort and style, this B&B is the best place to stay if you come to this area! I will definitely use this place again the next time I am in the area! I highly recommend Aunt Martha's Bed and Breakfast.

Text: We were lucky enough to be among Martha's first guests at this newly opened B&B. Lush rooms, with super comfy beds and deep new carpets - all complemented by a hostess that makes you feel right at home!
