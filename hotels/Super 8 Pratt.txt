Text: Overall the staff was very friendly. Price was good and the room was clean. In a very good location for a traveller to stay. Convenience store, Walmart, and 3 fast food restaurants all within easy walking distance.

Text: Room was very dirty. Carpet stains everywhere, very musty smell. Bathroom smelled of mildew. I would not take my shoes off in this hotel room. We brought our luggage in, left the bathroom vent on hoping it would help and then we left for a couple of hours. The room still smelled horrible. We booked 2 nights but did not stay even one night. Asked about being refunded for one of the two nights we'd booked, manager said she's not allowed to as instructed by the owner. Pictures are deceiving. The bed against the painted wall and nice mural is only one wall, what's behind the photographer is horrible. Will not return, would advise not to book here.
