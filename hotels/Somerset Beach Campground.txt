Text: You don't even know mate what a waste of money this place was. My mate Gustav Pustinia fell down the mountain while hiking. He was only 60 years old mate. The food got me die or re ah and I nearly died drowning in my poo. I cried when i left the place. I cried with tears of happiness. My mate Adam Goodes was spotted in the forest of the camp site. Me and the boys had a good laugh and asked him to go away. All the food was from aldi. Some of the camp leaders were really mean. They took away my teddy bear and i couldnt go to bed.

Text: We've been here twice now with our church group and had fantastic experiences both times!  The lake is clean with a good beach, and the fishermen in our group were quite successful (very large bass caught last year)!  

Very family oriented.  Clean restrooms.  Lots of fun stuff to do for the kids (and quiet places for grandma)!
