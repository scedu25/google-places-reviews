Holiday Inn Chicago O'Hare Area

Text: I realize the hotel is going through some re-construction pains but looks like they are trying hard to move in the right direction.
My recent experience was while a few of us were waiting on a shuttle to the airport there was a delay.  It wasn't all that long but the hotel manager "Clint" stepped up and drove one of the shuttles for us and allowed us to arrive at the airport in time to meet our flights.  This was greatly appreciated and shows they are concerned with the experience we had during our stay.
Thank you, Job well done. BB

Text: Stayed here for 2 nights while attending a family wedding in Indiana. It was under renovation at the time, which seems to be my luck anytime I stay at any hotel chain. However, they maintained noise levels at unnoticeable levels and the place was very clean, beds were comfortable and cozy, staff was great. The attached restaurant/ bar had great food and the friendliest staff I have ever seen/met at any establishment. We only ate their complimentary breakfast each morning, but we were treated as royals each time.

Text: This hotel has improved considerably since my last visit.The staff while always friendly seems to be even friendlier. The breakfast buffet has improved with a group of servers that are very attentive. I particularly like the sausage links. They also brought a paper coffee cup with lid for takeaway coffee. The buffet is included in the price of the room. The GM was available and observing the operation. Dinner last night in the bar was a burger recommended by the server. I took her suggestion on which burger to take and she has good taste. It was delicious.

Text: Entire hotel went through a renovation in the first half of 2017 to make the look and feel more contemporary. There is a small fitness center found on the main floor behind the front desk, and an outdoor pool for use during the nice summer months. There is also a Bar Louie restaurant located off the lobby that also has an outdoor seating patio. The bar is a convenient option for travelers staying at the hotel, as well as local neighborhood residents...the only downside is that service is known by locals to be slow and subpar. Back to the Holiday Inn, it is very close to O'Hare airport, and is also walking distance to the L for easy access to downtown.

Text: Stayed for a quick layover in the Chicago area. The room was clean, staff was professional, and the Keurig in the room was perfect for a quick pick me up before my flight. The shuttle to the airport was timely and convenient.
