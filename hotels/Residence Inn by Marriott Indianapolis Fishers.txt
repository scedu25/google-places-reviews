Text: Service always wonderful. They were able to give us a good discount on the room and were happy to provide extra blankets when we asked. The breakfast is always good as well. There was scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, oatmeal and a variety of toppings. Of course there was cold cereal and milk for those that preffered it. Fresh fruit was also provided. Swimming pool was pretty warm and clean. We rarely have problems when we stay at Marriott's.

Text: Excellent hotel. The suites are nice and spacious. Like a small apartment instead of a room. Staff is nice. The breakfasts are good and the social nights are nice to have.

Text: On our second night of a multiple day stay, but it's been very good so far. Nice, clean place, with interesting room design. Would definitely stay again. Looking forward to the rest of the stay. Also, pet friendly, so if you're traveling with yours, it'll be a great fit.

Text: Had a really great stay at this location. Not only was the price right, but they have a pool, hot tub and 24 fitness center. There's also breakfast in the morning and the coffee isn't half bad. The room was very clean and there are a ton of outlets in the rooms.
