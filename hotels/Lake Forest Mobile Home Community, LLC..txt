Text: Lake Forest really will work with you, even when life has thrown you a few curve balls. The management team is friendly and understanding. The neighborhood is quiet and family friendly. The amenities are amazing. I would definitely recommend making it your home!!

Text: Recently moved in. Rick made the applying process easy and explained everything. Paula is awesome as the manager. She had the maintenance guys take the appliances out so we could use our own. She's always willing to discuss any questions you may have and gets back to you quickly. Love the community.
