Text: Check-in was easy, clerk was very nice. Parking lot was large with enough spaces for everyone. Loved the elevator rather than stairs to 2nd floor. Room was clean and good sized. Great TV with many channels. Had hard time gettng online but called customer service and they were very helpful about getting us hooked up. Beds/pillows were comfortable. Breakfast had good and plentiful options. Instead of waffle maker they had pancake maker, a nice change from the norm. Only negative was the sink and tub/shower did not drain well at all. Even having experienced that, we would return if in the area.

Text: Hotel was located right off the interstate. Check in was quick. Was dissappointed to find out the pool was closed as they were doing renovations and the website I used didn't indicate the closure. The indoor pool was the reason we booked with them. Room was spacious and comfortable. Fridge and microwave in Room. Staff was knowledgeable of area and was able to let us know of our grocery shopping options. Breakfast was satisfying and check out was quick.

Text: Excellent hotel for the price! Pet friendly with no charge for pets and a room that was safe and comfortable for our cats. Seriously the cleanest hotel room I've ever seen. One of the (longhair) cats managed to get underneath the bed frame and while I was expecting the worst, she wasn't covered in dust or even dirty at all when she came out. Very friendly staff and decent breakfast considering the price point. Would just recommend you bring your own pillow or ask for an extra, because while the bed is comfortable, the pillows aren't that great.
