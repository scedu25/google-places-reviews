Text: This was my first stay here. Everything was nice, including the staff. It's a very comfortable place and I will stay there again.

Text: We ALWAYS look for candlewood suites and love staying with them.  BUT, the grand island hotel charges a RIDICULOUS PET FEE!  $75 for a small dog, well mannered who does no damage is beyond my understanding!  
We always stay at 3 & 4 star hotels & the most we have had to pay is $25, we will no longer be staying there!!

Text: Pretty sure they didn't change some sheets from previous customers. Nice hotel, nice people, but just wasn't quite up to par. Something didn't seem right.

Text: The rooms are incredibly nice. They come with a full kitchen (full fridge and freezer, stove top, microwave, and dish washer) and are very modern. It's also in a great location (surrounded by shops/restaurants).

Text: The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean.  The beds are comfy.  It seems like it is a newer build.  Some of the doors catch on the ground like they are not hung correctly.  Overall a very chic hotel
