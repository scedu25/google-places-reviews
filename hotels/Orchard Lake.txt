Text: Worst park ever. The new manger Scott is completely incompetent and acts like its your fault for what ever happens. Just like the last manger he never opens the office doors. They are always closed. He spreads lies about people when he does not even know them. I am selling the house I bought to get out of here and away from these people. The do not know how to run a company. The last manger was never their either but at least when I called and needed something fixed it got done. If you call corporate all they say is we will look into the situation but nothing ever changes. This new guy, Scott, came from another park in Batavia where I know the manger and she ever said she was so happy to get rid of him because he was a screw up. Great way of making this place better.

Text: I don't recommend it here. The kids are out of control, stand in the street just wanting to be hit. They cuss you out for no reason, run around like they own the place. And of course the parents don't do anything. Neither does management. They destroy property openly as well. If you're looking for a nice place to live with your kids I suggest looking elsewhere.
