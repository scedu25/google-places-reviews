Text: Great place for an over night stop. Nothing too fancy. Very nice provided breakfast. Woyld be more than willing to stay again. Do note there are no major food locations near by so be prepared.

Text: I stay here each year for a conference. I'm barely in the room. It's quiet, clean, comfortable. The water pressure is good. The breakfast is tasty.

Text: I am not sure what makes this a "plus" facility. Room was small, bed was fine but nothing special. No extra blanket in the room. Breakfast was better than average with attention to detail
