Text: My family and I are very upset!! My mother made a reservation for Saturday October 14th (got a confirmation email). Went to the destination and descovered that our reservation for Saturday has been rented out to someone else because the family wanted Saturday not Friday. Old Mill did NOT try calling nor emailing my mother to try to let us know that it has been taken. The lady up front did NOT feel bad or compensate for anything! That is wrong! We drove an hour away just to drive back home! I would not recommend this place to anyone because their customer service is awful! They deserve NO stars!!

Text: A very large place which appeared the majority (and nicest) spots were permanent.
Called in advance & was told they did not have handicapped spot available.  Lady said 425 would accommodate our needs.  When we arrived the spot was grossly downhill.  No other spots were available so we left.

Text: Great place to go and relax with the Grand Kids  and play mini golf and swim. Quiet nights ,peaceful days. Mostly seasonal campers have the shade trees but still a nice place. Staff is friendly and helpful
