Text: I believe the lady's name was Chastaty (could be spelled wrong) anyhow she was amazing! The front desk was easy and she showed me my room and the perks of staying. Fantastic service. I called her with a problem about me room and she can quickly to fix it. Will be coming back again soon.

Text: Me and a friend stayed recently at this hotel.  Seemed shaky from the outside but upon entering I was greeted by Chastaty at the front desk,  she was polite and professional.  The bed was comfy as well.  We will be back again very soon

Text: Service was fantastic!!!
Rooms and lobby are just to my taste and free breakfast was delicious. Chastaty is one hell of a worker answering all of my questions and I'm an ass about where I lay my head to sleep at. Will definitely be returning back in the future expecally if she's still working!

Text: Thought it was stripper and hooker night in the parking lot. Room was clean,but since it was a smoking room it smelt like it. Also strong smell of disinfectant and air freshener in hallways and Lobby. Will find a nicer place next time.
