Courtyard by Marriott Cincinnati Covington
Rating: 3
Text: It's pretty good! The location is funny, located VERY close to a very active train track. I heard a low grade electric noise, that I thought was the elevator the whole time I was there, even though I moved rooms. It's just in the building. Also, beware weddings! You don't want to get caught up in the round about in front of the hotel with shuttles and wedding goers...So, while it's a nice Courtyard, there are several caveats that may not make it the best place to stay in the very, very lovely Covington.

Text: The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. The hotel overlooked the river, and Cincinnati. Great view. The location was good, with easy access to the freeway, and aside from the restaurant located INSIDE the hotel, there are several different dining options within a short walk outside the hotel. I would definitely stay there again.

Text: The customer service was amazing! We were upgraded to a king suite just for being a Marriott rewards member. The location is also fantastic. Perfect spot to stay if attending a game in Cincy.

Text: The location has a convenient free parking garage. Lobby has tasteful decore, overpriced food and drinks, and a small convenient store. We upgraded to a room with a view of the river... our room had a fake window and a real window (a curtain covering a wall, which made it look like a window). Signs in the room were encouraging us to not have our room cleaned and towels replaced for extra points

Text: Cozy and clean hotel. But little bit noisy by train. The rate is reasonable.
