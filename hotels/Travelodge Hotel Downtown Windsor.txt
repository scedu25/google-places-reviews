Travelodge Hotel Downtown Windsor
Rating: 2
Text: Under construction. Everything is dusty. We had a renovated room though... It was good. The window is VERY small. And the material used is very cheap. I am sure I could have broken the bathroom door my just opening it... Everything feels like paper.

Text: Undergoing renovations.  Parking is brutal.  Once the renovations are done it will be very nice.  The rooms are already done.  Modern and clean but small.  Great location on the waterfront.

Text: The Travelodge is now a Holiday Inn Express. This hitel has recently been renovated and looks amazing. Great rooms with modern decor and very comfortable beds. I will always chose this hotel when coming to Windsor.

Text: The lobby and mezzanine were completely under construction as was the pool. Best front desk personnel ever. The young woman really tried to make it a pleasant experience, but they should alert customers to the fact that this place has been under construction and likely will be for the next four months. Front desk person gets five stars, hotel 3.
