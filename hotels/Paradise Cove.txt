Paradise Cove

Text: Its a pretty good swimming hole. Great place to float with your friends and have a few drinks in the summer. There's a few cliffs you can jump from. As long as you stick to established jumping areas, know how to swim, and are aware of your surroundings you should have a good time.

Text: This place is awesome for people in their 20's - 30's. Every summer, a group of us spend a whole Saturday drinking, relaxing in our inner tubes while soaking up the sun rays. There are two or three different types of cliffs to jump off of (based on height). I think the tallest is around 70 feet, but there are also 20-30 foot ones too. It's also fun to float in and out of the the dark caves. We set up our tents early in the day, spend the whole afternoon on the water, then when night comes we start a fire and continue partying the night away! It's a great time, every year.

Text: The grounds and water are majestic, however the staff member gave us no information except "do not jump near the barrels" and yelled at us and threatened to call the sheriff as we left, for lighting the tiki torches and being on the dock .. he was rude when we checked in and every interaction thereafter was terrible. We're still going to come back. That dude just is super negative and not my problem. We did nothing wrong to our knowledge.

Text: Fun place to spend the afternoon. Kids, pets, and glass are not allowed. Be careful when jumping off the cliffs, people get whiplash all the time.

Text: $10 entry fee, lots of great cliffs to jump from. Went on a Sunday, wasn't very crowded. Apparently Friday and Saturday is more of a party atmosphere. Will be going again.
