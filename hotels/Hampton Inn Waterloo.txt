Text: We just loved this place. the beds were so soft and comfortable.  The staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful.  The breakfast was very good!!
I would stay here again!!!
In fact, I loved the pillows and sheets and comforter so much, I order myself some for at home.

Hampton Inn deserves a pat on the back for making my stay even more comfortable than my own bed!

Text: Exactly what I expect from a Hilton owned hotel.

I checked in really late and they still had me ready to rock and roll as soon as I got in. 
Check in was smooth and easy, asked if I needed a wake up cal ahead of time and everything.

Breakfast in the morning was like most Hilton, waffles, cereal, sausage, eggs, fresh fruit etc....

Highly recommend staying here if you are in the area.
