Super 8 Mattoon
Rating: 5
Text: I love Super 8 motels they are the most consistently clean and dependable chain of motels at a reasonable price I've found. I travel just about every week. This motel in Mattoon is one of the nicest I've come across. I will stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.

Text: Checked in on Friday night, they didn't have any non-smoking rooms available. I have stayed in smoking rooms before and was ok, so I said ok. Supposed to give me corporate rate. I went to room, within 2 hours, I couldn't take the smoke smell any more. Made me sick. So I went back to the desk and checked out. Girl at desk said she would give to manager Monday morning to address as I wanted a refund. The rate they promised me was gone!!!! Charged me full rate. Total scam and they won't honor the online price of $55. So I speak to Patty the general manager, and she totally did not care and basically said too bad. She would not refund my money, and wouldn't even discount it due to bad experience. Very rude. The smell was so bad my clothes even wreaked of smoke from that room. It was disgusting. Patty would not give me the owners name/number. Terrible customer service and fraud on pricing.

Text: Great room for price!  Newly remodeled rooms. A little musty but turned on a.c. and was gone in a few minutes. Very clean except shower knob needs a deep clean. Staff really nice! Will probably stay here again.

Text: Good rooms and decent breakfast buffet. A cracked sink in the bathroom. Decent as a stop in longer trips.
