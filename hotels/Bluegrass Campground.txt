Bluegrass Campground

Text: Been trailer camping for about 3 years now.  This has to be one of the most frendly campgrounds that we have been to.  Larry,  one of the owners,  was out and helped me put my camper into the site.  Got in after dark and neighbors turned on extra lights to help us see.  Thanks Larry,  we'll definitely be back.

Text: Seriously this place was amazing!!! The staff were friendly and very inviting. It was home away from home. Bathrooms, showers, laundry room all clean and stocked. The kids had a blast, with the play ground, beautiful pond with swimming on one side fishing on the other! Our son caught 8 fish. Our 2 Yorkie pups were welcomed. Well shaded. Loved this place well worth it. And it was priced well. We would definitely stop there again!

Text: Nice place. Newer bathroom house. Showers were nice and huge. Trash cans were full and some paper on floors. Nobody cleaned the restroom area in the time we were there from about 1 pm to 11 am.   Huge recreation room

Text: Had a nice fathers day weekend here with the wife and kids. Clean park and friendly people. Nice pond for fishing and swimming. They even cooked up a nice fathers day breakfast for everyone. I have camped at almost all campgrounds in the area. I will definitely plan another trip here. This is a RV park. But I am a tent camper and they have a few sites to pitch a tent right on the water. My over all experience I'm a happy camper!

Text: Went to stay at the Eco Camp, which is a tent campsite on grounds for Father's day.  The campsite was well manitained and very clean.  The showers and bathrooms were spotless.  Very friendly residence and staff.  They had free crafts for the kiddos and a nice Father's day breakfast.  Will go back again.
