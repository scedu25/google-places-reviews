Crowne Plaza Columbus - Dublin Ohio
Rating: 5
Text: The location is far enough outside of downtown Columbus that there isn't too much traffic, but close enough to get to downtown Columbus quickly. Ample free parking. The rooms are clean and lavish. The attendants for the event I helped host were courteous and professional. Very happy!!

Text: Attended the Ohio Pen Show which utilized two of the ball rooms and the hallway. The space was a bit small for the event and so it was quite crowded and hot as a result. The rooms were well kept and managed and clean. The staff was friendly and kind.

Text: Don't let the dated outside of this hotel cool you, the inside has obviously been recently refurbished and is very nice. We did the Travelzoo deal including tickets to the zoo & breakfast buffet. The staff was very friendly and made it super easy. The breakfast buffet was great and we also got to enjoy the pool which was warm and clean. My only complaints are that the tub would never drain completely during a shower and the coffee maker in the room was filthy. I'm really glad I looked inside it before just pouring water in there! Other than that, this hotel was perfect for an overnight stay. Dublin is super cute and has a lot of local options for food.

Text: The hotel is nice and quiet. Great place to get work done. The staff has been very nice. Very close to my work location but quite a distance from anything worth mentioning.
