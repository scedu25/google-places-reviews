Text: Great views. There is a nice shower and bathrooms nearby. Camper/RV stalls have two faucets. There seems to be a picnic table at each camper/RV site. Dump station is in nice shape and easy to pull in and out of.

Text: Clean, well manicured.  Quiet and mature area.  The boat dock is 10 seconds away from the campsites as well.
