Text: The hotel room was decent other than the hair all over my sheets and comforter. I asked the staff to change the sheets by the second day because they had not. They changed the sheets but there was still hair all over the sheets and comforter. The bed was uncomfortable, and every time I walked in the room it smelled like smoke. I can deal with a lot but the hair issue was disgusting. I will not be back.
