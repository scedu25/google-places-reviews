Historic Golden Hotel

Text: They started charging me for stays after I had left,  and when I brought this to their attention they told me that because it would cost more in legal fees than it would to just forget about it,  that there would be no refunds... I had to call the POLICE to make them stop.  Seriously?!  What the heck?! 

Been staying in hotels for work for years and I've  never had this trouble before. Theft!  
 The shame is that the room was really nice!  Clean and stylish.

Text: If I could give zero stars I would. I work on the road and this hotel waited 3 months to charge my debit card for a single night stay. The employee I spoke to admitted fault for improperly closing out the transaction yet was extremely rude and condescending about the situation. I work in customer service and the way she handled the matter was completely unprofessional. Steer clear folks.... unless you want 80 dollars going missing out of your bank account 90 days later.

Text: They keep taking money out of my account, using my credit card information! My card company had to file fraud claims and run an investigation. NIGHTMARE!

Text: Horrible place to stay long term, good if you just need a quick place for the night. That don't mean you'll not encounter the downfall of the place, but don't expect a refund, because they'll fight to keep your money, even if you don't end up staying.
