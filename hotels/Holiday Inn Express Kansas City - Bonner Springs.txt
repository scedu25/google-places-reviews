Holiday Inn Express Kansas City - Bonner Springs
Rating: 5
Text: This holiday inn express was very clean!!! Our room was BIG and perfect (we live 50 weeks of the year in hotels so I'm almost an expert).  The guy who was working last night was both nice and patient.  We knew as soon as we walked in the front door that we were gonna be happy here. It's very obvious that the owner cares and takes pride in this property!

Text: This Holiday Inn Express wasn't as nice as others we have been to. The carpets were very dirty. There was a wet spot when we arrived that we tried to dab up with a white towel, which then came up black. We were uncomfortable letting our baby crawl around on the floor for this reason. The toilet seat coating was peeling up, which made the bathroom appear less clean. Breakfast was good with a good variety. Our room keys had to be recharged more than once in our 3 night stay and we are aware not to keep them up against cell phones. The front desk staff was kind and helpful, although not always professionally dressed, which made them more difficult to distinguish if they were just walking around. The location of this hotel is excellent and the service was satisfactory.

Text: Very nice accommodations. I was very surprised. The bed and bedding are superb. The rooms are spotless, the breakfast selection is vast and the outdoor patio was unexpected. Good deal for the money.

Text: I had an undesirable experience. The pool was not heated, therefore we were unable to take our children swimming. Our room had a chemical smell to it. It seemed pretty obvious this was a different hotel before becoming a holiday inn. Plus side was the fitness center was well maintained with working equipment, the towels were soft (doesn't happen too often), and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast also offered a good variety, including pancakes.
