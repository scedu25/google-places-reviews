Holiday Inn Express & Suites Evansville North

Text: Clean room and excellent staff.  My only issue was the parking.  Semi trucks, and large trucks with trailers allowed to take up what would have been ample car parking.  Plenty of truck parking in the area designed for them in the surrounding area as this location is a popular off the Interstate exit.  A sign in front of the property said "No semi parking."

Text: Extremely nice room. Super clean. Love the bigger frig, coffee, microwave. We had been in room when cleaning service came by (sleeping little kid) they gave us what we needed and didn't clean because we didn't want them too. Manager came by later to make sure we had what we needed because our room had been marked as not done. Awesome she would make sure everything was fine. Breakfast was great. Pool was clean and had shower in pool area which was nice and bathroom off to side. Will be coming back to this place again when we come back up.

Text: First time visiting Evansville. We had a great room, very spacious and up to date. There were lots of outlets for all of our devices. The Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion were a nice touch. The room was very nice. Updated and very spacious. We had very helpful staff who helped us locate a nearby restaurant that was very good. The included breakfast was good but the eggs and sausage gravy could have been a bit hotter.
