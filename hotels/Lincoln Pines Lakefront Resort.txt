Lincoln Pines Lakefront Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Truly outstanding cabins! Clean, well kept and tastefully decorated. The staff is both friendly and  responsive, and the grounds and lake are immaculate. It is a wonderful, relaxing family place at which to stay, and it's also extremely close to all nearby attractions. Highly recommended!

Text: This is the most relaxed I've been in awhile. My fiance and I stayed with another couple in a 2 bed, 2 bath and we had plenty of room. The place was very clean and very organized. I have no complaints. We came during the "off-season" for tourists and were the only ones on the resort, had a bonfire each night and always found things to do around the resort. The owner was super nice and showed us around, always asked is we needed anything andtold us to take our time leaving. 10/10 recommend this place  and from what I read on their website they're looking to add more cabins to the resort. Defiantly worth your time and money.

Text: It was a wonderful experience! We had 6 adults and two children in the 2 bedroom cabin and it was plenty of room. Wish we had more time to just enjoy the cabin, lake and activities provided by resort. We will definitely be back!!
