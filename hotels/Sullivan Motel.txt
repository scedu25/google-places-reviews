Text: Nice little place, ran by an older lady who really takes good care of the customers! Great low cost, older historic roadside motel with original charm. Its not a Hilton, but its a great little place! Thanks!

Text: I called to book a night for four people and no one answered the phone. They called me back about 4 hours later and when I started to laugh because of something that my friend did the woman on the phone very rudely asked what was funny (which was none of her business) and then hung up the phone. DO NOT go to this place. Awful costumer service.
