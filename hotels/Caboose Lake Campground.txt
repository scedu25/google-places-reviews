Caboose Lake Campground
Rating: 1
Text: I like Caboose for what they have to offer and have went for a few years now. I unfortunately and regretfully have to give a bad review for the very poor compation that they have. We had planned and reserved a site for this weekend and then received news that my grandmother passed and services are this weekend. I called to request a refund but i was told that they only give refunds if you cancel 10 days in advance. How does one predict when death happens. I feel strongly that they only care about getting paid in whatever way they can. I don't plan to give them my hard earned money any more. If they can't give me a refund under these circumstances they don't deserve my money.

Text: Pros: Beautiful lake with lots of nice mowed lawn. Flat level spots for campers.
Cons: too close to Highway very loud. Bathrooms are very far away for half of the park. There should be a second bathroom on the other side of the lake. They have a laundry and an  RV supply store but no detergent for sale. Store is supposed to open at 10 AM but they arrive at 10:20 AM with a line of people waiting to get in and buy things.
