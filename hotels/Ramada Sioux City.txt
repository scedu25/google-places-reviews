Text: Nice and serviceable overnight hotel for a budget. Clean room and decent staff. Was being renovated when we were there, so it was a bit more of a mess than usual.

Text: Service has been ok, they cleared up a booking issue that their own website caused and have been helpful and apologetic about it. Room was not very cleaned when we checked in but they we're good about doing it up right and proper after we asked about it. Have had a lovely stay otherwise!!

Text: Old old hotel average place above average beds rooms somewhat outdated flat screen tvs. Ac/heat could be a cause of respiratory infections.  Decent breakfast.

Text: The hotel itself was pleasant. Great location by food and the event center. When I checked in though they had me down for two rooms instead of one. I attribute this to an error message I received on the Ramada corporate site when I was booking where it told me my reservation didn't go through and I clicked submit a second time. But the person who checked me in said that she would cancel that second room so hopefully we're good
