American Elite Inn

Text: The staff is real nice but the room I had was very messy and unclean. I found some sort of bug in the bathroom and 3 little bugs on the beds and a swarm of nats to fight. The beds are like literal rocks. The ground I believe is just beat by a smidge for softness. I slept for 2 hours on the bed and couldn't fall back to sleep because of the cramps I had. Other than all that, the staff here is nice and provides lots of pillows. Lord knows you need it because you basically need 10 pillows to sleep in a sort of comfortable position. The breakfast to me was actually good in a way. But again since they have very kind employees I feel they will do so much better in the future rooms. It's not my last stay but it will do for a while.

Text: My stay at American Elite Inn was great. The room was clean and housekeeping checked to see if I needed the room cleaned each day. Fresh towels were brought daily. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.

Text: Front desk staff was very nice since it took 20 minutes to get a card to work for my door. Then No Wi-Fi signal. After trying all day nothing. Still have emails that need sent that are not gonna get done. A/C works great but does have a stringent smell. Over all room was clean but definitely way outdated.

Text: Inn is basic, clean, and affordable.  Used to have a breakfast buffet of milk, coffee, juice col cereal, breakfast pastries, biscuits and gravy, waffles, yogurt, and fresh fruit, usually apples and bananas.  This visit there was no yogurt, fresh fruit or jelly for the toast or breakfast pastries.  This was to cut expenses, per staff.  The lack of these choices makes the buffet a bad choice for diabetics, such as I, to eat there.
