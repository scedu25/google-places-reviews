Biddle Hotel & Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was like a castle with awesome working spaces for students and faculty members alike. 
Service was great, exceptionally tidy, we'll lit room with enough free  space in the room. No odor or fungus in bathroom or corridors. 
Bed & pillows were very comfortable. Loved it. 
Would highly recommend to all visitors staying in Bloomington.

Text: My experience is beyond my expectations. Not only is within the amazing campus of IU-Bloomington, voted the most beautiful University campus in USA, the rooms are outstanding, good taste and very clean. The service from the moment you enter and at all time is a 5 star. I would highly highly recommend this place 100%. Excellent for meetings. I only missed a bath robe but no complains because everything else is super.

Text: Had an excellent stay at the Biddle Hotel and Conference Center! The room was small but will furnished, clean, and comfortable. The hotel is close to a lot of campus attractions and dining. It appears that some of their renovations are incomplete so going around corners might find you in a less appealing hallway but everything is still very pleasant. Keep an eye on the bus schedule too - it's a bit of a hike from the airport and not timing your flight with the bus can mean multi hour stays at the airport.
