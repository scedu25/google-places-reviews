Wilderness Road Guesthouses
Rating: 5
Text: As a NYC transplant planning a destination wedding in the state I grew up in, I wanted my guests to see the absolute best of KY.  Wilderness Road Guesthouses impressed everyone!  Renting either a room in the adorable rustic industrial hotel, or in the home-away-from-home cottages, you can’t go wrong.  (Our group did both.)  Candace oversees both with an ever-present smile and an ability to take care of anything you might need.  My new husband and I plan on re-visiting for many anniversaries to come.
