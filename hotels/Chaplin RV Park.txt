Text: strange place is my best description.  mostly longer term tenets, strange vibe, odd location.  recommend using other local options, maybe fairground?

Text: This place is a joke! Stayed there for the state fair. It's run down, everything's broken and the owners are rude. They have signs posted everywhere basically saying do this or you'll get kicked out. Location is the only good thing I can say about this place otherwise it's just a scam. No where near worth the $30 a night we had to pay.

Text: Wi-Fi issues sometimes,  but usually get it going when you let them know.  Quiet,  except for the factory at night.

Text: Charged my group two times and wouldn't refund even after showing him the receipts. We should NEVER have to pay 90 dollars for a patch of gravel. I feel very disrespected and cheated.
