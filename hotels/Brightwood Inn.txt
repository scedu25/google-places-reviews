Brightwood Inn

Text: Brightwood is a charming place. It's a little scruffy around the edges but the rooms are comfortable and quiet, breakfast was delicious, and it's conveniently located just down the road from the park. Great for a get away with your significant other. Got kids? Stay down the road.

Text: At last, quiet. I can write. I can think. The simple pleasure — the luxury! — of closing a door, and I find myself again. A breeze in the open window brings the scents of wildflowers and... something that tugs a memory. I shiver in the late summer heat. Outside, beyond the tended lawn, prairie runs rampant. An arch opens from ordered grounds into a chaos of stinging nettles, bloodthirsty ticks and varmints hiding in the untamed brush. It inspires a terror like that of open, trackless sea. I don't trust the flash of gossamer white I spy on the horizon, ghosting through the tall grass. The late afternoon sunlight over wide horizons is tricksome. I've come too far to be haunted by familiar ghosts. The desk where I set up my typewriter — yes, I still use one — faces away from the window. But there's an itch between my shoulder blades when I turn my back. I read to escape. Why can't I write to do the same? Why does the blank page draw me back to the things I deliberately put behind me? I'm one, maybe two, bourbons away from charging through that arch and putting the past back where I left it. Six feet underground. Maybe this time I'll dig deeper.

Text: Very quiet, serene setting surrounded by state parks. Our room was spacious and comfortable with all the necessities provided. Our breakfast was delicious each morning and our host also had a habit of leaving her guests cookies to enjoy throughout the day. During the day we hiked the local state parks and marveled at the beauty of the waterfalls. Dinner was close by and very reasonably priced. Our favorite evening activity was to sit on the back patio or gazebo to watch the sun go down or to enjoy the plethora of birds that visited the feeders.
