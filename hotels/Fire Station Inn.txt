Fire Station Inn

Text: Great place! We truly enjoyed using this unique building for the weekend to meet family. It is well stocked with dishes, linens, coffee and other small items. The upstairs loft was really spacious and the living room worked well for visiting. It was a quick drive in to downtown to go do some things and eat. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a little privacy but still want a unique "bed & breakfast" type experience that you check this out. Oh, and the antique firetruck parked in the garage to take a look at definitely puts the icing on the cake. Would use again!

Text: Great value, walk right in and make yourself at home! Clean, and plenty of space. Not to mention the 1940's firetruck in the garage..
