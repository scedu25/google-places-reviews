Days Inn & Suites Terre Haute

Text: Had booked 3 rooms. ALL smelled of chemicals, like flea fumigation or something. They were on upper level. Carpets felt dirty. Breakfast was so-so. Waffles were good. Outside looked great, but don't let that fool you. Staff was pleasant. Would not recommend.

Text: The room smelled like someone had poured an overload of carpet fresh on the carpet, if we were not so tired we would have left.
I did not sleep at all, my body itched all night.
Sent my husband to the store to get a plug in deodorizer but nothing was going to kill that smell. The building is dated and needs an upgrade 10 years ago!!!
KEEP DRIVING!!

Text: Never again!!! The best I can say is that there were no bugs. But the place was old, run-down, dated & worn. The clientele seemed to include a lot of full-time live-ins that were doing their automobile repairs in the parking lot until 11pm. Bulldoze this place and rebuild!

Text: 0/5 stars. I’m in Indiana for work and l had no choice but to stay here due to all other hotels being booked. When I arrived to my room, It was missing the alarm clock, dirty/used soap bar in the shower, toilet paper roll was empty and room stunk of cigarettes and musk. I was also missing a “do not disturb sign.” When I got back to my room after work the next day, I noticed my makeup was missing from my bag as well as my hair straightener. As livid as I was, I went to the front desk politely with an itemized list of my belongings missing and I was told that they would “figure it out tomorrow.” Needless to say, I’m packing my suitcase in my car when I leave in the morning! Stay clear!!

Text: I enjoyed my stay. Prity, the manager, was especially helpful. As was Don, the maintenance guy. They were polite and friendly. They helped me with a small problem I had. I would certainly recommend this hotel to others.
