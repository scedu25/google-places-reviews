Text: Great customer service. Clean and very well maintained. The breakfast that is included us so great and the breakfast buffet attendant (Brian) was so courteous and ready for anything that we needed. As well as the entire staff that we encountered were GREAT.

Text: The location was very easy to locate. Its right off the main highwqy in lees summit and they have recently installed a new traffic light at the intersection directly in front of the location which mqkes it even easier. I had zero issues with any of the staff, they were all very happy to help with anything i needed. It was easy to locate the meeting room that my company booked as the location was quite conveniently placed. Over all it was a great visit.

Text: Overall this hotel was clean, the staff was curtous, and the facility was nice. My only complaint was there seemed to be an issue with the plumbing in the bathroom sink. Something foul would start to smell when the water ran. We asked the front desk to have it fixed while we were out for the day. They had someone take a look at it, but whatever they did it wasn't a 100% fixed. I assume this was an isolated issue. Still though it just put a real damper on our stay when we couldn't use the sink without smelling sewage. As I said at the top of this review, otherwise everything was reasonable and enjoyable.

Text: I had an amazing stay. The room was clean and comfortable. They pay close attention to detailing their rooms which adds to the experience. It was close to the Lee's Summit plaza which was a bonus as well. Good breakfast, just wish it were served a little later on weekdays as I almost missed it. Overall great time!

Text: Absolutely the best. Stayed there several times with my three girls and they could not have treated us better. My kids looked forward to seeing the hotel team because they treated us like family. I cannot say enough good things about the job the team does here!!!!!
