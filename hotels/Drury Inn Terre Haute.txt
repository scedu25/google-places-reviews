Drury Inn Terre Haute
Rating: 5
Text: My husband and I stayed here for a week on a business trip and we absolutely loved our stay! They serve hot breakfast with eggs and sausage every morning, though they have lots of other options - oranges, bananas, waffles, donuts, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, and even biscuits and gravy. The coffee is good, there's a soda fountain and a juice machine. There's staff all over the place that are extremely courteous and willing to help given the chance! We didn't bring bathing suits but there's a nice indoor pool. They serve popcorn and sodas 3-9 and have a hot dinner every night 530-7. Changing menu means it's not the same thing either! For adults they also offer alcoholic beverages with dinner! Our room was nice and clean with a microwave, mini fridge, desk and small flat screen. Overall this has probably been my favorite hotel we've stayed in! We will likely check out their other facilities when we travel if we can!

Text: The hotel was undergoing some renovation while we were there.  It will be even better once the renovations are complete.  The breakfast and evening meals offered a good variety of selections.  Would definitely stay there again.  The staff was very friendly.

Text: Everyone I had dealings with at this establishment was very friendly and willing to help in any way they could. This is the first time I have stayed at a Drury Inn and I was pleasantly surprised when I checked in. Upon my arrival I was met with a very nice lady and she explained about the breakfast of the morning and the cocktail bar and hot food bar in the evening. This is nice to have when you are working and just want to relax. The shirt I was wearing expressed my personal thought on our 2nd amendment and the staff complemented me for wearing it, and proceeded to inform me of the local gun ranges. I really appreciated this, and if I'm ever in the Terre Haute area again I will definitely be staying at this hotel. I travel a lot and hands down the Terre Haute Drury Inn makes you feel welcome and at home. My stay was in August of 17 and one of the employees mentioned that they were starting a remodeling project next month. I look forward to seeing what they do, it is already a very clean place. Thank you for the week I spent with you all.
