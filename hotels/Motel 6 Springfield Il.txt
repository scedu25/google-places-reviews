Text: The staff are always accommodating especially the General Manager Johnathan. The other staff are great to such as Raymond, Raven, the evening girls and the overnight guy (can't remember their names). I suggest everyone to stay there as it is the best bang for your buck. The staff are always willing to help you in anyway. The housekeeping staff on the 2nd floor are super. I stay there about 4-8 times a month.

Text: The place is very Pet friendly. We were able to take our two dogs, one of which is quite large, at not extra charge. They also provide Military discounts, which is wonderful. Most of the staff was lovely, except for the rude Asian lady who refused to let me use their microwave to heat my infants formula, so we had to get a water warmer for the duration of our stay, which was very invonvenient. The room we stayed in was small and there was no microwave or fridge and it had a strange odor, but it seemed pretty clean.

Text: Had a great stay! Very comfortable bed, nice tv and really nice motel. Staff was extremely nice as well! Will be back again. Thanks so much for the best nights sleep I had in 12 days on the road.

Text: I've stayed here several times over the past few years, and it is not as clean as it used to be. Front desk staff is still friendly, and it's convenient and inexpensive. The last time I stayed here, however, my non-smoking room was pretty smoky (the shower curtain reeked of cigarette smoke!) & could have been cleaner (big dust bunnies under the bed). I would still stay here as a quick, cheap stop, but don't expect too much.
