Star Lite Motel
Rating: 5
Text: I have to give this place props. It's one of those old fashioned, U-shaped motels from the 60s. I've stayed in a bunch of them. Always less than 60 a night. I never expect much. Cable TV is usually a bonus. The Star Lite went well beyond that. When I opened the door and saw how clean and well laid out it was, I was already pleased. When I saw they had a coffee maker and supplied shampoo, they surpassed my expectations.  Much better than a Motel 6 or Super 8. And WAY better than the usual "dieing motor lodge" I've stayed at in the past. 

One complaint: all three lights were on a single wall switch. I couldn't turn on a reading lamp without having the overhead on.

The 5 Stars is to help weigh the rating. No we're not talking the Hilton here. But much better than you expect. Thanks to owners that care.

Text: Don't listen to the bad reviews!! This place is nice. Its clean quiet and safe with a great price and free WiFi that works great. The owner is nice and just because he has limited English doesn't mean that he is rude. He cares about the building enough to keep it in good condition

Text: Visited coworkers here, was a bit run down and in need of maintenance but not the worst place I've seen yet. The owners can be a bit difficult to deal with. One of my coworkers had his wife & kid come join him in the motel for a week and they charged more for the wife. Then when they saw there was a baby, added on an extra charge. (like having a pet.)
