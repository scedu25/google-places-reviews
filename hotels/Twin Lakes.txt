Text: Is it possible to even give no stars or negative rating?? Called to see what was available if it would even be worth looking into and they would not tell me if there was anything open that was close to what I wanted. Wanted my whole life story but wouldn't give me any info. Also told me that I was NOT allowed to have my registered service dog on thier property! Discrimination!!!! I have reported them. Do NOT buy from this company. Drugs, alcohol, and violent people are all they will sel/rent to!!  Twin lakes mobile home park posey county indiana is the trashiest place to live.
