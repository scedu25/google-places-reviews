Text: Amazing hotel. Very up scale. Convenient location right off the freeway. Many places for food in walking distance. The rooms were very clean. There was even a dispenser for the shampoo/conditioner/body soap. The garbage cans needed some plastic bags though. The concierge was very nice and had a conversation with me about traveling with my pet. There was a little store for food and necessities. Vending machines with soda located on some levels.

Jeff at the front desk was wonderful and eager to help with all of my questions. He deserves a raise.  :). Thanks again, Jeff!

Caron Hill (manager of housekeeping) was very nice and made sure my stay was perfect.  Thanks again for all your help Caron!!! 

If I'm in the area again I will make sure to stay at the Drury, great staff and room was clean!

Text: Very nice hotel. Easy check-in process. Clean room. Good breakfast. Comfy king-bed. Tiny restroom. My wife and I have stayed at the Drury on Mid-Rivers several times and it's always been a good hotel.
