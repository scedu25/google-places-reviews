Text: I call this place the murder motel.... It's something you would see on a scary movie. It's old and run down, it smells bad, the bedding has burn marks and the shower is moldy... BUT this place is mostly occupied by HUNTERS so they don't care! And if they don't care, management will never update it or make repairs. Do not come here expecting a fresh clean and modern room.... you will not find that. What you will find is 4 walls, a door with a lock, a shower with barely any water pressure and a bed that is NOT comfortable. BUT it sure beats driving 4-5 hours at the crack of dawn to go hunting. And all the people staying here have always been nice. Though I joke and call it the murder motel nothing scary has ever happened here. They will even let you hang your deer outside!! Pretty awesome!
