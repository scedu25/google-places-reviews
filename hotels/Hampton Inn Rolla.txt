Hampton Inn Rolla
Rating: 5
Text: The staff were very friendly and helpful. One person even took me over to show me where I could park the bus if the parking lot got too full. The bed was comfortable as well, which is the most important thing. This was my second Hampton stay in mid Missouri this weekend, and they were both amazing. Would definitely recommend.

Text: Hampton Inn Rolla was quite easy to access from the highway. The room was extremely neat and clean the beds were awesome the pillows were totally comfortable and the towels are soft as feathers. The staff was quite accommodating and extremely helpful. The soup and cookies they served the evening I was there was delicious and quite filling and a very unexpected gratuity from the hotel.

Text: Recently renovated. The check-in lady was warm and welcoming. Our room was comfortable, as expected from all Hampton Inns. Regarding breakfast, the waffle batter was so thick that not only myself but others assumed the dispenser to be empty. I kindly approached the lady attending the breakfast quarters. She was blunt in responding that the batter is full and I just needed to be patient. We walked to the dispenser. Yet, she couldn't get it to dispense. She insisted I continue to pull the lever to allow the batter to run into my cup. It was clumpy and visually unappealing. After nearly one minute with only an ounce dispensed, I threw the cup into the trash and nibbled on an English muffin. I must say, I expect waffles from Hampton Inns. It didn't happen, this morning. Instead, I had a grumpy employee. Others attempted to bring the issue to her attention. Eventually, I overheard her telling people she thinned the batter. I left. Other than the waffles, I recommend this Hampton Inn.

Text: Awesome breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms, the staff are friendly and helpful people.  Recently renovated inside and out, easy access off and on to I-44. I suggest if your traveling by and your in need of a great place to relax and unwind this would be the place. Another great perc is they also serve dinner Monday through Thursday. How cool is that!!

Text: Nice hotel. Only drawback is their central exhaust system.  It runs continually in the bathroom.  Had to close the bathroom door during the night.
