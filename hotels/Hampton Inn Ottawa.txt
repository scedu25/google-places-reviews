Text: This is a great place to stay at. When we come over for our reunion we stay here. Very clean rooms. The pool is great and so is the weight room. I highly recommend this place. The service desk people treat you like family.

Text: It was a nice friendly place. My only complaint was the bed was so low and too soft that I had a backache within an hour of trying to fall asleep. Everytime my husband moved, it felt like I was in a water bed.

Text: Clean hotel, nice rooms. Staff is friendly and the breakfast was fantastic: waffles, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, pastries, and so much more. The breakfast was fully stocked, even at 9am when we eate. You got your firm and soft pillows, so our bases are covered. I recommend this place.

Text: Beds were comfy, nice location next to places to eat so we could just walk. Check out was noon which was perfect for our trip. Only issue was the refrigerator was loud when it would kick on.

Text: Nice sizes room, clean and well maintained facilities. Few small problems like the bathroom drain not working well and couple breakfast items poorly cooked or missing. Overall it was a good experience.
