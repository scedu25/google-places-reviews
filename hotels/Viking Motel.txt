Text: Not very happy with the service, Got here Saturday noon 10/7/2017   left 10/12/2017 only got our room cleaned 1 time. Every other motel we have stayed at your room was cleaned every day. Will not stay there again.

Text: Outdated, small beds, rustic at best.  Plenty of dead bugs.  There are other better inexpensive options nearby in Salina.  It backs up to a liquor store and is across the street from a gas station/ convenience store.  No other amenities.

Text: Charmfully outdated but clean.  Friendly staff.  If you're picky, it might not be for you.  But I was looking for a clean inexpensive room for the night.  This fit the "bill" exactly as I needed.

Text: This hotel was just what me and my spouse were looking for. It was functional, relatively clean, and inexpensive. However I imagine that most people would find it outdated. But we really enjoyed it, and the staff were great.
