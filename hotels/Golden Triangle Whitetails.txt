Golden Triangle Whitetails
Rating: 5
Text: Mike and KP are at the TOP of the heap in every facet of whitetail management and guiding to some absolute slammer bucks! All guides are ready and prepared. The lodge and accommodations are great as are the meals. I have been to several whitetail outfitters in the midwest and they are far and above others. You will NOT be dissappointed!

Text: Ask for a list of every hunter that was in camp the year before.  This is a pure numbers game for these guys. 45 guys in camp for shotgun season,  google these guys and do your research i hunted with Mike and there are outfits that are 100 times better, 10 percent of the guys and 1/2 price.  Take my advice , you will be disappointed! Dont say you werent warned!

Text: This year will be my 10th consecutive year hunting with my good friend Mike Pavlick and son, and head guide Kyle i.e. K.P.  This is an experience of a lifetime to pursue trophy Whitetail deer. Mike and K.P. manage the properties in a superior fashion. They don't overbook or overhunt the wonderful farms they own or lease. Every year, I have seen trophy whitetails, although I haven't always been able to close the deal.  The other hunters in camp, always are good for some hard laughs. Our hunting party has grown from 2 hunters to 7 hunters, once you hunt with GTW, you won't look elsewhere for a trophy whitetail hunt.  Rick the camp cook will make your mouth water with his tasty dishes. Alan Wade and his lab SCOUT will find your deer if tracking is needed.  I couldn't rate this hunt any better.  Cut the chase with the commercial outfitters and book your hunt with GTW, you won't regret that decision.
