Text: I was booked here through work. The hotel is centrally located to many different stores. My room was clean. My biggest problem was the Wi-Fi did not work. Being here for a week on business that was crucial.

Text: We've stayed alot of places in our travels.. this was the less liked of places in 15 years. The smell, was one thing we noticed upon entering & it wasn't any better in the so-called upgraded room! We reluctantly paid over $150 & it truly was no better than a $65 room at its finest. The beds are not comfortable.  Maintenance on the interior appears to be insufficient for the revolving door we're certain that their location experiences.  IF this is a newly renovated location...they need their monies back!
