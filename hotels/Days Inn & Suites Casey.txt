Days Inn & Suites Casey
Rating: 5
Text: I booked this hotel room on Expedia a few weeks prior to the solar eclipse not realizing demand has been so high. The only room they had left listed was a smoking room. I booked it anyway since I'd only be there one night. I didn't check in until nearly 2am. The young man who checked us was very cordial and offered to carry my bags up to the second floor for me. Breakfast was your typical food. They had a waffle machine though. What really stood out that made me give this hotel 5 stars was the fact that they made sure I had a non smoking room after they found out I was a non-smoker. Thank you!

Text: I wish there were more choices in town.  This hotel seemed great online so we added a day to our trip and started with visiting Casey.  The lady at the front desk was nice.  We checked into our first room and although it was supposed to be non smoking it wreaked of smoke.  We tried to open the window to get rid of the smell and realized it did not lock and was off the track.  There was also no screen.  We went and asked for a new room.  We were quickly taken in person to a second non-smoking room.  This room smelled worse of smoke.  The desk lady turned on the fan and opened our window stating that the last visitor must have smoked.  It was a stale smoke smell not recent.  She brought air freshener down and sprayed the room and left the spray for us.  There was no pool for our kids.  I was unable to sleep due to the smell and constant noise in the parking lot.

Text: My gf and I were driving from ST Louis to Columbus and need a place to stay the night. Stephanie at the front desk was extremely friendly. The rate was the cheapest we could find along the middle of I-70 we were traveling. The room was nicer then the hotel we had been staying at on vacation. Wonderful stay for the last minute situation we were dealing with.
