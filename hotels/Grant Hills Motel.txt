Text: this is better than staying at a major corporate motel or hotel chain. This is a 10 it's a hidden gem. 
 
hospitality is fantastic the rooms are clean.

The mattress on the beds are so comfortable you don't want to get out of them. 
The management at the front office always has a smile on her face and also  my dog feel so happy to be here. 

There's so many things to do around here but if you just don't want to go anywhere you could stay on the property and go swimming have a bonfire barbecue play in the yard or just relax. 

We will at least try to come back here at least twice a year if not more. 

 Thank you for a wonderful weekend.

Text: I was very impressed with this place. It was clean, curteous employees, great rates for a three bed room. The only suggestion I have is, don't walk bare foot on the walk way, the gravel is loose and its harsh on the bare feet .
Personal belongings were left in a drawer in the room and I called after I was home - Terri was super sweet and found it and mailed it back within a couple days! Very thankful for that!

Text: Very reasonable and newly updated by cable t.v. show featuring the rehab and upgrades. Nice pool and country setting on edge of town.
