Lost Trail Cabins
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice cabins! I stayed in the second one (brown roof?) We had about 7 girls in there. So it was pretty cramped bc they are small. Be careful on the stairs! Very steep. The driveway is long and FULL of pot holes with lots of hills. Nice people! They have huge German Shepard dogs greeting you when you check in at their home. I wasn't a fan of that bc I'm scared of dogs?????
