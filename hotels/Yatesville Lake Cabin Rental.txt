Yatesville Lake Cabin Rental
Rating: 3
Text: Pro:
-Really nice view from the spacious deck on the back and side of the building. Plenty of comfortable chairs for enjoying said view.
-Almost no traffic as the cabin is on a dead-end road near the top of the hill.
-Cabin was very clean, as were the sheets and towels.
-Living room area was pleasant, with a high ceiling and large windows. Furniture was nice. 
-Near a state park with hiking trails and other amenities. In the summer we could have gone out on the lake. 

Con:
-Oven broke. Maintenance guy was supposed to replace it but never did. Thus we had to change cooking plans for the weekend due to no oven.
-The hot tub fell victim to an electrical problem of some sort. We were able to enjoy it but not all weekend. It's also a bit small as hot tubs go.
-The driveway to the house was so steep that only one of the cars, an all wheel drive, could get up it. Others had to park in the yard. This would have been a problem, had it been muddy or if we hadn't been fit enough to haul our stuff uphill.
-Steep roads with hairpin turns might have been terrifying in snow. We're lucky that the weather was unseasonably warm.
-Only one bathroom! You can have up to 10 people sleep here, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Text: This place is fantastic for a weekend getaway. Went here for a business retreat and had a blast. Way more comfortable than a hotel. I think the mattresses were tempurpedic? I've never slept harder away from home

Text: The cabin was fantastic! Great location. The cabin was decorated perfectly. Our stay was comfortable and it felt like a home away from home!  The creature comforts like video games, DVDs and fully stocked kitchen made this a place we'll definitely return to in the future.
