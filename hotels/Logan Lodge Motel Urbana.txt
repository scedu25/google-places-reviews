Logan Lodge Motel Urbana
Rating: 1
Text: After checking the Logan Lodge website. It appeared to be a nice place. I checked in the room it looked nothing like the pictures on the website. It lied and said there was 32 inch flat screen tv. My room had a small box tv. The toliet had old pee in it. The water smells like metal due to well water. They had no non smoking rooms so I was forced to stay in a smokers room. The remote control was filthy. Luckily i had clorox disinfectant wipes. The room was just over all poor quality. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Text: Bed bugs are everywhere. DO NOT STAY HERE!  They take your money and take 15 hours to give it back. Water stinks, room dirty,  only clean twice a week,  and God forbid you run out of toilet paper. You been warned!
