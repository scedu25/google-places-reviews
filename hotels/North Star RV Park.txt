North Star RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: While driving home from vacation and having tire troubles we found this RV park as our nearest destination. Jim was so helpful in finding us a tire shop and getting us settled for the evening. He was personable and hospitable. We found the unusual size tire we needed and were back on the road the next day! Thanks for your help Jim!

Text: We had a great experience. The people were very friendly and helpful. If we are ever back this way we would stay again. It was very clean.

Text: Very clean and neat.  All pull-thru sites.  Kind of a stretch to get the electric to reach.  Owner is pretty brusque and  no-nonsense, but very professional and reasonably personable.  No longer has a pool.
