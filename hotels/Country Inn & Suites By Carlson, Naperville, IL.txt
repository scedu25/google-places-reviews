Text: Super soft and fluffy pillows an extra comfortable bed, made for a great night's rest.  Our shower head was convertible from rain shower to massaging blast for achy neck muscles.  We ate at the Breakfast Bar which had options for every kind of dietary needs. The best I've ever been to.  I would definitely stay again & again!

Text: Not too far from shopping stores. Rooms are very clean, spacious, atmosphere was very pleasant. Front desk person was awesome at his job handling phone and checking us in for a family with three rooms and having a line behind us!

Text: Country Inn and Suites was the perfect place to book our hotel wedding block! The wedding coordinator, Marissa, was a pleasure to work with and quickly responded to all our questions and requests! The complimentary breakfast was delicious and the complimentary shuttles we earned with room nights were wonderful! Our guests also loved the lounge and bar in the lobby after the wedding reception ended. We had a very comfortable stay in our bridal suite and appreciated the kind gesture of champagne, chocolates, and a gift basket in our room! I highly recommend the Country Inn and Suites for a relaxing, fun, and comfortable place to stay in Naperville!

Text: Check in was very easy. The staff is pleasant. We had very noisy neighbors and asked to be moved. Our request was accommodated without any issues. Our new room keys and cart were brought to us. The breakfast is decent. The rooms are clean. I have no complaints.

Text: Nice hotel, undergoing renovations at the moment. The staff is quite friendly and they are very nice with guests. The hotel is a bit hidden from the main road, but still has quick access to the highway and is only 10 minutes from the downtown area plus has shuttle service there. The carpets need a bit of remodeling but overall it's still a good homey place to stay.
