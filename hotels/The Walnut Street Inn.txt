The Walnut Street Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Gorgeous rooms with excellent staff. The couple that runs the Walnut Street Inn is kind, accommodating, and clearly very hardworking. The place was spotless, we had access to everything we needed for our stay. Couldn't ask for a better location, right on the square and within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. The street noise below didn't bother me, but earplugs are provided if you need them.  Highly recommend. If you stay here, you won't want to stay anywhere else when you're in Bloomington.

Text: Great room, very comfortable. Be sure to double check your emails for check in information as it is very specific. Sheets and linen were clean, there wan an interesting collection of stuff left behind under the bed. I found it as I was trying to figure out why the t.V. wouldn't work

Text: Great!! It's on the square. It was a little noisey but you didn't mind and ear plugs were provided. I hosted a small get together in the communal kitchen/bar area and it was so much fun! 
 My husband and I stayed in the maple room, it's absolutely beautiful. I had an opportunity to meet the new owners and they are so personable and they wanted to do everything they could to make our visit special, they did and can't wait to come back.
