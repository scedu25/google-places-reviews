Text: Stayed here three nights, have no complaints!! Front desk was very pleasant and helpful. Room was nice and clean, well worth the price. Parking is easy and the hotel is close to everything you could need. We will definitely be back!

Text: This was one of the worst experiences I have had at any hotel. Yes it's a bit run down but that doesn't mean it should not be clean. The rooms are old and dingy the one bed definitely showed a sag in the mattress why it hasn't been replaced is beyond me. The bathroom was dirty and I won't even discuss the shower head. The TV Received every other channel that was watchable. Breakfast the next morning was even more of a disaster the sausage was not even cooked and looked gray plus there were no eggs because the food truck didn't arrive but we were told that there would be eggs the next day!!! We were leaving that morning. When we were leaving what did I see but a beautiful green pool full of algae. Sorry Ramada but this is a one and out for me and my group.

Text: Great breakfast, nice pool. Very friendly helpful staff, day & night, for my 2 night stay! ? However the room was small & smelled a bit moldy!? #161 Needs a Deep clean! We tried to rent an additional room, so we would have more space. But all the rooms were booked. I guess thats not your fault, but mine. Wonderful front desk customer service!?

Text: Very nice hotel with comfortable beds and friendly helpful staff. The breakfast is what you'd expect. The area is not noisy. Not enough Nerf darts.
