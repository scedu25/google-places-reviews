Iowa House Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms are dated but very clean.  The staff was very polite.  This hotel was cheaper than the chain hotels.  The walls are paper thin.  The bed and pillows were comfortable. Will definitely stay here again.

Text: The place was definitely dated and not very clean...however the views were top notch as well as the service. Beautiful campus within walking distance to the stadium. Take shuttles at your own risk. Overcrowded and stuffing. Overall the experience is one to remember.

Text: The location is the best part of this hotel. You cannot beat the proximity to campus. The beds were comfortable enough. The size of our room was smaller than other hotels but fine for two people. The Continental breakfast was not impressive. Coffee, prepackaged pastries, cereal, yogurt, oatmeal packets, bread and bagels. The juice machine was not functioning. We will probably look for a different hotel next time we visit.

Text: We stayed at the Iowa House during our visit to the Iowa State Campus. The staff were very friendly and we really enjoyed the suite with a loft. The hotel is well decorated, and has a great living room area for meeting and relaxing. The breakfast was excellent. I only wish we had had more time to enjoy being at the hotel. We will stay there again.

Text: Very convenient! It was great to be in the Student center and so close to food and a coffee shop inside! Beautiful view of the river. Just so you're not surprised; rooms are not cleaned well. Junk in the drawers and under bed, and food in the microwave. Towels do not match. This hotel is nothing fancy but it is very convenient and close to CWRC. (Rec facility) This and free parking made it all worth it.
