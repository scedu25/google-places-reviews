Text: Everything was perfect. It was right in the path of totality of the 2017 Eclipse, and we stayed there for it. The staff was always very nice without exception, and the rooms were nicer than we had expected. We were very happy about the fact that they had air conditioning. Our room had 2 queen beds, a fridge, a full bathroom, and some rooms had microwaves. The Subway that shares the same building is open until 10 so it's really convenient as far as getting something to eat goes. At night we saw all kinds of frogs (maybe toads), cicadas, and giant grasshoppers hanging out outside our door so if you haven't really ever seen a lot of those it's kind of cool. I realize I may be biased because that eclipse was by far the coolest thing that has ever happened to me, but I think I would probably still be giving them this good a review, even if it hadn't been for that.

Text: Most convenient place to get your state recreational licences. However this is such a multipurpose location that the process was slow and attendant was uninformed and ended up charging us an extra $5 for getting the wrong date on our fishing license.
