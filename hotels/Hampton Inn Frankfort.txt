Hampton Inn Frankfort
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel looked clean and neat. It appeared to be a newer hotel. I am not sure if it was but it looked nice. The breakfast was ok. The eggs at all Hampton Inns are awful. They have a rubber texture. Otherwise, it was tasty. I had a nice hot waffle. I would stay here again if in the area.

Text: Such a great and very helpful staff here. Close to many restaurant and entertainment options. Grocery and retail shopping also close by. Would highly recommend staying here if visiting the local distilleries.

Text: The hotel was fine, and breakfast was good. Loses a star for location, as the only restaurants around are chain, and you have to drive into town for the local flavor.
