Hampton Inn & Suites Cleveland/Independence
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel was clean and looked nice. It appeared to be in a safe area. Three was coffee available for us all day. There was a wine and appetizer gathering from 5 to 6 pm that had some nice hot appetizers. There was a nice breakfast in the morning that was included in the room cost. There were 3 adults and two teenagers in our room that slept up to six. The room had two televisions, a mini refrigerator, and a microwave. We fit fine and the accommodations were comfortable. The water pressure was decent and I had plenty of hot water for the shower I took. There was a small fitness room with a treadmill, exercise bike, and eliptical trainer. I was able to get to Quicken Loans Arena within 15 minutes for a Cavaliers game. The hotel area seemed like a safe neighborhood with plenty of restaurants in the area.

Text: Great  customer service.  I was stranded after a 3 day poweer outage and there were no rooms but Joe at the front desk was so nice and could see I was distressed.  All the hotels were booked but he found me and my husband a room and was so helpful.  Things worked out great because of Joe.  He went the extra mile to help us.  Good service is hard to find these days.

Text: This is a perfect example of the very best of hotels! Clean, quiet, with friendly, helpful staff & an excellent breakfast menu. They even have bagged breakfast to go for people who are in a hurry. They had wine & cheese with chicken cordon blue & asparagus in the lobby last night for guests to have an evening snack. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

Text: Location is great! Right off the highway. Rooms good and everything is close. Wish fitness room was better. But overall great.

Text: Whenever we travel, Hampton Inn is our first choice for accommodations. And we enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn Cincinnati- Independence. The room was attractive. The breakfast was tasty with lots of choices to suit everyone in our family's tastes. Staff was friendly and helpful. It would have been nice if the pool was indoors rather than outdoors. And the outlets for charging electronics could have been better designed (sockets were too close together, so we could only use half of them). But other than those minor things, everything was top notch.
