Drury Inn St. Louis Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Great hotel with an awesome breakfast and 5:30 kickback supper and drinks. The staff is top notch! Super friendly and go out of their way if there is anything you need. Clean rooms with comfortable beds and pillows. Not much around the hotel in terms of walking or entertainment, but still a great hotel. I would definitely recommend the Drury Inn.

Text: Very nice room, my wife said one of the best beds. Very good staff when our room refrigerator went out they brought us up another one immediately. Friendly personalized service. We didn't use the airport but it's very convenient to the airport. The free eats were good.

Text: We visited Drury by the airport while on vacation. 2 adults, 2 children. Every single hotel staff were super friendly. They asked if we needed anything at all, made sure we were happy. Whole hotel was very clean and smelled clean. No one was in the pool, so we had it to ourselves both times we went down!! Breakfast was amazing, hot and cold, staff kept it stocked and cleaned up! Tons of brochures to insure u fond something fun to do while you're in St.Louis!! Loved it!! Will definitely return!! Thanks staff!!!

Text: Live savers! Pet friendly! 

We were exhausted from packing and then traveling all day from Middle Tennessee area and had all of our fur babies in tow. 
For a more than fair fee our animals were allowed to stay and we were also able to book last minute (literally last minute) for very nice accommodations. 

Breakfast bar in the morning was also a nice thing to have access to before we continued our travels.

Text: The property is located very close to the airport. It is a nice and remodeled property. The employees and staff are very friendly. The rooms are well kept and has been recently renovated. Also is a nice touch that this location has free breakfast and dinner for their guests. I would highly recommend anyone stay at this location
