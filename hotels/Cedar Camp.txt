Cedar Camp
Rating: 5
Text: Family oriented camp ground. Has cabins, campers, tent spots. The float on the little Niangua is just beautiful. Tammy is awesome and is always there to help no matter what time of day. There is even a play ground for the kiddos. My kids absolutely love it there, as do I .

Text: I have stayed here a number of times. If you want to have a relaxing float without the craziness of the Big Niangua this is the place. Campground is better than most Niangua campgrounds, and yes the breakfast is awesome. I hope to make it their this summer. I try to float once a year from Cedar Camp. Has a great swimming hole at the campsite.
