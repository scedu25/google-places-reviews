Hampton Inn St. Louis/Fairview Heights
Rating: 5
Text: Here for a Conference at nearby St. Louis with a girlfriend.  The room was great for sleeping with comfy beds, black out curtains & good a/c!  That was all we needed really but the person(s) who were at the front desk took care of us with stuff from kitchen even when we missed the timing and free cookies.  The person(s) who cared for our room made sure we had plenty of towels & wash cloths that were nice.  My friend loved her free breakfasts - I opted for a healthier shake I made in room on my own.  Thank you for a pleasant stay  in a safe location near tons of fun things to do, shop at or eat at!

Text: Location is good. Close to the action of St. Louis. Right on I 64 so the noise level is moderately high. Service is good. Rooms big enough but not extravagant. Very clean.

Text: The staff here was exceptional. The housekeeper in particlar was very helpful. The bed was comfortable. The only problem I had was parking was difficult for a bus. Would highly recommend!

Text: Old hotel with a musty smell. No refrigerator or microwave. Not Hampton quality. People are nice, hotel is not.
