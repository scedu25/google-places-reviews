Text: We just returned from a 5 day stay while in town for business.  The staff was great and took us out in a golf cart to pick which site we wanted and to make sure we were comfortable with where we would be backing in.  The grounds are very well maintained, the restroom/shower area is very clean and the people we met were very nice.  It was so quiet and peaceful.  Very nice.  :)

Text: Great staff. Wonderful atmosphere.  Grounds and facility are well cared for. There still seems to be a little animosity among "the owners and the public campers" but all in all is great place for a family to visit.

Text: The reason I gave this a 2 star is this:  We have friends who are full timers there and we wanted to go a spend a weekend with them.  They told us to call and make a reservation.  I called and they said they do take reservations but it is first come first served so if we make a reservation and go on the dates we reserved, someone else who got there before us could have the spot, meaning when we arrive there may not be a spot!  So what is the point in making reservations???  She kept saying, "Oh you can make a reservation but we can't promise there will be a site for you when you get here".  What???
