Text: Web had a very nice dinner.  I had a steak that was cooked to perfection and my wife had salmon which was also excelled.  The service was friendly and responsive even though all the tables were full.

Text: I have not stayed at the bed and breakfast part of this establishment but I have ate there several times there just this year.  Everyone is very friendly, the food is excellent, and of course everything is very clean or I wouldn't eat there. It is a very quaint little place.  Reservations are usually needed.
