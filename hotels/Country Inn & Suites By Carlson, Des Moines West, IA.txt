Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Des Moines West, IA
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed in a few different states / hotels on our road trip and the Country Inn & Suites was by far the best experience out of all of them! The pool area was open late until midnight which was great since most places close their pools early - and it was really nice and big!  Rooms were very clean and our overall experience here was great. There are tons of food options within walking distant (Cracker Barrel across the street was our choice which made the night even better!) This hotel is also Dog Friendly so we were able to have our 2 dogs with us for only $25!

We will use Country Inn & Suites in the future!

Text: I stayed with my family at the Clive Country Inn and Suites on July 28. The check-in process and service were average, but the room was not up to par. The room smelled musty (it smelled as though a recent visitor smoked in the room), the bath drain was clogged and the room's microwave had smeared fingerprints all over it. The pool is large and my kids enjoyed it, but as we were swimming our fingers kept getting tangled up in wads of hair. Please clean the pool regularly. Breakfast was below average for a Country Inn and Suites. This is the worst Country Inn I've stayed in. It's desperately needs to be remodeled and cleaned up before I'd stay here again.

Text: We had a great suite. Country Inn and Suites hotels are uniformly very good across the country. Breakfast is always good. The reason I rated it four stars instead of five is that the cold faucet on the whirlpool in our room didn't work. I had to fill the tub and wait for the water to cool.

Text: Nice, clean mid level hotel. Convenient to highways, food, and shopping. Desk and room service were fine.
