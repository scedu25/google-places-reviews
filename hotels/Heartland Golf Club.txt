Text: Will not come back, first we were placed on the back 9 because we will have no one behind us. Then three holes after we were contacted by one of the workers who sent us back to the 10th hole. While on the 10th hole the manager came out and was very rude, my wife bought me a $40 dollars gift card from this place. To say that i was almost to the point of rquesting my money back and leave the place. I will return just to cash my gift card. Do not recommend this place.

Text: I don't understand all the bad reviews on here. Just stayed for 3 nights with a group of 8. Staff was unbelievable nice & accomodating, allowed us to play golf from sun up to sun down, and have some of the best food in town. Also, can't beat how nice the condos are. Absolutely worth the trip from Ohio for me.

Text: We used to come here pretty regularly, but not anymore!!! Lately, each experience has been even worse than the last. The service is horrendous! The last time we were there Ashley was the bartender. She's waited on us before and no major problems, until this time. She was absolutely straight up the rudest person ever!!! This was for no reason at all. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, I will NOT be back!  No matter what the circumstances, you just do not treat your customers that way.
