Text: I acquired the upgraded room at a decent also slightly discounted price for the nights & it didn't disappoint. Nice king size bed, mini fridge, & microwave.

Beds very comfortable.  Great place to stay.  Convenient to the expressway  and restaurants nearby. Will definitely stay here again.
Only thing on the down side. No hair dryers.

Text: Rooms were ok, smaller beds than we expected but still a comfortable stay. Great water pressure in the shower :)

Text: My room was spartan.  No coffee pot and a single location for ice near the office.  Even so, it was clean and sufficient.  The bathroom was small but clean.  Certainly adequate.

Text: Just stopped in for a place to sleep on a trip east. Room was clean but small. Large enough for the kids to play. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Not much as far as amenities but a nice place for a one night stop.
