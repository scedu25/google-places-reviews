Text: Room was big.  Facility was clean.  Staff was friendly.  Location was fine - near the interstate and the mall but not really walking distance to anything.   Pricing was a good value - this is not the place to stay if you want a great pool, gym, or breakfast - but I'd go back nonetheless.

Text: At first glance the place is great. Nice furniture in the lobby, etc. Breakfast in the morning was decent. Wonderful oatmeal. At first glance the room looks good too. But the WiFi network doesn't have a password and isn't secured. And I question how well the rooms are cleaned. There were two stains on the floor when I walked in to the bathroom area. I also found a bit of food on the floor. (The food may have been a family member of mine. Not sure. The stains were there before we were though.) One of the light bulbs in the room was out and a lamp was missing a bolt.

Text: I liked my stay there a lot.  The staff was friendly and helpful to us.  The room was arranged differently than most rooms.  There were several good restaurants in the area and it was close to where I had business.

Text: Clean nice hotel.   Nothing special but well placed and maintained.
