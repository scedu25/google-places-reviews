Text: Stayed here with my husband for Hinterland music festival 2017.  Gentleman behind the counter was very courteous and helpful! The style of the curtains and bedspreads are outdated but who cares? Everything looked, smelled, and felt VERY CLEAN.  Even the curtains. Carpet looked new.  No cobwebs or dust. AC unit was clean. TV is a small old style one but we didn't stay here to watch tv, we came here for a place to sleep when we came back from the festival. Totally worth it for the price. Feels like a safe neighborhood too. No smoke smell for us. Might be a little crowded if you have kids in the room with 2 double beds but for just he and I it was perfect.

Text: Definitely a bit dated and needing some upgrades, but (as many other reviewers stated), the owners are EXTREMELY customer service oriented and kind!!! I enjoyed my stay here:)

Text: Loved it. Was a nice hotel. It's an older hotel but in great condition. It was clean and everything worked as it should. If you like retro then this is the hotel for you. I will stay here Everytime I'm here.

Text: Lovely grounds and very nice owner. Very thoughtful man. Rooms are cool and old timely, but decor is a bit tired. My asthma flared up in the morning, so be careful there.  Price was right!
