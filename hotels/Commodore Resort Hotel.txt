Commodore Resort Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Had a blast.  The pool is great with swim up bar.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  The rooms are clean and well equipped.  Be prepared for a bit of late night noise as it's a party place.  Also, the office is located in an ally 1/2 block in from Delaware Ave but this puts you within walking distance to everything.  For things that aren't within walking distance there is a cart rental place right next door.

Text: The Commodore was very helpful finding a room for us on the mainland this past weekend when all boat/ferry traffic was suspended due to bad weather. Once we did arrive on the island, the staff was very welcoming, and informative of the Spring Fling events. Our rooms were clean, and you cannot beat the location, we were right in the heart of the entertainment.  Would recommend to others and will be staying there again! Only reason I didn't leave a 5 star rating was that we weren't told the pool would not  be open, but it worked out okay given the weather we experienced. Overall, a great experience.

Text: I love stating here. This will be 4 years now. I gave this a 4 vs 5 star due to this year's experience. We had someone get into our room rummage through our suitcases and the puke in the bathroom. I know it was not either one of us I was working on call until 7 pm. Nothing was missing I think the person was disoriented and somehow got into our room. The staff at somepoint found a person laying outside unresponsive. That is not on the hotel but on weekends it might not hurt to beef up staff or security.

Text: I stayed here for my birthday/anniversary and it was great despite some reviews my experience was great! Entering the hotel my room was CLEAN! That was the first thing I inspected was my room thoroughly shaking blankets looking at the floor searching for bugs and I found NONE! Each day the housekeeper would bring fresh laundry! I stayed here on a weekday so there was no noise but ear plugs were still provided! Overall this was a wonderful hotel to be at and I'm glad it was my choice
