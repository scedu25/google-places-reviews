Main Street Bed & Breakfast

Text: We loved this place. Our room was great-clean, nice high ceilings, awesome old architecture. The owner, Michael, is really nice and waited outside for us when we arrived so we could get a parking space right in front. The only knock I'd give it is the frosted glass windows on the doors are pretty bright at night from the hall lights. Still, we'd stay here again for sure.

Text: My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary. We stayed in the Safari room. It was absolutely gorgeously decorated and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The owner, Mike was very hospitable. We loved that everything was just a quick walk away and we did not have to drive all weekend. We will definitely be back!

Text: Staff was friendly and accommodating. Room was beautiful. Noise from the trains was apparent but we were warned ahead of time and provided earplugs. :) Overall a very nice stay.
