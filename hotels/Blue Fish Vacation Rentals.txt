Blue Fish Vacation Rentals

Text: I stayed at one of the very cute little houses at the Gables in Union Pier for a week. It was a perfect place for me and my small family.  The unit was nicely decorated, stocked with the essentials, and close to the beach, restaurants and other fun southeastern Michigan area activities. My unit had a very minor issue that was taken care of by the property management very promptly.  I plan to come back!

Text: My husband and I have used Blue Fish many, many times over the past 10 years, and have NEVER been disappointed.  John is great, and his staff is amazing!  We have rented larger houses for 5 or 6 couples, and one-bedroom places just for the two of us, and everything we have walked into was perfect!  We will definitely use them again - and again, and again!  Everything is laid out clearly and concisely n the rules you will receive -  no surprises!  If you have trouble while at your rental, they respond quickly and efficiently.  We never worry when we rent from Blue Fish!
