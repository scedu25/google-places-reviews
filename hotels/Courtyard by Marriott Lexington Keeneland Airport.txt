Text: I didn't stay here, but most of my family did. My review is just for the lobby and the workers, who were very polite and helpful in locting some of my cousin's rooms. The entire place was clean and very welcoming.

Text: Solid hotel that met expectations. Room was clean and comfortable. Great simple restaurant and bar downstairs. Pool area could use some upsetting, but nice outdoor area with gas fire pit. Overall happy with our stay!

Text: The hotel is very clean, neat and has nice meeting space. However, I am very unsatisfied with the service offered by management. I gave a credit card for incidental expenses while staying with a corporate group. The room was already pre paid on a corporate card and noted in the account that this was the case. After two phone calls I have yet to have a call returned by management with a resolution. I'm simply told to do more work myself to provide them information they already have. Very  frustrating.
