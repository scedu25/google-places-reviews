Double Nickel Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Wonderful campground. Owners are awesome sweet down to earth people. Very reasonable rates. Mini golf, dog park, pool (Not open because it was almost end of season) and are all included in your stay at no extra charge, grounds are really well taken care of. If you are looking for a campground that is fun during the day and quiet at night this is the place. Will definitely be back again!

Text: We have travel over 5000 miles on our trip and have stayed at 12 campgrounds all on Good Sam's directory.  There have been some good ones, but Double Nickel is the best. We love how clean and accessible it is. We love the long pull throughs. We love all of the shade and all of the activities like a pool and mini golf. This is a great place for a stop through or a fun family weekend.  They are priced reasonably and so helpful with any question you might have. Thanks for a great stay, we will be back.

Text: This a fine place to stopover - up on a low hill overlooking farmland just off the freeway. It's an older campground that is very well maintained. The camp hosts are friendly and work hard to make your stay enjoyable. The sites are level gravel, well spaced, and many even have porch swings to enjoy. There are a lot of nice activities: playground for kids, mini golf, pool, game room, sand volleyball, and more. WIFI worked pretty well. Enjoyed the stay and would be happy to return.

Text: The Double Nickel is a nice quiet campground. We were just passing by and only stayed there one night. The grounds are well kept and Amanda & Jeff are a very kind and helpful young couple. I would of given this a five star, but I didn't need to use there facilities (which I am sure are clean and modern if it is anything like the rest of the grounds).

Text: Very restful here. Much to do especially for the kids.  Clean and we'll kept.  Friendly atmosphere.  And the owners are very accommodating.  We come here often.  Love the crafts and outdoor movie on Saturday s.
