Percival Springs Airport & RV
Rating: 5
Text: Easy place to get to open all year long level sights with full hookup. Will stop again and it only cost $25 a night. We stayed here with a 43-foot motorhome.

Text: Campground is on the grounds of the Percival Springs Airport.  Traveling east on I-70, I exited at Exit# 159, W. Fayette Ave. - there is a Petro Truck Stop at that exit.  Turn right (east) onto W. Fayette Ave. until you come to  US-45. Turn right (south) onto US-45 and travel about 7.5 miles south on US-45.  When you see County Road 700N, it's the very next driveway on the left side.  I did not count the number of RV sites, but I would say a good 25 or 30 sites.  All FHU with newer 50/30/20 electric.  Voltage was excellent.  Water had a bit of mineral taste, but I filter my water, so no problems.  Long gravel sites in excellent condition. All pull-thru sites.  Very quiet - I even heard the corn growing!  There is a air ambulance helicopter based at the airport.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a "camp host", very friendly and took our $25 fee.  Also on the ground of the campground is The Hangar Restaurant famous for its Barn-Storming Burgers & Sandwiches. Check out their Facebook page for menu.  Overall, an excellent campground where you will enjoy much peace & quiet.  We stayed at the campground the end of June, 2017.
