Text: Hansen's Hideaway is a wonderful place to camp if you're looking for a nice, secluded, family-friendly environment away from the main drag of town. The staff is friendly, camping is reasonably priced, and the seasonal campers are a fun bunch. Everyone is very accommodating. If I camped more, I would consider becoming a seasonal camper myself. I will definitely return for a holiday weekend sometime, which I've heard they have various events they do. Love this place.

Text: If you are looking for a simple camping experience on the fly this was a great place. My boyfriend and I and his 5 year old son decided to go on a spur of the moment camping trip, during 4th of July weekend. We wanted to go somewhere other then Starved Rock, and saw there are two state parks in the area. All the camp grounds in the area were first come first serve. We struck out at the first place and stumbled here. There are no defined camp sites, but a long tree line. It was not extremely busy so we found a nice private nook down a hill and set up camp. They had clean bathrooms and showers, a swimming hole, a small child's playground and they had some kid activities for the Holiday. The staff was extremely friendly and it was very reasonable in price. We would stay here again. It's only a few miles from both parks and a very quick drive. If you want deep woods camping this is not your campground.
