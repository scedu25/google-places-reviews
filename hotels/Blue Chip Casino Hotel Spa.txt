Blue Chip Casino Hotel Spa
Rating: 4
Text: Have visited this casino a few times. Cannot speak of the rooms, restaurants, or clubs as I have not visited those. As a casino, it is pretty nice. All of the employees have always been very nice and ready to help with whatever you need. The selection of video gaming is broad. Seems to have a good focus on hot new slot choices. From my experience, they seem a bit tighter. But that's from a limited amount of visits. Free fountain beverages, coffee, etc. via the self serve kiosks scattered throughout. The comps I've received are on par with most other casino properties I've visited. Overall, it's a much better option than some of the other properties I've been to in the area.

Text: Our stay at Blue Chip was awesome. We had a clean room, gaming was great as always, and we also really enjoyed the pool it was nice that there was a few hours without kids being there. The pool was nice, the Spas were nice, the pool could have been a little bit cooler, it was a little bit warmer than bath water but not as warm as the spas. Overall our experience staying at the Blue Chip Hotel in the Blue Chip Tower was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful and we are really look forward to staying there again

Text: The room was very well adorned, we had an open bar for our event and the mixed drinks we're not watered down, the wine was very good, as was the food. The wait staff did a fantastic job of keeping the event moving and timing the different courses perfectly. Anyone that had any questions or need help with anything was taking care of promptly and courteously. My date and myself are both smokers and had help from one of the wait staff what's a napkin to keep the door open so we can get back in and not have to walk to the front of the casino. It was a very thoughtful gesture and the person that helped us was not only vested but thoroughly engaged in the only making sure that we were comfortable. Very enjoyable experience.

Text: Blue Chip was great. Our room was very clean and the location is really convenient. We enjoyed the casino, and were able to take advantage of the buffet for breakfast. The food was great, we can't wait to go back. (We'll try to stay in the new tower next time, it looks even better)

Text: This is one of the best spas in the Great Lakes area.  I have driven across several states to have my hair cut here.  They also do nails, makeup, bridal days, and massages of all kinds.  It's affordable and worth it.
