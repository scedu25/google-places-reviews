Text: We were very pleased with this place 
  Clean, easy hwy access, pull through spots. Great hosts.  Also if heading south towards Kansas City, this is the only RV park prior.  We will definitely keep this park as one of the top places to stay

Text: Great location far enough from I-35 with easy access. Excellent staff service, obvious pride and dedicated to keeping a nice park. Full service - power, water, and dump hole on the site. Scenic countryside plus... a nice priced laundry facility.

Text: This is a very well Run RV Park. The managers are very courteous and kind. The location is quiet and they offer many RV spots. The park was clean and well-run. We slept very good the night we were there with no interruptions.

Text: Very nice RV / Campground.  Great hosts.  We were there for the eclipse event & they put on a potluck, which was a lot of fun.
