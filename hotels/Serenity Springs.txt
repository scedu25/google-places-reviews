Text: Had a great time during our weekend stay. We were a little disappointed that the carriage was not running, but they explained they suspected a foot injury and wanted the horse to have time to heal so we understood. The deliveries left in the butler box were a nice surprise that added to our enjoyment. All in all it was a very relaxing weekend. There is enough to do on the resort to stay busy for a day or so but with Indiana Dunes and shopping areas being so close we were never bored. We will definitely be returning.

Text: We came here for our anniversary and it was all we hoped for. We love the outdoors but also wanted something romantic. Everyone we dealt with was fantastic and our cabin was perfect. We loved walking as well as bike riding the property and had fun feeding the birds and fishing. My husband caught a great bass. We will be back. This was perfect joy and relaxation!

Text: Our stay was amazing. My boyfriend and I were able to spend some much needed quality time! There was some miscommunication with our cabin but they immediately resolved the issue. They were kind, friendly and accommodating. It's not easy to make some people happy but you all did an amazing job making us happy! Thank you for the stay and we will be back! To those who are reading the negative reviews, look at how many positive ones there are! You will always find someone e that wants to complain! Serenity Springs is awesome!
