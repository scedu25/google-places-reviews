Text: Wonderful staff and well organized!
My 12 year old son and I had never been kayaking and he wasn't sure he could do it. The staff encouraged him to go out for a "test run" so we could decide if he was ready to take the trip. The owner gave him a quick instruction and out he went!! He loved it so much we came back the next day for the 5 mile trip. Thanks for a great first experience!

Text: Everything was great. Especially the staff. From the driver educating us on how to use the kayaks to the cashiers. And most of all? I wish I knew his name, but when my wife got out of the kayak she was limping because of her knee. One of the staff members offered to pick her up in a vehicle, but she insisted that she was okay, but this did not sway his kindness. He still went and got the vehicle, drove down the hill, helped her in and drove her and my son up the hill. That was so nice. It's this kind if service that makes everything so much better.

Text: Really great experience. It was busy but the workers were smooth getting everyone situated. They have a little shop with essentials and shirts they had baggies for 10 cents which is perfect for phones and electronics and they have a place to check your keys so they don't get lost.  We had our 3 year old with us we got a canoe and did the 5 mile trip and had a great time ! They also have a place to wash off like a bathroom which is great if you have children wear shoes though.

Text: The staff is why I am mostly writing this review. They were all so pleasant to deal with. From the ladies who were checking us in, the bus driver (Aaron was amazing) to the people helping us in the river. Central Ohio liveries could take some notes in their customer service. As soon as I left, I began recommending this location to my friends and family. The trip was beautiful too. It took longer than I expected but we took our sweet time soaking in the nature. I suggest bringing snacks, sunscreen and water. Did I mention how wonderful the staff was?

Text: Great place to kayak or canoe. Family friendly and great for any size group (call ahead for larger groups). They offer regular and "sit-on" style kayaks.
