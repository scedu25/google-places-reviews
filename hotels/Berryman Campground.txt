Berryman Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Great little free campsite. Paved roads all the way in, fire rings and spacious campsites. Sites were mostly clean, a little junk here and there. Pit toilets were clean, and the entire area seemed like it was maintained. 

Not much site seclusion, and if car camping the paved parking isn't all that level. RVs with levelers should be fine. 

Not too far off the main roads, easy to find. The campground is also right on a logging road so there will be truck traffic during the day. There was also a bit of road traffic at night despite the remoteness of this campground (it's not that far from the access road).

Text: Berryman Campground is a hidden gem. We camped there over Halloween weekend and were able to get a site (only 8 there) on Saturday. There is no water or electric - show up with your own water and wood but the sites are big and the campground is normally quiet. On our particular visit they were working on paving the road into the campground so there was lots of noise from the heavy equipment - they even worked on Saturday. You won't get cell service here - at least not very good - we only had 1 bar for AT&T. We mountain biked the Berryman trail and we kayaked the Huzzah - both fun activities.

Great place for a picnic or a weekend of camping

Text: didn't see any cockroaches but I did find an entire campground to myself for free. cleaner than a previous pay to hike-in rustic campground I'd previously stayed at. if you got a horse, bring it. if you got a bike, bring it. if you haven a loud ass family stay at KOA.
