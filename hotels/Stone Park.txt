Text: We did not go here for the lights we had a retreat here and the owner is all about his patrons so I'm sure the lights are amazing as well!!

Text: We rented the Lodge for Memorial Day and it worked out perfect for us.  It was very well stocked and my kids and family loved it.  We will stay there again!

Text: The RV park is very expensive. Charged us $260.00 for 5 days. If we had another choice would not have stay here. If it rains very much you will not be able to pull your Rv up the hill. I thought I was going to drag the bottom of 5th wheel.

Text: We've been to Stone Park for events on many occasions.  The food is always great and the owner always does his best to make you comfortable.  I can't say enough about the Cave House.  It's wonderful!

Text: We went to the Stone Park Resort in Bonne Terre Mo a couple of months ago and really had a good time.  We watched a comedy shop in the amphitheater and then we went for a little stroll on the property.  We are coming back late summer to stay in the lodge and then to do a float trip just miles away from the resort. 

PS:  The food that was served that evening was terrific!  I ate more than I should have ... and enjoyed every last bit of it!
