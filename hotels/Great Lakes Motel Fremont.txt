Great Lakes Motel Fremont
Rating: 4
Text: Good late night stop. Off the freeway much cheaper than other options. Staff was friendly and had a little alcove to park in which I felt much safer with my soft Thule rack than right off the highway. For $71 with tax I would say forget the big place if you are on a budget and stay here.

Text: Quaint motel. Slightly overpriced. Bizarre shallow tub. Sheets made of sandpaper. Free toothbrush! Plentiful electrical sockets.
