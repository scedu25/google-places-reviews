Text: Great facility, not a bad seat in the house. Always fun and great camping for those that like to for race weekend. They also have showers. If you like racing like I do you will love this track. If you have never went to a race this is a great place to start.

Text: Been four years since I have seen the Kentucky Speedway. The parking space has more than doubled and the Stands have increased as well. With all the expansion the look and feel is still awesome.

Text: Great way to experience my first Nascar Cup race. Size of track allows you to follow action all the way around it. Clean grounds, good food, good family environment. Really appreciated the track Ministry as well. I've been to 2 Cup races & 1 Xfinity race now. Can't wait for next time!

Text: We went to the race this weekend and all the people at the track went out of there way to be helpful. My wife just had total hip replacement 5 weeks ago and I was very worried about all the walking and especially climbing all those steps to get to our seats. The people that showed us were our seats were asked if we thought my wife would have a problem walking up all those steps she was very hesitant so they got us some fold out chairs and let us sit on the lower level of the Quacker State tower ,no questions asked. The race was on a Friday night and got rained out. I'm talking Biblical style storms came through so they rescheduled for Sat at Noon great race great staff very nice racetrack Great Time and we'll be back
