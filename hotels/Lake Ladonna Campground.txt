Lake Ladonna Campground
Rating: 3
Text: The lake is awesome for the kids and everyone is very friendly. There is electric and water at every site. Most of the lots are small and have no trees. People really pack in at these sites and there is a lot of commotion and noise well into the night. Showers are pay with quarters and there are no structures for the fire so bring something to put over the fire if that's how you plan on cooking. Lots of kids around to make friends with and there is a nice playground. Not exactly the quiet I'm used to when camping. There are 2 state parks near by and a nature preserve as well.

Text: One of my absolute favorite camp sites! We used to travel 2 hours just to come here as a family! They have a beach with fun water activities and they usually have a DJ one evening for a dance party. We typically go for their Bingo marathons. It is right next to train tracks and trains do go by a lot, but you begin to ignore the sound. Sites are spaced apart decently.

Text: We've been here 3 summers in a row now, and it's still our favorite nearby campground. The lake is great for swimmers of all ages, and the people are friendly. We've made new friends just chatting with both seasonal & weekend campers. 
It seems like the caretakers have stepped up their game this year too. The grounds looked great, and the bathrooms were clean. 
The only downside to this campground is the train track that runs right next to it. There is a crossing where they are required to blow their horn, and the trains run at all hours. The standing joke is "what train?", because everyone gets used to it. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep through the night.
