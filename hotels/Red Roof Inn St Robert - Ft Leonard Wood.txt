Text: We arrived in town at 6am. They were able to get us a room but we had to pay for the full amount and check out at 11am. Beds were small and not comfortable. Rooms could use an update.

Text: It was a wonderful stay we rented two rooms. The staff was very sweet. The pool and jacuzzi were well worth the money after a long drive. The beds were comfortable and clean. If I had to be honest, there was a small smell to the rooms but wasn't to bad. And don't expect any hot foods for breakfast. Just cereal and toast but once again it was well worth the money and stay!!!

Text: Really good location. The cracker and Barrel across the street made breakfast really convenient. Only problem was they say complementary breakfast but all they had were muffins and warm not even hot coffee.
