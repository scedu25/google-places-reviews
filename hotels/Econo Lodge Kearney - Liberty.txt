Econo Lodge Kearney - Liberty
Rating: 5
Text: The room had recently been renovated and was very nice. The bathroom looked like it had been repainted but it could have used a little more fixing up but it was very clean which was the most important thing. The staff was excellent - very friendly and kept the place very clean. One downside is the location by a truck stop but it was not nearly as noises as I had expected. For the price, I could not have expected more. It was a great rate for the room we had.

Text: This hotel wasn't fit for rodents.  The entire place is falling apart.  Ceiling falling in,  tiles missing in the bathroom,  holes in the walls,  ac didn't work, beds were dirty. Someone had already slept in the beds,  and housekeeping didn't clean the room. There was old food in the refrigerator. Very nasty place to stay. When I complained to the front desk, they argued that no one else complained about those things, and refused to make it right.  I just don't want anyone else to get screwed over but this hotel.

Text: In town for the funeral of my wife's favorite aunt.  After the funeral we were emotionally and physically exhausted and simply needed some place to crash for the evening.  We chose the Econo Lodge Kearney because it was the cheapest motel within a 15 mile range.  It has turned out to be the most pleasant surprise we've had in a long, long time.

While we usually stay at Motel 6 (because of their wonderful pet policy) we didn't have our dogs with us this time so that wasn't a factor.  If this place has a dog friendly policy I'd have to invent a six star rating for it, but since I don't know I'll have to stick with five stars.  Now understand that we are not unfamiliar with higher end lodging - our kids have put us up at some really fancy places and we've been comped rooms that go for as much as five hundred dollars a night at some pretty classy casinos.  But for the price this is unquestionably the best place we've ever stayed - and if I were to compare it to our library of lodging experiences without considering the price at all it would still rank up there within 2 or 3 of the best places regardless of price - much higher than some of the multi-hundred dollars places we've stayed.  The pros:
*Friendly and helpful staff
*A spacious two-bed room with a comfortable chair and ottoman
*Three real pillows per bed (we always take our own pillows when we travel by car because so many places wrap a pancake in a chunk of cloth and call it a pillow).
*Mini-fridge, microwave, ironing board, hair dryer, full-sized bath and shower.
*Largest TV ever (including the very high end places) with excellent picture and best channel selection ever - including On Demand selection for most channels (including HBO) - something we've never seen before in any lodging.
*Free and easily accessible WiFi
*Free mini-breakfast
*Firm and very comfortable beds
*Freshly remodeled, tastefully appointed and immaculately clean

The cons:
From the outside it doesn't look anywhere near as nice as it is on the inside...but then that makes for a very pleasant surprise
The tremendous channel selection doesn't include TCM.  Sorry, but that's pretty much our go-to channel so I had to mention it
I checked - pet policy is $14.95 per pet and they have rooms specifically for those with pets right next to a break area.  Not what we'd like it to be - but not terrible.
The bathroom door was pretty bad - scrapes the floor and needs to be replaced.  I mentioned this to the night clerk and he told me that new doors are actually on the way.

To sum up - if you asked for more you'd be asking too much.  I cannot stress enough what a tremendous value this is.  If you're in the area you'd be nuts to stay anywhere else.

Text: Sorry no "whole sandwiches" behind our rooms pictures lol!!! Our  $60 room was clean and comfy. Quieter than I thought it would be with a truck stop across the street and safe area as we walked to a restaurant in the strip mall. Poll was clean looking and had drive around whole building so our truck and camper could park in back no problem. Waffle/cereal type breakfast. I would stay here again.
