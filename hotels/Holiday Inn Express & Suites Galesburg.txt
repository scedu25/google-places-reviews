Holiday Inn Express & Suites Galesburg
Rating: 5
Text: Fairly new hotel, my first time staying there. Lobby was nice and have a we'll stocked little convenience store. Rooms were fresh and modern. Loved the black out curtains. A bit pricey but surprisingly all the Galesburg hotels are similarly priced.

Text: I'd recommend this hotel to absolutely everyone and  would go out of my way to go to this hotel again! The staff is INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful. The gal who runs the breakfast in the morning was the icing on my cake. Because she waa friendly and chatted with us, she knew we had another 8 hrs driving time with 3 children, so she packed us a bag with some apples and bananas for the remainder of our drive. How thoughtful!
