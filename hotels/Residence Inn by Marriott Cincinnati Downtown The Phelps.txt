Text: Beautiful hotel with a wonderful, helpful staff. The room was very spacious and clean, would definitely stay here again! Also, the food at the restaurant in the hotel was great, highly recommend the Brussel sprouts and French fries. Free breakfast buffet in the morning was plentiful with much variety.

Text: Great room and fantastic location. Rooms are just a few years old and very spacious. You can see the river and baseball park from the higher rooms. Valet only parking, which was the only draw back. I usually had wait 15 to 30 minutes for my car. Over all great experience! Be sure to check out the roof top bar! I will definitely stay here again!
