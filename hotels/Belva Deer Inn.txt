Text: Quiet, clean, comfortable. Rooms were up to date and had all standard amenities including WiFi, cable tv, fridge, and microwave. Staff was friendly & helpful, everything was well stocked & maintained. Basic breakfast included as well. Rural hotel, so no major frills like pool or exercise room though, but we only vaguely hoped for a pool anyway. Decent food was only a few blocks away. It was a good comfortable night's stay for our visit to see family in the area.

Text: The breakfast was just so so. Cold cereal,  toast,bagels,  soggy waffles,  to toast or micro wave.  The only thing hot was the weak coffee.  The room had was very clean. But it had this very off putting odor.  Luckily I had some Febreeze to spray around abbreviated that helped.  It may have come from some cleaning product,  because I noticed the same smell in the hallway the next morning.
