Text: I highly recommend this B&B- It's a beautiful home and the Neely's have done a wonderful job of converting it into a cozy inn.
Although I arrived very late at night, due to work, I was greeted promptly with a warm welcome. In the few moments I waited on the inviting porch, I was wishing I had arrived early enough to relax in the swing. A big comfy bed was waiting for me in the "Michigan"  and the choc. chip cookies beside the bed were very tasty too. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room had a private bath w/shower. I hope that when I return it's for R&R and not work, so that I'm able to  fully enjoy this wonderful place.        I slept like a baby.
