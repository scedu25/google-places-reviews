Text: We enjoyed a motorcycle ride along the Sunset Highway (44) from Des Moines heading West into the Loess Hills and chose the quaint Logan Rooms Motel. Staying here is an excellent choice for the weary and late arriving traveler. The financial transaction was done over the phone with Hank who was very kind, polite and thorough regarding the motel. He texted the room code and receipt within minutes. The motel was easy to find right on the road. The room was bright, clean, and newly refurbished. Amenities include a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, cable television, and free WiFi. Everything else you need is within walking distance. Enjoy your stay at the Logan Rooms Motel.

Text: Absolutely wonderful!  Clean. New. Comfortable.  Quiet. Fridge. Micro. Nice walk in shower.  This little place is Logan ' s best kept secret!  Across the street you can get a large coffee for a dollar!  If this place had a website it would never have a vacancy. Love love love it!
