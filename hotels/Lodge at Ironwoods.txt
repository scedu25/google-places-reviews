Lodge at Ironwoods
Rating: 5
Text: I'm a local florist that had the pleasure of decorating a wedding at the Lodge of the Ironwoods on 04/28/2017. The event space is amazing. The acoustics are fabulous. The staff is accommodating. The kitchen couldn't be better equipped. The space is beautiful. There are multiple table size options. It has a gorgeous out door space... I can't say enough about how perfect the venue is for your dream reception.

Text: Very nice facilities, was there for a Trivia night and am was very pleased with the whole experience.  
The only downfall is the parking lot for the lodge is not very well lit but that's only an issue at night obviously.
