Residence Inn by Marriott Omaha Downtown/Old Market Area
Rating: 5
Text: Very clean, very nice. We walked into old market very quickly. The staff was very helpful, we forgot a phone charger and the front desk had one we could use. I made my booking online, and once we were there, Mickey, helped us get a room higher up. I also had trouble with the parking garage and they were very helpful. They do offer valet service for $15 a night, and they bring your car around and whatnot. 10/10 would stay again.

Text: Was originally the old federal building was gutted and redone into hotel suites, with many original parts left intact for a feel of the past. Modern rooms with a full kitchenette, work area and great mattresses for a good night sleep.
Employees very helpful and ready to take that extra step for any questions or help needed. Parking is valet for 15 dollars a day. Shuttle available for runs around area and airport. Come stay and enjoy great hospitality!

Text: Admittedly, this was a blind deal on a popular trip website.  Rooms are considerably bigger then I'd expect in a historic property.  It was fun to nose around the building.  Try to get a Dodge street view if view matters to you. Not much to see on the south side.  Breakfast was adequate but nothing to write home about.

Text: The location of the Residence Inn is located in a nice spot downtown. The entrance is a bit odd and be prepared to do some odd twisting or turning if you need wheelchair access. The room was wonderful. Ours was positioned on the corner of the building. The huge windows let in a ton of natural light. I almost wish I could have this nice of a stay whenever we travel. We have always been pleased with Marriott's properties when traveling. This was no exception. The breakfast was nice and the serving area had all the breakfast amenities you'd expect. Whenever we're back in Omaha, NB we'll be sure to stay here again.

Text: I recently stayed at this hotel this last week for my cousins wedding. I was traveling with my 8 month old baby and wasn't planning to rent a car. I called to find out if they had a shuttle from the airport to the hotel and they had a driver at the airport within 10 minutes of me getting my luggage. The entire stay was great. The front desk and all of the employees were so helpful. Being a mom traveling solo with my youngest isn't an easy task but they always were there to open doors, call the elevator and pop the stroller into the shuttle. They also provide transportation in a 3 mile radius so when it came to needing extra diapers or formula they were able to take me to the nearest walgreens and wait for me. In the middle of my stay my baby got very sick and needed urgent care. The front desk staff immediately tried to find an open facility nearest to the hotel and were able to get my family members car brought out so we could get the baby the medical attention he needed. One of our family members was scheduled to check out that same day and the front desk was extremely kind with allowing a late checkout and accommodating us under these circumstances. I will recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Omaha. The service was great and the rooms were very comfortable and clean, the kitchens were great to have too. There are also several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and even a starbucks just across the street.
