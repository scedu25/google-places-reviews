Text: This was a very cozy, comfortable, relaxing, convienent home away- from- home. My daughter absolutely loved the pool and the food at the onsite restaurant was delicious. The room I stayed in had beautiful wood trimmed walls around the bathroom sink vanity and very comfortable beds.  The staff went out of the way to accommodate me.  Definitely a place I'll be staying again!

Text: The updated rooms are clean and crisp.  However, room 136 was lacking shower caddy, towel hooks, hand towel hooks, and the shower refused to drain.  I had to end my shower early to keep the basin from overflowing.  I am hoping this is just because the room was not yet finished.  Concerts at Jethros are not affiliated with the inn, and you still have to pay the cover charge. Noise levels at the hotel was obnoxious, especially at three in the morning.  We have, however, stayed on a couple other occasions with minimal issues.  It is a great value for the money.
