Text: We have tried every stay option from campgrounds to resorts at 
Rend Lake until we were guest of some friends few years ago at
Gun Creek Fin, Fur & Feathers Sportsmens Club. 
We have stayed there a couple times and all were Wonderful experiences, with Great accommodations including spending time on the 
Awesome big covered patio for cook-outs and just relaxing after a day of good fishing. It was Amazing time along with all the Great amenities.
The added bonus this time was a Fantastic Guided Catfishing trip
with Ric Barth that was an Enjoyable day of Catfish catching..  
We would encourage you to check with Ric for fishing on your next trip there.
We look forward to our next trip/stays there and recommend you check them out. 
Just like they say "We Bring the Comforts of Home to the Outdoors!"
We cannot see ourselves even wanting to stay anywhere else...
