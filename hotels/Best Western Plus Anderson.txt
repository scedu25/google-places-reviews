Best Western Plus Anderson
Rating: 5
Text: Clean, decent, hot breakfast included.  Keurig machine in room.  Pretty quiet, even though they were sold out.  Ample parking, pleasant employees.  Beds were decent, linens and towels decent quality.  Our room and the public areas we saw all looked freshly painted and well kept.

Text: Clean and well kept hotel room. The pool, however, was filthy and around 45°F. Frigid. The hot tub was moldy and surrounded by lawn chairs with caution tape to discourage use. The hotel would have been fantastic if it hadn’t been for the fact that we chose it mostly for its pool and hot tub. The AC was too warm, initially, and it made weird noises. It finally started cooling in the middle of the night.

Text: This is the best hotel for the price in Anderson. I paintball a lot and constantly booking hotels. The staff were constantly ensuring the hotel was spotless. They were friendly and the breakfast was great. This is my new favorite hotel in Anderson and I will look for more Best Westerns wherever I go. Thank Best Western.

Text: Our check in receptionist was very friendly and helpful. I had signed up last month for the rewards program and she was able to connect this visit with our rewards program. She also arranged to have a card to be sent to us. Later we found gum on our carpet in our room. We reported it to her and she offered to move us to another room but we said we were ok. The breakfast bar was very full and presented well but we were very surprised that there were no friut. Check out was easy.
