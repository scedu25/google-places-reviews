Text: We often stay at this Best Western.  It has a wonderful hot breakfast in a welcoming ambiance.  It also has a fun indoor heated pool.  Our room is always clean and full of helpful amenities.  The staff can be counted on to help us in any way needed.  We know we will be rested and refreshed the next day!

Text: Thanks to the professional staff and Eric, the manager, my husband had his hearing aids returned to him.  Driving to hunt camp in Missouri he spent the night at the Best Western in Marion. He called home the next day to say he left his hearing aids .  I called Eric and he was very happy to send them back to us.  He had been trying to call us since housekeeping found the hearing aids but our phone number had changed.  We appreciate the courtesy and honesty of all involved.

Text: I was very pleased with my stay here.  This was the fourth hotel on a long trip, so I had a lot to compare to. The service here was so helpful and kind.  Breakfast was abundant, well stocked.  Very clean over all, good room.  A couple things that really stuck out about this place, aside from the very helpful woman who checked us in, was the pool and fitness center.  The pool area was lovely!  Great light in the morning.  And the fitness center, while a little cramped, had a fair variety and GOOD ventilation.  So rare.
