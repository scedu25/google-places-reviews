Fairfield Inn by Marriott Marion

Text: We had a long drive and decided to stop late one night to rest. We booked a room on Marriott reservations using points. When we arrived the door was locked so we picked up the phone to talk to the front desk but no one was to be found. After standing there about 10 minutes waiting to be let in, I tried calling the hotel from my cell directly and again no answer. We finally called Marriott Reservations back and told them what was going on. They also couldn't get an answer. Finally after standing there a total of 20 minutes someone finally came to the front desk to let us in with no apology. Additionally being a Platinum member they are supposed to offer a market item or points but nothing was offered. They also put us on the first floor right next to the ice machine which was very loud. We try to stay with Marriott when we travel but I regret staying at this one.

Text: Walking in the room there instantly was a musty damp smell that hit you pretty hard. Had it not been so late I would have asked to change rooms. Fitted sheet didn't fit the king bed and continued to come off which exposed the bare mattress. That's pretty gross to think about. In the bathroom the threshold between the tile and carpet wasn't attached to the floor. For one night in Marion it worked as there isn't a lot of choices but this place needs some work.
