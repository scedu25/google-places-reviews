Text: Great place to pull off for the night. Clean rooms, very friendly and helpful staff, and the price is fair. Standard Continental breakfast (waffle maker, muffins, juice, cereal) is a nice perk too.

Text: The smell was so intense! The cleaning supplies they use are hazardous if you have asthma. The lady who worked there was clearly overwhelmed but did her very best and stayed professional! :)
