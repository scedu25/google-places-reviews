Baymont Inn & Suites Robinson

Text: The hotel was acceptable for the price. The room was comfortable but could definitely have been cleaned better. The floor around the bathroom door frame was so dusty that it was "white" and the bathroom vent and vent on the air conditioner were crusty.  The staff totally made up for the short comings in cleanliness. Extremely helpful and friendly.

Text: Robinson, IL Best Western is a great place to stay.  Quiet and comfortable rooms and surroundings.  Will be staying there again when in the area on business.  Pricing was reasonable for the rooms also.  The breakfast items were the usual found with Best Western properties.  Very comfortable beds, and again very quiet in my estimation.  The stay was great, liked everything except having to write a novel to be able to post the above information.  I am a very busy person and say things in a short and precise manor and do not really have time to carry on about something in order to make it post on this site.  In this case I will take the time in order to get whomever to stop making us have to spend so much time typing.

How much more do I have to type in order for the POST is available?  Come on now this is ridiculous,  give us a break out here, still typing and the POST is still grayed out.

Just figured out I must click on the stars above-state that above instead of making us wonder what the heck we are to do to post-there are more important things in life than Google!!!!

Text: Clean room. Good climate control. Wish they had shampoo and body soap available. Non-smoking room smelled like smoke.
