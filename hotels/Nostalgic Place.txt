Nostalgic Place

Text: This is an amazing piece of history that has been converted into a wonderful place to unwind. The original characteristics of the building have been wonderfully preserved to add to the experience of staying at a first class bed and breakfast. If you get the opportunity, this should be your first choice for lodging in the area.

Text: My husband and I stayed here and loved it!  The room was beautiful, clean and relaxing. Breakfast was great and came with great conversation! Margo was an amazing woman and was very helpful with everything we needed. The pictures on the site are great but it is way better in person. The building has great character and is decorated beautifully. We will be back!

Text: In need of a quiet weekend away together my husband asked me to find a place for us to steal away...I decided that the Arcadia Valley,MO would be a nice place to visit as it was listed as a great place to see seasonal changes in the foliage and experience life in a small Ozark town. The drive was only about 2.5 hours from our home in Illinois. 

I called several hotels and B&B's to see what was available. When I called the Nostalgic Place I was immediately struck by how cheerful and inviting the owner, Margo, was. I was very lucky as she had had a cancellation and did have the St. Francis Suite available for our dates of travel (October 24-26, 2014). I happened to be on the Nostalgic Place's website at the time and had been admiring the St. Francis Suite. I immediately booked the room. I was really impressed when Margo asked me about my husband and I's beverage preference for breakfast and if we had any dietary restrictions and/or food allergies. I've stay at many B&B's and no one has ever bothered to ask those types of questions. 

When we arrived we were warmly greeted by Margo. She showed us to our room and gave us a quick history of the building and grounds all of which just added to the charm and beauty of the facility. Nostalgic Place is located on the grounds of what was once a large sprawling Catholic Church and school compound. 

The St. Francis Suite was spectacular! Soaring ceilings, wooden floors, large dreamy canopy bed, HUGE 2 person bathtub (which we used and enjoyed), thirsty bathrobes, oversized bath towels (which I really liked), separate sitting room with large flat screen TV (we never turned it on...no need), refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave. The St. Francis Suite has it's own private outside entrance and is on the ground floor. The other rooms in this B&B are on the second floor. 

We have a Tempurpedic bed at home and often find hotel beds miserable. Not so at the Nostalgic Place. The bed was supportive and very comfortable. The sheets were high quality and the rest of the bedding was just right for the time of year. Lots of large fluffy pillows as well. 

Breakfast was served at 9:00 am. We enjoyed poached pears with vanilla honey cream cheese sauce, perfect omelets with our choice of fillings, and home made buttermilk pancakes. There was no need for a lunch! The next day we ate ham, French toast made with thick sliced French bread and baked apples. Again, no lunch needed.

Before we checked out we made reservations to return for a three night stay in February. We are again staying in the St. Francis Suite which in my opinion is a bargain at $219.00 per night. I am from the San Francisco Bay area where mid-class chain hotels can easily let out at over $200 per night. Do yourself a good deed and definitely book a stay at the Nostalgic Place. It will exceed your expectations in everyway.

Pros: Best feature is most definitely Margo, the owner. She is a true hostess and a joy to chat with. She knows the area well and you can tell she enjoys her guests. The breakfast is outstanding, rooms and facilities are spotless, quiet, quaint, comfortable, reasonable, and inviting.

Cons: No sign or address numbers indicating location on College Street.
