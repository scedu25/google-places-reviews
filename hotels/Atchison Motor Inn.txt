Text: A bit run down looking, outside the room and inside. Beds were lumpy and sank in. You get what you pay for. At least they had hot water.

Text: Webster's Dictionary defines the word DINGY as "dirty, unclean" and "shabby, squalid."  Noah Webster clearly must've stayed at the Atchison Motor Inn.

The list of things that were wrong with our room are too numerous to fully list here:  trash left lying about the room from the previous guests, an unusable internet connection, a mini fridge that didn't work, a TV that only sometimes worked, no towels in the bathroom -- the list goes on and on.

However, what really defined our experience was the absolute dinginess of the Atchison Motor Inn.  If the other two hotels in town hadn't been full, we would've stayed elsewhere; in fact, we almost turned around and left when we first walked into our room.  If the front desk clerk had been the slightest bit friendly, we would have asked for our money back.

Picture the dingiest hotel you've ever stayed at.  Now picture something ten times dingier than that.  Welcome to the Atchison Motor Inn.  (It's a shame that I can't post photos here.)

In summary, you should stay elsewhere, even if it means driving to another town.  For that matter, you'd be better off sleeping in your car.  That's what Noah Webster would've done.

Text: Dirty, broke down furniture, bugs, no pool, the rooms smell, outdated, needs to be demolished. The room rate is CHEAP, you get what you pay for.
