Comfort Suites St Charles - St Louis

Text: Stayed here on my wedding night, and discovered a big brown stain on the bed sheet that was clearly visible. When we notified the front desk at check out, the manager was just around the wall and wouldn't come out and talk to us or apologize. I appreciate that she took $30.00 off the bill, but it would have been nice to see some professionalism.  Just take your own sheets, and or stay elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.

Text: Rooms were very clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The only downside was flat pillows, but I haven't been to a hotel yet that had good pillows.

Text: The couch in the room had dog hair all over it, breakfast in the morning was very mediocre. No orange juice biscuits and Gravy was ice cold. The dog hair was one thing, when you mess with my breakfast that I just cannot except. I gave it three stars because it’s a nice hotel, right in the heart of St. Charles Missouri.

Text: Comfortable bed. 
Very poor cleaning over the entire hotel. Hair and dirt on bathroom floor. Mirror was not cleaned at all, with who knows how many previous guests. Dust everywhere. 
Breakfast is pathetic only filled once so you better be early.
