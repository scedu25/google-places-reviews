Text: Love this place!!  I stay in a LOT of hotels.  If you are looking for super new and shiny, pick a different hotel.  This isn't a cookie cutter corporate hotel.  It's a little older but clean, has character, very rustic, feels like it could be up in the mountains, but it's in the middle of the city.  Staff is super friendly.  They even mailed me a piece of jewelry I left in the room!   They have an Omaha Steak house INSIDE the hotel, many locals come here for dinner.  Even the room-service food was AMAZING!!!   Hope I get to stay there again!!

Text: Inside the motel is VERY nice.  The room and the hallway are very pleasant looking.  The bathroom is very nice.  I think the counter is corian.  Very generously sized room.  Has iron, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker with ground Maxwell House coffee provided, has blow dryer and shaving mirror, closet with safe.  Has TV.  Small table with 2 chairs.  VERY satisfied.  Would be happy to stay here again.

However, we had a lot of trouble finding the motel at night.  The sign in front was not lit.  Around the back, where I was told to park near an entrance near our room, the lot looked deserted.  I'm told by my daughter in law that it is in a good neighborhood so there is nothing to worry about.  Part of the parking lot nearer to the front entrance was very dark and it seemed to have lights but the lights were not on.

Text: Stayed 2 nights during a wedding so the hotel was nearly full. No water pressure in my shower. The only other room available was a log cabin suite...so they moved us to it!!! Hotel needs some repairs and renovations, but food and the bar are pretty good. This is our second visit to the Regency Lodge, had an engagement party here a year ago, we were impressed with the service. Would recommend!

Text: This is good motel!  Only reason I don't give it a 5 star is minor things that an older motel might have.  Yes, it is older and it shows a little bit of its age.  However, it's has a lot to offer.  Nice Big pool, hot breakfast, nice lounge area that does have a menu with good food and has a bar with a fire place (even has a piano player on certain nights), rooms are very cozy and clean,  out door seating area for relaxing by a little stream/pond, and the staff has always been positive and nice.  All that for $75.  I will take this any day over high priced and modern.

Text: Great for the price! Bed and linens were very comfortable. The free breakfast was good and had a big variety. Some stains in the hallways and dimly lit. Coffee pot in my room didn't work. I wound def. stay again tho. I was pleasantly surprised.
