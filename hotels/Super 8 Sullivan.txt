Super 8 Sullivan
Rating: 5
Text: Great motel! Super affordable prices and the staff is so nice and really makes you feel at home. The rooms were very clean and comfy and we slept well without any disruptances. We weren't expecting the breakfast and room to be so nice at the price we paid. Definitely one of the best motels we have stayed at!  All in all, a great experience and lovely staff.

Text: This is not a 5 star hotel. Neither was the price. Good value for the price. We had a good night sleep. Quiet. We were happy with our stay.

Text: I don't usually rate places 5 stars because most places have things I feel should be improved. The moment I got to the hotel I felt at home. The staff were super friendly and helpful. When I got to my room the AC was cranked up and the room was ice cold. That means a lot to me. The moment I got in the room I was comfortable the beds were some of the best I've ever slept on at a hotel. The dryer was broken, however they let me dry my clothes in their dryer. In the morning they had a continental breakfast. The phone in my room didn't work, but they offered to let me use the hotel's cordless if I needed to make any calls. Thet treated me like family and accommodated me for the few things that were wrong. The night stay was reasonably priced and after my stay I felt like I had gotten a steal. Next time I pass through I'll be staying here again.

Text: The rooms were very nice, nice bedding, mini fridge and microwave. I  was super impressed with them. However, hotel is known for drug busts. There was one while I was staying there and a local said they normally have an undervover cop on sight at all times.
