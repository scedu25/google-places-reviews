The Spa at The Hotel Bothwell

Text: I went in to purchase a gift certificate for a pedicure for my mom's birthday.  The spa looked beautiful and the person who helped me was very nice.  I inquired about if my mom needed to call to make an appointment or if she could just walk in to get her pedicure.  The lady said it would probably be a good idea to call to make an appointment to make sure there was someone there to provide the service on the day and time she wanted it done.  My mom called to make an appointment for Saturday (two days after purchasing the certificate) and was told they didn't actually have a person to provide that service on staff at the time and as a courtesy they could extend the expiration date of the gift certificate from 6 months to one year.  Who sells gift certificates for services they don't have the specialized staffing to provide?!?  One would think this would have came up more than once during my interaction while buying the gift certificate.  I'm just glad it was my mom I bought this present for and not someone else because I was embarrassed that the gift certificate I just purchased was not able to be immediately used.  You may have the most pleasant staff members but if you list services on your website and sell gift certificates for services you are not able to provide that's terrible customer service.  They gladly refunded my money but I will not ever be spending money there again.
