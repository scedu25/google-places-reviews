Motel 6 Lafayette In
Rating: 2
Text: Our last resort after our other hotel lost our reservation (their opinion separate). And I mean last resort. We planned our trip two months in advance and ended up here only because our reservation was lost. Bedding was worn. Holes and such. Not enough towels. A place to lay your head at best.

Text: The room did not have any towels. That night, my wife asked for towels and was told they did not have any. The next morning I went down and asked for towels and they said they still did not have any. I will not stay here again. There was also a used washrag hanging on the shower when we first got there. The rest of the room was adequate.

Text: For the price it was a great place to stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. We didn't have enough towels and washcloths and were only given one more. No creamer for the coffee, said the truck didn't bring any. The room was fairly clean except for the hair clippings in the drain.

Text: Our bathroom was filthy. Previous dirty towels still were hanging on the door when we arrived. Dirt and dust bunnies were all over the floor. It appeared as if the shower and toilet had never been cleaned. The fluorescent light bulb over the sink was weak and keep the flickering. Also, we were upset since the website stated they had an outdoor pool, but there was none. That was one of the reasons we choose that motel for our children. The bedroom area was okay and the front desk was accommodating with towels and extra pillows.

Text: I was pleased with the room overall.  There was some dust in the main area, but bathroom was clean.  No tissues in dispenser and only 2 towels were available.
