Residence Inn by Marriott South Bend Mishawaka

Text: Our family stayed at this Marriott on our trip out to Iowa as a great stopping point.  

The room itself was great, the bed was incredibly comfortable and well maintained.  It was able to fit the 4 of us, plus our 2 dogs comfortably and it had a nice kitchenette which worked out great. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and were very helpful/accommodating to our couple requests.   We wanted to hit the road early the next morning and they helped package up some fruits, cream cheese and tea/coffee for us to get on the road bright and early the next morning. 

Doesn't get much better than that for service -- great spot!

Text: Supper clean very modern hotel. Breakfast comes with the room. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there was no pool or hot tub. Other than that it is a great place to stay.

Text: I stay here every month on business. I basically stay in this property because it's less than a mile from where I work and is close to plenty of places to eat. It's rooms are clean and comfortable, but I have never had a good experience with the staff. They are not friendly at all and mostly seem kind of clueless. I'll continue to stay here because of the other things I mentioned but the staff really detracts from it being a great hotel. Very unlike Marriott properties. I'm stay in all brands all over the eastern part of the country. They need to step up customer relations.
