Text: Very friendly owner and staff members. My room was clean, the bed was so comfy, and the water pressure was amazing. I will be back.

Text: It's a bit worn but everything was clean and the staff was really nice. Beds were plastic wrapped and comfortable, a/c was cold and the flat screen worked. For the price you can't go wrong.

Text: Would never recommend to my worst enemy. My boyfriend and I checked in the hotel about 4am, as you could image after a long drive we were exhausted and went straight to bed. 
  When we woke up to prepare ourselves for our long drive ahead, we found bug. Bugs everywhere. (Both dead and alive) the entire room was filthy. When we comforted the front desk of our complaints they had told us there was nothing they could do. 

If you're traveling and need a good nights rest, you're better off pulling off and sleeping in the grass.
