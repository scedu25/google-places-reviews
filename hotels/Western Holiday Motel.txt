Text: This was the creepiest place I have stayed at. The carpet was filthy and it smelled awful. We turned the air on which did work and went to the lake. When getting ready for bed 2 out of 3 beds had bed bugs, a clump of black hair under a pillow, and stains in the middle bed on the entire bed. One of the sheets had blood on the edge. Did not sleep or stay there to sleep. Disgusting!!!! Got a full refund. Never again.
