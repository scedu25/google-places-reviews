Text: Clean with  lovely scenery.  Very  quiet except for the wildlife.  Lots of birdsong,  deer walking  around but little  of humanity is heard!

Text: Lovely little campground on the banks of the river.  Basically it's electric only, but one can hook up to water at certain sites, using a splitter.  No dump station.  But really pretty and peaceful.  Close to the tiny town of Bentonsport which has many interesting stores and museums.  A lovely place to get away.
