Stoney Creek Hotel & Conference Center

Text: Really nice pool that transitions from indoor to outdoor. The decor makes it feel more like a vacation. Near a nice riverfront park. Beds were small. Not sure if the amenities were worth the extra cost. The large banquet room has a wonderful river view.

Text: Cozy!  Very accommodating and friendly staff.  Right next to a harbor like setting on the river.  A great area to walk my dog!!  The best seafood restaurant shares the same driveway. It's our new spot to stay traveling through Illinois.

Text: Nice space. There was no sounds system so it was somewhat difficult to hear. Also the staff was asked to turn up the heat for the clients but they never did. Other than that it was a good location for a conference within the city.

Text: I went there to check out a possible wedding venue. Got pricing for the venue overall nice. The event planner was very nice and helped determine if it would be a venue we would like.
