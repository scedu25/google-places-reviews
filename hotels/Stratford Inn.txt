Text: Its dirty. Filled with cockroaches, no hot water in the shower. The beds don't even have real mattresses on them, and they sink into the box spring from where people sat. They don't even put fitted sheets on their beds when they make them, they lay just a flat sheet. And I've been here for almost 5 days now and housekeeping hasn't knocked on my door once. I'm going to have to call down to the front desk if I want my room cleaned, or I just keep cleaning it myself. But part of the joy of staying in a hotel is haveing someone to clean up for you, right? Well not here. I wouldn't recommend ANYONE to come here. Not even my worst enemy. You truly get what you pay for.

Text: Staff was very nice, but the only thing I can say about the room was great water pressure in the shower.  Everything is extremely dated and dirty. Not worth $50.00 a night
