Text: Very clean, comfortable beds, a recent renovation, and a great staff. Location is near the bypass, mall, and good dining. I travel to Lawrence several times per month and I only stay here. The staff also worked out a very good rate for me for staying often for work when other places would not. Highly recommend! Also they have Otis spunkmeyer cookies by the front desk at check in, with beverages, a nice treat!

Text: I will definitely stay here again. My room was nice and clean. In the bathroom they had nice big white towels plus an extra touch of a little vanity kit and a shoe shine whipe. The bathroom fan was on a separate switch. The lighting was a little too dim for putting ones face back on, but there is a full length mirror in the bedroom. The beds are new and fairly comfy for hotel beds with four pillows.There was a microwave refrigerator and a Keurig. Plenty of plugs for all of my electronics.The  fitness center was open 24 hours. It had the usual treadmill and the elliptical strider. It had hand weights, kettlebells, a ball, water, plenty of towel, but no way to clean the equipment. There was room for me to do my  Erin Brooks cardio strength program from YouTube. Wi-Fi was good. Real scrambled eggs, sausage reg. or turkey, cereal, egg white omelets were some of what the free breakfast offered.
