Text: We checked into the Gateway and immediately asked for a refund. We drove 2 1/2 hours back home in the middle of the night instead of staying here. The sheets were stained and the bed was disgusting. I didn't even want to sit on the bed. The staff gave us a full refund, which was the only good thing about our 2 minute stay.

Text: Quite possibly the worst hotel I've stayed at, tiny room, dirty linens, old ratty mattress, and when I turned the heat on it smelled like someone just went to the bathroom. NOT good!
