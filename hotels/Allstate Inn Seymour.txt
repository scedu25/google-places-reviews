Text: Didn't even stay here. Asked to see a room first. There was pubic hair on the toilet seat.  Layers of dirt and dust on top of everything. They do allow smoking in their rooms. But the room was so nasty, we decided to drive on to a nicer place.

Text: Can't expect to much from a motel. Lowest priced rooms in Seymour. Smoking allowed in rooms.

Text: Some rooms are better than others rooms, but for just $45~1bed?

Text: I’m a truck driver so I’m always staying in different hotels around the country. I have to say this is by far the WORST hotel that I’ve ever came in contact with. I saw roaches in the microwave, stains on the linens, and to top it all off; the front door of my room looked like it had been kicked in prior to my visit. Needless to say, I checked into the Days Inn across the road and had a descent nights rest
