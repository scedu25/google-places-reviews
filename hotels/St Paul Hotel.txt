Text: First off, this is a nice hotel. If you NEED to stay in Wooster, this is the nicest place to stay probably. That is, if you don't mind over paying. The staff were friendly and helpful. And the room was OK. I stayed in the grand suite with the hot tub and it is definitely a step up from a normal room. My real complaint is simply that its not an almost $400.00 a night after taxes room. At least not in the condition it was in while I was there. It wasn't really dirty per say, so much as not as clean as it should have been with that kind of price tag. There was all kinds of debris floating in the hot tub, which kind takes away from it when your sitting there trying to relax and you feel floating stuff bumping you LOL (kinda like getting a spider on you and then feeling like something is always crawling on you lol). The carpet is stained and unraveling in multiple locations. And the room is only kind of clean, and by that I mean, its clean just looking over it, but I moved a couple of items making the room a bit cozier. Well for just a moment anyways. When I moved the small couch I could see it was filthy underneath and against the wall the was fingernails and debris. The walls were scuffed and filthy especially in the bedroom under the T.V. Some of the drywall was cracked and flaky in the bathroom bottom corners. Again, i'm kind of nit picking, I know. But when your paying almost $400.00 a night for a room I kinda feel you deserve to. Def not a bad hotel, just not a $400.00 hotel. When you pay that kind of money your room and amenities should be immaculate! But, if you need an above average place to stay in town there and you don't mind paying for more then this will be perfect! I will say the shower is pretty nice, it does take a while to heat and the pressure is a bit lacking, but its still nice:) Again though, soap scum and grime in corners :( Also I want to say I don't mind spending more or splurging, I simply feel that if I do, that what I want to feel satisfied in doing so and in this instance I was not :( If you don't have to stay in Wooster and are simply looking for an above average room or getaway I would highly recommend either Belamere Suites in Perrysburg, OH or Gervasi Vineyard in Akron, OH. Both are much much nicer and I actually feel your getting your moneys worth. Both are very comparably priced, and not just a little bit nicer, but much much nicer. Sorry St. Paul, again not a bad place. But I think your establishment should be ashamed to charge the same prices and be so lacking in quality :(

Text: Visited the suite in preparation for a wedding. Very tastefully decorated! Loved having the hot tub and bedroom/living room areas separated by the metal sliding door. Best part was heated tile floor in the bathroom!!
