Denison Inn & Suites

Text: Please see photos and captions, the front desk was clean, clerk was friendly. Rooms were large and spacious, stocked. Did have a working fridge and microwave. Outdated fixtures and finishes. Bed was not soft, so for those who like a firm mattress that is a plus. Shower fixture is great for those who are vertically challenged, needed a new shower curtain though. Maid was friendly and courteous in the mid morning. If you need a quick inexpensive crash pad this will work. Note: hot tub and sauna were not working.
