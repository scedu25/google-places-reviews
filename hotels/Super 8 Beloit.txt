Super 8 Beloit
Rating: 4
Text: Great staff. There is adequate and decently lit space to park trailers and semi trucks across the street behind the Wendy’s. Safe area. Very friendly night desk attendant checked us in late and confirmed where we could park our trailer. Gwen took great care of us at checkout, you can tell she really cares about the guests and the hotel. Excellent customer service! Convenient exit doors located along the side with the parking so getting back and forth from our rig was easy. Refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker in room. Hospitable place at a decent price. AAA auto club discount for members.

Text: Nice place good size pool, not high chlorine. Not too cold. Good breakfast. Waffles! Easy to get to from the main drag. No entry cover on the driveway, we unloaded in a thunderstorm. This is for the Super 8 in Beloit.

Text: If you need a place to sleep for a few days and don't really mind and mediocre hotel than Super 8 is perfectly fine. The rooms are comfortable and spacious and the bathroom is good too. The service is friendly and the only thing I'll complain about is the breakfast given. The eggs and sausages are practically inedible and during my stay the waffle iron was out of order. If you don't mind a breakfast of yogurt and toast than Super 8 is a good choice for you.

Text: Having never stayed at a S8, I was skeptical. My one night stay was pleasant. The room was clean. I would stay again if I was in the area.

Text: Clean, bed seems comfy. Nice pool area, not very many jets in the whirlpool, but the water is warm. Easy to find, close to restaurants and gas stations. Staff is very nice.
