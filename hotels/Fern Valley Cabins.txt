Fern Valley Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: Cozy cabin tucked away in the woods. Nicely decorated, had two bunk beds and a futon, perfect size for two people. Cabin is right next to the river and there's a fire pit outside, great for bonfires. Really loved staying at this idyllic location.

Only thing to be aware of is there is no cell phone service/internet and the cabins run on well water (really disgusting to drink if you're not used to it) so bring bottled water.

Text: Great cabin, small, but everything you would need for a great weekend.  Comfortable beds, soft linens, stocked kitchen, and that great cedar smell when you walk in the door.  Wonderful picnic, campfire area and it sits right at the river.  Owner was very friendly and went out of her way to make sure we had a great time.  Thanks Maxine!  We will definitely be booking again in the fall.  Only downside would be there is no cell phone service once you cross the ridge down into this little valley, but hey, that's one of the perks if you ask me.
