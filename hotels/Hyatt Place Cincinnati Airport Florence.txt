Hyatt Place Cincinnati Airport/Florence
Rating: 4
Text: I was given a good rate when I booked about 3 days out from my one night stay.  Front desk was polite and quick check in.  I was placed right beside the elevator.  While it wasn't loud I could still here it from time to time.  It wasn't loud enough to wake me though.  I wasn't in the room long  but from what I used it was nice.

Text: The hotel is very easy to find and it is in a quiet area conveniently located next to the airport, only 15 minutes from downtown. The rooms are nice and big. Breakfast is simple but filling. We will definitely be back if we are visiting Cincinnati again.

Text: Nice rooms except bathers very small. Comfortable bed, good lighting and plenty of plugs...which is unusual in hotel rooms. Good breakfast. Friendly front desk employees. Will return in the future.

Text: Oct 23th we stayed at  room 315,   we had some issues with the shower door, it would not stay closed,  and water in shower did not drain correctly because the floor was not level,  there was not clock in room,  the pool was not inviting,  because is surrounded by concrete, and fan was extremely noisy. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant.  thanks.

Text: Stayed here for a weekend of Reds games. Standard Hyatt Place experience. I wish the entrance was a little closer to the freeway exit. I usually don't use the pools, but this one seemed a little cloudy/dirty, maybe because there was a big group in there earlier? Convenient to a lot of restaurants and grocery stores. I would stay here again. I'd rather stay at the downtown Hyatt, but there were no rooms available there for my World of Hyatt points (I booked only a couple days in advance). I wasn't offered or given any bottled waters for my Discoverist membership (not a big deal this time since I brought my own anyway). Family liked the breakfast offerings.
