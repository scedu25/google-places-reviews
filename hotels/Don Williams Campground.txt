Don Williams Campground

Text: Really lovely setting with beautiful trees.  However,  lack of supervision means that picnic tables are moved by campers, plastics are found in campfire pits,and people may or may not have cleaned up after their pets. The rates are great and it is quiet midweek.  (Imagine weekends might be something else.) And, there are bars over the windows of the office.  An indication if some vandalism at some point, I guess.
