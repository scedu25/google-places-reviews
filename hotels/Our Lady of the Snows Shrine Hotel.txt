Our Lady of the Snows Shrine Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: This is a "basic" hotel on the grounds of Our Lady of the Snows National Shrine. The rooms are reasonably sized and priced. The TV is old (nat a flat screen) but functional. Breakfast (including waffles) is included. The entire facility is very clean and well organized.

Text: They have very nice, spacious  and cozy rooms. A wonderful place to get a spiritual recharge. Lots of space and the shrines are beautiful, I can't wait till they get the Stations of the Cross finished. A wonderful place for a quiet retreat.

Text: Well, the rooms are decent, the front desk personal are very nice, but, the one thing that we were not very happy about is. Our tv is probably a 1980's no microwave and no refrigerator.  We have joining rooms with my sister and her husband and they have a really nice tv ,and all the extras. So, if you book a room her, and if a tv and refrigerator is what you want,  you need to ask for a room that has all that.

Text: Okay kept hotel rooms that are a bit small. Peaceful quiet place to stay though. Not enough hotels have CRT TVs, they are great for Super Smash Bros Melee as they have little to no input delay.
