Best Western Plus Georgetown Corporate Center Hotel

Text: Excellent experience staying at this hotel!  Staff is excellent! They went out of their way when we wanted to change rooms due to a slightly musty smell (my friend has asthma issues). The next room was perfect. Clean, comfortable bed, nice bathrooms.  The breakfast the next morning had a great selection, and was hot and fresh even though I went down just before they closed. Only issue with breakfast - I think it closed at 9! Early for me.  Overall staff made the difference and rooms were great.

Text: This is a very nice hotel.  There are a lot of extra details.  The staff is supreme and very friendly and accommodating.  Comfy bed.  BW eggs are bland.  I'd like to see some real eggs offered for breakfast.  Morning protein is very important.

Text: The Lexington KY area is a regular stop-over for me in business and family-related travel. I had missed the Best Western Plus Georgetown Corporate Center Hotel until now! It, hands down, is the best site I have found yet! Clean, quiet, well located for an easy dinner and all the details just right!

Don't just LOOK at the loveseat if your room has one--it is very comfortable for sitting too!

Text: The personnel were genuinely friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. I also enjoyed the indoor swimming pool and hot tub. They also offer a great physical fitness center. I only wish I had more time.
