Text: Riverside has an awesome atmosphere for the middle of Iowa. Their gaming floor has tons of slots and every table game. Hotel and spa services are top notch also and very well priced. I also attended a craft fair in the reception hall the weekend I went down and it had many vendors from all around. Riverside is the complete package for a great time!

Text: My husband and I just stayed overnight on Saturday, September 30,. 2017. Our stay at your resort was exceptional. Our steaks at Ruthie's Steakhouse and wine were delicious, our room was comfortable and clean, and the golf spectacular! The one person who made that difference was Kevin DeNIke. We set up an appointment in the performance studio and he was knowledgeable, accommodating and gave us the "red carpet" treatment. We were thrilled to have our golf game analyzed by Kevin and his recommendation on our clubs. The golf course was very busy yet Kevin took the time needed for our instruction and was the epitome of a golf professional who everyone likes, admires, and respects. Kevin is energetic, personable, enthusiastic and made our experience at Riverside Golf and Casino fun and enjoyable. He deserves a huge bonus in our opinion. He can multi-task and works his heart out. We both play a lot of golf, like to gamble, eat good food, and drink good wine. Blue Top Ridge meets all of our expectations and more. This is one of our favorite places to spend a weekend because of Kevin's hospitality and expertise skills and knowledge of the game of golf! Thanks Kevin for a  fantastic weekend! We will be back soon!

Text: Riverside is a really nice casino. The rooms are really neat. They have huge, all glass, walk in showers with electric curtains that close around it. Nice variety of slots. Could be a little more generous with the pay outs. Pretty tight! Only reason i stayed here is because my husband is in the hospital in iowa city. And with the discount coupons that we get in the riverside monthly flier, it makes it way cheaper than staying in any other hotel around. And less stress with all going on. All around nice place.

Text: Stopped in casino to play a little poker. Great little place for poker. The casino is big if you a slot player. The poker room was smaller than most I have eaten but the people were ultra friendly. Staff was nice!
