Text: Absolutely love this place. Some small tub stains but what can you really do about a stain? The people were lovely and helpful at anytime.

Text: Hotel staff very professional. Manager was resolving a guest issue when we checked in. We had a great stay, housekeeping was good. Breakfast lady was helpful and got us some bacon when we asked. Very clean place and staff was knowledgeable about the area. Better than Hampton!

Text: Every employee that we had contact with went out of their way to greet us warmly and ask if they could help us with anything.  They were polite and kind and more than accommodating. We were able to check in much earlier than we planned and had a pack and play waiting for us in our room because we had mentioned we had a baby. 
The service here is phenomenal, the hotel itself is clean and fresh and welcoming. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are quiet. If you're in the area we would highly recommend Fairfield inn!
