2 Sisters Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had a great stay! The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The hostess was friendly and accommodating. She is a community leader, so she is very knowledgeable about the town and provided great recommendations for dinner and attractions. The food was yummy, filling and delicious. We are glad we spent the weekend there!

Text: 2 Sisters is everything a b&b should be.  Cool old house, nice private rooms, fun hosts, and a good breakfast.  Also, we could walk to the charming downtown, and the river is only a few blocks away.

Text: Beautiful home with interesting features and history. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The sisters are great and breakfast was very tasty! It is in town but it is a quiet location with a big front porch to relax and drink your morning coffee. Madison has lots of options for a small town. There are great places to eat and shopping is fun with lots of variety. Rich in history and architecture there are many things to do in a weekend. The river walk is very nice for a stroll and often has activities going on there. Also, there is a beautiful state park nearby with some good hiking. We enjoyed our visit and recommend it to anyone passing through or needing a long weekend away from home. We want to return!
