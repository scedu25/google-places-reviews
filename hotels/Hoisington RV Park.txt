Hoisington RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: For a city operated RV park, this one is good for an overnight stop, though not very scenic being behind a recreation center by an open field and a water tower, the sites are a bit odd, being back in sites on the edge of a large parking lot with the water and electric hookups located behind the sites off the pavement.  They even provide free wifi, though its performance is less than great and it has fairly strict website content filtering.  There is some fast food, and even a small grocery store within walking distance maybe 1/4 mile away on the main highway.  The place was mostly empty the night I was there with only 1 other RV there and no activities in the recreation center going on, I was self contained so only used water and electric hookup so can't comment about the facilities beyond this.

Text: Nice place to stay. Has 30 & 50 amps and water, have to go to dump station. You can use Activities Center to shower. Shower area is clean but there was no hot water. When we asked about the hot water we were told " hot water heater is on the other side of the building and no one has used the showers for a couple weeks. He did put a note in about the hot water issue. Other wise it is really nice and very inexpensive.
