Courtyard by Marriott Lansing
Rating: 4
Text: Good rooms. Messed up reservation and not much to correct it. Breakfast bar was great. Parking a challenge. Restaurants within very reasonable walking distance. There's a pool that looks good. Overall good impression.

Text: Room was great, staff was very friendly. Only downside was there is no free breakfast bar, and the café that they have instead is expensive and takes a while to prepare your food.

Text: I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott as part of a bridal party and they were very accommodating. They upgraded the bride's hotel room to the best hotel suite, brought us a roll away bee, amount other grand gesters. The hotel was recently renovated and in all, looks awesome. There is not free breakfast, but the little coffee shop serves delicious breakfast sandwiches.

Text: This hotel is very utilitarian. It provides you with a reasonably comfortable bed, and not much else. The rooms are in dire need of renovation. The showers are small and uncomfortable, the shower head is too low, the bathrooms are awkwardly laid out, the paint is scratched, chipped, and damaged. This is one of few hotels in the area, all of which are in similar condition. I recommend avoiding the area and staying in another nearby city with better accommodations if possible, but if you must stay in the area, this is as good as it gets.

Text: Great room. Clean. Rehearsal dinner for a wedding, reserved a room to eat in. Any additional service was quickly provided. Needed 40 seats, and got 25, but they quickly rectified the situation. Definitely a thumbs-up.
