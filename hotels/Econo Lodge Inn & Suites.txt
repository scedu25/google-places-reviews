Text: I checked in very late due to a weather delay which caused my reservation to be cancelled. However the clerk was able to fix this for me. He saw that I had a service dog and informed me of the designated place to walk my service dog. He also have me a room at the end near the back door which was next to the pet area. I greatly appreciated his courtesy. The room was very large with a very large bathroom. The room was clean and the hotel was very quiet. I wanted to stay there again when I was traveling they but the hotel was booked solid. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through Iowa.

Text: Unfortunately I was put next to 2 doors that went outside and every time someone came in or out they let both doors slam. I had my dog with me and she kept growling and or would bark. They eventually put a sign up on one of the doors which helped for awhile but started right back up at 5:30am. Service was great, room was clean, and they had an awseome restaurant near by called Emma Jeans. Great Food!
