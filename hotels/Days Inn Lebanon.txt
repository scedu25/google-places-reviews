Text: CLEAN ROOMS and GREAT VALUE. I stay in Lebanon every year to visit my in-laws. Previously I had stayed in another hotel but the rates were much higher and so I decided to try out the Days Inn. I was 100% satisfied with every aspect of the stay: the rooms were CLEAN, the staff was FRIENDLY (shout-out to Stephen & Joshua), we had FREE WIFI, a pool for the kids, and a great breakfast in the lobby every morning. Next year I will definitely be staying at the Days Inn. Thanks so much for the great stay!

Text: Friendly staff, the king size bed was very comfortable and our bathroom was very clean... However the room had the same musty smell of a cheaper motel. There was a dead praying mantis, and grasshopper under the curtain. In my opinion, this place could use a facelift and upgrade in their bedrooms, it looked like our bathroom was remodeled recently but not the bedroom. Overall it was ok, I'm just pickier than my husband. I recommend staying here if you're looking for a comfortable, low cost, quiet place to stay.
