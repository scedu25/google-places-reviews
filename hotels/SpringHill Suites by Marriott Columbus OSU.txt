Text: This hotel is top notch. A great staff, clean rooms, and centrally located. The people that run the front desk were extremely helpful. The bartender was very friendly and talkative. I look forward to staying here again.

Text: Really nice room for a great rate. Everything seemed recently renovated. The location was great for me too. Breakfast was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it close to some more interesting restaurants and coffee shops.

Text: This Hotel needs to be updated. The carpet in the room was filthy! The stainless steel compact refrigerator had handprints and the nightstands were not cleaned off. We also called down for more towels and they were never brought up. This place has great potential if just brought up to date
