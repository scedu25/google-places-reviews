Country Hearth Inn & Suites - Willard
Rating: 2
Text: Very smokey and dingy, nasty bathroom, broken fridge, and TERRIBLE Wi-Fi, literally unusable. If you have Verizon there is also no data connection and very poor cell reception. Hope you like basic cable because that's your only entertainment. Breakfast is mediocre at best. 2 stars instead of 1 because it is cheap. But you get what you pay for..

Text: It sucks that this little Podunk town only has one hotel.  I stay here when I visit family in town because there's no other option, but the place is always unkempt and dirty.  The carpets look like someone has puked on them and the walls are paper thin.  The people in the room next to me we're having an orgy and I could hear every detail.  I had my kid with me, so I had to keep the tv up loud to keep the child from hearing what was going on.  The employees are tattooed and scraggly, hotel's exterior looks like a third world country war zone, and the interior is run down and outdated.  I only give it a one star because there's not an option to give it less.
