Text: Friendly staff. When the renovations are done it will be fantastic. Can't wait to come back. 

We were here for Comedy Off Broadway and it is so convenient. Park the car and never have to leave if you don't want.

Text: This is a contender for one of the worst hotels I've
ever stayed at. 

First off, the downstairs area is audible no matter where you are in this place so even on the fifth floor I can hear the drunk girl wooing at midnight in the bar. Second, this place has conference/meeting rooms on the floor. Friday morning I'm coming out of my hotel room and face to face with a group of 20-30 people right outside my room, what the hell?

Third, the cheapest televisions in these rooms. I tried watching John Wick 2 and whenever an action sequence goes down it looks like an 8 bit Nintendo game on the screen.

I just brought a cart to put my bags on it and within a half hour of it being outside my room the cleaning staff took it and brought it right back downstairs.

The benefit of this place if you're visiting is that it's right by everything and that's it.

Text: There is Major construction inside so the entrance is not impressive. Service was quick and efficient. The room was very nice with a view of the lake and fountains. The band playing next door was loud until 10 PM, then we had quiet in a very comfortable bed.

Text: The staff was great . I'd give them 5 stars. Rooms where nice. But the construction going on when I was there 6/2-6/4 was almost unbearable!  Really all that noise at 9 am on a Sunday? ? I suggest asking if the work is still going on when you plan to stay! Great outside atmosphere with live music on the weekends.
