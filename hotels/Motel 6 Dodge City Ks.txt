Motel 6 Dodge City Ks

Text: I made the reservation online and was not aware that there was an extra charge for additional guests. I reserved a double room and assumed standard occupancy was 2-4 guests. When I checked in, I was asked how many people were in the room and replied 4. The manager let me know there would be an additional charge. I asked what the extra charge covered and how much it would be per person. He said he didn't know, that the "computer decided it". I booked my room at $133.90 and but was charged $188.94 for having 4 guests. An extra $55.04 seemed outrageous to me. So I went online to check the difference in price when you added guests. For 1 guest it was $130.62, and for 4 it was $151.62, a difference of $21 even. I really feel stolen from and am unlikely to stay in a Motel 6 again or recommend this motel. I understand charging for extra guests, but the manager charged me way more than the standard charge and could not give me a per person breakdown. I was told that the manager would call me and tell me how the charges were broken down, but never received a call.

Text: Service was fine pleasant and friendly however we had visitors in the room in the form of cockroaches. The room stunk badly like mildew. The floors are so thin we could hear everything from the people above us.
