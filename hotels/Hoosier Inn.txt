Text: We stayed here for a week during a recent visit to Portland and my Portland High School class reunion. We were very pleased with everything, including the friendly, accommodating management, clean room, hot shower, central location, and low noise level. It is definitely a lot of value for the cost. We'll be back!

Text: Stayed here after five years and saw a great change, the bed and the furniture was updated, had a strong wifi signal in the room I stayed in, and would not mind staying again when I come visit my family.

Text: Don't let the polite demeanor fool you if you plan to stay for more than a week. Housekeeping cleaned only twice in my two week stay and they complained about the amount of stuff that 4 people had. Also, if you aren't in the half of the building closest to the office, forget the Wi-Fi. The signal sucks at best. I had 2 days of useful internet out of 14 days I was there. The room phone wouldn't stay plugged into the wall, my linens were changed one time, I had to request toilet paper, etc. The list goes on and on. Avoid this hotel, they suck.
