Text: My first time at a B & B and it was a wonderful experience.  Hal and Lyse were wonderful hosts, very sweet and kind, made us feel very comfortable and was very informative about Pelee and gave suggestions were to visit.  The B & B was immaculate and perfectly decorated with a country feel.  The 3 course breakfast was amazing!  Very close to the beaches and Pelee National Park.  Can't wait to come back.  Kind Regards, Lucia and Ed

Text: I loved the French toast banana bread! I'm still thinking about it a week later. Also, the  hosts were lovely, the view and location wonderful and the space well cared for. Really a gem! You should be prepared for close quarters with other guests.  Bonus: it is just up the road from the national park!
