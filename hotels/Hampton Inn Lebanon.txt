Text: It's a Hampton. Expect nothing more and you get what you pay for. Great place to get a good night's sleep, freshen up and get out to those Kentucky bourbon distilleries!!!

Text: Not quite up to standards with Hampton Inns. Parking lot is tiny, hotel is hard to find. Shower door in room 117 was on the verge of breaking. It was a sliding door with no ball bearings. Simply GRINDING aluminum on aluminum!
Breakfast was fantastic!!!

Text: May  have hot breakfast....but no hot water.  When asked about hot water  young guy comes to my room after I had shower running for 15 min. He feels the water and has the nerve to say, that's not warm enough for you?  Really? The water was cool. He then says he will move me. I told him to check that room before I move my stuff.  Well no hot water. He seemed to be contradicting himself with everything coming out of his mouth.  So then he says whole hotel is out of hot water. So I wait and wait. I go down stairs to see how things are going and he answers me very very smooth 3. "THEY ARE WORKING ON IT".  When I checked  in 2 days ago  there was an older couple who was promised a room.  When they got here, they were told no rooms available.
