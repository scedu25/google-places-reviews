Coshocton Village Inn & Suites

Text: The hotel was not bad, it's very close to Roscoe Village (you can walk). The room could have been a little cleaner, and the hot tub steps were slippery!!!! But otherwise it's not a bad little hotel to spend a couple nights.

Text: Been here many times, with great experiences; however, not happy with desk clerk Krista. She was not pleasant or informative when making reservations, nor, the next day when our door keys wouldn't work...others were great..
