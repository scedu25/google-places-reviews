Text: An Excellent venue for your event or meeting. The staff is friendly and helpful. Shout out to Shari, our hostess,  and the kitchen staff because that was the best breakfast burrito ever!

Text: The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the front desk was professional. The only issue we had was the remote to the TV for the jaccuzi didn't work. A very small, insignificant issue. We would most likely stay here again if we needed accommodations in the area. We were disappointed that breakfast was not included, and this is something we look for typically. But we knew when we booked that it wasn't. Again, a small, insignificant issue. The hotel is very nice and we had a pleasant stay.

Text: We stayed in a Jacuzzi room. The overall appearance of the lobby was fantastic. Check-in was ok but they did not advise checkout time or location of pool/work out room. The room itself was very nice. The only issue is the Jacuzzi itself. Took forever to fill. It also had hair and debris in the jacuzzi.
