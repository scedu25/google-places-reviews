Text: Was recently down in southern IL for a backpacking trip on the River-to-River trail through Shawnee National Forest, and had called several days before the trip to setup a shuttle from Eddyville to Elizabethtown.  We got there on Saturday (around 4pm ish) and went to the office to talk with someone.  The office was locked, so I went up to the man mowing the grass to ask if he was the owner and he was and asked about our shuttle to Elizabethtown.  After a moment, I was told that we wouldn't be able to have a shuttle (since he had an appointment and his wife wasn't there to give us a ride).  This left us up a trail without a ride to get where we needed to be.  This was the worst service i've had with any of our backpacking trips and won't go here in the future for anything.
