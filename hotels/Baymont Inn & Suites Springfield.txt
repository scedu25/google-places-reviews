Text: Room was well worth the price. Very clean, fresh smelling, nicely designed, and spacious. Bathroom was equally clean, and good quality shampoo, conditioner, and soap was provided. Bed was large, and extremely comfortable. Staff was very friendly, and courteous, and even provided me with a complimentary toothpaste & toothbrush when I mentioned I had forgotten to bring mine. The overall design of the building was very nice & clean. The complimentary breakfast was a step above the typical cold breakfast selection. Sausage, biscuits, gravy, eggs, cereal, waffles & french toast, along with coffee, and juices. The breakfast room itself was rather small & cramped, but adequate enough. My only real disappointment was the late check in time (3 pm), & standard checkout (11 pm). It kind of seems as if you're getting gypped out of several hours of what should be a full days stay. One of the only motels I've ever stayed in with such a late check in time. But I'd still stay there again. Overall, I was extremely impressed.

Text: Nice Clean Rooms.   At a very reasonable rate.   I called to c what their rate was and they quoted me a low rate so we went there about an hour later without making the reservation ahead of time also because I don't like to use my credit card online in my phone.   But when i got there the rate they gave me was almost 20 dollars higher,  so i mentioned that I called them a while b4 and they had quoted me the other rate and they gave me that rate.   That was Awesome of them!   The Free Breakfast the next morning was very good...  A lot of variety...  Much more than ive ever seen in other hotels b4 !  
Our only complaint is they sure seem to have very very thin walls you could hear the neighbors next door very clearly.   And ours just happened to come in at 3am.  And stayed very loud for about an hour.

Text: Stayed on 3rd floor and slept like a baby.  Bed & pillows were comfortable and clean.  The entire property was very clean.  I had the chance to meet the new owners of the property, and they were nice people.  The hotel is right next door to a Cracker Barrel if you're a fan of that chain.  Would stay here again.  Bathroom and pool area were clean and we'll maintained.  Stayed here 9/27/2017-9/28/2017.

Text: The new owner takes so much pride in his hotel. Walking in - you say wow. Not your typical old looking Baymonts. The staff is amazingly nice. Rooms were upgraded 2 years ago and he wants to redo them all already. Rooms were quiet. Clean. Beds and pillows were so comfy. Wonderful water pressure and nice and HOT. For any frugal business travel - this is a hidden gem. I checked out thinking I would be done with business - and nope. So of course, I went right back to my new favorite hotel.
