Dusty Trail Inn

Text: Decent for the price. Pet friendly. Nice staff. Non smoking room description only means that someone isn't smoking in there at that moment, not, never smoked in. Lots of burn marks and strong cigarette odors. So much so that my clothes smelled of smoke the next morning.

Text: If you're a "high brow" traveler, The Dusty Trail Inn may not seem to fit your foo-foo lifestyle, but you'll be missing out on a good opportunity to rest from your long drive. No need to worry that this place doesn't have a chain name. The rooms are spacious and clean, and the mini refrigerator and microwave are a convenient addition. Breakfast choices are plentiful. The hotel is easy to locate from the highway, and Garden City offers plenty of amenities close by. I recommend having a meal at Wards café just across U.S 83 from the hotel. Good food!  Each of the hotel's staff were polite and helpful. They treated us very kindly upon our arrival and throughout our three night stay.
