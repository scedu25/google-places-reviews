Bright Leaf Golf Resort

Text: Bright Leaf is the perfect place for a stay and play golf outing. Our group has been here numerous times and we absolutely love it. Hotel and pool are great. The course is always in good condition and the restaurant has great food but even better staff. Highly recommend Bright Leaf.

Text: The place was a little dirty and in need of a deep clean, or better yet a remodel. Went to bathroom in middle of the night and found roaches under bathmat. Would not recommend this place.
