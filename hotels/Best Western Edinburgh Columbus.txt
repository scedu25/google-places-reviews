Text: Nice hotel. Decent breakfast. Bed could be a little more comfortable and pool water could be warmer but have been in colder. Hotel has been recently updated so that's a plus too.

Text: The hotel is really nice and the rooms were cleaned really well. The pool was a little cold and the manager was nice enough to turn up the heater in it. Overall I would definitely stay again. I would highly recommend staying here again.

Text: My usual priorities in a hotel are:  Competent & friendly staff; Cleanliness; and, Affordability.  This Best Western fit all of my criteria.  Temperature controls in the room functioned well, bed & pillows were comfortable, room smelled clean, shower head was adjustable.  Wi-fi worked fine.  Pool could have been warmer, but seemed clean, and we had fun in it.  My husband was bummed that there was no hot tub, but there was not one advertised/promised, so that's on us.  If you are a stickler for new carpet and modern decor, then you will probably find a lot to gripe about.  If you're a reasonable person who wants a nice place to stay and still have cash left over to shop, eat, explore, then this is a good place to hang your hat for a while.

Text: The Best Western Edinburgh/ Columbus is truly a wonderful hotel!! I had a large group stay in the hotel and 100% of the persons within my group were greatly satisfied. The hospitality and service we received were second to none., I would like to commend Sheena and her friendly staff for making our stay comfortable and meeting the needs of my group no matter how great or small.
