Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Columbus West/Hilliard
Rating: 5
Text: My entire family stayed at Fairfield Inn for several days for a family reunion and we all had a fantastic experience!! The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful! Asking how we were and always greeting us with smiles. The breakfast crew/cooks that set out the unbelievably amazing continental breakfast were so sweet and lovely, always with a  "good morning" and kept the area stocked and clean. The breakfast was awesome- waffles, fruit, yogurt, bacon, eggs, omelets, oatmeal, cereal, etc. Wow, the nicest spread! The maid staff were helpful and friendly and kept the rooms looking great. The hotel is very clean and run with the nicest staff. It really made the vacation all the more better. The rooms are spacious with all the amenities you could want. Super experience and would definitely recommend the place.

Text: Good location close to the freeway. The staff were great, they accommodated our one year old with Johnson's baby toiletries and a small toy. Breakfast was also very tasty.

Text: Good for the price. The manager is friendly. The room was dated but clean. Much better than the last 2 places I stayed for the previous nights in this same area.

Text: The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed playing in the pool. Breakfast was nice. We got the last room in the place (a double double), which was a bit cramped for our large family, so I'd recommend getting a reservation.
