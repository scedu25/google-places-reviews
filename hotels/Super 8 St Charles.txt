Text: Okay...carpet needs to be shampooed. They turned the water off almost the entire day because someone was working on the water system. They did not inform you ahead of time. Staff was very nice.

Text: The lady who checked us in was very nice but the room was a disappointment.  Although I had booked this room well in advance of my arrival date I did not get the room I asked for.  I requested a no smoking room, and the door plate outside the door showed it was a no smoking room, the room smelled like cigarette smoke.  The lady who checked us in warned us that the rooms where we were combined, some smoking some no smoking and that the room and hallway smelled like smoke.  She said we could move the next day if we wanted but she didn't have any other room available for our first night.  The room smelled horrible.  The next day everything we had smelled like smoke.  It was so bad I had to spray everything with an odor control spray.  Non smokers are very sensitive to the odor of smoke and should never be given a room or be on a floor where people are allowed to smoke.  I feel that I should be given a partial refund as this hotel was given at least a month advanced notice and should have had the non smoking room when we arrived.

Text: You get what you pay for with this hotel. We reserved a non smoking room, but were told none were available when we arrived. The furniture was worn and the building smelled. The desk attendant was very nice and apologetic and the pool area looked well kept. Overall the building was clean.

Text: Good location, easy to get to. Staff was cheerful. It was pretty nice, but needed a deep cleaning around the edges. Nice bed, bedding and pillows.

Text: Wasn't too bad for a Super 8. Large pool. Breakfast wasn't anything great but worked for us.
