Text: This hotel has a great location right off of I-355, and a friendly staff. However, it's age is starting to show and needs renovated. Just a short drive from Morton Arboretum and a variety of food and shopping options.

Text: The staff here was incredibly friendly and they all seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. This was great. My room was as described, ready early for me, and very clean. They do offer free breakfast in the morning too. Price seemed a little high for this caliber of hotel a but I would stay here again.

Text: The breakfeast is amazing and HOT. The staff is absolutely courteous and nice. They are all polite and will help you the best they can with rooms and accomidations. Slight down side is the rooms are dated and the hotel used to be a smoker friendly. Little bit of mold in one of the rooms but like i said they were more than reasonable with switching us out :)

Good location. Lots of restaurants and shopping centres close by. Malls, Wal-Mart, Costco -- all within 10 minutes. 

I was worried after reading some of the reviews. However, my room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was clean. There was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. No real complaints about the room, except that the air conditioner is a bit noisy. 

All of the staff I encountered were very nice!
