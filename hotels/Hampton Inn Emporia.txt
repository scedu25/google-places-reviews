Hampton Inn Emporia
Rating: 5
Text: Best hotel in Emporia, hands down. I was surprised to find that they call a few minutes after you get to your room, to make sure that everything is acceptable. Very friendly staff that makes working in Emporia that much better.

Text: Great customer service. Rooms are clean and nice. Even my 8 year old commented on how nice it smelled when we walked in. Arrived at midnight and the gentleman at the desk made check in easy and fast. Which is nice after driving all day. I will definitely recommend The Hampton Inn to others traveling on I-35.
