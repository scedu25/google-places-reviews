Text: We stayed on a Friday & Saturday night. Check in was quick & friendly. He asked if we wanted first or second floor, we chose first floor to accommodate my mother. The room was clean. It was a bit stuffy, but we turned on the air and things cooled off fairly quickly. The room had a mini fridge, microwave, desk & large dresser. In the morning they had a complimentary breakfast set out that consisted of muffins, bread, biscuits & gravy, waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, apples bananas, juices & coffee. There were tea bags, but no hot water to make tea or the packets of oatmeal that were on the counter. Overall, it was a good experience & we plan on staying again when we come to town for the What Cheer Flea Market.

Text: My mother and I stayed here with our company and it was super comfy. However my mother had gotten food poisoning from the Deviled Eggs for Breakfast on June 23rd, 2017. The only thing she got sick on was that. Otherwise it was a great stay. Just don't let them hand all the keys out to one person if you travel with a group or company.
