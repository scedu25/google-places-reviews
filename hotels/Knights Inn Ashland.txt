Text: The rooms are clean and have a descent decor. The price is is great for a room that your just going to be sleeping in. There is no riff raff hanging around outside so it is safe.

Text: The rooms were nice and spacious enough for me and my father and the dog to be comfortable and the smokers room was not in a bad shape like is sometimes common at hotels

Text: It was a place to sleep. I wouldn't stay there with kids or a family. However, as a man who was tired from driving 7 hours with another 7 hours left I was in the right place at the right time. Room has a recliner a desk and a bed plain and simple. As a bonus it did have a fridge and microwave. I'm not saying it's bad but just know it's nothing special. I paid 67 dollars for a queen size room. I gave me the sleep I needed. In addition there appears to be people(energy or construction workers) I assume living there. The people I encountered seemed nice enough as a man once again. I wouldn't want my kids or wife staying here though.
