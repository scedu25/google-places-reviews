Text: We had a room in the back by the outside door. We also have a small dog with very sharp hearing. We also had people walking up and down in front of our door and the entry area next to our room talking on their phones which cause our dog to bark, because it sounded like they were right outside our door. Then we the outside door next to our room opening and closing all night as people went out to smoke and stood by our window talking with each other or on cells. Needless to say,  after driving 510 miles, I really needed sleep and not be awake all night. I doubt we will ever stay there again.

Text: Small place that allows for pets. Our room was a small room with two beds and a bathroom but it wasn't small enough to be comfortable. It has an out door pool and staff that helps out quickly when asked. I enjoyed my stay here and would come again!

Text: The bathroom in our room was super small. I had to enter the bathroom sideways, or both shoulders would hit the door frame.  Inside the bathroom you have to almost stand on the toilet to shut the door.

The rest of the room wasn't terrible, just average.
