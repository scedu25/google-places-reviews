Text: Room was clean and spacious.  Nice TV.  Coffee machine and small dorm fridge AND a microwave.  All for a reasonable price.  My only complaint was the smell as soon as I walked in the door.  Whatever that really heavy deodorizer is, I'd get rid of it.  It's waaayyyy to strong and there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the downstairs hallway.  I didn't smell it once I got in the room.  I would stay there again, however.

Text: The room was a great value considering we had a pet along. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. My two complaints are that I wish they had more pillows on the bed and it would have been nice if water was available in the vending machine. I would definitely stay here again!

Text: Poor experience. We arrived on 5/6/17 around 9:00pm and whoever had worked the previous shift had not put down that the previous occupant of our room had checked out. The poor front desk woman (who was very nice and is the only reason it is getting 3 stars instead of 2) had to go all the way to the back end of the building to check and make sure the room was clean. The room was, for the most part, outdated. There was a tiny bottle of shampoo but no body wash or soap. After my husband swam he had to wash with just the shampoo. The worst part was the bed. It was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in and I didn't get any restful sleep.

Also outdated TV service reminiscent of the 1990s. 

We were hoping the breakfast would be the saving grace. We were wrong. We will pay the 20 or so dollars extra to stay at the Best Western next time.
