Sonesta ES Suites Cleveland Airport
Rating: 5
Text: My dad and mom stayed at this hotel.  They loved it so much they decided to stay in Cleveland a little longer.  I'm an interior designer and i have to say they've got the design of the rooms set beautifully!   The colors and layout are very appealing.  I nice area in the rooms for visiting  (ample chairs,  a couch and coffee table).  Also a nice kitchenette.  The bed looks very comfortable.  The room was very clean and the grounds are week kept.  This area of Cleveland is also very nice for visitors.  There are many good restaurants to choose from,  grocery stores near by,  a beautiful metropark, about 2 minutes from the highway and nearby shopping of all sorts.

Text: I would have given it 5 stars bit the cleaning staff does need a little work. We doing a bottle of Diet Coke in the fridge from the last guest. Also the shelves in the cabinets needed to be cleaned out. Other than those two thing, great place to stay

Text: What a fantastic place to stay! Had a great little outdoor pool, as well as a basketball court/tennis court (with equipment to borrow). Nice tv room /lounge. Our room was huge! Lots of room to move around. Great kitchenette. Very clean. LOTS of places to plug things in.

Text: Rooms are super cute with full kitchen and space to easily sleep 5 people. Close to highway & plenty of food establishments without being so close that noise is an issue. Highly recommend.
