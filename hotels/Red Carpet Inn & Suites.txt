Red Carpet Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: My stay at the Red Carpet Inn has been very pleasant. Clean sheets and towels always offered. Laundry is done for you at your request. The rooms are clean and cozy. They offer reasonable weekly rates, and pets are allowed to join you on your vacation. Management is kind, and extremely helpful. I HIGHLY recommend this inn to anyone looking for a nice getaway!

Text: Gave 1 star only because it won't let me give it no stars! Terrible, we stay in hotels 50 weeks a year for work and this is one of the worst!  Ceiling in the bathroom was collapsing, they tacked it up with a paint stick, linoleum floor peeling up to point of trip hazard, and no bed frame! Just a box spring and mattress on the floor.  I rarely write reviews  but this one was so bad can't recommend!  Plus other issues...

Text: A lovely dump. Very bad place. Great location for a terror movie.

Text: Comfy beds. Good price. Magical lights outside and in! Air conditioner was great and not too loud. Looks scary, not that scary.

Text: Rooms are not fancy and are a little dated. But everything else makes up for it. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms have mini fridge, micro, and working air conditioning. Beds are comfortable and clean. Caught housekeeping mopping the hallway this morning when we left.
