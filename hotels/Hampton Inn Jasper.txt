Hampton Inn Jasper

Text: Nice hotel. The hotel seems to have old style rooms. They are large and quite. There was no refrigerator and microwave in my room but they arranged it quickly. Hotel is right next to a very good German restaurant. Probably best in Jasper. Overall good place to stay in Jasper.

Text: Rooms, staff, and breakfast were great.  Didn't go to the pool or fitness center.  The only complaint is that this hotel did not have automatic doors. To me, a hotel of this standing should have automatic doors.  It was very hard to get luggage in and out 

Edit Aug '17. 
They have now added automatic doors and are currently expanding and renovating. Looking great so far!

Text: Not bad, but older hotel. Lots of construction going on outside during day, so all cars parked there were covered in dust/dirt. I mentioned to the front desk that they may want to warn people, but yhey just told me where the closest car wash was. Pool was nice, fitness room was an afterthought. Internet connection was fine, as was the breakfast.

Text: The manager that checked us in, his name was Andy I think, was really nice and very helpful. There were a bunch of rowdy kids in the pool but yet the experience was still really nice. And the gym is so nice, too. Small, but very useful. One of the my best hotel experiences. Enough to make me write a review which I don't usually do. It's not a "5 star hotel" in any way but it was a great one night stay hotel that is both affordable and wonderfully clean and fun.

A very nice and clean Hotel.  The rooms are very clean and the breakfast is always good.  Possibly the nicest hotel around Holiday World.  The pool and workout area is always well kept.
