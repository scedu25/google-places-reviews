Monterey Motel

Text: Terrible sleeze bag dive roach motel. You're feet stick to the floor from the nasty carpet. None of the furniture matches. For a town that is known for its water, you won't even want to get in the shower. Rooms,all need major renovation and don't know how the city isn't totally embarrassed by this hideous out dated monstrosity! Not to mention, the caretakers are very rude!!! 
   My advice?  Fork out the extra dinero to stay at the Elms Hotel, where atleast you are considered as a customer.
