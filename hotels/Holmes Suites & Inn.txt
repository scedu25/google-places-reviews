Text: Nice place overall. Close to 270/70. Restaurants/coffee/gym in the immediate area. Hotel is in good shape, only a couple years old. Walls are thin and the shared fitness room/business center is about the size of a walk in closet. I would probably stay here again.

Text: BED BUGS
This place has Bed Bugs and they will not refund your money. The old lady with black hair is very unprofessional and crazy. The other staff seen the bed bugs herself. 
It looks very nice but they are Bed bug infested!!!
