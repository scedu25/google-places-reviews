Text: Nice area. I  really like the Lincoln area. It's peaceful and quiet. The staff is pleasant. Clean comfortable rooms. Small bathroom but great place over all.

Text: The hotel in Lincoln, ILL was pretty average. Accommodations were acceptable. Cable and Wifi available as well as breakfast. Staff was courteous when we interacted. The air-conditioning in both of our adjacent rooms (Rm318) seamed to have cold air but no blower. Would use again.

Text: This hotel isn't special in itself but the people who work there make it special. They are so kind and attentive, it was such a joy to stay there. The rooms were clean and we had everything we needed.

Text: I like it it's always nice and clean. Only thing I wish is they fix vending machine on second floor. You have to use your card bc it won't take cash. Otherwise great place. Definitely would recommend to others. ?

Text: Old stained carpet, had garbage left in unclean table, room had some broken furniture in disrepair. Very small bathroom. Bedside lamps did not work. Paid over $100 for a one night stay in what felt like a 2 star hotel. Won't be back.
