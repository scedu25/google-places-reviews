Comfort Suites Columbus
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel lobby and rooms are nice and clean. The room is a nice size and includes  a sitting area with desk and sofa. The bathroom is a decent size. There is a small microwave and a mini fridge. The pool is on the small side and the temperature is decent, but there is no hot tub. The pool could use a cleaning; my kids found 2 pieces of gum and a large hair ball at the bottom. The desk staff, especially the manager, is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is average - sausage and scrambled eggs with the usual pastry and cereal choices as well as a waffle maker. The location is a bit questionable with an adult store around the block and a shady looking motel in the back, however I  never felt unsafe. All in all, I  gave it a 4 instead of a 3 (which I would consider average) because of the comfort, size, and cleanliness of the room and the desk service.

Text: My stay here was about as expected for the rating and the price.

Pros: 
-Nice spacious room, nicely updated.
-Nice to have breakfast included.
-Good price.

Cons:
-Night staff at front desk reeked of pot smoke and was high.
-Workout room smelled of smoke, and was unable to use it.
-Pool but no hot tub (something more people would use than a pool).
-Slightly funky location, but also easy to get on the freeway and get anywhere in Columbus.

Text: Rooms and hotel were clean and the service was great. Had no problems checking in or out. The hotel does sit in an odd spot from the road but still is easily accessible.
