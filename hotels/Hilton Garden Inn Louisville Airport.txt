Hilton Garden Inn Louisville Airport
Rating: 5
Text: This is an AWESOME Hilton to stay at if you are going to the convention center. They have a free shuttle that will take you there, and to area restaurants. Super clean, really nice staff. Would stay here again!

Text: This is a very nice Hilton starting with the grounds colorful flowers and greenery. Check in was quick. The young gentleman at the desk was friendly and helpful. Our room was very large, clean,  and comfortable. LARGE TV,  microwave oven, frig, and Keurig coffee/tea maker. Two pillows each, the bed was more on the firm side. Would stay here again.

Text: The staff here was great. On the morning I left there was a problem with the shuttle and I needed to get to the airport to catch my flight, so the front desk worker immediately called me a cab and paid for it when the cab arrived. Also, the guest rooms seem recently renovated and very nice.

Text: We went to an event that a group was hosting at the hotel. The front desk staff was friendly and professional. The lobby was well appointed. The ball room was sizable and clean. An all around good experience.
