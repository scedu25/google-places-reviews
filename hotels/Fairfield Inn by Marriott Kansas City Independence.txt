Text: So far it has been very pleasant. Nice quiet room. Really nice breakfast. They are under renevation but doesn't seem to be noisy ( at least at night). Staff has bent over backwards to accommodate us.

Text: Although they were under a remodel the manager on duty Tim was amazing. We had access to the pool in the adjacent hotel and was offered their free breakfast as well. Will recommend this hotel anytime

Text: We normally love Marriotts and had a bad night here. Fitness center closed. Breakfast? Only if you cross the street to their other hotel. The pack n play for our 4-month old? It took 3 attempts to find one that worked. The lady up front was pretty nice, but those other factors were disappointing.

Text: This place is under construction. Big time. The reception was friendly and when we expressed concern over staying there, they took $20 off the room - bringing the rate to $1 over the advertised rate. Breakfast was offered if you traversed through the construction to an unknown location.  We declined.  Feeling like...well, not good.  But the construction workers who were loitering around the parking lot when we pulled in didn't hurt our car do we're good.
