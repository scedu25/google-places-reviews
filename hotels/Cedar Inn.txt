Text: I always preface my reviews by stating that I typically stay 150 nights a year in motels as I travel a lot for work. This place is great. You can park right by your door, the rooms are clean, and it is in quiet location off the main road. It isn't the Hilton but it is a good place to stay the night. I was here a week and I wish all motels were like this. The owner Ron is an awesome guy. One night when we were there he cooked steaks on his grill and invited us to join him.

Text: Pilot Car!  I had a great stay here at a good price. If you're in town check it out. Flat-screen and good shower pressure. The only thing missing is a more comfortable chair in the room.
