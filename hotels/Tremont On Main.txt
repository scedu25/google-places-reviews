Text: Ambiance is fantastic. It's the only high end place to dine in Marshalltown. The prices are a little high for the food and the area, but other things make up for that: 1- nice break away from all the fried food everywhere else, 2- the owners and workers are very accommodating and go above and beyond to make sure every customer leaves happy, 3- everyone is competent and professional, 4- you are personally remembered and treated like friends and family. 5- they obtain as much of their food locally as possible

Text: Normally everything is great, excellent! Tonight not so good. Our waitress which we viewed was not busy. Had a hard time getting a second drink. Also when she offered us bread asked if we wanted olive oil or butter we said butter.  We never did see the butter. My food was not as described and I asked for some lemon wedges and got a few dried out skinny pieces of lemon from the bar. I received two pieces and asked for more received the same. What I received four thin, thin slices that didn't come near to a wedge. My husband's prime rib was barely room temp.  This is my favorite place in and around Marshalltown and for being date night it was truly disappointing ?
