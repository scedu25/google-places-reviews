New Victorian Inn & Suites Norfolk
Rating: 4
Text: This hotel is a great option, centrally located and well kept. The rooms are renovated, new paint and furniture, besides the old bronzed appliances. New floors, good working AC, and very quiet rooms. The continental breakfast was stellar! The highlight of the stay

Text: Great front desk customer service. Affordable. Beds aren't loud and are comfortable. The basic rooms are not luxurious but you can tell they do their due diligence to make sure you are kept up to par. Would recommend to anyone looking for a decent affordable room. Solid hotel.

Text: Spent a single night here on a drive from Minnesota to Colorado and served it's purpose. Breakfast starts at 5am and WIFI was good. Not sure how I acquired room 100, but it's one of the biggest in the hotel. Only negative aspect was the lighting in the room.
