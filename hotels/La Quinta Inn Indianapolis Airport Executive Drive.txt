La Quinta Inn Indianapolis Airport Executive Drive
Rating: 4
Text: A great place to stay the night before flying out from the Indianapolis International Airport. Nothing fancy but clean and safe, at a reasonable cost, with several restaurants close by.

Offers free breakfast, the typical  coffee, waffles, muffins and fruit, but much appreciated when leaving early. They also have a shuttle to the airport early in the morning. Would definitely use again.

Text: I had FLEAS at this place - in my bed, flea bites, fleas the next morning.  The staff never once apologized.  I got the run around before I finally got a refund.  And in the end, between the flea collars and flea spray and dry cleaning and a few ruined shirts, the refund didn't even cover all my costs associated with my stay there.  I regret only one thing about my trip to Indianapolis - that I ever decided to stay at this hotel!

Text: I stayed here for one night for the Indiana Youth Convention back in November 2016. The hotel was very clean, and it smelled very nice. It was one of the few hotels where the beds were soft and comfortable. The only complaint I have was that the shower was broken. Otherwise, I enjoyed my experience here.

Text: Easy shuttle ride to airport. Room clean and smelled fresh and the pillows were nice. Shuttle was ready so no waiting. Front desk was helpful and had a map for nearby restaurants.

Text: Seems like an older La Quinta.  Pleasant, if not picturesque.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The staff was friendly even though we arrived well after midnight.
