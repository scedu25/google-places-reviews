Text: Truly a 0 Star review......Owner/ Manager was rude to us as potential customers. Our experience was horrendous... I wouldn't recommend living the neighborhood.

Text: If I could rate this zero I would. There is a bad roach infestation in the park. No matter how clean your house is, you will always get roaches due to the infestation. Talked with the manager about spraying the park since this is a widely known issue and she will tell she can send someone to spray your house for a 75.00 one time fee. Which is useless if the whole park is not being sprayed.  She also tried to sell my daughter a trailer that had a bad mold infestation and told her it would be her responsibility to clean it up.  Please take your money, sanity and family else where.

Text: Did a drive thru to pick an acquaintance up that needed a ride. Seemed somewhat clean, somewhat quiet. Might not be to bad of a place. But those speed bumps man! I understand the purpose of them I have a child myself, but geez. You need a four wheel drive just to climb those suckers.
