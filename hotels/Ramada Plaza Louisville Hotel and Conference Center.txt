Text: Nice freinldy help who try to help. Rooms are nice the big problem? Roaches!!!!!!! they moved me 2 times even the new room you got it! more roaches!!!! My friend stayed on the other side of the hotel  he always woke up with bug bites. Gross!!!! If they can keep that stuff in check and the infestation be a great place to stay. My advice if your gonna stay there bring RAID. Shame on manager for poor extermination in a other wise nice looking hotel.

Text: First time staying here. There is no heat and it is 31 degrees outside. I am pregnant and have to work in the morning, it's nearly 11 pm. My parents came to visit me, 65 and 69 yrs of age, and are also having to suffer through this while the staff are careless. The heating/cooling maintaince man has been extremely helpful, but the hotel management is a JOKE. This place is NOT worth any amount of money to stay here. Unless you like feeling like your well being does not matter.

Text: Loved the hotel very nice! Very clean and had a lot of nice extra things such as a gym and an big arcade. And my boyfriend loved that they had a sports bar in the hotel. The sports bar was awesome! The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that even though we got a hotel suite that slept 8 people, they would only let us have 5 wristbands for the pool and the staff was very rude about it. This doesnt make any since to me. But overall the hotel was nice but they do need to rethink the wristband policy they have.

Text: Worst customer service I have received in a hotel. We checked into our hotel room and realized we had received 2 queen size beds instead of one king size bed. The beds were ridiculously small that we called and asked if we could switch please. He told us no because they were booked. My fiancé went to the lobby and asked, he then said we could, that he would take care of us. When I got to the lobby he suddenly said he couldn't for whatever reason so we had to walk all the way back to our room in the back of the hotel with our luggage again. The hotel lobby looks great when you first walk in but as you get to the back of the hotel it starts smelling and looking worst. I do not plan on staying at this hotel when I visit Louisville again. Seriously, do not waste your time or money.

Text: AC doesn't seem to work, room smells odd, showers are a roller coaster of temperatures.   The pillows are hilariously tiny. The staff is nice but I wouldn't stay here again.  Seriously, just don't stay here.  Rewarding the owners financially for running this place is a step in the wrong direction.  Replacement room was nasty, had ants.  All the steel fixtures in the building seem to be developing rust.  There just isn't anything good to say about this hotel.
