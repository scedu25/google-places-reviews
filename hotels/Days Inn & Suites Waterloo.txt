Days Inn & Suites Waterloo

Text: While the rooms are big and the beds are comfortable, the rest of my experience was not good. The receptionist wasn't too friendly and seemed to be annoyed with us when we asked for clarification as to where our room was located. The breakfast in the morning was decent, but the sausage gravy and the sausage links were cold. I also didn't see anyone attending to the breakfast area. The trash can were overflowing.

Text: I think that the location is some what difficult to get to. The facade is very nice so that is nice. The staff appears to be reasonable and polite. What brings it down is the quality of the rooms. I feel like they could have revovated them in order to ensure the guess happiness. But the price is quite reasonable. Right on man!
