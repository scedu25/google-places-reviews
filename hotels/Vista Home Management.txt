Vista Home Management
Rating: 1
Text: The manager doesn't want to do anything unless you wave $$ around. They act like it's affordable living until you move in and realize their maintenance workers are incompetent, they say they provide lawn care but my yard hasn't been mowed and have not seen the use of a weedeater around the homes, if you have a nice car don't move here because kids are mouthy and will vandilize while parents refrain from correcting their kids so you literally need to call the police, the trailer park is constantly adding ways to charge you more in some way or another. Wild cats, raccoons and possums hiding under the mobile homes constantly tearing trash out and ripping underneath the homes causing damage. Stay away
