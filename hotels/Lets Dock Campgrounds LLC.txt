Text: This is a fantastic place to take your family.  Everyone including the other campers were welcoming and friendly.  We had major boat problems and our trip could have easily been ruined.  The experience at the campground more than made up for it.  The kids had a blast staying in the tee pee and there were plenty of other things for the kids to do in the campground.  This was hands down the cleanest campground I have ever been to.  The bathrooms had all of the amenities of home (a huge plus for my wife and daughter) and they were also wheelchair accessible.  We can't wait to go back and this time we'll be sure to try out the zip line.
