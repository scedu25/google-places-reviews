Text: The only good thing was the beds were clean. The AC kept turning off. Had it on the lowest setting and still didn't get cold. When I left I asked for a late check out 11 came around they kept calling and telling me after 12 they would charge. So I got my stuff together And left in a rush felt like I was more of a burden then a paying guest!! Come to find out for 1 stay at this hotel I got chargerd over 3 times for 3 different transaction on 2 separate cards. I called and talked to a lady and all she said is I don't know!! 
Never staying at this location again. Baymont has always been friendly can't say the same about this one:

Text: By far the worst hotel I've been to. The staff are very unfriendly and rude. If could have found another hotel with vacancy I would have left. I stay in hotels every night with my job. I can assure you that I'll not be staying here again. Do yourself a favor don't stay here.

Text: Nice hotel. However it does allow smoking with the hotel smells of smoke. Overall not a bad place just got to get over this smell when you're in the hallways

Text: Only stayed here Bc it was the only hotel we could find. Staff is pleasent and breakfast is decent. Rooms have a musty feel/smell to them. I just woke up to go downstairs for breakfast and it smelled like someone just got through smoking a doobie in the hallway. I'm here for work and not really what I want to smell like going into work. Not all of the power outlets In the room work. Avoid this place if you can. Unfortunately I'm here until Saturday.
