River Gardens Bed & Breakfast

Text: I am so grateful to have stayed at the River Garden Bed & Breakfast.  It is rare to meet such genuine kind and generous people as we found in Gerry, Shelly and Charlotte. 

One evening I came home exhausted from our days events. Feeling a bit overwhelmed I asked Gerry if there was a local pizza place that would deliver as I could not drive anymore that day.  In Gerry's very magnanimous way said, well let me take you to Papa Murphy's then". He drove us there, we got the pizza and before I knew what was going on, back at the house, he had place it in the oven, then too delivered it to our community room where we took our shoes off and in home comfort ate. 

The accommodations were clean and comfortable with lots of extras.  I am not always a restful sleeper, but found that the second night I slept the entire night peacefully. Since coming home I am astonished that I am continuing to sleep well and attribute it to all the great hugs we received. Leaving such a joyful home was difficult, but now we know we have friend's in Muncie. Next time we'll have to visit in the summer so we can better enjoy the White River, the gardens and orchard.  Thank you for expanding your world of love.
