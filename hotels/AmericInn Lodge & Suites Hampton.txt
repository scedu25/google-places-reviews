AmericInn Lodge & Suites Hampton
Rating: 4
Text: My family, wife and two kids, and myself have been staying here for the last 10 years while visiting family in Hampton. The staff is courteous, the rooms are clean and the breakfast is filling. Only drawback is the breakfast area can get crowded when the hotel is full but that can be expected anywhere. We stay here about three times a year. The kids love the pool.

Text: Wonderful hospitality, from the friendly smile and the fresh cookies on check in, through the clean, comfortable room to the tasty breakfast and the efficient check out with an invitation to return.
A couple asides: 1, Hampton, IA is in a rural area with spotty cellular service. I had both cellular service and excellent WiFi at the AmericInn. 2, the breakfast staff kept the food well supplied while staying nearly invisible. When I did see the lady and greeted her, she was friendly, then went about her duties seamlessly.

Text: The room I was in was room 116, very nice and clean. The people working the front desk were very nice. My favorite amenity was the pool, very clean and well kept. Breakfast is provided in the morning but nothing above what one would normally get at a nice hotel like this.

Text: Excellent customer service. Rooms and facility were so clean that everything looked brand new. Wonderful swimming pool area which even has handicap lifts at spa and pool. Will definitely stay there again.
