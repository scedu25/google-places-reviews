Text: We stay here during the Auctions of America event in Auburn.  I posted a picture earlier of the Jacuzzi tub in Room 125.  It is awesome after a day walking around outside.  The breakfast here is consistently the best one of any Hampton we stay in.  The bathroom is clean.   Staff here are very helpful.   It is easy to get to off the highway.

Text: Staying here after spending the previous night at a disgusting comfort suite was a breath of fresh air.  Everything was clean.  Breakfast was absolutely amazing.  They even have a hot tub here!!  Finally a hotel that gets it!  Kids want hot tubs!

Text: Very nice hotel. Loved my room. Got the was super deep, which was great, though would have appreciated stronger jets. Slept great and enjoyed a quick free breakfast on my way out.

Text: We stayed in room 402 this past Saturday night. The bathroom was so filthy with soap scum  and hair I had to wash own my hair in the sink and then to top it off the hair dryer didn't work I burned my hand on the crack in the handle twice... I called to the front desk numerous times to let them know  and no one ever answered the phone. No one ever asked us if our stay was okay or of the room was okay. For a Hampton I was totally disappointed in the room and the service! I won't choose that hotel again . Very unsatisfied and disappointed.
