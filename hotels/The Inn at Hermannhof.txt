The Inn at Hermannhof
Rating: 3
Text: I was only here for the Oktoberfest. It's a beautiful place. And the polka band packed the place. It was the most traditional Oktoberfest of the half dozen that were going on in Hermann.

However the only food served were pretzls and steam table brats like you might get from a roadside van. Even worse, the draft beer was all local with but two selections. Not a single German beer to be had.

Still, I'd highly recommend their Oktoberfest if in the area. Brings the kids and grandkids!

Text: Our trip was lovely! We stayed in one of the cottages at the Inn. The view was breathtaking; the service was great. They gave us coupons to use at some of the local wineries and brewery. Each morning, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the Inn and spent our afternoon sipping wine at the Hermannof Winery. Well definitely return for a quaint weekend in the hills of Hermann at the Inn!

Text: You cannot beat the location. Right in downtown Hermann and walking distance from Hermanoff winery and Tin Mill brewery. Definitely recommended.

Text: Amazing place. It's like a vacation you usually have to travel very far to get, right there less than an hour from St. Louis. The town is great, the restaurants are amazing, and the hotel is likely the best hotel we've ever stayed at. We will absolutely be coming back.
