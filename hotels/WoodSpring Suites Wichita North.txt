Text: Stayed there for 2 weeks. Great place. Great people when it comes to the employees. Emily is a wonderful person who will meet the requests you ask for. I'd stay again and recommend anyone to stay there. It's easy on the budget, quite, clean, and all around pleasant.

Text: I love this for extended stay hotels. As the rooms are clean, it is quiet here. My only complaint is that it is hard to get things fixed here. They don't have a maintenance man on the weekends at this time.

Text: Allow me to share my nightmare experience at Woodspring Suites North; I booked room #428 for one week because the price was reasonable and I didn't need a five star hotel room. The very first night I fall asleep for a few hours wake up to use the bathroom and the bathroom was literally crawling with roaches. There were so many I had time to pull snap-chat up on my phone and take a video. I spent the rest of the night gathering my things and looking for another hotel at 2 o'clock in the morning. The next morning I explain the night I had and the manager e motionlessly offer me a refund which I appreciated but do beware this hotel.

Text: Awful hotel, Wanda, the employee there is rude and has no tact.  Big F for customer service!  Hotel policies for reservations are defunct and disarrayed.  Better luck next time, but not in this lifetime for me, I will never be back, very upsetting to return 3 times to get a room and all 3 times denied, based on policy and of chance.  Well, you get no more chances from me, not 3, nope not 1 either, your fired as any hotel provider for me or my company.
