Pleasant Hill Lake Park (an MWCD Park)
Rating: 4
Text: It's more of a permanent resident campground. Though the grounds are very nice, the sites are crammed together and fenced in. So, if you're looking for a place to camp tent and really immerse yourself in nature, this isn't it. But, if you're looking for a permanent place to park your RV, this is more suited for that.

Text: I paid $5 to get in and swim with my children and it started storming after thirty minutes of being there. I called the park and asked if we came back the next day, if they would let me in for free and they didn't hesitate to tell me that I could. The only issue I have with this park is the amount of litter people leave behind. Maybe provide more trash cans? I don't know but it was terrible after we left from watching a movie on the beach a week ago.
