Text: There were 14 of us. The good was good and you get nice sized portions. One of the ladies ordered French onion soup for her meal and got it when we were almost done with ours.  Although that could happen  anywhere.  Went a few days ago for a clambake and was very good.

Text: Food was good, wait staff needs some help, too in a hurry, didn't ask how you want burger cooked or what you want on it, didn't ask what kind of salad dressing, and not too friendly. Didn't ask if there was anything else we wanted like desert after, just gave out checks. We had a large group and people got the wrong burgers.
