Brushy Creek Lodge & Resort
Rating: 4
Text: The staff was very friendly and accommodating! Our late check in was no problem.  The cabin (#2) was clean and cozy!  Very comfortable bed and futon.  It was lovely sitting out on the back deck drinking coffee in the morning surrounded by woods.  A grill was available just outside the cabin for grilling dinner.  The main lodge with games and movies was a perfect hang out while waiting for the eclipse!  It was great to walk and drive around the forest too!  This family of four found it a very relaxing stay!  Would definitely recommend to friends and plan on returning!

Text: Without a doubt the best people and trails for a VERY peaceful getaway!  I can't say enough about how accommodating all the people are at Brushy Creek and yet if you want your privacy you are allowed that too.  Riding the Missouri Fox Trotting horses they have there on the beautiful trails, through the hills and creeks is just what a Dr. would order for a stress free time. The creeks are so clear and cold, great for swimming on a hot day in the summer.  Inhaling the brisk cold air in the winter is wonderful refreshment.  The facilities are very clean and very comfortable.  At night you'll see the night stars unlike you'll ever see them any where else!  Like a home away from home without the stress. A slice of heaven!

Text: We stayed three nights just prior to a holiday weekend, two in a tee pee, one in a cabin.  The staff was helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  We had a small dog with us which wasn't allowed in one of the state parks that visited and they gladly allowed us to keep her in a kennel for a few hours.  The tee pee was great, approximately 12 feet in diameter and 15 feet tall and could easily sleep 8 - 10 people.  The cabin was basically a hotel room fashioned to look like a cabin, but nice and clean.  They mostly cater to horse owners, but I would recommend them to anyone that wants nice quiet evenings in the outdoors.

Text: I used the shuttle service while backpacking through the Ozark. Unfortunately my group took a wrong turn and became a little lost. We ended up being late for our shuttle, but our driver, Johnny, not only waited for us to arrive, but was completely understanding and friendly. He gave us a lot of information about the area and it was overall a very pleasant experience!
