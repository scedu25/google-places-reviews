Text: I had an overwhelmingly positive experience here. I was traveling with 3 small kids and no other adults. The staff was kind, friendly and helpful. I didn't catch names, but I interacted with staff during 3 shifts. The evening desk receptionist offered a portable crib for my toddler and delivered it promptly. The overnight desk attendant was so friendly to everyone who had special requests (I was hanging out in the lobby while my kids slept). One woman was working in the breakfast area and thoughtfully brought my kids crayons and coloring books to keep them busy so I could eat. Everyone was patient with us despite the fact that traveling with my kids is like herding cats. Highly recommend!!

Text: It was fine. But I have a few complaints. My shower drain didn't drain... I was standing in a couple inches of water by the time I got done. Also, kinda sketchy when I first walked in. It didn't seem very welcoming it felt like they were worried about loud obnoxious unwanted guests. The rooms were fine other than the fact that I had a stain on my pillow.
