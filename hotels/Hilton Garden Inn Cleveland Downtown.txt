Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Downtown

Text: We had a great experience at Cleveland Hilton Garden Inn with my toddler and infant while my wife was staying with a friend overnight at Cleveland Clinic just a few minutes away. As I was getting my stuff together from the car I put my phone together with the room keys and it ruined them. Tech Man Marvin was so kind to join me to the room to make sure the keys work. They didn't work and he was most gracious to head all the way back down to the main desk to get me new ones. He's the man! From our room we had an excellent view of Progressive Field and my 2-year-old loved it. It was hard work caring for two babes, but we had a fab time. Thanks, Marvin and team!

Text: Throughly enjoyed our stay.  Lots of tables/seating areas in the lobby. Great location with free shuttle service within a 1 mile radius. Staff is outstanding.  The only downfall - no free breakfast. :-(
