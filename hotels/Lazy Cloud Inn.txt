Text: Absolutely wonderful place to enjoy quality time alone with your loved one. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, comfortable, and cozy. The themed rooms are fun and keep you wanting to try new ones. Their dinner baskets are delicious. My husband and I have been here twice and will definitely be returning. Highly recommended!

Text: I saw their photos online and decided to take my girlfriend for a mini getaway.... well this place was definitely that and some. The southern charm mixed with the histories off other couples that had the opportunity to stay in this suite before us, it was blessed with love!!! I felt like all the magic from many couples before us was in the air. Reasonably priced and the staff was amazing. From the beautiful young lady who greeted us when we arrived, to the amazing staff who delivered our breakfast to our door. My goal is to come back and stay in every suite so that this cloud nine feeling never fades...

Text: Our kids gave us an overnight at the Lazy Cloud.  What a great experience!  The people are so friendly and helpful in finding "local" restaurants.  They are currently remodeling/updating but were still very accommodating.  I would definitely  stay again!
