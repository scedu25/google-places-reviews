Text: The staff were very helpful. We were only there for one night but it was quiet and we were able tog et decent rest and enjoyed our stay. We brought our dogs and they gave us a room that gave us quick and immediate access to the courtyard so we could walk the dogs often. Great stay.

Text: Why would you build a gazebo right outside of guest rooms? I was rudely awoken twice at 11pm and 12am to the sounds of loud boisterous voices from chatty middle aged couples talking in the gazebo right outside my window on the third floor. It was not a pleasant experience being that I had to get up at 4am for a long work day. Other than that the hotel was fine and conveniently located near many restaurants and a Wal-Mart within walking distance.

Text: I attended a meeting at the convention center and was quite impressed with all aspects of the facility. A large dining space provided roomy accommodations for a large group of 150 plus participants. The facility was aesthically pleasing, spotless, and logically organized. The meal was delicious and tables properly prepared. Kudos for a superior job and attention to details!

Text: Not a bad hotel. Pretty standard. But the reason we went here was for the pool and hot tub. They've removed the hot tub, and the indoor pool is not heated. Feels like a crisp 60°. So that hot tub would've been real nice after our cold swim. It was cold enough that my nieces were shivering and didn't want to stay very long.
