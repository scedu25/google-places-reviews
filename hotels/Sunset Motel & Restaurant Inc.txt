Text: Was very surprised by this hotel.  We needed some temporary housing. It is inexpensive.  (Do your own cleaning, which is fine with me)  it is quiet, it's older so the walls are actually thicker.  It's next to the BBQ which is excellent.  
Like I said it is older, but is better than some expensive hotels.  The owners are very nice. Been here almost a month, Have had no trouble.
