Text: Absolutely amazing. Staff was so accommodating to my son's procedure prep. They printed coloring 0ages of my twins favorite characters. Brought them a huge pitcher of lemon water since one was on clear liquids. And gave them each a toy  that they could play at the hospital just because. They were so awesome. Very clean rooms and a nice breakfast in the morning. We know where we will.be staying for any future visits!

Text: Nice hotel right off the interstate. We were passing through so that's all we needed. Clean room, nice bed. Easy walking distance to several restaurants. Nice breakfast bar in the morning. Pleasant staff. Overall a good stay. What I would expect from a Marriott property.

Text: Pros: Staff was very helpful and friendly.  The room, lobby and breakfast area was very clean.  Excellent breakfast spread.

Cons: Wifi was difficult to connect to.  Had to call their tech support for help.  Took about an hour to fix the issue.  Also, could not stream videos at first.  Tech support said I had to purchase an upgrade on the wifi to stream (first hotel I've had this issue with).  It later worked for me.  Not sure if they gave me a free upgrade?

Text: Room was clean and staff was friendly.  WiFi was very slow, almost unusable, and the free breakfast was not good.  Cold eggs, undercooked sausage, etc. Only one luggage cart to share between all guests. The Fairfield Inn we stayed at the previous weekend was far better.

Text: The room was nice. Breakfast was pretty good. There was a pool and hot tub, but I did not get to use them. My only issue was the tub didn't plug all the way so I kept hearing it drain when I was trying to take a relaxing bath.
