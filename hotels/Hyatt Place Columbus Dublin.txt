Hyatt Place Columbus/Dublin
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very spacious. Sitting area with couch and chair, large screen TV, refrigerator, and a desk. The staff was awesome. The breakfast was delicious both mornings. I would recommend to family and friends. This will be where I stay when I visit Columbus again.

Text: I had a wonderful stay. Checked in late, but all 4 ladies up front were very accommodating. However I do wish they would've been more thorough about check out time and what was offered for the breakfast instead of "there's breakfast from 630-830".. But other than that it was a very clean and lovely room

Text: The location was great because I noticed a couple of eat out places within walking distance. I stayed overnight for a high school soccer game. I should have stayed an extra night and watched Columbus Crew. Any way, the only things that stuck out to me was the lighting, in the hallway, the yellow lights makes everything look outdated, but the bright lights in the lobby and rooms look great. The rooms were spacious but the bathroom was tight(when you open the door, you swing inches by the toilet bowl). The morning breakfast was mediocre, I was there early at 7 to get a fresh breakfast, but everything tasted like it was made an hour before. The bar in the lobby was a great touch for an evening sitdown.

Text: Rooms look nice and are clean. Comfy bed. Has a mini fridge. Bathroom is cramped though. Free breakfast is very nice, a lot of quality selections.
