Text: Weston bed and breakfast was lovely. My friends and I stayed there for my besties bachelorette weekend, the ladies running it were very nice. We had a group of 4 so we stayed in the cottage, and ot was great. The rooms were really nice and it was the perfect room for us. The breakfast in the morning was also perfect. I highly recommend them.
