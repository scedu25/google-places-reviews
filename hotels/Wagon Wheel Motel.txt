Wagon Wheel Motel

Text: Such a cozy and quaint blast from the past. Perfectly maintained and restored. Each room with its own theme. The owners are amazing. A beautiful and serene experience that is perfect for any occasion from a romantic weekend getaway to family road trips and holidays.  The history is interesting and love the neon signs! Hick Bbq is right next door.

Text: Don't let the run down sign fool you because lights up perfectly at night. The cottage style motel rooms are very clean and we'll kept. The grounds are very well maintained. Definitely worth a stay in the Town of Cuba MO

Text: We loved it. Jeff checked us in and we had a good chat. Rooms are small but beautifully appointed. Used my portable fan to move the air, but we thoroughly enjoyed the surroundings.
