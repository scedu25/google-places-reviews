Text: It seems like an OK place until the night after we got home and we started Finding the BEDBUGS!!! I immediately called the hotel and the lady I spoke to assured me they did not have bedbugs and I assured her that I never had either before being at their hotel. I gave her a room number and told her I was not looking for any compensation just wanted to ensure no one else took them home with them
She then told me that she would have a manager call me, that has been six weeks ago I have not heard from anyone!
After going through all of the steps to get rid of them on our own TWICE, Which by the way, is a lot of work! We are still finding them and have now scheduled an appointment for tomorrow for a professional to come in and exterminate our house of them for $600!!!
Needless to say it would be my advice that it would be much less expensive to stay somewhere else!!

Text: The staff at this hotel is superb...very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very nice. The only complaint I have is the very low water pressure. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our 6-night stay here.

Text: Stayed on the third floor and the room is very tidy. The front desk staff was very nice and prompt. We had quite a big group for a professional development conference and they did a wonderful job accommodating us.

Text: The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Our toilet wouldn't flush.  The repairman did get it to flush, but not well. Glad we were only staying 1 night!  Breakfast was not great. Eggs and sausage were cold. No salt packets or shakers. No little creamer cups for the coffee/tea.  We won't be staying again.
