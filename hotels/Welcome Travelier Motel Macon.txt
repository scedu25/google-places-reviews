Welcome Travelier Motel Macon

Text: Very clean room, freshly painted and upgraded bathroom with all new fixtures.  Air conditioning worked great.  Clean fridge and microwave. Sheets were very white and nothing stuck on them (hair...etc.).  Good TV with quality picture.  Great service and good rates.  My suggestions for future extra improvements would be thicker fluffier pillows, laminate flooring and a couple wall hooks in the bathroom to hang clothing on. We would definitely stay here again.

Text: Stopped for a night as we traveled thru Missouri. We wanted a a quiet, clean, comfy room...and got EXACTLY that! Perfect for a good night's sleep..nobody making noise in hallway or above you..no kids running from pool to vending machine. Forget those big chain hotels..$50 for a comfy room and a hot shower. Nice owners too.
