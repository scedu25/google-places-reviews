Text: I LOVE Kayak Morris, the location is so beautiful, the staff is helpful, and the prices are great. The campsites are the perfect size and very convenient for all camping needs. 10/10 would reccomend!

Text: Reservations required for camping so they can do a background check, sounds like a joke I thought but nope. $39 for two hour kayak rental is way too much. I like to get outside to relax, not to go through the stress of corporate bs.

Text: They set up everything for my kids and husband. Great amenities and lots of fun facts with the kayak tours and guides. The owner was very personal and made our stay one we will never forget. Thank you Janée.

Text: I have always enjoyed spending good times with great people here. Terrific location with all the amenities. If not there's a full town and a Walmart down the street.
