Text: For the most part it is a nice place. The staff were friendly and pleasant. Rooms were cozy. However a lot of dust and the parking lot is full of holes. 2 are so big that it will destroy your vehicle.

Text: The outside of the toilet had vertical streams of dried urine.  The bath tub and shower surround had rings of dark-brown filth.  The shower curtain was black with filth where people touch the curtain to open and close it.
The flooring in the bathroom was dark brown with filth.  
As I left in the morning, I reported it to the manager and he blamed his cleaning crew.  It seems to be a management attitude problem toward cleanliness.   Go somewhere else, anywhere else.
