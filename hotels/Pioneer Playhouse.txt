Text: Paid for dinner and a show. The website said that there would be live music to entertain us while we ate.... the live music was too far away to hear well. For those that didn't buy the dinner tickets, that is where the music was. Dinner WITHOUT entertainment was definitely NOT worth the price!  The show might have seemed better if I wouldn't have been so disappointed with dinner.

Text: This place is a magical world of its own. Everyone needs to put this on their "places to see/things to do in Kentucky" list. What a neat, little experience. Great actors in Death by Darkness.
