Text: This was my first time staying at this hotel (I  usually stay at the Days Inn that is nearby). There was a new employee who checked me in and due to her inexperience the process took longer that it should. Her cheery attitude and polite demeanor more than made up for any inconvenience I experienced. The room you I could see was newly remodeled and furnished with new accoutrements. The air conditioner worked properly and the bed was firm (absolute musts if you have to be away from home.) It goes without saying that I was able to get a good nights sleep. This is now my preferred lodging of choice whenever I stay in this area.

Text: Good location, good room, VERY comfy bed and GREAT shower! We enjoyed our brief stay here. Pool was comfortable and just large enough to play with grandson. Close to everything I needed. Would stay again.
