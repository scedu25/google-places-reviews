Text: Lovely! Our thanks to the owners, who live next door and drop in to make sure we're all finding what we need. Obviously they take great care of the house! It was spotless when we arrived! Plenty of room for our big family. The decor and artwork are lovely, and there's plenty of seating, outdoors and in. We'd love to go back!

Text: The most peaceful sleep I've ever had - each night we were there. And the cleanest, purest space I have ever been in that I could just pay my way into. I can't wait for another opportunity to be in Fairfield IA to enjoy Sweetwater Bunkhouse. Reasonable rates, too.
