Text: Very contemporary and clean design of this million dollar renovation. We liked that the lights were on when we arrived in the room and that the staff went out of their way to be extra helpful. Excellent value for the money spent, included a full breakfast included in the room rate!

Text: Overall, loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again! Changed rooms, as the window of the first room they gave us you could reach out and touch the people sitting on the patio eating and listening to the live band. The room, beds and breakfast we're great!
