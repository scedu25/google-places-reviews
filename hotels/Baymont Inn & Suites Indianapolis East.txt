Text: I was not very happy with my stay at this Baymont Inn and I am not a picky person at all. I stayed here for two nights and the night I checked in the lady at the desk was to busy having a conversation that she wasn't very attentive to my needs. She told me my room number and handed me my keys. I expected for her to tell me what time breakfast begins and ends and also when the pool closes but she didn't she continued on with her conversation. Then the second night we didn't have them clean our room because we slept in and everything so when we got back to the hotel I stopped by the front desk to ask for some towels and said I will bring them up to you. An hour passed my husband called down there and she said I will bring it in a minute. So we waited and waited. Then he went down there after 30 minutes and they had a sign up written in crayon saying they will be back in 10 minutes so he came back up there and we waited another house because we fell asleep (It was midnight). So we called again and she said that the towels are being washed (We didn't understand why she didn't say that from the beginning and why did it take three hours to wash some towels what hotel doesn't keep fresh towels and sheets). We were not happy about this at all and won't be back. This was our anniversary weekend it wasn't a good experience at all !

Text: We left.  Had a last minute need for a hotel and booked this for the nice price.  Walked in to the messiest hotel I've ever seen. Looked like it hadn't been vaccuumed for a week.  First room we were given hadn't been cleaned.  Second room looked like it had been "cleaned" very quickly by the desk clerk who went to make sure first that it was a good room.  There was a fresh ice bucket, slightly melted in the bathroom.  The bed was crumpled.  It stank of strong perfume.  Bonus, we saw a pretty trampy couple walk through the entrance.  No good.  We went across the street, paid a bit more, but had a very clean, less stressed night.

Text: I understand you get what you pay for but I stopped here for one quick night and I regret it entirely.  The room was not clean or even dressed up as if they had cleaned it.  Bathroom covered in hair, filthy carpet, stains every where only one working light with one working bulb.  I am off for a refund and leaving if possible don't even want another room.

Text: After 3 trips back down to the front desk, it was determined our room door didn't work. Moved us to last room available. Bed springs were worn out, and bed sat at sloped angle. Smoke detector was removed. Coffee from previous person was still in rooms coffee maker.  The place wasn't visibly dirty per se, but was showing aging. Wouldn't stay here again.

Text: We arrived for our stay and were told upon checking in that the hotel was in disarray because owners have a disagreement. We had 3 rooms reserved and were traveling with 12 people. We opened the door to 1 of the rooms and the beds were tore apart with the mattresses standing on end against the wall. As we stood discussing why the room would be like this, another guest came down the hall letting us know she had found bed bugs on her bed. This confirmed our assumption about the room we were looking at  We immediately high tailed it out of there and stayed accross the street. Very dirty, other 2 rooms smelled like old wet clothes and the smell of marijuana filled the hallway. One good thing I can say is the housekeeper was very nice and welcomed us as we were opening our room doors and handed us all fresh towels. That WAS NOT ENOUGH for us to stay and chance perhaps taking home bedbugs. We cannot be positive about the bedbugs because we are not experts BUT, we did see them on the other womans bed.
