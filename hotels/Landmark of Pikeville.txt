Text: We truly enjoyed our dining experience. Our server was attentive and very helpful. We didn't have to ask for any refills and our food came quickly. The restaurant is a very nice place to eat and is always clean.

Text: I have enjoyed dinner at the Landmark Inn for over 30 years now. The food is good old fashion southern cooking. This last visit I had smothered chicken with fried green tomatoes and mashed potatoes. It was excellent. I wish they would bring back the prime rib. It was amazing! Dinner aside, the rooms are nice and the pool has a slide that is at least 25 feet tall. Lots of other businesses are within walking distance.

Text: Maybe the best rooms in the area. They are clean, good sized rooms. The bar on the top floor WAS NOT welcoming.
