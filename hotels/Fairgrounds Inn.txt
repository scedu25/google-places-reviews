Fairgrounds Inn

Text: We recently stayed at The Fairground Inn and had a great experience.  Big clean room and friendly employees. Rooms also had mini fridge and microwave. The breakfast is just so so...probably 2 star and the wi-fi is weak if that is important to you. I made my reservation on Expedia and got a great rate. I would definitely recommend.

Text: I'm sure there are worse hotels, but this is the worst I have stayed in.  The air conditioning was turned off on the whole second floor and in all the rooms.  It was 90 degrees outside and it was much cooler than my room when I first got in.  I turned on the air conditioning and it may have gotten down to about 80 in 3 hours or so.  Never got to a comfortable temperature even by morning.   Breakfast was a joke.  A stack of french toast and cold cereal.  The computer was down in the morning so they couldn't even check you out or give you a receipt.  No complimentary coffee in the room.  And the coffee available in the breakfast area was like water.  And the one vending machine was empty and the other just had a few packs of Doritos and a few chocolate bars.   Too boot it was not even a cheap room!  Never stay at this place.

Text: It is a 2 star motel and exactly what you'd expect for a 2 star motel. Have no idea what this hotel could be thinking... $120/night for a 2 star motel when all comps are $50-65?  No motel in this run down city is worth $120/night. Keep driving.
