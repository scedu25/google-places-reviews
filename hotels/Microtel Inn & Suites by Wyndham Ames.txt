Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Ames
Rating: 5
Text: As a returning guest, I picked Microtel due to affordability and location. It's easy to find and not terribly far from downtown Ames. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and plenty of local shopping. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Will definitely return.

Text: Clean and comfy.  Great staff, very helpful.   Excellent value for this type of facility.  My only negative comment is that while the bath tub was clean it had been damaged and poorly repaired instead of replaced.

Text: I really enjoyed my time at this Microtel Inn. Room was clean and service was very pleasant. Breakfast wasn't too bad but don't get the corn flakes. It's totally off brand and gets soggy really fast. But that doesn't really mean much does it lol.

Text: Room was fine TV/bedding but the air conditioning didn't seem like it worked very well. Also when you flushed the toilet it made a sound like a steaming tea kettle that lasted about 45 seconds at a time. Bathroom was small but clean. Breakfast was adequate nothing great but not bad. Staff was friendly and overall fine
