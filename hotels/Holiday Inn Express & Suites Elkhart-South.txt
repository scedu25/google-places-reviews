Holiday Inn Express & Suites Elkhart-South
Rating: 4
Text: Newly renovated. The hosts are friendly. The rooms are cleaned daily. There is a pool indoors. There is not much here as far as eating or night life. You will have to drive at least 15 min for that. All in all not to bad of a place.

Text: Great place to stay. Very Quiet and peaceful. We pick this hotel due to the fact that it was close to prime time rv manufacturing. Paid a full week in advance and still a little pricey for my taste. Breakfast is great, lots to choose from. Able to get hot coffee till late in the afternoon. ?

Text: Spent two nights here while traveling on business. They are doing some renovations but it barely affects the hotel quality, appearance, and amenities. Surprisingly nice hotel for the area. Good breakfast. The pool open to the lobby is kind of awkward though.

Text: Could use better between guest checks. Heat was running full blast even though it was 80 outside and definitely needed A/C running. Otherwise, pretty standard HIE.
