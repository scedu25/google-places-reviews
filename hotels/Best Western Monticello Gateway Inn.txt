Best Western Monticello Gateway Inn

Text: Nice room but pretty dirty. Mirror and shower hadn't been cleaned in a long while. Shower head was built up funky.No premium channels...paying 200$ and not having HBO lowered the value. Also, the water connection under the sink isn't connected properly so water sprayed when using the sink. Decent property that obviously isn't managed well.

Text: My stay was very pleasant. The staff went out of their way to make me welcome. The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a big swimming pool. There was a complete breakfast. I would definitely stay there again if I happen to travel that way.

Text: We have stayed at this particular BW many times before. We like the location. The hotel has always been in very good shape. Never the less, it has recently been updated and continues to be a very nice place to stay. The staff has always been wonderful. Only other comment I have, is that for the last two years that we have stayed there, a car has always been parked in the canopied drop-off/loading area and it seems to be parked there all afternoon/morning.

Text: Our group stayed here for a three day convention. The manager and staff were exceptionally accommodating and friendly. Their conference room was used as a hospitality suite that was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Our stay was so enjoyable that if I'm back in the area, I won't stay anywhere else. 

It's a shame I can only give this motel 5 stars. It deserves 10!
