Text: The room was spacious, clean (very clean bathroom). AC stopped working in the morning and the hot tub's bubble didn't bubble-lame. The staff not friendly but did they job well.  The breakfast was great and the lobby was great for our board games.

Text: Very well run hotel. Newly renovated rooms with a modern feel. The continental breakfast is probably the best I've had in an American hotel. They also have a Manager's happy hour Tuesday-Thursday with a cheese and vegetable spread, along with free wine and beer!

Text: Very clean and comfortable. The staff is nice and helpful, the rooms are great and the amenities are good. My room is in great shape, clean and nice decor. I was hesitant when placed on the 1st floor as it is usually louder from parking lot noise, but the construction or soundproofing is good enough that it was no issue. The free breakfast was very good and a staff member was present to make sure items were stocked and she greeted everyone that came in. The location is nice, many restaurants near along with a Wal-Mart, plus it felt like a safe area. I can be picky so for me to give 5 stars it has to be good. If I came back this way I would absolutely stay here again.
