Rock City Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Lovely little motel. Very friendly owner and it’s been cleaned and refreshed a bit in the last 5 years since I was last here. Happy to have a little place in Minneapolis near family instead of having to drive all the way from Salina each day. Totally recommend if you need a quiet and clean and inexpensive place in the middle of nowhere, Kansas.

Text: Great price and only 18 miles from Concordia. The rooms are clean and had a refrigerator and microwave and nice tv. It is much cheaper here than staying in Concordia.

Text: Basic small town motel. Clean room and friendly staff.  Edit to review - I accidentally left my credit card in the motel room.  When I called the owner/manager had already found it and is going to mail it.  Thanks!

Text: The room and motel were decent. It seemed like there were a handfull of little inconveniences, but nothing major. We will probably stay at the Mill Street Inn for our next visit to Minneapolis.
