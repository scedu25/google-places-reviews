The Travelers Budget Inn

Text: I booked a room earlier in the week. Called before I left town to confirm. "Yea we will be here". Get there, ring the bell twice, dude looks at me, waves, stretches then disappears. I worked 16 hours, drove 2 and this happens. You knew I was coming. You couldn't wait until midnight to go to sleep? Thanks for nothing.

Text: Would give it 5 but it needs updated just a bit. Staff is friendly. The lady that cleaned my room didn't barge in. I hate that when you're in a room and they knock as they open the door. That did not happen here. Front desk clerk was so sweet. She was very professional.

Text: For 50 a night, this hotel was totally worth it. Our room was clean with a large bathroom. Also had a microwave and fridge. Check-in was simple. Only downside was there was no elevator but overall a great experience.
