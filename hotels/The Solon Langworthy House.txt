Text: The Solon Langworthy House is a newer establishment in upper Dubuque, but the owners have remodeled an old home and have made it a true home for travelers. The bottom floor room is the best, offering a large bed, tv, leisure room and jacuzzi tub. All amenities are provided, which sets off the whole experience. I found my stay to be very comfortable and homey, and I didn't want to leave. Breakfast, tea and a wall of DVDs are provided for all guests. Great place to stay.

Text: Great place to stay, and close to downtown. The B&B was on one end of the house, and owners on the other.  It was very private; you walk in and there will be a note on your room with instructions on your stay. The room had a comfortable bed and jacuzzi tub/ shower. Enjoyed the movies and popcorn provided. Nice small breakfast was provided in the morning. Would defiantly recommend

Text: We absolutely loved our stay. The proprietors of the establishment emphasis privacy and that is exactly what we were looking for. The room was lovely - very comfortable bed and the jacuzzi tub was so relaxing and romantic. We also enjoyed the movie selection provided. Hope to go back again soon.
