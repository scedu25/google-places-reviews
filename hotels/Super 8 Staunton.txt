Super 8 Staunton
Rating: 5
Text: This is the nicest Super8 I have ever been to! It is beautiful inside, the rooms are clean, nothing smells bad, bed was so comfortable with very comfortable pillows. Breakfast had waffles, cereal, biscuits and gravy, juices, coffee, fruit, etc... This super 8 is in the middle of our drive that we make a few times a year and will plan on staying at this Super 8 every time. Also, their prices are unbeatable! Great stay! Thank You.

Text: Pretty clean place. I've been in four star rated places that haven't been this good. And they got truck parking for at least eight trucks. Owner was very friendly. No piss stains on the mattress either! Nice! ?

Text: Staff was very friendly.  I would rate it higher as it did seem clean and nice for the price. But on the morning we left I watched a roach climb around on the breakfast counter. They need some pest control!

Text: This was the cleanest hotel I've ever been in. The place seems brand new. The even let us have a late check out because we showed up so late. Would recommend.

Text: Nice clean motel.  Good local restaurants nearby.  My only complaint is there's no elevator.
The staff was very nice and informative.
