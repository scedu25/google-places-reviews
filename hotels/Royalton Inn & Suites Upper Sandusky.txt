Royalton Inn & Suites Upper Sandusky

Text: Room smelled like smoke even though they told me it was non-smoking. Everything else was fine. Clean enough. Bed wasn't super soft but slept just fine in it. Not a bad hotel, but not great either.

Text: Royalton Inn and Suites is a small independently owned hotel near the freeway in Upper Sandusky. Though in need of a few cosmetic updates, it was clean and comfortable. The staff I met were all extremely kind and attentive.

Text: Pretty much just stayed to sleep. TV wouldn't work, had to unplug microwave to plug tv in because of a dead outlet. Breakfast was ok, nothing big, didn't start till 7 but book said 6am.
