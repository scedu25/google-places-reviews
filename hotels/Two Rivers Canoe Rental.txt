Text: Best canoe Rental place around. Very friendly and very accommodating. I won't use anybody else whenever I float the current or Jacks Fork and Anita in the office is fantastic.

Text: Top notch rental company. We had a really good driver who was fun to talk with and was quick with unloading our gear.  Great spot to camp and takeout. They have one of the best views on the rivers
