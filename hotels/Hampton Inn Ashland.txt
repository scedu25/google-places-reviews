Text: Very very clean, really nice staff, great breakfast area, nice rooms. Amazing. It's very very clean, even the slightest of details such as no dust on any shelves up high, and other things like that. I'm very pleased with this branch of the Hampton inns

Text: Rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is not that impressive. Extremely basic and bland. Overall a decent experience because what matters most to me is the condition of my room, and it was nice.
