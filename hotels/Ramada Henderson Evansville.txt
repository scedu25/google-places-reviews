Text: My husband and i were able to get a room on the way home to Wisconsin after the eclipse. Heavy rain and traffic meant a lot if people were looking for lodging.  

The front desk staff were phenomenol! Patient, helpful and accommodating while taking care of tired and stressed people, including a bus load of Amish families.

The room was clean and comfortable, and appeared to be recently updated with new bedding and comforters.

Text: Just stayed here with my boyfriend son and sister for frog follies weekend .. we've stayed here 4 other times prior for the same reason .. every year it gets worse .. we left to go to the car show at a little after 10 am on Saturday and come back around 330 ish. House keeping had not came to our room .. we got in the pool for an hour showered and went to get dinner came back only one bed was made  and they didnt give us more towels so I asked for more and the housekeepers that was there was rude and acted like I asked for her life .. the night stand was moved and there was trash for god knows how long ago .. when we checked out Sunday morning we told the lady at the front desk and she had an excuse the housekeepers went to lunch and never came back .. we likes this place the first 2 times we stayed but I don't know if we will stay here again

Text: The service was great upon arriving. Cleaning could of been better, the floors wasn't very clean and the water to take a shower had to run for awhile it came out orange, I assume from rust in the pipes no big deal. The breakfast was amazing before checking out the next morning.
