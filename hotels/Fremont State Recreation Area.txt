Fremont State Recreation Area
Rating: 3
Text: For Nebraska, which is a bit lake-poor, this park is one of the few remarkable places to come experience a truly red-neck day out.  Camping sites are average  in size and quality, amenities are minimal and the overall condition of the beaches are not great.  Probably the one exception to the three star rating would be Lake 20 which has been improved over the past few years with beach expansion and cleaner water-- I'd give that particular lake 4 stars.  One of the big drawbacks to this park is the park staff-- I've been visiting this park since 1976 and have yet to meet even one staff member who actually seems like they like working here.  Fishing in any of these lakes is low grade at it's best.

Text: Used to love this place, now it is overrun with people and no respect for people fishing.  I was fishing late one night like 11 pm,  and boat came past 10 foot from shore and ran over our lines and cut them.  Game Warden said nothing about it and said the boats could stay out on the lake as long as they wanted.  Will not camp here again.

Text: This park is pretty dirty. During holiday weekends, it's just a mess. Avoid the shower houses when you can. Otherwise, it's a big campground with plenty of space to walk around. There are a couple of beaches and plenty of places to fish.
