Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City East/Blue Springs
Rating: 4
Text: Good location, great modern updated room, very comfortable.  Would give 5 stars if breakfast included.  When checking in staff very friendly, however stating breakfast from whatever time till 11:00, made us think breakfast was included.  They also noted discounted happy hour, which when going down for drinks, they only offered 4 beers on special (not our kind), 1 wine and 1 other drink.  Need to be little more specific when telling people.  Otherwise enjoyed our stay, golf course, etc.

Text: Very efficient and friendly staff.  Beds are quite comfortable.   Every morning we had a nice breakfast as we sat by the fireplace.  Everything was great during our 5 day stay.

Text: The lobby sets the stage for your experience: modern, clean, and welcoming. The rooms are great with modern furniture that makes staying there a treat. The room's desk chair was comfortable enough to work from all day. The one criticism I have is that the pool/hot tub/fitness center is in a weird spot where everyone can see you, because it is right across from the elevators.

Text: Great hotel at a very convenient location. It is just a short drive right off the interstate. Rooms were very nice and updated. Only drawback is that they don't offer free coffee.

Text: Very nice, clean and comfortable! Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Pool closes at 11pm. The man they have locking the pool up was very patience and kind when explaining the pool closed and waited while we gathered our children and belongings, saying we could come back at 6am to have more fun.  He answered all of mine and my children's questions with engaging responses. Making us feel like we belonged here at the Courtyard by Marriott!
