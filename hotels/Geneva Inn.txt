Text: They changed the price without notice.  I reserved a room for $70 and when I arrived it was $100.    The smell of disinfectant was overwhelming.  The bathroom fixtures were all corroded.  Look elsewhere.

Text: It was a bit expensive for this particular motel. But overall it was decent.

Text: The staff was courteous, but when I got into my room it was as cold as it was outside because someone left the window open in the bathroom and the heater was turned off. when I turned on the heater it was barely able to take the chill out of the room. I froze all night long in that room.

Text: It's not fancy, but it was fairly clean. Decent place to stay for one of this vintage in this price range.
