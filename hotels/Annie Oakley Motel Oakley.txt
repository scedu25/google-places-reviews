Text: I was very pleasantly surprised with this motel. I usually stay at a hotel on I 70 but decided to drive the quick, non trafficked two point five miles to the hotel from I 70 into Oakley.  Sweet little farming community. Here is what I found: neat and tidy, spotless, newly renovated, fresh paint, fresh air, soft beds, quiet a/c unit, quiet pleasant, sleepy town, good rest, great shower, soft towels, lotions, soaps, shampoo, nice roomy room, great price, touch of charm and tiny bit of retro. welcoming staff who stayed up for my late arrival. will stay there every time in my many commutes from Colo to northeastern Kansas family. Rating 5 country stars. Finally, check out the breakfast burritos, glazed doughnuts and coffee at the local gas station.

Text: Check in was a breeze. The staff were polite and efficient. 
Rooms were clean. Expected a quiet night in this small town, but we heard motorcycles driving up and down the main Street for a good hour. 
I took a long, pleasant walk in the neighborhood. Except for the smell of fertilizer it was enjoyable. 
I'd stay here again.

Text: Worst motel in Oakley! No toilet paper or even an ice bucket. The bathroom lights were not working and showering in the dark was not fun. The smell of manure was overpowering and nauseating. We paid $80 because I had my Pomeranian so the charge was $10 extra for him. I should have kept driving all night or paid $20 more at a decent hotel. Don't go here unless you HAVE TO!

Text: Nice place for the price. The staff were very friendly. The room had a good sized refrigerator/freezer unit and a nice T.V. The only issue we had was that we visited in June, and the little AC unit had a hard time keeping the place cool.
