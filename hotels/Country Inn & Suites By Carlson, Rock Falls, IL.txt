Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Rock Falls, IL
Rating: 5
Text: The stay was pretty uneventful. The front desk had great phone etiquette and even let us check in early to get ready for a wedding. The rooms are really spacious and have a separate living room, bathroom, and bedroom with a with its own door and lock. I would recommend staying here to anyone and would stay again. The rooms even come with blow dryers and irons and ironing boards. Breakfast was hot, taste and complimentary as well. They've earned every star on this 5 star rating.

Text: Have stayed many times, and never had a problem. The Staff has always been accommodating and friendly. Clean and comfortable. Complimentary breakfast is as expected. Sometimes a thing or two is off (i.e. the jacuzzi is broke or the ice machine is on the fritz) but usually not the same issue twice. Would recommend for an affordable stay.

Text: Nice enough place, clean and staff polite.  Rooms are too dark to try to read in.  Can't completely shut curtains in window so bared all to people in parking lot.   Ice machine was broken with a sign to use the third floor machine.  Went to elevator and it was broken with a sign to use stairs.  So at the end of the day I will stay at the holiday inn down the street.  Pretty disappointed in this place

Text: For the price, it wasn't what I expected. The room was ok. Had a tub with stains and the sink area clearly had water damage. Had a stink bug in the bed as well. Was given a few replacement pillows, but didn't exactly give me reassurance of a quality hotel.
