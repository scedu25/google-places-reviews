Text: While it's a bit hard to find the car entrance, instructions online are very clear. The castle itself is wonderfully appointed, beautifully decorated, and nicely laid out. As a historical site it is very interesting. As a B&B it is super cute. The rooms are large and open, with lots of detail. The hosts are very nice and accommodating. I'll definitely be back.

Text: Fantastic building and architecture, but not as pristine as I'd expect for a pricey spa/B&B on a wedding day during peak wedding season. A good power washing would do the grounds well. Rooms are spacious and stately, but homeowners personal items and antique toys gave the overnight accommodations a cluttered feeling for my taste. Overall it's worth checking out from a historical/experiential perspective, but I wouldn't recommend it for the 30 and under crowd.

Text: I shot a wedding there today.  The man running everything was the nicest and most helpful person I've ever had the pleasure to work with. Outstanding! Couldn't recommend it more. Totally worth it. The whole staff went above and beyond to help everyone with anything at all. Amazing people and a beautiful place.
