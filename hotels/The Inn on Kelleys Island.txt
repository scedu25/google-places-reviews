The Inn on Kelleys Island

Text: If you have arachnophobia, this is not the place to stay. Dirty place with tons of spiders everywhere, especially in the Pilot's room where we stayed.  They were behind the blinds and on the ceiling, in the ceiling lights, in the bathroom lights, everywhere... We killed at least 10 large spiders the first night. There were even spider webs in the corners of the stairs.  Windows were full of spider nests.  Landscaping needed a good trim - probably where lots of those creatures were living. People seemed friendly, but the old house needed a really good cleaning!!  Also, don't most B&B's have full breakfasts?  This one had complimentary fruit, cakes, etc, but not a full breakfast.
