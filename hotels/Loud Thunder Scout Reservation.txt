Text: Clean buildings and cool stuff to do. Major rain downpour when I was there, but the volunteers and staff made it fun, anyways. Paths could be marked better to make it easier to follow/ teach maps.

Text: Thought it would be a good place for family fun.  We rented pontoon boats at $30/ an hour.  No one ever explained to us that if you are even just a FEW minutes over an hour, you are charged for the WHOLE hour.  So that 10 minutes it took to pack up and drive to the office to pay cost us $30.00!  The Supervisor did not seem worried about customer satisfaction.  To bad, we would of made several trips back.  Very disappointed.
