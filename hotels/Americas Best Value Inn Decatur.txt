      Well, I got about 3 hours of sleep. That's after driving for almost 72 hours straight. (Seriously) 
      I piad close to $70 for a Queen bed. This is  very expensive for an outdated room that smells like mold, stale cigarettes, alcohol and body oder. Put some, Glad Air Freshener in the rooms. Cheap air fresheners for your car would be much better. 
        Another thing, the owner is RUDE. Front desk guy was helpful, until the owner said something in another language..? I asked for a plastic spoon to eat with. They advertise breakfast. (1 Pack of oatmeal) isn't a breakfast to be advertising. Then the owner stared at me the entire time. "Creepy" Owner made me feel like he was expecting me to take (2 packages of oatmeal). I didn't eat any of your oatmeal... Owner needs an attitude adjustment. 
    I know he seen my brand new $60,000 truck, when I pulled in.  MY COMPANY'S name on the side of it too. I did get it as a gift. The government didn't give it to me. And my brothers, cousins, sisters dad did not pass it through the family. I PAID FOR THE TAXES ON IT AND I'M PAYING YOUR TAXES!!! 
      So, the next time you see a customer that doesn't look like you. Talk to them with respect and treat them like a guest. Your letting people live there to do your work. Enough said... You and I both know what I'm talking about.
