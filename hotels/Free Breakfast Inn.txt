Free Breakfast Inn

Text: Filth!. Only stopped cause bad storm, sign says 39.. booked king online, they said no king rooms left.. so for 53.60 I got a single, that was with a cash discount, got no receipt, no coupon for breakfast buffet, roaches in room, tv pure fuzz. Scared to touch anything in room nasty. No heat, no air. Bugs holding bathroom hostage.  This sweet old lady in the nasty stinky office may seem nice, she's a pure con woman.. there's no way anyone who ever legitimately stayed here rated this place more than a 1 has ever stayed here. Abandoned cars everywhere with flat tires.

Text: Price matches quality, our room wasn't particularly clean, disappointed we had to leave the hotel to get the free breakfast. Outside and inside looks old and not maintained, but so did most of the buildings in the area. If you just need to sleep and get a break from driving, it'll work and it's easy to get to from the highway. Very unique once in a lifetime experience. But we'll never stay again

Text: Got caught in a rainstorm, this was the first place off of the freeway I could stay the night. Wasn't overly impressed, but hey. . . I got some sleep and got out of my wet clothes. The free breakfast was good. I got a none- smoking room #14. The room was small, and everything was super cheap, including the walls, beds, covers, carpet, bathroom. . . . There's better hotels around the area. I wouldn't have stayed be it not for the storm.

Text: Other then the musty old cigarette smell in #25 everything is great and the plus side is its American Owened and Operated I'd advise if you plan to stay stop at a store get air fresher and bring your owner hyphen items
