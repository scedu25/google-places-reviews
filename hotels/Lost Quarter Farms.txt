Text: This place is cool!  My cousin Jimmy took us here for our vacation and we had a blast. I havent really done much hunting before but this place kinda got me into the sport now. we were up in a secluded area where we got to hunt duck and deer and i had a great time. even my wife enjoyed it. they took good care of us back at the lodge and i remember those home cooked meals. it was all very accommodating.  Maybe well do this again I always say I'll try almost anything once and Im glad I tried hunting over here.
