Hyatt Place Champaign/Urbana
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms are huge and walking distance to tons of dinner spots.  Always prefer Hyatt Place when traveling and this is as good as any other location.  Breakfast is large and many options and staff is great.  Bar is a nice place to end the night and grab a drink or two before bed.

Text: Attended a conference. Basement location was nice, but a bit cramped. A/V was adequate, but projector and sound could have been configured to fill the screen and space better. Overall nice location and facilities.

Text: Very nice stay and very nice hotel and facilities. People at the front desk we're relatively kind but not necessarily welcoming. It is ok
