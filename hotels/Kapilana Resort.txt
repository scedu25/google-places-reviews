Text: I've traveled all over the world and I got to tell you this is one of my very favorite!! The rooms or condos ( I've stayed in both)  are extremely clean, the new owners are fabulous,  you wont want to leave it just feels like home .  I can't say enough about Bryan and Jen  they are just fabulous folks young aggressive customer oriented just a wonderful  bright spot on the lake .I highly recommend it if you're looking for a place to stay on the lake this is it!! great price great people great accommodations I just can't say enough good things about it!!  Brian andJen  go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and are extremely comfortable.They bend over backwards to take care of the guest!  On a scale from 1 to 5 they get a 10

Text: The owner was very nice. If you are looking to get away this is the place. It was very quiet and relaxing. Great room set up. The beach house has a nice little kitchenette. I would recommend to family and friends to stay here.

Text: To be honest this was one of the most uncomfortable places I've ever stayed. We were a party of 4.
Could have been nice with some upgrades to the beds. Guessing, they were at least 20yrs old. I had to sleep on the love seat in living room. 
The carpet was so dirty and coming apart. If walking on it it felt stickey,had to wear shoes at all times 
Nice surrounding outside  but was disappointed. They owner of this must improve and update.

Text: It was a perfect place for a get away! We had a 3 bedroom, 2 bath condo with a large kitchen! Everything we needed was offered! It was very affordable! Our kids loved it! There's a pool and playground right there and within close driving distance to anything you'd want to do! We will definitely be back!!
