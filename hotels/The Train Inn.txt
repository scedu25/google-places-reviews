The Train Inn

Text: I was fortunately enough to stay at the Train Inn from the 29th-31st of July and it was one of the best B & B experiences I've ever had!!! The Train Inn's location is perfect for those who are looking to have easy access to campus or to re-live campus life (like in my case) if only for a weekend. I went down for a friend's wedding and had such a nice stay with Paul and Teresa.  Both were very warm, friendly and accommodating. Paul is an AMAZING cook and both served me a delicious gourmet breakfast/brunch each morning.  The house is beautiful and quite a treasure and they even had a hot tub I could use!!  Thank you so much Paul and Teresa, you gave me a weekend of nostalgia I will never forget!!

Text: Feels like a home away from home, decor stunning and historic, rooms furnished and all the amenities you would want, gardens, paths enjoyable, front porch to read and take in those hummingbirds amazing! Innkeepers Paul and Theresa are absolutely top on my list, welcoming, kind and now let's not forget that unbelievable breakfast(s).  Such a joy to visit and stay, I'll be back and they know it! Thank you both. :-)

Text: Sitting at brunch with my husband right now, talking about the best breakfasts we've ever had, and even though it's a bed and breakfast and not a restaurant, the french toast as part of the bountiful breakfasts we've had at train inn still tops our list. We've stayed with Paul and Teresa four times and the closest we've ever lived is a four hour drive. That's how great our experiences have been.  The inn is walkable from the Amtrak station as well as downtown bars and restaurants. Its in a historic home but with tasteful updates and features (we've stayed in "historic" bnbs before that look great online but are really just look and feel like grandmas house but this place is great in person). Paul definitely has a designers eye.  Carbondale also is a little gem with surprisingly good entertainment options. There is hiking and a wine trail half an hour south which we've done in late summer, and within walking distance from the train inn are a handful of really great dive bars, a nice cocktail bar, a vegetarian cafe, every ethnic food restaurant you can imagine, an adorable bakery, an excellent liquor store, tons of live music for all tastes. Highly recommend a weekend date in Carbondale, especially if you're coming from Chicago or Fort Campbell!

Text: The Train Inn, Inc. is absolutely the best B&B I've ever stayed at. The house is beautiful and full of charm. The food is outstanding! I would describe my breakfast experience with one word - royal. The best thing about The Train Inn, however, are it's hosts. Paul and Teresa are fabulous hosts; they are kind and generous, and make you feel nothing more than welcome and comfortable. As I sat and talked with them I felt as if I were chatting with old friends. This B&B deserves all the patronage it can get. If you are passing through Carbondale, you MUST stay at The Train Inn, Inc. You won't regret it!!!
