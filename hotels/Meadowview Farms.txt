Text: Don't do it! They stole from us while we were not even home & then turned a blind eye & decided to sue us after they stole from us!!! It's a joke & we did not heed warning!

Text: This place is a joke. They don't answer the phone, they go back on their contracts, they have zero professionalism and the homes they claim are refurbished are very much not. They did quick patches and did not get rid of BLACK MOLD in my house then tried to evict me for one month missed in lot rent. Also never gave me a contract even though I requested it several times. DO NOT!!! I repeat. DO NOT live here!

Text: Be sure you can really do it. These people are predatory lenders. Financing those that they KNOW can't afford it. Take your money for however long they can, then kick you out and find the next sucker. Mine WILL be paid in full this year. Watched a lot of desperate people move in and out of here in the past 7 years.

Text: This place is unbelievable they charge people that run the office all the time and they threaten you with eviction notice all the time even if you talk to the people from the bank. They put papers on your door about stuff they want you to do but you don't see anybody else doing it.Its like they have certain people that they pick on yes I have been behind on stuff but I always get it caught up
