Text: We had a spot there this year, (2016) and really enjoyed it. Having a newer camper with most amenities,  helped, but the difference came from the created sense of community and Ed the caretaker/ manager. The rates are fair, the lots are good sized, and Ed is truly a great guy that works very hard at keeping the place nice!

Text: We stayed here for a weekend last summer and it was really nice. They have a new playset they've built and a basketball court. The owners are reall nice and it's nice and quiet with friendly people. They also had a night with a free band and pizza. It's a bit older and not alot for the kids to do or I would have done 5 stars. But we're planning on going back soon.

This place = clean, new, friendly
Arrowhead = timeshare sales pitch where everything is broken
