Text: Not horrible but, certainly a far cry from the Marriot. Inexpensive average place for long or a short stay. Had to consider it a few times over the last year.

Text: I waited for several minutes for receptionist to show up then signed my life away for a dump!  Went into my non smoking room that smelled like smoke looked at the room and then went back and got my money back!!  If you're looking for drugs or a prostitute this is the place!!

Text: This place was decent. My room was clean, had everything I needed. The shower worked, staff was friendly and helpful. Good for passing through or extended stays. Reasonable rates, overall good experience here.

Text: I stayed in the this hotel with low expectations really all I wanted was somewhere to sleep and shower.. and I was so disappointed! The room smelt like cigarettes and but. There was an empty tissue roll a half used toliet paper roll, no hand soap no commentary shampoo or conditioner. When I called to ask the front desk the guy phoniex who was nice said he had no idea if they even kept those things in there rooms.. (you don't keep hand soap??) and told me to wait for the am staff. Who showed up late for her shift and then told me they aren't in the room because they ran out... I get things happen but I don't get paying full rate (even on the cheap end) for a staff who has no idea how to help, and room that doesn't even have the basics of hand soap in their restroom!! I have three kids and not being able to wash their hands was gross not to mention who knows how long they have been "out".
