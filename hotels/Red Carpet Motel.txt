Red Carpet Motel
Rating: 4
Text: The night's sleep was super comfy. However it was really strange. It was like a vampire motel. The manager said to make sure we keep our room clean and to not mess up the towels. The directory also told us not to let anyone into our room that we dont know and keep our room locked while we are in it. Spooky but kinda fun.

Text: The room was very clean and orderly. The hotel was very quiet and I had a good night's rest. Coffee was good and they also had breakfast to choose from. I would stay again.

Text: Couldn't breathe after room heating and cooling unit was turned on. Donuts on counter for provided breakfast, dated Oct. 26. We we there on Nov. 9th. Should have gotten paid to stay there. Instead of paying 70$.

Text: It's not the Ritz but it will do. Walking distance from Knoxville Raceway and reasonably priced.
