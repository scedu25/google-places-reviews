Text: I stay here often. The company i work for is based in Sycamore so its very convenient. All the staff is very friendly. The Texas Roadhouse Steakhouse is across street and many shopping and a large selection of restaurants nearby. Nice indoor pool, exercise room, fast wifi.

Text: Clean and comfortable updated room. Small pool and pool area. The"work out" room was a disappointment as was the area provided for the complimentary breakfast. Ok place for an overnight stay but couldn't recommend for an extended stay.
