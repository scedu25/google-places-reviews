Tara Point Inn and Cottages
Rating: 5
Text: We visit Grafton often and this was our first stay at Tara Point. This place was Amazing! The rooms, clean and beautifully decorated. The view was gorgeous with views of the river and the woods. We watched deer eating and squirrels playing. The staff was so nice, informative and helpful. They know the area well. We brought our son with us and the someone had already pulled out the couch and had the bed made up ahead of time for us. They also added extra sodas and breakfast items to the refrigerator. I could not believe the details and extras provided in the room. I've never stayed anywhere that has provided a shelf of books with instructions to take one if you like it. They had a small DVD collection available. Microwave popcorn and popcorn bowls, binoculars on the mantle, bug spray at the door. They have thought of everything. I can't think of a time where I have given 5 stars in a review but this place was over the top and staff went the extra mile to make our stay amazing!!

Text: What a great place,  the view is AMAZING and you feel like you are secluded and at peace with nature.   Only downside is price and a continental breakfast.   For the price breakfast should be much better.  Awesome experience however,  we will be back

Text: We were too late for the Eagles, but the stay here [almost] made up for it!  Very private location with spectacular river view.  Hospitality was above and beyond!!
