DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Dayton - Miamisburg
Rating: 2
Text: We got a block of rooms here last month for our wedding, and this was the one major thing that went wrong with the day.  The renovations are beautiful, and we are Hilton Grand Vacation Owners and Silver Club Members, so we were happy to book our block of rooms here... we thought that we could come away with lots of points (club members get a point for every dollar their guests spend on rooms in a block) and would be able to trust the Hilton name.  We even chose this hotel over another one in the area that provides a free shuttle to our wedding venue, because we trust the Hilton name so much (yep, we bought our own shuttle).  Well, the blocks kept filling, and no one was telling us.  Then, when I would call and mention it, they would say that it wouldn't happen again... and it did. over and over.  not only did my guests not get our rate, we also did not get our points.  moreover, the list I received from the hotel of our guests accounted for less than half of them, so nearly 20 rooms did not get welcome bags from us.  People are flying in and buying rooms; the least I could do is give them a discounted rate and a welcome bag.  But they got neither... did I mention that our wedding was on a Monday?? The amount of business we were bringing the hotel for that day should have guaranteed better service.  We also had arranged for the bar to be open late on the day of the wedding (again, good for our guests, great income for their business).  Not only did that information apparently not make it to the actual staff of the hotel, but the man working at the front desk threatened to call the police on my father in law for opening his own bottle of wine in the bar.  he didn't apologize to us until AFTER we explained that the bar was still supposed to be open, and how were we to know that you can't drink in the lobby area?? Why not tell us in a respectful way?  All this business we're bringing you, and you yell at a 60 year old man like he's a drunk teenager and don't hear him out?  At least that guy apologized, because when we reached out with all of these complaints to the General Manager, he only thought to say "the bar WAS open late for you until 2."  Yes.  It was.  The night BEFORE my wedding.  And only until midnight.  My father in law paid the last tab, and the charge went through at midnight.  
Also, when people were checking in, they were told the wedding party was on the first floor... I'm the bride and I was on the third.  Clearly they didn't really care who the wedding party was, and made no extra effort to make it special for us.  In fact, our officiant was moved out of his room at 10am on the morning of the wedding because they just HAD to re-do the carpet in his room!  Why would you book him in that room in the first place???  And 10 am on the day of the wedding????
I'm not one to post bad reviews generally, and I really actually found much of the staff to be kind, including Gena from group sales (very sweet, but this experience did not go well).  One of the front desk women actually ran bags to rooms that weren't accounted for in our block and tried to push our cheaper rate through the system for them!  Another front desk employee, however, was completely unhelpful when I called to say that I think we had two rooms booked under our name but we had only meant to make one reservation... he never did just tell us how many rooms we had.  It wasn't until later when we saw that we were charged for a second room that it made any sense.  But like I said, most of them were kind, just either not informed or not that great at providing the services they said they would.  I just wish that they had all followed through on what had been promised to us.  It would have saved us a lot of stress on the most important day of our lives.
Brides, if you are getting married at Canopy Creek, I would encourage you to book with the hotel they recommend.

Text: The hotel was expected. I did not get the room that I booked because it was not ready when I arrived to check in. The restaurant did not have my first two choices for dinner. Otherwise, the room was fine, met expectations.

Text: 2 star at best - Hilton member a long time. Had to ask for member water items during check in and no cookies.  I stayed here to ensure a place to work and relax. The rooms had a desk that you could not work at because the chair was too high to put your legs under the desk because drawer was too large. The dining area in the lobby - oh where to start. You had to be over 6 foot tall to eat at the bar chairs too low for bar height, the dining room tables too high for the chairs designed for a comfortable or relaxing experience. The sofas too low for the tables aligned there. Obviously someone extremely tall did the redecorating. Then there is the food. The French onion soup tasted microwaved and the cheese melted on it not baked.   The onions were raw. The wings were not baked but rather baked maybe at some point microwaved with sauce on it that was cold. No blue cheese to dip hot wings in. Truck with deliveries didn't arrive. Very disappointing. Save money stay at a Hampton and go to dinner. Hamptons are the best Hilton value for the price.

Text: Nicely renovated rooms (2016 work). Apparently, DoubleTree doesn't care if buildings look like cheap motels from a distance but cest la vie. Book a breakfast rate if only a few dollars more. Not worth the $11 walk up price. Stay away from highway end (low numbers.) Would def stay again. Red Lobster across the street.

Text: Although the room was very nice and spacious, I was not overall pleased with our stay. On our second day there the maid designated to our room collected the used towels, but did not bring us new ones. After three days they are supposed to change out the bedding, and ours was not. I know this because there was a small stain on the fitted sheet which remained there the entirety of our stay. The breakfast was incredibly disappointing. Especially since we paid $20.00 extra dollars for breakfast. The description for breakfast was complimentary breakfast with five hot items, including the chef specialty. The only thing different than any FREE complimentary breakfast was the chefs specialty and the potatoes. I could have gone out to breakfast and spent the same amount of money and gotten better food. They also tried to charge us $14.00 for nothing. The man at the front desk said that was something that happened often. They were also out of lids for their coffee cups at their complimentary coffee station at the entrance. All-in-all I would not go to this hotel. You could find a better hotel for cheaper.
