Sugar Camp Outfitters

Text: We had another great year at Sugar Camp! Me and my dad both went home with Ohio monsters! This was our second trip down there and it was unbelievable to both kill one. We plan on going next year! Top notch everything and they work hard to get you on the big ones! My deer green scored at 149 and was by far the biggest deer I've ever harvested. I was tagged out after 1 1/2 days of a 3 day hunt. Great people, great lodge, and big deer!
