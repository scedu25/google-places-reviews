Text: MAC helped make life-long memories and bonds for me and all the cadets through amazing staff and fun and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. They taught me not just discipline like many other programs would, but good character traits- such as integrity, commitment, courage, and confidence- a family away from family, and motivation I use daily. Not only am I now part of a supportive team and community, I am a stronger individual.

Text: Loved their summer program. My daughter came home more mature, confident and with goals for her life. 
Staff was great always attentive and seemed to know my daughter very well.
She will start school there this week, because she has made such major improvements during the summer I can't wait what the school year will do for her.
Only four stars, because some of the buildings are in need of repair. I know they are old and they are a work in progress.

Text: I attend once a month for training during the school year and even more frequently to lend a hand. I've been a cadet since 2011 and every day I learn something to better myself and set me apart from others. It's given me the pride, courage, honor, integrity, discipline, confidence, and leadership that I need to be successful in anything I do later inlife. People tell me that I'm going to go far, and I have this program to thank for it.

Text: Making the decision to join the cadet corp here at forest hill military academy has been one of the best decisions I have made. The program teaches you so many valuable skills that you can use even if you are not going into the military. These skills range from how to survive in various situations to attention to detail. There is even summer programs with more fun things go learn that can be found on their website. The staff care so much about you and they are always there for you to help you. The program has a perfect balance of military  and family feel. They provide the military atmosphere while also accepting feedback about problems and how you feel. They work diligently to fix any issues and make your experience better and better every time.They grow from the feedback given and are truly there to help you. With the mix of this and mrs kremers awesome cooking, this place is like a home to me. Everyone is very accepting so don't be shy and come and enjoy yourself it's my favorite thing to do, I look forward to it every month.

Text: The new Staff at Forest Hill Military Academy have not only met my expectations but have exceeded them.  I have never seen such a positive change in my child.  I understand the  academy has an unfortunate history with the Academies previous regime; but I must say the new Headmaster along with the Director of Admissions have made a forever lasting impact in my child's future.  I also want say a special thank you to Drill Sargent Kremer. My son cannot wait for next years Military Adventure Camp.
