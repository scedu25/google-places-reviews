Red Roof Inn Champaign
Rating: 2
Text: Checked into a Champaign,IL. Red Roof hotel and first room toilet would not flush. Called front desk to get someone to fix it. Got called back and was told. They had no-one available to fix it right now. This was right after I had checked in. Then my requested to be on top floor. So she decided to not only give me a room with a broken toilet. Put me in a room on the bottom floor right in front of one of their cameras. Felt like I was being watched. Open the door and one of the owners walking parking lot ,walking by people's window like he is a correctional officer in a prison. This used to be owned by someone else ,had to be. Because it is nothing like it use to be.

Text: Bed was comfy but the room smelled smoky. Not big enough room for a king bed in my opinion. Bathroom super tiny. You can tell they have recently had some renovation but the smoky smell still exists. Really awful coffee think about changing that.

Text: I made a reservation over the phone while driving back from college at about 10 pm, and didn't get there until 11 pm. This was not a problem and the staff was very helpful in finding me an accommodating and affordable room. I went straight to sleep when I got there. The bed was comfy and bug free (I checked thoroughly). The rest of the room was clean as well, and I would definitely stay there again if I was passing through the area. Picked up a muffin and coffee on my way out too (muffins and juice/coffee were the only breakfast choices).

Text: The rooms were quite nice! The bathroom had a fan, which is always a plus. Nice new TV. Only complaint was the lack of a hairdryer.

Text: Clean updated room.  Relatively quiet.  Great location.  Older property.  Nicer than I would have expected, especially at the low rate.
