Baymont Inn & Suites Warrenton
Rating: 4
Text: The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the employees were friendly. It had a pool and a hot tub. The bathroom was extremely small but I'd say it was great for the one night stay, seeing we paid half the price of Holiday Inn.

Text: Fan in bathroom was not working.  The rooms are clean and bug free. I enjoyed the view.  My friends wanted to get a room. The owner hassled them.

Text: The hotel was nice, breakfast was good, and the kids loved the pool. I didn't catch the name of the woman who checked us in (around 9:30pm on 10/6), but she was wonderful; very cheerful, sweet, and helpful! 
I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Front desk staff is very pleasant. Pool is nice and warm. Not over chlorinated. Towels provided to dry in the pool area. Bathroom large enough to change too. Halls nicely maintained and room is very comfortable with firm beds, nice television,  and clean toilet and shower.. We'll stay here again when we're in the area.
