Text: This is a nice hotel. Using your phone as the key is awesome.  The rooms are nice too.  I am only giving it 4 stars because the fire alarm went off for about 45 min.  I think that deserved a free breakfast voucher or something.

Text: Service was fine when checking in. They let us check it early which was great. The bar is open until 1:30 on Saturday's. The hotel had a shuttle to the wedding we were attending which was great. The rooms were pretty standard. The as worked and want to loud. The black out curtains were pretty good so we could sleep in. The internet just worked which is pretty rare. Overall it is was a good stay.
