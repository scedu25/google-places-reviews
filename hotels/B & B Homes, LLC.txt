Text: BEWARE OF THESE SHADY SLEEZEBALLS. I REALLY WISH GOOGLE ALLOWED YOU TO GIVE 0 STARS

I visited on Saturday, 10/15/2016

The first employee I interacted with was extremely rude and unprofessional and generally useless. My experience deteriorated from there. 

Next up was the owner who attempted to price gouge me. When confronted with the fact that I overheard him discussing a lower price than what I was being offered with other customers he got defensive and walked away. 

These people also own Effingham homes and this review will also be placed there to warn others. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the time and aggravation of visiting these unethical "people."
