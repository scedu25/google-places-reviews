Netherfield Natural Farm Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Everything was great. Refreshing pool, nature hikes along lake, lots of farm animals, farm fresh (really fresh) eggs for breakfast. The Pyrenees dogs kept the coyotes far away. Stayed in the barn loft so there was a lot of extra room. Very eco friendly; Solar panels supply most of their energy. We'll be back!

Text: Excellent farm, excellent food, excellent hosts. We had a great time relaxing at the farm, and the kids had a lot of fun exploring. Would love to go back.

Text: A lot of effort but in the end it's just an old farmhouse with a bunch of Ikea furniture and bright paint. They say you get a free lunch with two nights or more stay but we never got ours it's a nice idea though. cute

Text: Our first stay here has been absolutely perfect. There is something to be said for the hospitality of a bed and breakfast, they truly make you feel like family from the minute you walk in. The animals are incredible, bottle feeding baby calves and feeding all of the livestock was a one-of-a-kind experience. The Great Pyrenees dogs, Adele and Ellie are just the sweetest creatures ever. We brought our own dogs and genuinely loved taking them everywhere with us and we could finally have a vacation that was all-inclusive foe them as well. Do not hesitate to add lunch and dinner, Scott's cooking is top-notch. It's better than any restaurant hands down. I took a buscuits and bread making class while my husband napped and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in our room. Don't hesitate to book the Jesse & Rhoda room, the private balcony and large bathroom with the jacuzzi tub is worth the slightly higher price. This is absolutely our new favorite getaway and it's only 50 minutes from Kansas City, but it feels like a true retreat. The outdoor options are great, between the beautiful pool, fishing at the pond, hanging with the cows in the bar/n or taking a walk along the trails there is something for everyone to be interested in. The house is maintained so well, the rooms are clean and tastefully furnished. There aren't any cons to speak of, as Scott and Matt have made sure that each guest has everything they need and more. We will be back... Soon!
