Holiday Inn Express & Suites Wichita Airport
Rating: 3
Text: The hotel was nice. The bed was comfortable and the staff was kind. We had an issue in the pool at night. Kids were unsupervised and being rowdy. One staff member look and said she,didn't see anything going on after I complained. After that the rowdy kids hit a kid that was not with them and he threw up the the pool. They obviously closed the pool down after that. The next morning however, the general manager apologizes for the issue.

Text: Our room was clean and pleasant. The microwave and mini fridge were quite convenient. The staff was friendly whenever we walked in the door. We spent a lot of time with our family in the lobby area, which was very accommodating. Overall, a very good experience. Would stay here again

Text: Absolutely the most horrible experience ever.  My wife was in Kansas visiting her elderly Mom. Instead of rushing to the airport on the day of her flight out, we reserve her a room at Ramada Inn, she wakes up in the wee hours of the morning with a roach crawling across the bed.  She packs up her stuff and goes to Holiday Inn, checks in, goes into the room, sees What?  A roach, goes to front desk to talk to clerk.  Can't get back in her room.  This fiasco started at 1:30 am.  It's now 7am, her stuff is still locked in the roach room.  The GM, albeit nice, has been there most of the night trying to get door open.  Maintenance showed up 30 minutes ago, still no luck.  My wife's flight is at 11, she's had no sleep... in tears.
