Super 8 Kearney/KC Area

Text: Our room was 76 degrees and humid when we arrived. Towels were stained. We also caught multiple black beetles crawling out from under the bed. Pros: it's pet friendly and affordable. Staff is nice. Breakfast is good. Cons: Smells like cigarettes even in non-smoking rooms, not very comfortable. Feels dirty with beetles blending into the carpet. Made my skin crawl.

Text: It's clean and basic comfort but it's a place that still allows smoking in rooms. As a result any non smoking room will smell just from second hand smoke. Mine did badly and that's why only 4 stars.

Text: The lobby is a very relaxing space. It is conveniently located near many food options. The overall feel of the hotel is very quiet and laidback.

Text: It was a very packed night (right before the eclipse) but the staff was friendly and efficient. The room was clean and comfortable. Only complaint was that the lobby smelled strongly of perfume and the room had an odd, stale smell.
