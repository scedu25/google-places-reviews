Text: What this hotel lacks in location, it makes up for in many other ways. Super friendly staff, spacious, clean rooms that are comfortable. Huge variety of hot and cold breakfast. Sadly, no hot tub, but the pool and fitness center make up for it. They even let us do a late check-out. Rates were good too. I would definitely come back!

Text: The service MADE our stay. To be honest this place needs a make over. The lack of in room amenities almost ruined it along with shoddy, out dated aesthetics. This place really feels at home along some $50 motels instead of a $100 a night Hilton property but the people working here bend over backwards to make you happy really made this a 5 star from a 2 star experience. Whoever owns this place owes customers and employees alike to make this place worth going to.
