Text: We got a room with a king sized bed and a pull out couch. It was clean and quiet. Staff was very friendly. We've stayed at this hotel several times and never had a bad experience. It's our go-to hotel in the Des Moines area.

Text: I was there for a work event. The conference room was clean and well set up. They served beverages and desserts that were much better than the last hotel. The speakers were clear and the projection was easily seen.

Text: I have recently stayed at this hotel and it was a great experience. Very modern hotel, nice and clean.  Only reason i am not giving this a five star is because the person that checked me in was not very friendly but this was my only encounter, everyone else was great. Will definitely be staying here when i visit the area again.
