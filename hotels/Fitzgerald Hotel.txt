Text: Very disappointed! At first thought what a lovely historical place! When going to bed, the pillows were paper thin, the mattress was in plastic wrap, very noisy! Had to sleep on floor
    Strangers calling on the phone, asking about what room we were in etc...Made me very uncomfortable, after that at 2:00 am people were yelling and slamming doors! For the amount of money spent very disappointed.

Text: my experience here was very pleasant I really enjoyed myself the peacefulness and  quiet environment of the hotel was just right up my alley. staff here were very attentive and friendly. The manager was just awesome loved his friendly personality and willingness to help. The rooms are very spacious reminds me of an apartment rather than a hotel for a person who wants a home away from home. I love the old historic feeling of the entire place would highly recommend this hotel.

Text: I stayed here about a year or so ago.  The place is really unique.  I really enjoyed it - still think of it occasionally.  The town is quiet and got a older feel to it.  It is fun to walk around.  Inexpensive, clean, quiet, enjoyable.
