Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Schaumburg/Woodfield Mall
Rating: 4
Text: Well priced, clean. Free parking but no free breakfast. Lots oif shopping and restaurants nearby but it was hard to find a restaurant on a Friday after 11pm. The Friday afternoon staff mentioned restaurant coupons but when we came back at 11pm the desk clerk had no clue. The Bistro and Starbucks in the hotel offer food but a little over priced. $ 5 for a bagel with cream cheese and hard boiled egg. The room was cleaned and smelled clean. The shower was hot. Bed was comfy and a/c worked well.

Text: Location is just off the street behind another business (The Clubhouse) so it can be tricky to find but a beautiful location. Facility itself is clean , spacious, accommodating aND serves a mean lunch for business meetings. Though I wasn't there overnight the hotel offers a pool, working room and Internet access with a shuttle to take you were you need to be. Overall 5 star rating from this satisfied guest.

Text: Everything was just what you'd expect. Comfortable clean accommodations. Friendly staff. Wish they had coffee and snacks in the morning you didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for.
