Corner George Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: The owners, Marcia and David, are kind and wonderful folks. This beautiful and lovingly restored building from 1884 was cozy and comfortable, and even had central air. David was a wealth of knowledge about the history of the building and the surrounding village. Breakfast was plenteous and delicious with consideration for any dietary restrictions. Though the owners aren't coffee drinkers, they had coffee available for those who needed it. In addition to the welcoming atmosphere of the B&B, the surrounding village has a warmth and welcome to it as well. Marcia and David offered several suggestions of places to visit for food or fun that were within 20 minutes or less driving distance. There were plenty of options for staying busy or just relaxing and strolling around the quaint German village that is Maeystown. The old style skeleton keys and ice cream shop next door were sweet bonuses. We look forward to returning for a quiet get away in the future.

Text: My wife and I stayed at the Corner George Inn in October 2013. My father and his wife lived in Maeystown several years ago and loved it. They have both passed away. We were in the area visiting my mother and mother-in-law and chose to visit Maeystown. We  enjoyed visiting with David, the owner. He gave us a tour of the town and helped us reconnect with a high school friend and his wife. We enjoyed our visit with them also. Our room and breakfast was very nice. We had a great experience in every way!
