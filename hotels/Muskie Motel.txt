Muskie Motel

Text: The weekly rates are good. That’s the only good thing I have to say about it, though. That’s the ONLY reason it got 2 stars from me. The room is completely outdated. The AC/heater didn’t work. He told us to just use the fan. Huh? The tv is small. I don’t care if it’s a flat screen or not, but geez. The shower either freezes you or skawls you because there’s no medium. The beds are not comfortable at all & it stinks inside the room. Outdated bedsheets & blankets. Let’s pause here to say my husband & I are here together, but are having to sleep in separate beds & not my choice. We wouldn’t mind the two beds but these are definitely twin beds. Just enough room for ourselves in each bed. WiFi works when it wants to. Walls are super thin, so make sure you have earplugs if you’re next to someone who has a significant other. You’re sure to hear them. The doors aren’t very secure, so when my husband left, I had to put a chair up against the door to feel halfway safe. Overall, you get what you pay for. I wasn’t happy being there, but because of work, my husband chose this hotel. I have been uncomfortable the entire time & although the weekly rates are unbeatable, I’d never return to this hotel. It’s the worst I’ve ever been to. The staff is nice though. I will say that. This just isn’t the hotel for me.
