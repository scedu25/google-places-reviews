Text: the lady working and the desk was very friendly. the room wasn't horrible bit wouldn't have been my first choice.. I was put there by my job.. My biggest issue was there phones wouldn't let me call home to omaha.. only local call and to other rooms. this made me stranded for the 3 days I was there because my cell phone had no service here either...

Text: Proprietor refused to send me an email confirmation when I made reservations for August 18-21 back in January for the weekend of the solar eclipse, but verbally confirmed at that time that I had those 4 nights starting on August 18.  Now when I call to verify he says he has the reservation for August 8-21 (claiming a misunderstanding) and it is clear he is eager for me to cancel so he can resell the room for $200/night.   I didn't want to be billed for 14 nights, so I cancelled.  I feel that this "misunderstanding" was cooked up just to make me cancel.
