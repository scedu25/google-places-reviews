Coblentz Country Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed at the Water Lilly cabin. It was the most beautiful place that we have stayed at. We have never seen such a beautiful cabin. Plenty of room and space. It was spotless and so relaxing. No house cleaning on Sunday, but they provide enough linens to compensate. The owner was so polite and helpful. My husband and I will be back next fall.

Text: I am giving Country Coblentz Cabin 5 stars and 10 if I could! My fiancé Elroy & I had a wonderful stay at the RedFern Cabin this Sunday. It’s romantic, great amenities, and everything was really accessible. You will love this cabin for family & friends. Sadly it’s reserved Christmas weekend but hey who wouldn’t want to reserve this beautiful cabin in the heart of the Amish Country. A real gem!

Text: We stayed in the  Owl's  Perch unit  and we're totally  blown away  with how gorgeous  this unit is! Easy parking and access to the door. Basic kitchen with small cook top and fridge but with a freezer big enough to hold a bag of ice cubes , carton of ice cream , etc. Super  comfy bed, nice bath, great jacuzzi . We never went out to eat but chose to buy local  cheeses, sausages,bread and spreads to enjoy  in the comfort  and luxury  the cabin

Text: We stayed in the Red Fern Cabin.  Very nice cabin rental - comfortable and very clean.  Beautiful inside and everything is in great condition.  The décor is amazing and the cabin provides plenty to do without having to leave.  There is a beautiful fireplace and cozy rustic furniture with a big screen TV - (if you like to watch TV while on vacation...), a full-size pool table, foosball table, and an "old-school" video game with multiple games - inside.  Outside there is a beautiful private hot-tub next to a great patio with a fire pit.  

Awesome place!  The bathrooms are very - very nice!  One has a beautiful garden tub and separate shower, and a huge sink area with very unique rustic counter space and a very cool carved rock basin.  The other bathroom is also very cool with its wine barrel doorway and pebble floor shower, and copper sink!   The kitchen is amazing - lots of counter space to work, full size refrigerator/freezer, Full-size electric stove & oven, beautiful huge window above the sink with a motorized blind.  A fabulous little side porch off the kitchen that shelters you from the weather, but allows you to be outside.

A parking area right outside the main door of the cabin, that is secure and private to this cabin.

Although this place is 5 star worthy - I had to take away a star because they boast a "full kitchen", but fail to note that there is only 1 rack inside the oven - which made it difficult to manage a full meal, the pots & pans situation leaves a lot to be desired, there is no dishpan, and only 1 dishtowel & dish rag.  Be sure to bring these items to make your stay much for comfortable and easy.  However, it's such a nice place, we plan to visit again in 2018 - but will bring more kitchen stuff with us next time!
