Comfort Inn Shepherdsville - Louisville South
Rating: 5
Text: One of the better Comfort Inns I've stayed at. Clean, quiet, very friendly and helpful desk staff. The woman who is in charge of the guests' breakfast was wonderful! She kept all the items stocked, and containers full. She took a moment to speak with us just to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and had everything we needed. Very pleasant experience!

Text: I would give this hotel 2.5 stars, but that's not an option. I liked that they have friendly employees and decent options on their free breakfast buffet. It was relatively quiet, even though our room was directly across from the elevator. The shower was acceptable and there was plenty of hot water, (but the shower curtain wouldn't stay shut). I took away stars because the bed was very creaky/noisy (even with any slight movement), there were SEVERAL stains in the room (on the walls, floor, and linens), and there was a gross musty/smoky odor on the towels. It was a convenient location, though not the easiest parking lot to get into. It did the job, but I would likely not choose this hotel again.

Text: We were there for two nights with our marching band. 69 students, several parents etc...we had 60 of the 80 rooms. That staff was super helpful, friendly and very accommodating! Rooms were clean and we'll stocked with linens etc.. they made our stay smooth and pleasant.

Text: It's not a bad place to stay. I stayed here for a work meeting just for one night and the rooms are clean. My only complaint was that the toilet wasn't working but they did repair that before I got back from my meeting. Otherwise there are small fridges in the rooms microwaves coffee pots and a decent selection of channels on the television.

Text: I would actually give it more a 3 1/2 stars. The beds were a bit uncomfortable but still a nice quiet stay. However even though they've made some improvements to the place one could tell it was still an old hotel. Not a big deal though. Staff was very friendly and most helpful. The free breakfast was great too.
