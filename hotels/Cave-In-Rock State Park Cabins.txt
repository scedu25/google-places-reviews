Text: Cabin 4 A was awesome. The views from the deck are worth the stay alone. Warning! The walls are thin, you can hear almost anything that's going on in 4B!

Text: great addition for rural community. excellent selection, nice building and awesome view. very clean, easily best overall lunch or dinning experience within 30 miles. personally love the salads everything is fresh, though the menu selection is often limited throughout early week due to understandable limited food stock.
