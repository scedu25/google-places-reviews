Text: This is one of the worst hotels I ever stayed at. As soon as we entered the room it smelled really bad. The room was conjusted. There was a blood stain on the carpet. We switched rooms 3 times but never got satisfied with any of the rooms. The tub had tons of rust on it. The wall had a huge hole in it. The bedsheets looked like they hadn't been washed for years. If you're gonna stay at this hotel which I hope you won't check the room before paying. Plus there wasn't an option to give this hotel 0/5 that's why I gave it a 1 star. Thank god we are only staying a night!

Text: This is the worse Hotel I been to. It needs to be condemned. I found a bag with garbage in it under a chair, while I was talking a shower the tub filled up with water. The tub was dirty as well. The next morning as I was waking up I seen a cockroach crawling on the wall. The walls has mold on them. Shame on them. Never will I stay there again! Didn't want to even give it a raiting but I had to in order to post first.

Text: DO NOT GO HERE !! So I booked a room for one night and for one the room and shower is extremely small. There's a smell, but not very strong. I woke up the next morning and seen a roach and reported it to front desk and they basically kind of shrugged it off like it wasn't anything. And I realized after I left that I have bite marks, which indicated that they have bed bugs as well. (And I'm pretty sure their housekeepers don't change the bed sheets) 65 dollars gone to waist honestly.
