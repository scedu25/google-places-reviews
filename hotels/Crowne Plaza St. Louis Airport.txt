Text: I stayed night for a wedding. Everyone was extremely courteous and professional. In my stay the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. In fact the day after, I ordered a pair of hotel quality pillows through Amazon, $40 dollars queen size, and they are just like staying at the hotel. The wedding was fun but my pillows will be with me for a long time. Lol

Text: Pool was a great refreshing temperature. Easy access to towels. Great hot water. Nice smelling shower supplies, not to mention I felt the cleanest I had in quite some time. Comfy beds with super easy to adjust a/c. A really cool building architecture wise as well. 10/10 would stay again

Text: My family loved our stay at the Crowne Plaza. This was the last leg of our family vacation before we got on a flight to home. I have IHG platinum in was upgraded to concierge-level which was awesome because we had access to a Concierge Lounge that offered free snacks and drinks. The rooms are also on the top floor and required a room key to get to the room. we appreciated the extra security this offered. Staff were very nice rooms are clean and modern and well-maintained. Bathroom was a little small but it wasn't that big of a deal.

Text: Great rooms,  loved the pool *you are kind of on display though,  the elevator over looks it* 
Has a TGI Fridays inside and their own restaurant for breakfast/lunch/dinner.  
Reasonable prices,  decent location.  

*important* When driving in, the turn to your right off of highway is IMMEDIATE. You go around a loop, you'll see the hotel at that time,  then before the road is going straight you must turn right immediately.  There is somewhat of a lane on the right,  not defined,  to veer to your right,  to allow other drivers to move past you.

Text: 3.5 stars is about right.  Not the most convenient from the airport.  Pain to get to with a rental car (sneaky turn you only know once you've been here a couple times).  Hallways smell damp. Room was decent,  but not what I expected from a Crowne Plaza. Leaky tub, faulty lights, and other minor room issues = I'll look for another hotel next time.  Breakfast was very good but not normally included in the room price.
