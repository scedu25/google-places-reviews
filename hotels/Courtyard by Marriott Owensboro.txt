Text: The stay at this hotel was wonderful. The rooms were clean. The beds were comfortable with very soft covers and pillows. Before we arrived we had requested extra pillows. They brought us the pillows plus an extra blanket. The pool water was warm. The pool is a bit on the smaller side and if you want to go when it is not occupied by a lot of children you need to go early in the a.m. or late in the p.m., but it is open 7-10. The hot tub was always available and not crowded. They have a beautiful fire place outside at night that you can sit around and visit. The staff was very pleasant. All and all the only thing I could even think of that was even a little disappointing was that there was not much water pressure in the shower. I would stay here again no question about it.

Text: Lady at check-in was not real pleasant. Room (beds/pillows) were nice.  Room is spacious. Only sink is in with the tub/toilet...makes it a little rough to get ready traveling with two women. No breakfast included in the price. They have an over priced restaurant that cost close to $10 for an egg sandwich and OJ. For the price..I would stay elsewhere next time at a place that included a hot breakfast.

Text: Overall nice facilities, very friendly staff.. skip the 7.00 microwaved breakfast sandwiches. Room smelled like chlorine and the check out clerk informed me that the "ventalation from the pool must have entered the room". Showers are great.
