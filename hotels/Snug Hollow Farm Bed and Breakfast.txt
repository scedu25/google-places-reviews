Snug Hollow Farm Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Second visit.  This time 5 nights instead of 3.  Breathtaking nature, perfect trails that can be challenging or meandering.  Food that encourages lingering conversations.  I am still walking around in a cloud after soaking up all of the beauty.  The one word I use for my visit is magical.  Barbara has created something very special at Snug Hollow.  If you don't like nature, gravel roads, beautiful fields and woods, singing birds, clean, simple accommodations, and good wholesome food, then you may want to stay somewhere else!  I hope to continue coming for years to come. ?????????????????

Text: This was a wonderful experience. My wife and I spent two nights in the Cabin with a View and it was cool. It is decorated as you would expect a cabin to be, with rocking chairs and vintage furniture and lots of books upstairs and down. The kitchen and bathroom were modern (the cabin is only 3 years old) and nice and clean. The queen size bed upstairs is an ok mattress, not overly comfortable, but fine for a couple of nights. We didn't use the other two twin beds. The cabin has a lot of windows all around the house which helps keep you connected to the hollow even if you want to chill inside. The views of the hollow during the day from the front porch are great, and at night we spent a while just watching the stars and listening to the insects sing their songs. The back porch is screened in, faces the woods and is always in the shade during the day, so it was a great place to do some yoga and just sit and enjoy the isolation of the place.

It was around 90 degrees both days we were there, but we didn't even have to run the air conditioner to cool it off after dinner because it cooled off so fast in the hollow. 

We did some walking around the trails, and the property was beautiful. The pastures were full of mature grasses, wild berry brambles, goldenrod, ironweed, and some other yellow wildflower that looked like tickseed, maybe? All of the paths were wide and freshly manicured, so you didn't have to worry about constantly having all of the above scratch across your legs as you walked. Along the pastures we saw lots and lots of pollinators, honey bees, solitary bees, dragonflies, monarch butterflies as well as turkey and deer. 

The garden area near the main house was pretty with veggies like peppers, tomatoes, okra, lettuce, arugula, swiss chard and some great flower plants like zinnias, cosmos, sunflowers and something else. I am a big gardener/flower lover, so I would love it if maybe they had a full time gardener that could really increase the amount of production they are getting from their own land. As things currently stand, I think it is great that they are taking advantage of having at least some fresh ingredients to go along with what they are augmenting with from off the property.

We ate two breakfasts and one dinner while we were there and I totally think the food is worth the trip by itself. You eat together with other guests which makes for an interested experience. Don't worry, you aren't just left at the table to make idle small talk with total strangers. At all of our meals, the staff seemed to curate the conversations at the tables, with Barbara proving to be particularly astute at this. After dinner, I said that Barb worked the crowd like a comedian, engaging everyone at the table as she spoke about her experiences and interwove what she was learning about the guests. It is clearly a skill she has honed over the years.

Our visit for two nights in the cabin and 3 meals was $620 after leaving modest tips for the staff. I am a working class person, so that is pretty steep for me, but I am sure many regular B & B users would find that to be  a steal. I think that because of the unique nature of the experience, it was worth it for a memorable weekend. I don't mean to discount the value of the place or the services they provide. This isn't just 350 acres of overgrown pasture, they really do have an aesthetic that they are shooting for and achieving. And all of the things they are doing, making delicious food, cultivating a truly relaxing state, and manicuring the surrounding nature is very valuable. I would think about returning for a special occasion, but the price is too high for a periodic weekend getaway.

Text: Everything about our visit was incredible. The food, the atmosphere, the architecture, the people - it's all wonderful and contributes to a generally perfect experience. Seriously, the bread was to die for. I don't know what to say, really, other than to just go there. You'll love it. I can't wait for my next chance to hang out with Barbara and any other people lucky enough to find themselves at Snug Hollow.
