Text: Pet friendly and quiet. Nice country setting close to town.  I wish the saluki bus came here.  It's a long walk to get anywhere without a car but it can be done. It's cheaper to do any maintenance your self than call for it done

Text: We have been here for almost 2 years. We began in a smaller unit then moved into a bigger place. More recently management has improved and Mandy, the new manager, has made a drastic change. Today she even wished my son happy birthday!
Maintenance requests are taken care of quickly and efficiently, the guys are super nice. Things are clean and quiet and family friendly.

Text:  Nice places, nice people, but be careful about the price you see in ads compared to what price they say they rent for.
