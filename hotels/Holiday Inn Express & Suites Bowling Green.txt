Holiday Inn Express & Suites Bowling Green
Rating: 5
Text: I've stayed at every hotel in the immediate Bowling Green Area. The Holiday Inn easily has the most hospitality toward their customers. The rooms are very clean, the staff is friendly, and the breakfast bar has several very tasty options. I've also noticed they go the extra mile- from housekeeping leaving a friendly note hoping I have a nice day, to wishing visiting sports teams good luck (hotel staff crafted funny tennis ball faces that say good luck and posted them on the tennis team's doors). FANTASTIC HOTEL with a very friendly culture! :)

Text: The honeymoon suite was fantastic and the in-room jacuzzi was the perfect way to end an exhausting day. They even were nice enough to put a nice congratulations sign out at the front desk for us. It was a very nice night!
