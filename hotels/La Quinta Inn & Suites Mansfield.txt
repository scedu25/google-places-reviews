La Quinta Inn & Suites Mansfield
Rating: 4
Text: The beds are very comfortable and the room was very clean. But the people across from us were loud and disrespectful and had over 6 or 7 loud kids. They also over took the pool and spa over for a good 3 hours we finally got down there with an hour to spare. We just wanted a nice quiet time away from home but we didn't get that. Everything else was really nice though!

Text: For the time I was at the La Quinta in Mansfield. I had a pleasurable experience. The Inn is clean and well kept. Service was professional and pleasant. I did not stay overnight. I will update my rating when I do.

Text: Very nice. Remodeling did wonders. Front desk personnel extremely helpful (since reservations screwed things up). They took care of us swiftly & efficiently. NOTE: The first motel I've been in a long time where the toilet seat wasn't falling off.

Text: I found La Quinta to be an excellent place to stay overnight with a pet. Most LaQuinta's allow pets. They had a grassy area for pottying and the room was clean and comfortable for me, my husband, and our two sons.

Text: Was a clean room. Very courteous staff. Was Weird that the ice machines are only on the 2nd and 3rd floors though. None on the 1st or 4th.
