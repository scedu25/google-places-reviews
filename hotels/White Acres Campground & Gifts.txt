White Acres Campground & Gifts
Rating: 4
Text: First, the owner, Allen, is a gem of a man. Exactly what someone in the Hospitality Service Business should be! 
The only reason I'm saying 4 ? is I wish the site was about 2 additional feet of gravel & a few are too close. You can hear your neighbors talking in their campers when windows are even a little open.
However, there are grass areas & picnic tables for each site, trees, a large field and it's children & pet friendly. Both under control at all times ??.
He is expanding for more lots & upgrading the bath house during the coming year.

Text: Couldn't believe how crappy this place was, grass was tall, owner wanted to change his mind halfway through our stay from paying for the lot to pay per person, and wanted to come complain about us having friends over for a crawfish boil. Owner was constantly bothering us about where we were parking when his son said we could already park in the spots we were at. No communication between the two lead to a lot of trouble for us even when we were just doing what we were told. Never go here, son is a creep and druggie, and owner is a constant complainer.

Text: I would give the owner zero stars if they would allow. We had a reservation for more then a couple of months with white Acer's for the upcoming bourbon fest and just received a call that he had cancelled on us. Said he over booked. I even called to confirm a couple of weeks ago on our reservation and everything was okay. I see now a couple more people have complained of the same thing. Avoid this place!  They do not honor anyones word.  I recommend anyone else to get ahold of the BBB if they have been through this.
