Super 8 Terre Haute
Rating: 2
Text: An adequate hotel as a "last resort" overnight stay. Housekeeping barely maintains a minimal cleaning standard. Melissa did an awesome job with booking my weekend stay.

Text: When he saw my dad was an AARP member he checked and got 4.00 off. This was after we'd already agreed to a price. I thought that was very nice. Room was clean and inviting, bed was very comfortable.

Text: The door was hard to shut. The hinge on the door lock was broken but the bed was very nice and the bathroom. Every thing else I have to say it is all good.

Text: Only been here a day but so far so good.  The front desk manager (Mindy) has been incredibly accommodating, rooms are nicely refurbed, lobby looks wonderful and I'm looking forward to trying out their new mattresses.

Text: This was a decent hotel, our room was quiet so I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about with thin walls. It's not the Taj Mahal, you get what you pay for. My bed was comfortable, it was quiet, it was clean. I think the shower and toilet room could have been better, but it functioned, plenty of hot water.
