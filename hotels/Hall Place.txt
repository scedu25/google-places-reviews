Text: Stayed here for my honeymoon and had the best time ever. The Hall's were amazing! Polite and friendly people. The rooms were perfect. This was our first time at a bed and breakfast and because of this stay and the Hall's we will no longer stay at hotels. Highly recommend this place! Everything was decorated nicely and I personally loved the breakfast even though it was the same thing every morning, I still found it tasty :)
