Best Western Plus Crawfordsville Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Great Place, either new or newly redecorated. Very nice room and lobby area. I hosted a photography workshop so I booked rooms for all my clients here. I was very impressed as were my clients.  Happy Clients means happy day. The breakfast area and the lobby was very comfortable. The rooms did a very nice job keeping out sound. I'm a light sleeper and I had the first room off the lobby which concerned me a little. but it was fine. Peaceful night and I fell asleep and stayed asleep  with no problems.
