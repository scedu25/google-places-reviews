IHG Army Hotels in Wickam Inn On Ft. Knox.

Text: The toilet is extra small so if you're a tall guy it's going to feel weird using it. The location is awesome it's right on post. Don't attempt to GPS the address it will send you over the cadet area. Instead search by name and will get you the right location. I ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut using the address that was in the room it was also wrong and sent my pizza to another hotel I put the suggestion in the suggestion box. My biggest complaint is that I could hear every single person in the hall and I could hear kids screaming in their rooms three or four rooms down I could hear my neighbors TV on both sides and I'm sure they can hear mine. I gave this establishment 2 star rating due to the lack of sleep I got. Even though the location is awesome I don't think I would try this hotel again.

Text: I remember staying at the old Wickham Guest house years ago and this new hotel is a big upgrade. Rates are very reasonable and, due to the huge drop-off in soldiers at Knox, this hotel is rarely busy.   When here, take a minute to read the display dedicated to the brave soldier for which the hotel is honorably named.

Text: The facility is nice. Wish they had an indoor pool. The day staff were unfriendly. I almost wanted to tell the lady, it wouldn't kill you to smile.

Text: Typical Army IHG facility. Feels old and not updated. Room was hot, HVAC on a motion sensor that never really cooled off, and seemed to turn off at night (maybe if you flail in your sleep, it'll stay on). But breakfast was a bit above par for the chain, at least more than some boiled eggs and packaged yogurt. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately most travelers don't have an option to not stay here.
