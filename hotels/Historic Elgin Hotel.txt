Text: This is the most amazing hotel I have ever had the pleasure of walking into. Seriously!! The historical value of this place alone swept me off of my feet. The building was built in 1886 and has changed hands many times in it's years of operation. The new owner and innkeeper have made this place more beautiful than one would think possible. Not to mention, they are two of the kindest and sweetest women I have ever met. If you get a chance to stay here, you absolutely should. Or if you are in the area, and not looking for a place to stay, I highly suggest you call for a tour! You won't regret it! I can't say enough about The Historic Elgin Hotel!!!!
