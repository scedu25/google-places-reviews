Happy Hills Campground

Text: Very friendly staff. When we arrived we had issues with our power. The problem was taken seriously and Darren and his employee Adam I believe was his name,  worked on it until they figured it out. Easy going and pleasant to be around. Restrooms are clean and atmosphere is nice. We will stay again on our next visit!  Thanks!

Text: We originally went to Serenity Hills and while it is beautiful it was filled with RVs and we are just simple tent campers. After expecting a problem when we asked to move to Happy Hills we were instead met by Darren who graciously allowed us to move to Happy Hills in a very secluded and beautiful camping spot with no issues and full of apologies. We will definitely be coming back to this place with amazing owners!! Thankful for good people!!! :)

Text: My wife and I rented a cabin for the weekend we got married to be our home base (as we got married at Ash Cave and had our reception near there). The cabin was cozy, had air conditioning, clean bunks, a camp toilet, running water, a small fridge. a microwave and a grill.  The staff was friendly and cabin was clean.
