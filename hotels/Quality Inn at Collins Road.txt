Text: The room was nice. I want 2 things when I check into a hotel. A working TV and a good night sleep. My remote control would not change channels. Woman at the desk said some were programmed wrong, too bad. WTH? At 4:30 I was woken by loud noises in the hallway. When I went to investigate it was the police. When I couldn't sleep anymore I again went to the front desk.Turns out they were evicting the guests for smoking pot. When I asked for a refund the lady said they don't do refunds. So it was a pretty awful experience

Text: Our king bed suite was nice and comfortable. The free breakfast was really tasty with hot food options. We were charged $30 for our two dogs but they are dog friendly.

Text: The staff was great!!  Breakfast was awesome!!  Room was very clean and the bed was amazing!!  Bathroom... Well... There was hair in the tub, on the floor, and the toilet was a little dirty.  Here was also a used washcloth left behind from someone what on the shower curtain rod that I didn't notice until I was in the shower!!  I clean for a living so notice things especially in the bathroom!!
