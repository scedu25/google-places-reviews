Timber Trails Campground
Rating: 4
Text: great for a quick stop when driving through, easy pull through spots for over nighters.  level, clean, up to date.  also would be a great weekend place if you lived in the area, seemed like a big happy family, all very friendly.  probably 95% of park are annuals, but don't let it stop you from stopping overnight.

overall the park was very clean and play grounds were in excellent condition.  a huge tractor themed play ground, ship themed one, and a regular old one.  also a decent pool.

I do agree the camp office is a pain to find and also easy to get your rig stuck on a dead end when checking in.  but overall an excellent experience!

Text: Pullthru sites with water, electricity are near the pool and two new playgrounds. The office is at the back of the campground and poorly marked. Some of the seasonal sites are unkempt. We camped overnight in a motorhome and would return.

Text: This is one of the nicest RV park we've seen in the last 3 months on the road.   It was practically empty when we were there in September 2016.   It was great because my dogs had free roam & was in heaven chasing the squirrels.  It is very clean & well maintained.   Sites were wide enough so we had enough privacy.   Yes, most definitely would return & stay a little longer.
