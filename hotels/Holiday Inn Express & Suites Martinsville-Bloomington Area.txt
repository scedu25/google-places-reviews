Text: I am very picky about the hotels I stay in. This is one of my favorite hotels. The staff are competent,  professional and friendly. This hotel is clean!  From the parking lot to the breakfast area to my room.  I check behind chairs and under the desk and never find anything yuky. I am always billed correctly.  It's easy to find this hotel and access is easy also. Parking is convenient. I look forward to coming back.

Text: This is a nice, clean hotel. The staff is friendly, polite and helpful. The rooms are nice sized and setup well. They have a free breakfast that's better than most. I ate it everyday. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The hotel was very clean and quiet.  I like the fact they have you sign a no tolerance for sound or partying.  The staff was very nice and helpful. The Free bottle water in the lobby was a nice touch.  One of the nicer Holiday Inn Express I have stayed at.
