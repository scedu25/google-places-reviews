Text: Never deal with this company! Being a reward member gets you nothing! Booked a room as rewards member that gives you lowest rate and had to cancel (3 weeks ahead of event). Then they charge you in full for the room and will not refund your money once cancelled. You only have 24 hours to cancel a room or you still have to pay whole amount! Nice business practices! So I called customer service and after an hour they told me it is the Marriott Decatur Forsyth that has to issue refund. They said there is nothing they can do..You all should be ashamed of yourself for taking money like this...

Text: Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. On hold times are ridiculous and the manager very unhelpful. I also notice only the positive reviews get a response. Never. Again.

Text: I travel 100% for my job, and this is one of the best hotels I've been to. The hotel itself is a standard Residence Inn, but the staff make the difference. The housekeeping staff is excellent and friendly, and the front desk staff are amiable and extremely helpful. I couldn't be more pleased.

Text: Nice clean hotel. Looks pretty new as well. Friendly helpful staff while I was there and it's in a pretty good area. Everything went well during this stay.

Text: Newer Hotel, built within last two years. Stayed two nights, supposed to be three but over sold I was told, which forced us to stay one night at the Homewood Suites across the street. As a platinum elite member this was almost unforgiving however, I had a room with another hotel and location so it was not the end of the world. Smooth check in and the free breakfast was on par with other Marriott properties. The king bed, open modern shower with the speaker phone shower-head was a nice addition to an already great floor plan. They will local shop for groceries and the room also has a full size kitchen and couch. There is no dining table to speak of however, there is a small breakfast counter with 2 seats. The only minor inconvenience of my room was that the bathroom fan seemed to always stay on and run, regardless of light switch positions. Also, I could here the Lowes speaker announcement a few times. Did not interrupt sleep and I would stay here again. Highly recommended if in the area. Thanks for reading and video of the room on the youtube channel.
