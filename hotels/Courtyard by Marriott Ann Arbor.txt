Text: This was a great hotel to stay at. I would highly recommend it for business travelers. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The food at the restaurant was pretty good. It was within a short drive to downtown. The building and decor is contemporary. To reiterate, the staff was just great.

Text: Conducted a Training seminar here for a week. Very nice facility with plenty of offerings for a business meeting. Only complaint (I will get it out of the way) is the air conditioning did not work for 2 days. Fortunately it happened on days when it was relatively mild weather, so we survived. There were people attending to it and attempting to fix it, but 2 days to fix something is too long.

The infrastructure for the Training was very well organized. Walter was always available and ensured that our every need was met. Of particular note is that they provided Water in jugs, a bucket of ice was always available, plenty of beverages and Coffee with real cups. Good attention to the environment and minimum wastage of paper, plastic etc. They had real spoons to stir your coffee and not the plastic stir sticks. Food was good and there was an interesting variety of foods even catering to the gluten free and the vegetarians in the group.

An outdoor seating area which was quite nice to sit and enjoy your lunch or to break away to make a phone call during breaks.

Rest rooms were clean and had background music playing through speakers, a detail commonly missed in most establishments.

Overall, a great location to host a seminar. Well done!

Close by the mall, grocery store and plenty of restaurants. We'd definitely would stay here again as well as advise anyone coming this way to stay here, it's worth it!

Text: Great rooms!  Clean and comfortable.  Spacious pool and exercise room.  Full bar that you could meet friends or take a date.  No "free" breakfast.  You can have decent food instead.
Close to downtown, Univ. of MI, and 294.  Setting is beautiful, quite, and relaxing.  Perfect for weekend retreat.
