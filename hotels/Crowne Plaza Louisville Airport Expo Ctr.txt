Text: Amazing beds and amazing pillows. Wonderful and accommodating staff. The rooms were very nice, and had actual coffee pots instead of kureg! Keep that up! Will absolutely be staying here again in the near future. Also, try the chicken noodle soup

Text: Loved it! Always do! I'm so glad Louisville saved one half of the old EXECUTIVE hotels! That just don't make architecture like this still and probably will never again!  The rooms... nice, the service... nice, the stay... lovely!

Text: Hotel is conveniently located by the Expo Center and the airport.  Must have had a renovation at some.poimt because certain areas are new, however, in all, the hotel is pretty old and run down.  Rooms have an old smoke.smell, rugs, furniture and decor have not been maintained.  Rooms were not replaced with updated heavy hotel doors, very hollow and light, allowing the opportunity to hear everything; neighbors, ice machines, elevators.

Expensive breakfast buffet ($14) and full service restaurant throughout the day with decent service.

24 hour airport shuttle.

Not the nicest full service hotel in town.
