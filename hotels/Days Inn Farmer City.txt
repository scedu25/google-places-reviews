Text: Great food, nice truck parking, clean restrooms. Can't comment on the showers but I've been told they are excellent.

Would come here again, just for the food.

Text: Avoid staying here unless there's no other choice. The water is so bad and foul smelling, tastes like rust, that you almost cannot take a shower in. Had to move out after the first night. So disappointed.
