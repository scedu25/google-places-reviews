Text: The park is very scenic and full of great shade trees. The staff was great and very helpful. Rates were good and the park was immaculate! Nice brewery just up the road and you could get a ride from park staff to and from. Antenna signal was good so local tv was good. Laundry room was clean and the machines worked fine. We would definitely come here again!

Text: My family and I had two hours notice that we were looking for an overnight. The host was extremely helpful and polite. She came to meet us upon arrival and then ushered us to our spot for the evening. She was a delight to work with. On top of the friendly and welcoming atmosphere, the trees make it feel more secluded. The bathroom was so nice. It is immaculately clean and there are double shower curtains for privacy to get dressed. Multiple shower stalls ensure that there won't be a wait. Happy Trail was so accomadating and nice that I wish we had another night to spend. Thank you, Happy Trails!
