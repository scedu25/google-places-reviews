Text: Best room I've stayed in a while . HVAC unit could be set for the fan to run constantly. Bathroom grout was clean and there was a slight smell of bleach in the air . Only downside was the bed was to soft .

Text: Easy to find and conveniently located. My room was clean and comfortable, and the front desk agents were friendly during check in and check out. My only complaint was that the AC in my room was super loud- but I only noticed as I was leaving the room, so it didn't interrupt my sleep or anything.

Text: We were greeted by a very happy woman who will got us checked in & offered us bottled water (which was much appreciated after our trip). The rooms were simple but clean and had everything we needed. The pool happened to be closed but they had made arrangements for guests to have access to the pool at the Hilton Garden so we were still able to go swimming. We would definitely use this goes again. The location is close to the interstate and has easy access to food and gas options.

Text: Very clean room, comfortable bed. Shower had great water pressure. Front desk staff was great and called the room after check in to ensure everything was good with the room.

Text: Clean hotel, rooms are very big. If you like a firm mattress (like me) you won't like these mattresses. That's my only knock on the hotel.
