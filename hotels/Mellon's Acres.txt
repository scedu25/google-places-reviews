Text: Very pretty place!! My wife to be and I got the package that included the two cottages for Friday night and one for us to stay in on Saturday. The Cottages are definitely relaxing but could use a little upkeep. Maybe better furniture,  the rugs and the furniture had a few tarnished stains on them and the pictures on the wall made me feel like I was at my grandmother's house, (no offense to the older generation) and we had to kill a couple spiders while we were staying there but that's not a big deal. I mean it is in the country!! The wedding was fabulous, we had it by the waterfall and Dianna helped us coordinate the setup and made sure to help us with anything we needed help with. Overall I was satisfied with our decision on the venue.
