Text: Hallway smells of mold. Room smells like Lysol. Furniture dated and ripped. The good: room is huge , front desk staff very friendly and the indoor pool is awesome!

Text: My room was covered in some type of dust. Not sure what it was exactly, but it seemed like nobody had been in the room since the last time they updated hotel (Terribly 70's). Also, I might have been touched by a ghost. 9/10 would stay again.

Text: For the price we paid, me and my boyfriend will come back. The hot tub does not work and the front desk mentioned they will be filling it in with cement. There were no pool tables, arcade games, or ping pong tables. They will not be bringing those back. The pool was great. The smoking bedroom that we had was very clean and did not smell. Can't complain.

Text: Great place to stay if you are flying out of ohare airport. Rooms are kind of old but clean. Shuttle driver was great and right on time. Will stay yhere again. Best part you get to park you car there for 14 days if you stay the night.

Text: Great price for ParkSleepFly, but shabby rooms. Paid $91 at check in (had booked for $109 online) for 5 nights parking. On-time departure shuttle. Lobby looked nice,  but doors are not automated if you have a lot or large bags. 2-story hotel that is VERY spread out, so a lot of walking potentially. Room was quite spacious but pillows small, chipped paint, rough towels, A.C. unit not really enough to cool the room, bed not overly comfortable. Everything was clean, though. Pool area looked fantastic, but not tub roped off. Despite shabbibess, will likely use again.
