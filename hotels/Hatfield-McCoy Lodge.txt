Hatfield-McCoy Lodge

Text: Terrible experience. I had reserved a room a month ago for two friends coming to town. When they checked in, the management had already given that room to someone else. They put my guests in a room that was not nearly as nice, with no discount. We had the room for three nights, but the room was so atrocious that they could only stay there the first night. We got no refund. The management and owners were cold and did not care about us. We ended up moving up to the Holiday Inn and had a much, much better experience. Save the money and the headache and just go straight to the Holiday Inn or the Hilton or any other nearby hotel. I've stayed in many hotels, and I usually go with the small business/local business. But usually, that comes with the added benefit of being treated like a person. That was not the case here.

Text: I'm a travel nurse, so I'm always looking for a good deal when it comes to lodging. Hatfield is a wonderful motel, great price, awesome customer service, and the room is so nice, feels like I'm in a cabin in Gaitlinburg! Will definitely stay there anytime I'm in Pikeville :-)

Text: Really nice now that the other owners r gone, the tall blonde lady that was married to the owner was a pure b@*&h. Se thought she was too good for Pikeville,LOL!  I wasn't never gonna go back but I gave it a ty and I was treated with respect.  The rooms r alot nicer AND most importantly, cleaner.
