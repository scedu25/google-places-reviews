Text: Started calling Saturday morning for a reservation and got no answer. I left a message.  Phone message gave another number, l called it...no answer either. Left another message. Did this several times on the way to Hays, KS. Got to the park and someone answered only to say they had no hook-ups left.  Lots of work to do to be a recommended spot to stay. My advice... keep going. Really sucks that this is the service they provide. AND it's under "new management".  Wow!!
