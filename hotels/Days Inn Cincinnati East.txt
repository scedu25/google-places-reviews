Text: Cheap run of the mill kind of room. Staff however is excellent and always willing to go the extra mile to get you comfortable placed in your room for rest and relaxation. Save yourself some $$$$$ book online for best rate i use Expedia myself

Text: Days Inn still manages to feel just a step above a murderous motel but still retain all of the lovely stains and charm of one.

Text: Avoid this place. Non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke, we had two TV's and two refrigerators because one of each was broken. A/C was hit or miss if it would work or not. Cable didn't work. Cigarette burns in the linens and the comforter clearly hadn't been washed in a while. Not worth the cheap price.
