Text: Country Charm is right!  We stayed for our first Bed & Breakfast experience together.  It was wonderful.  Very pleasant and comfortable experience.  We had a relaxing cozy evening and a delicious breakfast waiting for us on Saturday morning.  We will be back.

Text: Crocker's B & B is a wonderful place to stay.  The Crockers are very nice people and a more than ample breakfast is served.  The house is very cozy and was plenty warm in April when my wife and I stayed there.  There was a nice big bathtub in our room which was very relaxing.  The toilet was a few feet down the hall which did not bother us a bit.  It was shared with just two other rooms.  We chose our time for breakfast which was 8am so we had to head over to Crockers Country Living for our breakfast, which is a senior citizen apartment complex on the same property.  It was very enjoyable eating over there because many of the old folks were in the big dayroom there when we ate our breakfast and we got to visit with a lot of them.  Some of them would tell us stories about the old days and they were very nice.  When we went back a couple of months later to stay at our own place which we had purchased in April we stopped by to see everyone.  Crocker's is very reasonable compared to the other B & Bs in the area and I would highly recommend it if you are seeking that sort of accomodation.
