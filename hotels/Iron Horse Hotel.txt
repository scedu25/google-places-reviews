Iron Horse Hotel

Text: I booked the Iron House Hotel in Backwater,  Missouri in early February for the eclipse.   I arrived to find the remainder of the hotel had later been booked for a wedding.   Nice event but it consumed the entire place.   We could not get to our room due to the wedding in process.   We waited outside in the August heat.   Later the wedding party and guest enjoyed a nice meal and continued to over flow the entire hotel and staff.   I finally was able to connect with the owner/head chef and request a reversal of my charge,  I was cancelling and choose not to stay.   He looked me in the eye and with a smile asked "Is there a problem".

We left and drove the 260 miles back home.

I appreciate the special event of the wedding and understand the owner's economic choice but I had been looking forward to my husband and I staying at the hotel for over six months.   I think the least the owner should have done was to contact me to let me know the change in circumstances.  I could have then made my decision as to whether I chose to keep my reservation or make other arrangements.   At the very least I would have been prepared for the Total inconvience of not having the hotel available to us until late that night.

At the every least I was unfairly treated and at the most disrespectfully neglected.

Text: We booked this hotel as a last resort. I skeptical rolling up to it at midnight, but was delightfully surprised! Such rich history to the hotel with great service and atmosphere. The home cooked breakfast included was so tasty! Would recommend everyone to this hotel when passing through I-70!
