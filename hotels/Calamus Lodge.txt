Calamus Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: Rented a cabin, me my wife and three kids.  Nice enough, all amenities and clean.  Am here for a family reunion so extended family has the whole place rented.  The lodges are nice and roomy.  Lots of space for the outside things...campfires and such.  Little playground for the kids.  That's real nice.   The owner, bruce is a very nice man, he has a donkey,  which seems pretty old, that has run of the place.  Kids loved him.  Adults too.  Overall experience was very good. Would come back if not so dang far away....maybe some year in future...

Text: Walking in the front door there's no signs to lead you to the next room.  Which is office which is the restaurant, once in the door a please seat your self sign would be nice. Bartender was the waiter and running himself crazy with all the guests.  Owners walked in didn't even say hello or help the waiter/bartender.
