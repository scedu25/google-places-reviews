Americas Best Value Inn - Belvidere/Rockford
Rating: 1
Text: Worst ever...hotel was pass dirty...nothing that a little Lysol could'nt take care off and this was inside and out. Unfortunately we had to stay...every hotel was full. The only thing good was the staff. I'm only giving it a  one star because there is no negative star.

Text: Inexpensive hotel. You get what you pay for. All in all, good stay.

Text:  Good value for money spent. They have us two towels and we're still waiting for the others. Breakfast is a no. Just one tray of donut holes and one bag of bagels.

Text: It was a quick overnight motel stay but the rooms very smelly and the bed sheets/ blankets were old. The breakfast was very minimal. For $65, it wasn't bad but next time, I would spend a little more , stay somewhere else. This is more of a motel than hotel.
