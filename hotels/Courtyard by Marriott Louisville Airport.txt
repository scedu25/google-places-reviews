Text: People are nice. Cool lobby. The beds are great, but the bathtub backs up. We have been here a few days and they are unable to fix the problem. I've stayed here before with no issues.

Text: Nice rooms, in-lobby small bar and cafe. Convenient to airport. 4 miles from downtown. Not many good walking distance eating options.

Text: Extremely unhelpful and incompetent staff, rooms are in dire need of updating, and paying 10 dollars for a cereal/ yesterdays eggs and sausage that will make you spend your day in the bathroom seems ridiculous. Never got a recite and after asking 5 separate times to have one emailed i continue to get excuses and rude staff. I recommend staying at the Hilton a few miles away.

Text: Hotel was nice but the day I checked out I forgot my pillow in the room and called them around 7 or 8 that night when I realized it. They told me that house keeping is in charge of that and to call back the next day. I called back as soon as I got home from work and they told me to call the next day between 10 and 3. I did and the front desk jotted down my number but I never heard back. Day FOUR I called yet again and they tell me the same thing. This is ridiculous!!! I've got spinal injury in my neck and it's the only pillow that doesn't flair a migraine. I've tried many pillows while waiting to hear back and I've gotten no sleep. I won't be staying here due to the fact that they won't return calls or go out of their way to see if my pillow is even still there.
