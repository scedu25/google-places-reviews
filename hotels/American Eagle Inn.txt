Text: No shampoo or creme rinse, no blow dryer, TV had very few channels, remote didn't work. Bathroom tub had patch over s hole in center of tub. Check out is at 10:30 not the usual 11:00 and there is no late check out. They raised the room rate 20.00 because of the eclipse.

Text: We have 'lived' here for 6+ months. It is our temporary home. The owners have treated us like family and are very accommodating. They keep the rooms and outside area very clean and rates are very reasonable! Not to mention right off the highway.
