Nolin Lake State Park
Rating: 5
Text: It was April when we camped here and it has been one of the best camping spots. Clean and level spots with a place to hang your garbage. Spacious sites on pea gravel so if it had rained there was no mud mess. The lake is big and has beautiful scenery. You can see it from some sites and walk from one and sit on the rocky shore. I would go back. I only wish I had pictures  to share.

Text: We go every summer as we live approx 45 min away. The first time we camped there we put up our tent in an RV site. Allot more space then tent sites.. To much to do at this lake.. You'll absolutely love camping here if your on a trip and need a place cheap to camp.

Text: Our first camping trip at Nolin Lake State Park campground, it will not be our last. The campground was clean, quiet and large enough(approx. 30 sites). The bathhouse was very clean. The campground host was friendly and made rounds a couple times a day. We camped on site #21 with our 43' fifth wheel. It was easy to back into with plenty of parking space for our tow vehicle. Highly recommend giving this campground a try. WE'LL BE BACK???
