Super 8 Hays KS

Text: Great place to stay. We traveled through the night from Indiana. I called about 2 hours out & requested an early check in. They said they'd start preparing our room. Happily, it was ready when we got there. Nap time. This hotel is right of the interstate, easy to get to, inexpensive, very clean, very comfortable king size bed. Good breakfast, could use some protein though, like hard boiled eggs &/or peanut butter. Bath tub was kind narrow & short but it was very clean. Overall a great stay, I'd recommend it strongly.

Text: It's a budget friendly and clean hotel. The furnitures and bath tub are old. But I was expecting it as the price was very less compared to other places near. The staff were super nice. I pulled in at midnight and they had only one parking spot left open and the parking spots are super tight.

Text: We got to the hotel at 4am with no reservation. The man at the front desk was super helpful and very nice. I was surprised that the room had a fridge and microwave because it was very inexpensive. We will for sure use this hotel again when we are traveling through Kansas and need a place to sleep.
