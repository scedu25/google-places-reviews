Text: I am a contract IT person and live in extended stay hotels. My stay at Candlewood suites - Troy MI has been exceptional. The hotel is well kept, clean and located right next to the I-75 expressway. My room has a new TV, stable Wi-Fi,  good furniture and a well stocked kitchen, everything I need to live and be comfortable. The staff is very nice and goes out of their way to be always helpful. I'll be going to Boston, MA next and am definitely booking at Candlewood there in hopes my experience will be the same.

Text: Pretty close to the road, easy to access and also many options for dinner. As it's possible to cook in the room, it's easyer to save some money if necessary. Cleaning and room space is pretty good. TV, bed and furniture are new and comfortable. Bad things: refrigerator and are control is makes too much noise and I could not sleep so good.

Text: The first room we were given hadn't been cleaned, but the front desk fixed it quickly and was very helpful. The second room was much better, and our stay was pleasant overall.

Text: The building is kind of nice, it has 3 floors with elevator and stairs, it has a little Gym whith some running/scalator machines and some other stuff to work out. The service is not excellent but it is good. It has a laundry and free coffee machine. Regarding the room, it is equipped with all you need for cooking, one bathroom with a bath, a big desktop that also works as "meal table", one TV with cable, a refrigerator and a closet with an iron.
