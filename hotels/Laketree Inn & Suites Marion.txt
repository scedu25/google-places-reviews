Text: Stayed here for a wedding and have no regrets staying here.  As others have said the building is older but everything was clean and the staff were very friendly. Would defintetly stay here again.

Text: I have been coming here for over 15 years. Close to the south end of lake of Egypt. Parking for about a dozen boats. Building is a little older but our room was updated with new beds and nice TV.

Text: Planning an outdoor wedding in a few months near here and stopped in to check this place out to see if it was worthy of using it as a staging area for the wife to be. I found it to be acceptable, large clean rooms, free wifi, as clean as any low cost motel,  horrible westward view. The Indian woman working the check-in was very nice.
