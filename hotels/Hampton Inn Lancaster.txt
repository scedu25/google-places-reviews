Hampton Inn Lancaster
Rating: 5
Text: Although we only spent one night, we enjoyed it greatly. The staff were friendly and quick to get us into our room. The rooms themselves were one of the better rooms I've been in. Haven't sleep that good in a while. Next time I need a room, if given a choice, I'd happily go with Hampton Inn again.

Text: One of a few places that allowed 18+ olds to rent a room at there hotel. The hotel was in a nice location as well as the amenities we're very nice and updated. The staff was extremely kind. I would recommend to anyone. I honestly can not wait till I have another trip in the area so I can spend another night.

Text: I don't know if it was this specific Hampton Inn or if all of them are like this, but this was better than any hotel I've been to, and I travel a ton for work. something about the space and decoration of the room is perfect. It's also literally right next to Olive Garden which was nice. The continental breakfast was standard for a hotel but the staff is especially kind.

Text: Standard Hampton.  Good breakfast buffet with decent amount of seating.  Exhaust fan in bathroom not working. Fridge but no microwaves in rooms.
