Albert the Bull Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Thanks to the Aubusson Travel Club for this peaceful Campground.  If you need a place to stop for the night and rest it will be great.  Full hookups around the outside edge of the park and water and electric in the middle.  The bathrooms are old but clean.  Self serve, just pick your spot and pay.  I would stop again with no problem.  Albert the Bull was impressive also!
