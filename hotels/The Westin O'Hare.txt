The Westin O'Hare
Rating: 5
Text: The room and price for the room was great. Free, no-hassle parking for guests. Fast service when requested. The breakfast was a la carte, but this fact was very transparent. All and all, the bottom line price was higher than some, but the value of the services and amenities matched, if not exceeded the price point. Great stay!

Text: Conference hosted in lower level of hotel. Rooms were above average and enjoyable. Food was catered through the hotel and was very good. The bacon in particular was thick and quite tasty. Would definitely suggest staying here for O'Hare over nights

Text: Hotel conference accommodations are great as well as staff.... but that parking pay box is a bad joke!!! The instructions are all wrong and it caused a huge traffic backup. Westin, please invest in better instructions. If you are going to the Weston and need to be somewhere, allow 15-20 minutes to get out of the lot.

Text: Very nice rooms and great staff. I was particularly impressed that we could have our dog stay there without a fee. They just required us to sign a waiver. They also asked if we needed a dog bed or water bowl. I always feel like hotels assume your dog is going to be a pain, but this one made the whole family feel welcome.

Text: Excellent hotel. I attended an event in their ballroom, and they were very acomoda ting with receiving some shipping items and providing great service during my stay. The gym was better than average too
