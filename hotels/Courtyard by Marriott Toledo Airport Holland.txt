Courtyard by Marriott Toledo Airport Holland
Rating: 3
Text: Nice room. Courtyard view with a balcony. Housekeeping needs more training. No clean towels were given on a daily basis, unless requested. Sheets on bed were not changed, but the bed was made daily at least. Not what I would expect from any Marriott property. Pool was nice but it was freezing in the pool area, had to go outside to warm up and almost run to our room before we froze. Front desk was always nice. Marcus at the front desk was great.

Text: We stayed for just one night and the room was very clean and comfortable. We were upgraded to a suite, which was a pleasant suprise. The bed was a little hard and the pillows a bit too soft for my preference. That may just be me, however, as my fiance slept very well. I couldn't sleep, so I spent most of the night on the loveseat and read for several hours before heading to bed. The view facing inward towards the courtyard was beautiful and well kept. When visiting family in the area this is our go-to hotel. Definitely would recommend and will return in the future. Staff was also very nice and helpful. Also, we did not get any food at the restaurant there, but have in the past the couple dozen times we've stayed before. The food has always been very good! A nice plus for breakfast or a late night snack.

Text: It's a standard Marriott hotel. The staff were efficient and polite. The room was nothing special but it was clean. I stayed one night and it was perfect for that purpose.

Text: Absolutely amazing view and setup inside the middle courtyard. I had 3rd floor balcony and loved it. Interior design is a little dated but nothing disappointing. I'll be back next time for sure.
