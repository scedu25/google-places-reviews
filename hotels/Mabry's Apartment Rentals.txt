Mabry's Apartment Rentals
Rating: 1
Text: DO NOT rent from this person the apartments are extremely below standard. When I rented an apartment from the Mabry group I immediately realized the substandard living in the apartments. I really felt like I was living in a 1950's   dorm room with old wood paneled walls and indoor outdoor carpet. There was NO SPACE even for a college student.  Within two months of living there (and with the roaches) I broke my rental agreement and moved out. 

There is a long list of problems with these rentors that I have heard about (horror stories). I am only stating my experience.

Text: We tried to look at an apartment when I was looking for housing in the area for school. The lady told us she might have something and to call her later. When we called back the guy told us to show up to get an application. When we get there he tells us we have to pay an app fee before he would even show us an apt. What a freak?! Never heard of that before. I later heard from a friend that he showed her an apt the day before without that BS and the place was a roach infested dump. Creepy landloards, dumpy apts. Look elsewhere, we found a nice place right on Main from an awesome landloard!
