Walnut Meadows Campground

Text: Needs work. Needs to be better maintained and needs improvements. Driveway washed out some spots have no water hook ups so they run you a bunch of water hoses. Landscape is very grown up and they don't mow or weed eat near campsites. Not a very good deal for the price. Sewer doesn't work properly. And it smells horrid. No laundry facility no pool.

Text: Was here Oct 2015, and back again because Joe and Nella and others in this little park are truly family.  Fair, friendly, safe, and certainly reasonable rates, stay as long as you like, and relaxed just like it was two years ago.  Not all sites have sewer, so check with Joe and Nella by phone and see what's available.  I have 40' coach and trailer, 60' stem to stern, no problem with length and sites are reasonably spaced apart so awnings and slides have plenty of room.  It feels like true family to me, and i'll stop back again next trip thru Barea.  Thanks ,, jmb

Text: Very wonderful group of people. Nella and Joe will help accommodate any situation that should arrise. Lots of clean spaces,  nice bath house with showers, and a laundry room that was also well kept. Would highly recommend this campground. Very laid back atmosphere, with a lot of family morals. Thank you for the experience!
