La Quinta Inn Davenport & Conference Center

Text: For the most part it was fine. Beds were comfortable. Needs a make over pretty bad but I heard that they are starting renovations very soon. Staff was very nice. Breakfast was nice but no gravy for the biscuits. If you are going to have biscuits then have gravy too. Many people were upset that there was no gravy and ended up throwing the biscuits in the trash.

Text: The room was clean when we got there. But it seemed old and needed updating. The hotel had a decent work out room, coin laundry, and what looked like a nice pool. The breakfast had a lot of options. My only complaint was when they cleaned, they only switched out the towels. They didn't do the bed, vacuum the floor or refresh the soaps. Stuff I've come to expect as normal when staying for more than one night.

Text: Extremely nice staff.  Decent place and nice clean rooms.  They are about to undertake extensive remodeling.

Text: Unbeatable for the price. We had our two dogs with us for no extra charge or hassle. We only had to sign a form. The bed, furniture, and shower were great, as was the staff but it would've been nice to have another person at the front desk as there was a line from time to time. The faucet was leaky and the room arrangement was a bit funky as the bed was not aligned with the tv and entertainment center. Great, easy stay though and we will be staying there again.

Text: I appreciate that La Quinta is always consistent. It's not the Hilton, but the rooms are always clean and comfortable. There is nearly always a continental breakfast. This La Quinta was no different. Clean, comfy, affordable, breakfast.
