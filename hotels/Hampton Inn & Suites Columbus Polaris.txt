Hampton Inn & Suites Columbus Polaris
Rating: 5
Text: Excellent hotel with amazing customer service and hospitality! The complimentary breakfast was one of the best, along with fresh hot coffee all day long and cookies at the front desk. The woman who checked us in was so sweet and helpful and our room was very quiet and comfortable. The hotel is situated very close to a ton of shops and restaurants, including a huge mall half a mile away and lots of walking trails and parks. It's also a short drive to downtown Columbus. Couldn't have asked for a better stay, would highly recommend it!

Text: We had an amazing stay here at the Hampton Inn in Columbus. The interior was beautiful, and the beds were really comfortable. We loved every minute and slept great. The breakfast bar was open til 10am and they offered breakfast on the go in baggies which I thought was an awesome idea. 

The staff was kind and helped us get checked in quickly. We will for sure be back!

Text: The best Hampton Inn I’ve ever stayed in. Clean, quiet room with comfortable pillows and great water pressure.  There was a nice pool and a good breakfast spread as well.  The staff seemed friendly.  The hotel is just off the 71 near a lot of shopping centers and restaurants.  I had business at Ohio State University, which was a 25 minute drive during rush hour.

Text: This hotel has a bed and breakfast feel - very welcoming. The room is clean and comfortable. This hotel is convenient to suburban shopping areas and corporate parks. The breakfast/lounge area was very cozy this morning. The staff do an excellent job keeping the breakfast area stocked and cleaned. We had a corporate team meeting at the hotel for about 20 people with a u-shaped table layout. It was the perfect size with refreshments and room for our catered lunch. The hotel provided a projector and everything was ready well ahead of our meeting time.

Text: The hotel was very nice. I was a little disappointed that the hot tub was out of order. The rooms were clean and very nice. The thermostat did seem to be messed up and the day in the bathroom didn't work. The breakfast area was great. Great selection, plenty of room, and plenty of seating.
