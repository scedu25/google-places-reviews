Hampton Inn & Suites Scottsburg
Rating: 5
Text: We were displaced due to hurricane Irma. They have went above and beyond to help us and accommodate our needs.  I would very highly recommend the Hampton inn in Scottsburg Indiana. We stayed in a suite with kitchen, room is clean, staff is very friendly,  wifi with 3 computer's going so we can work remotely has been stable. Our family just cannot express our gratitude to this place enough and the free cookies are yummy and a great bonus.

Text: The day before arriving here, we checked in at 9:15 on the app and was able to pick the exact room we wanted. We stayed here for four days during the event and had an absolute excellent stay. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, with an excellent selection of items to choose from, including hot waffles.  The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating in every way. The rooms were well maintained, clean and secure.  On Sunday,  we checked out with several others at 9:15 and we're on our way home.   We will certainly be back here next year.

Text: Room smelled of smoke upon entrance, even though we got a no smoking room, but price was fairly reduced due to the smell. Suite was large, otherwise clean, and the entire staff was incredibly nice. Wonderful stay, highly recommended, and overall very positive experience. Hopefully will stay again.
