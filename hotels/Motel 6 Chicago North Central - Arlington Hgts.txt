Motel 6 Chicago North Central - Arlington Hgts
Rating: 5
Text: Super easy check-in. The grounds are a little sketchy at night. Once inside it's definitely a great value. Mainly due to the cleanliness of the rooms. There is no carpet, no heavy nasty bedspreads, no bedskirts. Those are all great pluses, especially because this is a pet friendly location. There is nothing worse than going in to a room that smells like dog pee.
I highly recommend for the economy traveler!!

Text: One of the better Motel 6. Well kept, we'll maintained. Would come back for another stay. 

They don't get 5 stars simply because about 85% of the time I would come out the side door  (I have a dog and asked for easy in/out access), there would be a gang of people there and it made me feel rather unsafe. There are no security cameras and at least 90% of the time, these people were either drinking or drugging or both. 

My last night there was a sleepless one since there was a party going on all night out on the door stoop. I was concerned for my safety so I didn't say anything to the front desk. Those people would probably have known it was me complaining.

Text: Nice and friendly staff! The room was immaculate! Better than any Motel 6 I've stayed in thus far! The color and decor was exactly like the website.photos. The location was nice and quaint....Nestled in a beautiful area with ample amount of restaurants surrounding.

Text: You forgot to leave the light on as you advertise. Very basic room. Surprised it even had a TV. It was clean overall and overnight stay was peaceful. Staff was friendly and helpful. Short wait to get room key. Good value overall.

Text: I'd like to say I was very satisfied with my stay at this motel. Veronica and staff were very helpful for my needs and service. I also have to say I was impressed in how clean the room was, like new. The cleaning staff does a great job! If in the area in the future this I will stay at this motel.
