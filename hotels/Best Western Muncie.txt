Text: Clean, comfortable place to stay. Staff is friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and seems to be recently  updated. Rooms are good size and have everything you need to a wonderful stay. Pool area looked wonderful but we did not have a chance to swim. Breakfast is wonderful. They offer a large choice of breakfast items and even have a pancake machine.

Text: Jared and the rest of the staff are wonderful.  They are kind and extremely helpful.  Our group definitely feels welcome and at home every year when we stay for Ball State Homecoming.  We will never change hotels.  I only wish the price hadn't gone up this year.

Text: The hotel staff and rooms were wonderful. We stayed here twice during the week. The kids loved the pool, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and Kathy who makes breakfast took the time to talk to us and make sure we were welcome.
