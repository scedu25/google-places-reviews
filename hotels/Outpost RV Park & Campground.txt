Outpost RV Park & Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Located roughly two and a half miles from Cave Run Lake, the Outpost Campgrounds offers affordable camping and RV lots with or without power. It's home to very close knit community of regulars that are more than friends they are family. 
There is a pool, bathrooms, showers, and a laundromat on the campground as well as a store. There is also a small playground for children.
They have a great fireworks display near July 4th, and decorate the campground during Halloween. 
There are fun activities for young and old during Halloween like a haunted house, hay rides, after dark some haunted hayrides, and there is a dinner and trick or treating for the kids.

Text: The owner and the regulars are very nice people.  It's a quite campground currently with alot of longterm pipeline workers.  They are quite as well. The pool is not in operation and the bathrooms are old but fairly clean.
