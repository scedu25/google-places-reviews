Paxton Inn Motel

Text: Nice no frills motel. They allowed me to stay there with my 3 well-behaved dogs. There is a good sized grassy area for dog walking. Please be sure to pick up after your pet so this motel remains dog friendly. A restaurant is close by but I didn't eat there.

Text: For alittle off the highway motel this fits the bill!!  Very clean which is my most important feature. The couple that owns it is very nice.  Went to the Harvest Moon drive in then stayed here so wouldn't have to drive home late.  PERFECT!!

Text: Good cheap rate, but good enough for a one night stay over. Pretty decent for a motel off the highway by a small town. Even has a spectacularly clean mini fridge, which i haven't had at some high class hotels

Text: Cheap hotel, so you get what you paid for. I'm all for saving money and understanding this phrase, but this place was worse than super 8. Some rooms are worse than others. Mine had mold in the bathroom and the floor in the sink area was coming up off the ground. Definitely wear socks/shoes in the room as the floors are gross. Wifi also sucked, kept losing connection.

Text: Clean and fairly well maintained room. There are a lot worse out there that charge more. Earlier on same trip stayed at a Super 8 and the ants in the room were numerous.
