Hampton Inn Corbin

Text: This stay was a mixed bag.  First, I always check in online and choose my room.  This was not available and they placed us on the side of the hotel next to the highway (noise).  Second, we are very long time Hilton Honors members but were not so greeted.  That information is on the reservation and Hilton prides itself in acknowledging their loyal customers but in reality it seldom happens.  Third, I did not sleep well because the bottom sheet did not fit the bed and kept popping off all night.  I am unaccustomed to re-making the bed all through the night.  Fourth, the bathroom tiles were very white and clean but the grout, wide lines, was black around the toilet and tub and more beige around the rest of the floor.   Clean, maybe, but visually very unappealing. We had a super stay at a Hampton in Bristol, VA the night before, so this stay was disappointing by the standards we have come to expect from Hampton Inns.

Text: Incredibly friendly service that makes you feel like family when you arrive. Breakfast buffet is comprehensive with something for everyone. Hot and fresh plus great tasting coffee. Cleanest hotel I have seen on a long time.

Text: My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn after watching a performance at Renfro Valley. The lady at front desk was very friendly and professional. Room was very clean.  Breakfast was also good ! Would definitely recommend staying here. A little pricey for one night stay but guess u get what u pay for !

Text: It appears the hotel was built in 2009 and although it is starting to show some wear , all was good. At this point we've been on the road for nearly 2 weeks and we finally had a best sleep of this trip and that's all that matters. Those bed sheets are great.

Text: Really friendly staff! Hotel itself could use a few updates and the bed was too firm, but everything was clean. Overall it was a good experience.
