Text: After a last minute decision to take an extra night coming home from New York, limping in pain through the front door, cold and wet fron the rain, (embarrassingly enough, crying),  the staff and (I'm assuming?) another hotel guest, took a moment to remind me that there are still kind, decent people in the world. My faith in humanity dwindles at times, and it's nice to encounter other compassionate souls along my journey. Thank you, kind sirs, for the reminder, and the comfy accommodations.
