Text: Beware employees are extremely rude. Not the most safe place. They don't require proper ID when trying to check in. There's been at least one suicide in this place. They threw the person's possessions away without even asking the family if they wanted them. Would not recommend for anyone. Sleep in your car at the Walmart parking lot you're better off
