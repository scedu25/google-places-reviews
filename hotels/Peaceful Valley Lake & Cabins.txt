Text: This place is amazing. Beautiful cabins, spectacular scenery and as the name implies it is remarkably peaceful. The owners Rose and Tim treat you like family and their attention to detail is impeccable. Each cabin is unique and has it's own theme. Making each time staying at Peaceful Valley a new experience. This is the second time we've gone this year and will definitely be back.

Text: Great place to relax, fish, and enjoy family time. The owner is a terrific host and the cabins are very well equipped with everything you need - just bring meat and veggies - condiments were supplied. 
Highly recommend this place. ?

Text: Cabin was very nice. It was very scenic and away from everything. Caught plenty of blue gill in the private lake.
