La Quinta Inn & Suites North Platte

Text: Standard continental breakfast, good quality I felt. Deb and Tiffany were the attendants who served me, Tiffany checked me in and made sure I got the military discount which I appreciated. Deb was very tentative setting up the breakfast lounge. Also my cat stayed for free. The room was nice, but my one grievance of the entire experience was that my room had a funny smell. Not unbearable, just something I noticed but I still give them 5 stars.

Text: Easy to get to hotel and restaurants. Ate at Whisky Creek Grille...excellent food and service! At hotel, workers were very helpful, especially Deb, in breakfast area. So happy to see gluten free bagels! (I'm gluten free.) Wish all hotels would think of us. :-)

Pets are aloud, although I don't have one. 
The breakfast bar is well stocked and there is plenty of room for groups to sit.

Text: Service was really great. Front person was flexible with our checkin time. Room was clean and very spacious. Front desk gave me a free toothbrush and toothpaste because I forgot mine. Pool was awesome. Only problem was that the hot tub had NO chlorine. I tested it with test strips I carry. That was only dissappointment. The hotel also provided

Text: We have stayed at la quintas for the last three nights with our two dogs traveling 3000 miles across the country.  This is by far the nicest and most up to date. Great location and staff was very nice. Will put this on our favorite list. Great dog area both in side fenced area and open South of hotel. Very clean. Thank you. Will be back. !!
