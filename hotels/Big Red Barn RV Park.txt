Text: Maiden voyage with new 5th Wheel. Richard was super assisting us at check in, with our 1st set up and checked up and made sure everything was going well through our stay. Made sure we buttoned up as we left. Super 1st time experience. Sites were great, facilities well maintained. Will return every time in that direction.

Text: Great RV park. Quite, level gravel lots, trees, each spot has picnic table. Friendliest people on the planet.  Will make this a permanent travel stop.

Text: Once before I gave this park a great review and have stayed here many times.  I wonder if it changed hands or management because the guy that checked me in didn't listen to a thing I said or the request I had put in my on-line reservation request. I am a disabled vet and have difficulty walking, I had asked to be on a particular side of the park (big open grass field) to make it easy to walk the dogs and my first spot was on the opposite side of the park so I verbally asked for that side of the park so I could easily walk the dogs. He moved me to another spot still on the wrong side of the park. Then he went through all the rules and asked if I had pets? (I just asked to be moved to walk the dogs!) He made a point of telling me he had just added some doggy doodoo stations in specific area. So I am on the far side and will half to walk clear across the park to let my bigger dog do his business. I did get a Veterans discount but I had to prove I was a veteran with a DD214 or Retired ID.

Text: We really enjoyed our stay here!! The bath houses are clean and they offer laundry facilities. There's space to walk dogs and the entire park is organized well! Spots are level and hookups are placed nicely. There's a concrete walkway along the side.ofnthe door camper. Although the spaces are gravel they are nice and packed. Easy in and easy out. Were impressed.  Offer 30% military discount!! The staff is very friendly!
