Text: Had a GREAT stay. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and modern-things I look for. The room I was in also had a joining room, that is a big plus too bad they didn't note that on the website maybe I missed it. We needed that but my other son slept on the couch which was big and room enough he didn't even have to pull out the couch will be back again. Pool was on the smaller side along with the gym room but all good.  A very small little bar for drinks. The breakfast no complaints. Would recommend.

Text: Typically I stay up the street when I am visiting for work, but thought I would try out HP.  So glad I did!  Staff incredibly welcoming and friendly throughout my three night stay.  The property is clean and maintained, the rooms big.  They have complimentary breakfast, as well as dining options throughout the day and a bar in the lobby.  My room was on the second floor, I never heard a peep and had great sleep quality.  Would stay again for sure!

Text: Clean and comfy. Room was great. Even the sofa bed was comfy. Only thing I didn't like was the size of the bathroom. Pulled the door over my toes several times. Breakfast was ok. Friendly staff that put up with us till early in the morning. Wedding party with a block of rooms. They were great. Would stay again
