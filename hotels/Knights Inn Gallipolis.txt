Text: This place is run by the nicest family ever! They have so much pride and work so hard to maintain a beautiful place for guests to be! It's always a great experience for my mom and I so, I wouldn't ever stay anywhere else! It's a great price for a great stay! Thanks for all your hard work! It will never go unnoticed!!!

Text: I give it 5 starts because its perfect as a hotel and the staff are super nice and accommodating. Every morning there are mini muffins, cereal and fresh fruit.
It is not a Hilton but its great. When one is on vacation one tends to not need a Hilton. If one stayed in their room all day watching the Tele then you probably should have spent vacation at home where its free.
Definitely would stay again.

Text: Fully adequate budget hotel. Clean, decent room. Had a "dorm room" feel. Not all that cozy, but clean and maintained. 

Recently, partially renovated room (bathroom was still old). 

Quiet, safe area. Easily accessible from the highway. 

Cold cereal, coffee, fruit and waffles for the free breakfast. 

Neighboring room noise was quite pronounced (bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper). 

Staff was very friendly. Would stay here again, but would shop around first.

Text: Went in late for a quick sleep so we could get back on the road again. Comfy beds and clean rooms. No carpet on the floors that looked nice and much cleaner than many places with carpet! My kids likes the many channel selections. Super friendly staff! We didn't make it to breakfast so can't comment on that part. Overall great place.

Text: Honest, friendly, clean and affordable. We won't hesitate to stay here again. Just don't book through online search it will cost more and they will pressure you to book. Told us only 1 room left and was 87$. Got there and found they actually had 4 rooms with a king bed and if we walked in cost would have been 59$ plus tax.
