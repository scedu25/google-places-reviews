Text: We had a wonderful stay at this historic bed and breakfast!

Doris made us feel right at home, and even brought us fresh baked cookies in the evening.  We were in the area doing genealogy research of our family.  She shared some local history books with us that were very helpful and knew a few people for us to contact.  

After a restful nights sleep, we were treated to a delicious breakfast. We will be returning to this lovely B&B and Doris' hospitality!

Text: We stayed in the June room and it was comfortable. Really enjoyed visiting with Doris a real kindred spirit with my wife. Great breakfast. We hear she has many repeat visitors that come from afar.

Text: We recently stayed there on a recent visit to MO.
The place is great. The room was super nice and the food was outstanding.
The screened-in porch on the second floor and the patio were great places to relax.
The hostess provided great information on local attractions.
Will stay here on our next trip.
