Text: Fine place to sleep for the night. Hotel showed some wear and tear and the room wasn't as clean as I would have liked. It was quite and had a nice kitchenette.

Text: Service is prompt, rooms are clean, enough room for a family of six at a reasonable price - something which is not terribly easy to find in Lincoln, for whatever reason. Furniture in suite quite worn down, though, and decor very dated. Definitely felt budgety, but sufficient.

Text: I travel a lot and this hotel exceeded my expectations. Liya, at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful.  This is the only hotel I could find with an outdoor pool and it's very nice and clean. The room was clean and the bed was comfy!  There is also a kitchen in the rooms...so convenient!!  There was beer, wine, a salad bar and a mashed potato bar for dinner when I arrived!  Very wide variety of breakfast items as well. And all for $120 a night!!!!

Text: Very presentable. Friendly staff. Great morning breakfast. The amenities are sufficient. Only reason it does not get 5 stars is because after I took my shoes off and walked around in my white socks all evening in my room, the bottoms of my socks or rather dirty.

Text: The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The pool area was nice, and the staff was attentive. The breakfast was very good as well. This was our first time at a Staybridge and we will definitely choose it again.
