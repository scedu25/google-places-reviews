Lodge at Mark Twain Lake
Rating: 5
Text: Staying at the lodge was like staying at a friends house!  Easy conversations, warm hospitality, clean room and great breakfast.  Enjoyed the view too...watching the sunset  and listening to birds - especially the bobwhites!

Text: Spectacular off season stay at the lodge. From the delicious home-cooked breakfast to the quiet that surrounds the lodge it was one of the highlights of my trip to Missouri. There is a spectacular view of the  sun coming up from the lodge's upstairs balcony if you rent that room. The hosts are fun and immediately make you feel welcome.
