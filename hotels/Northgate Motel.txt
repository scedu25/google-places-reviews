Text: I stayed 2 nights, Room was  clean. They also have Free WI - FI Internet. Most important they have full cable tv, not just few channels.

Text: We had no other option but to stay here after our neighbors apartment caught on fire. I would rate it less, if that was an option. Its dirty. The employees/ especially the owner and his wife are rude. We had problems with bugs. And we weren't allowed any company, not that we wanted any in that filthy place. My worst experience at a hotel/motel I've ever had.

Text: Very rude people. Motel has a very bad ant infestation. They show you no respect! Wifi is always down. Cleanliness is very questionable. Do not come here especially if you're visiting family because they're not allowed to visit you. You can not have any company.
