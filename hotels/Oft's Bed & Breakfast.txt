Text: Gordon and Linda are fabulous hosts. This was my first time ever staying at a B&B and they certainly established a very high bar. It is hard to fathom that anyone else could top their hospitality. The house and room were beautiful. Extremely kind and gracious hosts!

Text: We stayed for one night at Oft's house and they were a very nice couple!  When we parked our car; immediately Gordy came to help with our bags and walked us through the entire house and told us what was available to us to use and so forth.  The house was very quiet and peaceful all around the home.  We loved learning more about the couple and the breakfast they made was amazing!!

Text: We stayed with Gordon and Linda in late September after flying into Omaha to start a road trip to south Nebraska to learn more about Willa Cather.  We were the only guests in the house and enjoyed an introduction to the well-documented history of Gordon and his family's multi-generational tenure in the house. They encouraged us to have supper at a quirky neighborhood restaurant-pizza parlor across the street and it was a great slice of local life as well as pizza. We had such a great visit that we arranged to stay with them a week later on our way back home.  They are great folks, serve a wonderful breakfast and keep the cleanest old home I have ever seen.  I highly recommend Offt's B&B.

Text: My wife and I were looking for something special to do to celebrate our 5th Anniversary and we certainly found it at Oft's Bed & Breakfast!  Gordon and Linda were wonderful and we instantly fell in love with the place!  Starting with the kind instructions on how to locate them, to the roses and card from them that we found in our room upon arrival.  I love old homes... particularly those "someone else" has lovingly restored.  I saw architectural details in this home I've never seen anywhere else.  Of course, with all the necessary modern conveniences that we require today!  We'll definitely be back to visit this special getaway!
