Cuivre River Campground
Rating: 3
Text: Low cost and spacing on most campsites was good. A few spaces weren't as well spaced/located though. Downside is they don't enforce quiet hours (10p-6a) or other camp rules well. Group nearby us was up until well after midnight playing music and being loud. It's the luck of the draw as most people there seemed to follow the rules and be respectful. Also bathroom facilities could use some work/basic maintenance. The clip lock on the men's bathroom was broken off so there was no way to lock the door and there's no light so no way to know if someone is in there or not. Overall, I would stay there again, but campground could use some improvements.
