Text: Friendly staff. Room was clean. The area is kind of secluded not much to see or do. You have to drive out to the malls. The strip had plenty of fast food and red lobster next door. Downtown is about 20min  away

Text: Very nice hotel. We stayed two weekend nights. Pool, exercise room, lobby were all very nice. Staff was great! Only complaint is the free breakfast food. All carbs, high sugar products. Not good for those of us who can't eat this way. At least one morning there were cheese omelets, but I suspect there was pancake batter in them. By blood sugar readings were too high. *sigh*. Yes, I know it was free, so i shouldn't complain.

Text: Location was just right. The room was clean and well decorated. It had everything you might need, for a day or a week. The decor was modern and had enough available outlets for charging your electronics. Breakfast was great, had a hot option and it wasn't just cereal and pastries. There were omlettes with peppers and meat, sausage, potatoes and fruit. Every thing was delicious. My only complaint is that the lights seemed really dim at all points of the day in the main hallway.

Text: Typical Hampton It is visible from the road. I only saw the lobby and small conference room. Lobby was comfortable, but small. They had a computer and desk area located in the same space. There was a sign saying breakfast was offered in the mornings. The location is reasonably close to the airport and Magic Mountain entertainment. There isn't much else of traveling interests in the area unless you're visiting family. Seems OK for smaller meetings.
