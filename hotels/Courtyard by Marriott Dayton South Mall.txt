Text: Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. No free coffee on the morning but they do have a Starbucks. Just renovated. Easy to get in and out.

Text: The cleaning staff did not change the Sheets, but re-made the bedding? with the soiled sheets. I'd expect better from a supposedly better hotel. I am disappointed with my stay here and don't nor won't recommend this location

Text: Decent hotel. The room was clean but a little out dated. It was nice to have a small balcony overlooking the courtyard.

Text: It has been a very comfortable stay. Everything was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was good but a little pricy. Wish it was complementary. Other than that everything has been great, very nice to get away. One thing that we couldn't ignore though was the staff. Everyone that we came into contact with was rude and did not seem to care about our well being at all. The cleaning lady was really sweet as well as Becky, the front desk lady that checked us in. Everyone else, even some guy I spoke with over the phone, was kind of disrespectful. Good thing we are easy going people (:
