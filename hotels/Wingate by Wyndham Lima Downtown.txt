Text: Most of you know that some people just like to complain.... Take that into consideration as you read some of these reviews. I am a traveling dueling piano player and I stay several nights a week in hotels. This hotel is reality great for the money. Centrally located to downtown festivities and the consumer service was very satisfactory. Are there nicer hotels, yes! However, for the money this hotel is on point. No complaints here and I would right the negative reviews off as just negative people. Enjoy your stay if you should decide to spend a night here.

Text: We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, August 4-6, 2017.  Four rooms were used by our family.  Our previous stay was in 2013.  The property is now showing several signs of deferred maintenance:  only one of the two elevators was working and had been out of service for several weeks we were told; the carpet in the hallways was overdue for cleaning and repairs; our rooms had only been partially cleaned upon check-in, with dirty floors and bathrooms noted.  This could be a lovely place with some investment in upgrades and diligence in housekeeping.  But as it is, it is tired and worn looking.  We were sadly disappointed.
