Text: Just had our wedding here! We used the main venue and we stayed in both cabins while we were there. It was such a beautiful place. The cabins have nice walking trails that our photographer loved and got great pictures at.

The cabins were large enough to fit the entire wedding party, guys in one cabin, girls in the other. Cabin 2 also had 2 bathrooms which aided the girls getting ready in the mornings. 

Jana, the manager / owner was very easy to work with and helped reassure our day went smoothly.

Text: These are great people to stay with. Friendly, accomodating and clean. That meets my criteria! Newer homes with good clean appliances, furniture and bathrooms. I almost hate to give them a review. I want to keep it for myself!
