The Southern Hotel

Text: Perfect every time!  We had the Quilt Room this time on the third floor and there aren't elevators so if you have an issue climbing stairs, you should ask for a second floor room.  We loved the gardens before dark and after...  after dark, we were able to enjoy a romantic stroll in candle light.  So beautiful!  The breakfast was, as usual, so delicious and we very much enjoyed talking with other guests as well as the owners, Mike and Kathy.  Mike is so knowlegable about the history as well!

Text: Beautiful place, the owners have put their hearts and souls into it. Kathy's breakfasts are incredible. I mean, next level cooking here. The hotel is right near everything, so walking the town is very convenient. We will definitely be back!

Text: Amazing space with a great garden. Stayed 3 nights. The owners have created a gem for those that like to stay in a historic place rich in local texture.  Wonderful hosts. Tasty good and fresh food. Right in the center of a beautiful town.  Easy street parking even during eclipse weekend.

Text: Lovely property, beautifully decorated with real antiques, but the real treasures are the hosts.  We were last minute reservations since foul weather delayed our camping weekend, and Mike and Cathy could not have been more gracious and kind.  Lovely dining room and sitting rooms on the main floor.  Delicious breakfast.  They've thought of everything - real pros.
