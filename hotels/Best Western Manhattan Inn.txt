Best Western Manhattan Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean and bug free. Mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in room. Didn't like that the sink was outside of bathroom. Heated pool. Breakfast was good with a variety to choose from. They even had almond milk!

Text: This is a hotel for a low budget stay. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Location is not the best.

Text: I have stayed at the Best Western during many different trips to Manhattan and it has become my first choice any time I'm here. The staff is always incredible, my room has always been immaculate, and the breakfast isn't too bad either. Only downside is that it is a ways from campus.

Text: Great hotel and staff, both at check in and check out as well as breakfast. Overall a good experience  everything you expect: good food, good tv, pleasant staff,  cold a/c, hot water fast, and clean sheets and pillow cases.  The mattresses were are the reason I didn't give them 5??'S. They just weren't quite comfortable and had hard edges for some reason. Almost every BW I stay in has great mattresses. Just not what I expected to experience.
