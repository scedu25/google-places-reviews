Text: Nice hotel, not bad for price. The room smelled a touch, the guest before had probably smoked in it, but wasn't bad, just aired it out a bit and l didn't notice the smell after a couple minutes. Otherwise, the room looked clean, no bugs. The pool was closed up even though it didn't say so online which kind of stunk. But the hotel staff were very nice and helpful. It had a very nice bar connected that had plenty of seating, very nice bar tender, great food and drinks, and pool tables. Breakfast was simple but nice, and was ready at 6:30 when I went down. Overall I was happy with my stay

Text: We had a positive overall experience we did have some raccoons that came into the dumpsters out back that was kind of our entertainment for the night, there were probably about 10-15 of of them but they were pretty cool to watch and the baby really like them

Text: Nothing fancy but rooms are clean and comfortable. There is an airport shuttle, restaurant onsite, free parking and close to highway. Great value for price. No elevator.
