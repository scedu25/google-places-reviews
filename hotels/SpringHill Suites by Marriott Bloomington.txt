SpringHill Suites by Marriott Bloomington
Rating: 5
Text: Staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though they were booked solid they were able to switch our original reservation from a single king to a double queen room. I left some clothing items upon departure and after calling them the items were sent out quickly to my home via UPS. The bar is open late. The breakfast is a good variety of choices including scrambled eggs, waffles, cheese omelets, a southwestern blend of sausage, potatoes & peppers you can put in a tortilla, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, fresh fruit and bagels all on a buffet style self serve counter.

Text: Excellent service, clean nicely maintained rooms. What can I say. This was an excellent experience.

Normally I give a 3-4 star review for any Marriott property, because they're pretty consistent. The staff here really put my family's stay here top notch. My wife and three young children were with me on this particular stay. The young kids normally seem to scare off or fluster hotel staff, but in this case everyone we interacted with was outgoing and particularly friendly... to the point that my children (who are experienced travelers at 3, 7, and 9 years old) specifically asked if we could come back to this hotel specifically in the future.

Text: A great destination for a weekend excursion or short stay.  Breakfast is available on site and the location is convenient for other food choices or options.  It is within walking distance of everything in the downtown area.  If you are like me, the nature trails nearby will be an added plus.  This jewel is just waiting for you or your group.  Come on;  go out and explore!
