Hill Street Motel
Rating: 5
Text: My parents stayed here for one night and they had a good time. The room was clean with 2 very good double beds and with a nice bathroom.
You can make your own coffee in the room or go to the minimarket at the gazstation and enjoy the vanilla. A fine place for one or more nights!
