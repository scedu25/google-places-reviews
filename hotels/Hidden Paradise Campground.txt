Hidden Paradise Campground

Text: Don't go. We went there and you couldn't get in. The sign was faded and the road was small  and skinny. We were right next the rushing river. It was hard on a T.V. or camper for driving on the gravel road. It takes you through a resedental area with kids toys on the road. 
When you finally get in hundreds of stray cats run around. Finally you pull into a spot and almost hit all your neighbors slides. It is so crowded and over priced and you can't even find your hookups

Text: Very nice very clean, however over booked!!! Be prepared to be nickel and dimed. Booked and charged for two cites but only received one, the other was booked by another camper who also booked two cites and paid full price. We ended up sharing the cite due to nice campers but the owners never responded to the complaint nor fixed the payment issue.

Text: Unique camping cite. They keep it clean and the staff is friendly. They charge for absolutely everything which is different than State Parks, but prices are fairly reasonable. They do patrol the area for security which is nice. Overall pretty good place to camp.
