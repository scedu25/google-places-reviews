AmericInn Hotel & Suites Des Moines Airport
Rating: 5
Text: It's conveniently located close to the airport, restaurants and grocery store. I found a healthy meal at the grocery store and was able to take it back to the motel. Since they serve a free breakfast in the morning, I was able to get plasticware and a plate so I could eat my meal. It is a short walk if you didn't rent a car at the airport. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The beds were very comfortable and the fridge was very spacious. Enjoyed my overnight visit.

Had a microwave in our room and a descent size TV to watch, along with a fridge and free Wi-Fi!!! Beds were nice!!! Also loved the priced they offered compared to the other motels around here that were $25 more!!! Nice pool and hot tub! Good vending machines and soda machines!!!

Text: Easy to find, but yet back off of busy Fleur Drive. The rooms and the actual hotel were very clean.
