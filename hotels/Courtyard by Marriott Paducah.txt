Courtyard by Marriott Paducah

Text: It was a nice room, a bit smaller executive suite than expected. They were nice, however there was no complementary breakfast. Having children that was a bummer. The pool was small as well, but the outdoor sitting area is beautiful.

Text: The receptionist was very friendly and my entire check-in took less than 2 minutes. My room was very large and smelled super clean when I came in. The water pressure was fantastic (always a concern of mine). I was travelling for business just for one night so I didn't spend much time in the lobby/bar area but it looked very nice. The hotel is separate enough that you don't feel like a tourist and right across the road from a cute little pond. However, it is close enough to plenty of restaurants to make it convenient. Check out was just as easy as check in.

Text: We had an excellent visit at this location. Not only were the staff very attentive and engaging, they were also great with my dogs. Across the street was a little lake/pond with a walking path around it so it was a great little outside break. It was quiet and we were able to get plenty of rest.

Text: The front desk staff and the cafe staff were professional and courteous. We only had one issue while staying in room 227. The air conditioner worked, but sounded like a tractor starting every 5-10 minutes. Told the front desk upon check out. They said they would have it looked at.
