Night Inn Sweet Springs
Rating: 5
Text: Very nice motel.  Owners were very friendly.  Our room was large and even had a couch and coffee table.  Everything was very clean and nice.  Motel was easy to get to from the interstate but far enough away so it was very quiet.  We will stay here again when passing through MO.

Text: Denied room for having service animals. Offered more expensive room as a replacement and would not lower price to accommodate. Would not recommend.

Text: Summary: Best place to sleep with this price. Location is real good; 1 min from highway. The owner was very kind. The place seemed small, but rooms were perfectly clean and had everything we needed(well functioning water, air conditioner, fridge, microwave, free wifi&breakfast). One star deduct came because the breakfast was kinda light for me, but was still the best place I stayed during my cross-country trip.
