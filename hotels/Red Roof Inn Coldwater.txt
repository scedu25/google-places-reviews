Text: Pros:  Great location if you're broken down by the interstate and have to stay a day or two.  Within 200 yards of a Wal Mart, a large Chinese buffet, and a Buffalo Wild Wings.  The staff is also very nice.

Cons:  This hotel is very loud, and I don't mean because of loud customers on a particular night.  The doors to the rooms shut loudly.  They don't have that sort of hydraulic door stop that prevents doors from slamming loudly.  So all night it's doors slamming.  Also the walls are pretty thin.  

On the little things: The coffee maker in my room had no coffee pot.  When I brought this up I was offered coffee in the lobby but no replacement pot.  The bathroom had no trash can.  The shower is in a separate room than where the towels are kept and there is no towel rack or hanger in the shower area.  The beds are full size, not queen.
