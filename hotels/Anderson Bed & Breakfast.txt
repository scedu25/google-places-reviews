Text: Dawn and Phil do a great job and make you feel very welcome. The breakfasts they prepare are amazing. The Anderson B&B is very comfortable and a nice place to relax. We enjoy staying here and have visited three times now.

Text: Great atmosphere, fine hospitality, excellent food. This is your quintessential B&B. The historic house is has been upgraded with modern conveniences, but maintains the character of a 100 year old farm house. The location is perfect for a walk through campus or straight to Aggieville without the hassle of parking.

Text: The host's were nice, the house was very tidy but when they say a great place to watch birds they mean a great place to watch birds poop on your car... Omg, they should really remove the bird feeders. I parked there overnight and My vehicle was literally plastered, PLASTERED with bird crap. I'm talking 80-100 bird poops in like a 7-8 hour period, I then left, went to the car wash, returned and before my vehicle even came to a stop I took a deuce right the middle of the windshield. I won't lie I'm still a little steamed about it and this was a few months back in November. Ended up having to wash my car twice from a one night stay.
