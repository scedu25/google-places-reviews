Text: I stayed at this hotel a couple months ago and i have to say that have completely turned this hotel around.I immediatly noticed all the differences when i stayed there last week.  All the rooms have been completely renovated along with all the bathrooms. They have added an excellent breakfast bar and the restaurant is supposed to be starting soon. The location is perfect as it is right of I-70. This is where i will be staying when i visit St.Louis every 2 weeks.

Text: I've stayed in better but for the price they charged compared to the hotels around this was just fine. 
Clean sheets clean linen roomed looked good. 

They're still remodeling 

Quiet which is always good
