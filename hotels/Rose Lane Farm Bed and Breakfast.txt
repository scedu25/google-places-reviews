Rose Lane Farm Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed two nights. Rosetta and Stephen made us feel most welcome. Their accommodations are clean, private, comfortable, tasteful, and quiet. They are located between towns in Amish country on a beautiful and functioning farm. The free range eggs and sausage at breakfast were awesome, as was the entire menu - way more than we could ever eat. Rose Lane Farm is highly recommended, whether to visit the area or just passing through. THANK YOU, Rosetta and Stephen, for making our visit GREAT!
