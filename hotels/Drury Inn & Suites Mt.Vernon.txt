Text: We had the most amazing experience at this hotel. We always stay at a Drury Inn because of the customer service and how wonderful the hotel is. We'll never stay at another hotel besides a Drury but this hotel was above and beyond! Ron the manager was absolutely amazing! We ordered food and  he made sure we had everything we needed to have a nice sit down dinner with our family in their dining room at 10pm! He Didn't have to do that. This is going way above and beyond what he needed to do! Thank you Ron for allowing us to have a sit down dinner with our family really late. We had such a great dinner because of you! We also travel with a chocolate lab and they made him feel so welcome, and everyone loved him! He couldn't go anywhere without making a new friend. He's a part of our family too. Thank you Drury Inn for allowing dogs to stay at your hotels so our entire family could be together! This is the best hotel experience we've ever had. It's so clean, everyone is amazingly nice, the pool and patio area is amazing and there's always popcorn! Thank you again!

Text: I stayed at Drury Inn & Suites Mt. Vernon Thursday to Friday. The location was convenient. The room was very spacious. I stayed in a double queen room and requested a roll away bed. (roll away bed was 10 dollars extra charge) The pool was great had extended to an outdoor pool as well. There is even a hot tub. The included dinner food around 5:30 til 7 and soda and popcorn is a nice addition. Also they serve a decent breakfast. Only thing that I can think that could have made it any better would be to not charge extra for the roll away bed. Since extras aren't extra is their catch phrase.

Text: My cousins and I stayed here two nights for a family reunion in nearby Centralia. This was close to the interstate and easy to get to. The staff was very helpful with places to eat and shop and the amenities were exceptional. We'll definitely stay here again whenever we come back.
