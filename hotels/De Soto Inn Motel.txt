De Soto Inn Motel

Text: Smoking room smelled heavily like smoke, which is to be expected. They could clean underneath the beds and make sure their air conditioning units worked properly. Other than that I guess it was decent.

Text: I had to stay a couple days. It was nice for the price. But the walls are super thin. The people next door was having sex and they didn't invite me to join. Since i could hear everything anyway. Lok

Text: We stayed here because it was cheap, we were not expecting an amazing room or experience. The room was clean. The front desk person was pleasant. The walls are paper thin. We heard our neighbors talkinguntil 2am. We heard random people outside our door throughout the night. The pillows were not comfortable and the beds were hard. The area is safe.

Text: The location was perfect for my visit with my family (they live within walking distance). The price was good for the size of the room. My only complaint is the beds are hard.
