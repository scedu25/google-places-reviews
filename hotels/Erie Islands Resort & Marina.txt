Text: This place is the biggest joke ever!! We stayed three nights over Labor day weekend in the campground. Their website is FALSE IADVERTISING!! Hardly anything that they say they have is either "closed for scheduled maintenance" or was just plain not there.  The inside pool was cold, the hot tub was cold, the sauna was closed for "scheduled maintenance".  The outside pool was only filled half way up.  Weeds growing every where.  Wasps nests everywhere, including the electric boxes, not to mention all of the mosquitos at night.  So many that you couldn't sit outside at night.  It's clear that they don't spray for them.The isle ways are pitch black, no lighting at all.  Very unsafe! No one is ever in the "security office".  Always have to call the number for someone to meet you.  Never saw any security guards the entire time of our stay.  Linda is the one that checked us in and gave us fancy little paper bracelets to wear in the "rec" center. Not sure what that was all about. No one there to check them.  We stayed in section "A".  Over from where our sites were there was a fenced in area with a blue tarp over the fence except one side that the wind blew off.  We asked a worker what it was and he said that he was told it was a "pond under construction".  We took a walk over and read the signs that was posted on the tarp and it stated that it was under investigation.  It was a burned up RV camper with the charred remains.  That was VERY creepy!! Asked the man at the security shack to speak to a manager and he said he would send someone to our camper but no one showed up.  I called to speak to a manager after arriving home and the only person that will even return my calls is Linda.  Seems like they are trying to avoid us.  My next call will be made to the BBB.  For $58.00 per night and by looking at their website I was expecting a whole lot more.  If you are looking for a campground in the Port Clinton area keep on looking.

Text: This place seems like it used to be great. The management is very rude and price gouging - 10$ per person per day to use any of the facilities on the resort in addition to overpriced camping costs - and many of the facilities are closer look or open during very limited hours. Putt putt course is gone, horseshoe and volleyball courts are overgrown. Most of the toilets were "closed for maintenance" and every dumpster was overflowing with garbage. Beautiful land, just poor upkeep and management. Will not be coming back

Text: **STAY AWAY** These positive reviews are lies. They act as if this "resort" is high class, it's dirty, outdated and always dead. Don't waste your money here at all! Keep moving....The grounds are not kept up with, trash everywhere, the pool is nasty, trash all over, high prices for nothing, campground is in terrible shape and no one camps there. You've been warned!

Text: We belonged to the resort for about 20 Yrs.
We have paid an enormous amount of money
over the years. Now they tell us were SCREWED. I am going to pursue legal action.
We have been riped off big time. Not Happy.
Anyone who has had the same thing happen
To them we should get together and start a class action lawsuit. We have been RIPPED
OFF BIG TIME. I'M NOT GOING TO STAND
FOR IT.

Text: Does this review come with negative stars?! In 2009, my boyfriend and I went to Erie Islands on a Groupon. Ultimately we were sold a bill of goods, false promises and a bunch of lies! We should have ran when Joan, the manager, treated us like we were an inconvenience. Stupidly, we bought into the timeshare only to find out that "You must be stupid to believe what you are told!" according to Joan. We financed the timeshare partially through credit that they extended us and the rest through a credit card they opened for us. After several attempts to make accommodations at the resort, (with the price that we were quoted) there was always several excuses as to why those units were not available. On the two occasions that we were finally able to reserve a unit there were upcharges that we were never informed of prior to booking...linen charge, wifi charge and cleaning charge. We realized that this place was not what we expected. We tried NUMEROUS times to contact Joan (the manager) and were always promised a return call. The one time that she graced us with her callback, she was rude, condescending and the farthest from professional. Fastforward, three years, we have not been back to that deplorable place...unkempt accommodations, broken equipment and poor service. I hope this review helps people think twice before considering going to Erie Islands!
