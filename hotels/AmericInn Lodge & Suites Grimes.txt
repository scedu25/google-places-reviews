Rating: 5
Text: The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The lobby was clean and inviting. When we checked in, the front desk clerk informed us that our room had been upgraded. We were very surprised by that. The room was very clean and super comfortable. Breakfast was great! Loved this hotel and we will definitely revisit if the chance comes along.
