Text: Nice motel for the low cost. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was fine, and the wifi worked. We caught it the night before the solar eclipse so they were at capacity, but we booked in the morning and they were very friend and managed to swap us in to a non smoking room

Text: The wifi worked! Also the air conditioning was nice and fast. The bathroom was a little cramped but it wasn't terrible. In case it's important, the room had a door inside that could go into the next room.

Text: Simple motel.  Standard rooms,  house service is great but the breakfast is a little lacking.  It's being remodeled and the landscape make it very cozy. I will be recommending this place.

Text: Very clean and quiet.  Had a pleasant stay. Plus the owner is renovating. Has free WiFi.  They actually have three connections available depending on your room location. I've stayed here twice with no issue connecting to the internet on the two connections I used.  Note: they have a very basic breakfast on the weekends only, but restaurants are close.
