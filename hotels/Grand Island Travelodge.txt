Grand Island Travelodge
Rating: 4
Text: It's a typical Travelodge.   Parking is adequate, room had a microwave and small fridge which was a nice surprise.   Think the price of the room was a bit higher than it should have been but this was during the 2017 eclipse and hotels were charging higher than normal rates every where we looked.  Staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall, the hotel was as expected.

Text: Great location, quiet and comforting rooms with air conditioning. Timely and kind services. Expensive rooms for basic set ups. No extra features.

Text: My room was a bit dated, but clean and pfairly comfortable. There was a mini-fridge, which was a great convenience, as I was staying all week and wanted to be able to keep some food and drinks handy. Guest services were friendly and helpful. My only gripe was that I needed to get my key card re-scanned as it didn't let me into my room after a couple of trips in and out. Other than that, though, everything went smoothly.

Text: I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the traffic noise. If that doesn't bother you, this place is nice.

Text: I booked a five-night stay for a relative from out of town. The rooms and premises are clean and quiet (even on a weekend), neither of which is invariably the case for hotels/motels situated on S. Locust. The accommodations are without pretension but entirely adequate. The cost is eminently reasonable. Grand Island's Travelodge is a terrific value. I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is interested in an all-around decent place to stay and who can do without ostentation.
