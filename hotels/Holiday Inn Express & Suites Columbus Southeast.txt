Text: The front desk girls were really nice. We reserved a room that had a king bed and jacuzzi tub. When we checked in they gave us a room without a jacuzzi tub then switched us to a two room suit then told us that they had no rooms with jacuzzi tub.

Text: Room was fine, comfortable bed, a little dated. There was a pool party at the hotel when we arrived and kids were running back and forth to the elevator dripping water everywhere. However room was quiet so I was happy.

Text: We stayed there for a night while on a trip and the place was worth every penny. The rooms were tidy, restrooms were clean. They had good breakfast options as well. The lady at the reception was very welcoming and we enjoyed their service.

Text: Well the beds are comfortable and the gym is okay but don't bother using the Wi-Fi. You'd be better off using data than to let a video buffer at 144 quality.
