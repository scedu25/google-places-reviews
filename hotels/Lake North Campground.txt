Text: Super windy on the lake. Crowded sites, no clear sites, not enough grills or fire pits. No beach area. No place for kids to play around the camper area. Extremely close to the highway.

Text: Gravel parking with great areas right next to a man-made lake. Mostly RVs. Picnic tables, fire pits, grills, electricity, and primitive water spigots. Free camping. 

There is a major road running right past the campground and it is noisy. Shade trees, nice lake, swimming, pit toilets, no amenities. But we found no other camping in town.

Swimming, fishing, and watercraft allowed.

Unregulated camping, gravel parking lot, grass, picnic tables, grills, water, and electricity available. Camping is lakeside and free, but there is no ranger or camp host. The sites are shady with plenty of trees and pit toilets are available.

Some of the RVs parked there showed no activity, a a couple of them looked like they belonged to itinerant workers. We only stayed one night because I didn't feel comfortable leaving my tent and campware there during the day. It is along a nice bike trail, but otherwise somewhat isolated. Traffic noise was minimal at night. There is a children's playground.

Overall, not bad.
