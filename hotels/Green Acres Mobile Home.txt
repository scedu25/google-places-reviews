Text: Management is very friendly and helpful. This place is trying to show that living in a mobile home can be a pleasant experience. Prices are reasonable and they screen residents for criminal records. I highly recommend anyone looking for quiet country living checking this place out first.

Text: There is no way to contact the owner of the park that you are paying your rent for. The management at this park is the worst I or my neibors have ever seen...never even speaking to you only dropping off an occasional note taped to the door as they refuse to talk to anyone.
  I did give the park two stars as it is a great place to live and quit as well as no thef and very friendly neibors. Close to Fremont and Blair as well as school bus pick up at the drive...lot of great things here of management was changed
