The Burford House Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This has been one of the best places I have ever stayed in.  The owner is incredibly accommodating with your schedule, makes breakfast every morning, and checks in on you to make sure your stay is going smoothly.  The rooms are fantastic, and it is in a great area.  I will definitely be staying here the next time I am in the area.

Text: I had a wonderful stay at the Burford House Inn. The rooms are beautifully appointed and maintained. I stayed in the King Suite and just loved every minute. The bed was so comfortable! Delicious breakfast and always snacks and beverages available. The home is in a quiet and safe neighborhood, right across from a beautiful park, within walking distance of downtown, and has some street parking.  Mark is a gracious host. We had great chats about everything from real estate to bean soup recipes. He was very helpful, attentive, and friendly. If you are looking for a B&B in the Iowa City Area you should definitely stay at the Burford.
