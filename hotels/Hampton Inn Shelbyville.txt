Text: Everything about our stay was great. Breakfast food was delicious. Our room was clean and quiet. The pool and hot tub were relaxing though the pool could have been a tad bit warmer. Definitely would stay again. Friendly and welcoming

Text: They about killed me with carpet powder,  but I guess I'd rather smell that than a nasty stench that they were most likely covering up with it.  Carpet was very outdated so hopefully,  that will get renovated at some point.  The pool was nice and just the right amount of chlorine, but it was very cold! The staff was very friendly and courteous. Breakfast was good as well.
