Text: Nice campground for primitive camping.  We tent camped 3 nights there in July 2016.  The sites are gravel base and most have water and electrical hook ups, although we didn't use them.  The manager was really friendly and they have 3 friendly cats that follow you around sometimes.  
The bathrooms were really nice for a campground - decorated in country style, but clean and had hot water every day we were there.
There isn't a restaurant there anymore, unlike some outdated internet info, but that didn't bother us.  Price was similar as other places in the area and we enjoyed our stay.  Would definitely stay again or recommend.

Text: A nice play to stay.  Nice accommodations for our horses.  We rented the lodge.  It was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  The lodge could use some repairs/maintenance performed here and there, but we were comfortable.  

Linda was great to work with pre-trip as well as during our stay.

Trails were pretty much what I expected.  They are difficult, so not for a horse that sat all winter and you take it to this area for it's first big summer ride.  Horses should be in shape and conditioned.

There was one spot where we mistook a trail sign's intent for the way we should go and ended up on hiking trails rather than riding trails, but we figured it out (a little later than we'd have liked) but all turned out well.
