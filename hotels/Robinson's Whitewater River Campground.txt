Text: Beautiful campground! The bath house was even acceptable. We came down as a vendor for a weekend event. Brought our RV and have had no complaints.... electrical outlets everywhere and water spickets as well. The town has old train museums and is a really neat place to visit. Very well kept too!  And there is tube & canoe rental that picks you up about 2 hrs down the river to bring you back! That's what we are going to do tomorrow before we have to leave and go back home lol
