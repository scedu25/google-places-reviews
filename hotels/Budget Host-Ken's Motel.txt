Budget Host-Ken's Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Older well maintained roadside motel. Park outside the room. Single story. Full size refrigerator in room. No microwave or coffee maker in room. Lobby does keep fresh brewed coffee in morning. Usual ice machine and a washer and dryer. Friendly courteous staff. Excellent value have stayed here a few times visiting family in Aurora and will continue to do so.

Text: Not bad at all. Rooms are clean with fairly new furnishings.  Bathroom was clean and well maintained.   Internet worked fine.  It's an older motor inn that allows you to drive up to your room and avoid carrying bags long distances.  The attendant was friendly and allowed us to do a quick inspection of a room before committing.  The heat-air system is a little older but works fine and is not noisy.  If you are looking for a good budget hotel that isn't a dump this is your hotel ($56).   Will post photos later.

Text: Good location near many restaurants. Was clean and roomy. I loved the grey brick on the outside of the building :)

Text: Great room for size and space, full size refrigerator. Room was clean and appeared to have new carpet and paint. Wish we could have had a king size bed, think they only had queens. Mattress was not comfortable and need better pillows. First time to stay, but may need to again as relatives live there.

Text: Not bad good for a cheap motel. But keep in mind it is a cheap motel the staff was mostly friendly and there are washer and driers on site bring your own soap!
