Text: Most horrible Valentine's experience ever. Upon walking in we got yelled at and told to wait because we were 5 minutes early for the reservation that we made. And then got seated at the same time as a couple who walked in with no reservation. There was no bartender on staff though they claimed to have a "lounge". First drinks were decent and our appetizer was tasty. Then we waited for 45 minutes without even water in our glasses. The food was very good aside from the fact that we ordered a glass of wine each to have with our entree (prime rib and surf and turf)  which never arrived and I couldn't get the attention of any staff person to get butter for my very dry baked potato. So, for the over $100 that we paid for the meal we couldn't get out of the place faster. What we ate was delicious (kudos to the cooks!) but the service was rude when we walked in and horrible through the meal unfortunately.
