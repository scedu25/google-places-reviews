Text: Comfortable bed and good sized room.  Only two drink cups in the room hidden in a corner. Never did figure out how to get a signal on the tv. Breakfast did have waffles that was nice. But I didn't see anything but coffee to drink.  Not a bad place but for $80 dollar's I was less than impressed.
