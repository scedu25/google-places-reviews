Text: Recently booked here for our wedding, booked 10 rooms, when guest would call they would tell them rooms for wedding were booked when they weren't!! So guest that went on line to book a room and got the room cheaper than we did even though the hotel management said that we got a wedding discount! Management was very rude!! We booked a room for ourselves with double bed, when we went to check in we got a single queen room, I talked to management about the mix up, he was rude and did nothing about the mix up plus could barely understand what he was saying!! The continental breakfast was horrible!!!! The honey packets for toast was expired and looked disgusting!!! Would NOT recommend this hotel!!!

Text: Prices are ok. Breakfast was good. We were in town for a wedding. The motel served its purpose. I would stay here again.

Text: Rooms were clean and the breakfast was decent. The beds were kind of small for a single, it was more like a bed you would find in a double room. The wifi was pretty spotty, I had trouble keeping it connected to my devices. It was pleasant overall, and I would stay there again if I was ever back in manchester.
