Text: Really nice guys here, beautiful campsite, well- maintained, clean and close to the water. Tent camp for $15 next to two beautiful ponds, or RV camp with full hookups! Will absolutely make it a point to visit again!

Text: Our experience was great at first... But then AFTER we paid all the rent to keep our camper there all through the winter months they told us that our camper wasn't good enough to meet their high standards to stay there..   So we had to move our camper..     
But let's be honest... This place isn't all that high on the standards list anyway..   Plus they couldn't keep track of what we actually owed them..
