Sonesta ES Suites Ann Arbor
Rating: 4
Text: Spacious room with modern style design and a kitchen. There were couple issues with the room though. The room door couldn't be opened smoothly and an electrical outlet was broken. They provided very friendly customer services. The free continental breakfast was so delicious too. We will come back next time.

Text: I was put into the Soonest ES Suites in Ann Arbor due to being displaced from my apartment while work is being done on it. The room itself is quite large with a functional kitchenette and it is cleaned daily. They are also pet friendly, which is important for my family. One issue I've had is that our room keys periodically stop working properly, so we need to return to the front desk to have them fixed. That said, it is a .inir inconvenience.

Text: Beautiful hotel rooms for sure. Had an interesting time outside one evening. We were asked to be quiet around the grill area, and after taking off voices down to a near whisper, someone turned the sprinklers on (unless they were set to only be on for about 30 seconds before it was dark).

Text: I had a perfect stay. The room was large with a complete kitchen (even dishwasher!), very comfortable beds and the service was excellent. Ther were all very friendly and helpful. They served a good breakfast every morning and there were even free drinks and snacks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I also enjoyed the nice hot jacuzzi. 
The only negative thing was the fact that it's close to a busy road, so you will hear the traffic. But since the bed was so comfy, I sleapt like a princess anyway :). 
Would definitly stay here again.

Text: I enjoyed staying here. The rooms are in separate buildings grouped by I believe eight units in a two story cottage-like building. They are very close together and near the front desk. The inside was clean and contained all the amenities I expect from Residence Inn. A free continental breakfast is provided as well as events and free food in the evenings at times. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. I would happily stay here again.
