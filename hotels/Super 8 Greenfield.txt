Text: Very friendly staff, they are very helpful and kind. The rooms are very clean with a fresh scent. Indoor heated pool & hot tub. A wonderful breakfast bar in the mornings. A lot of extras that come with the room, A lot of parking space. Will definitely be back next time we stay at a motel in Greenfield Indiana.

Text: The service was great but they did not have a elevator and for the price we paid, I really expected more. It was 1/2 way updated and had a weird smell. As I said before, the day time front desk ladies were great. The night desk lady never told us there wasn't an elevator and was a bit snappy when we asked about it.

Text:  Very clean and very nice staff.  No complaints. I stayed for one night and it served its purpose of a place to sleep.  It looked newly remodeled as well.

Text: The room was very clean and the decor was lovely. The was an indoor pool which I didn't take advantage of. The staff was friendly and helpful. The grounds were well maintained. The only thing I could say that could be improved upon would be that the TV's could be just a little larger, because they were a little difficult to see from the beds.
