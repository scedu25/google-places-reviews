Rustic Motel Rolla
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed here for one night on a trip from Texas to Ohio. The Rustic is clean, newly renovated with a favorable price. Staff was very friendly. Only stayed for the night but I would recommend staying here if you happen to need a clean, cheap place to stay the night or two.

Text: We ware coming back from Chicago going to Dallas and took night stay in this motel after enquring in 3 places. We found this most cheapest so decided to stay here. I would say it was a very very comfortable stay. The lady at the reception was very polite and respectful. Rooms were clean and specially bathroom was drop clean with white day light bulbs. Surely recommend.

Text: Rustic Motel is a very well kept, very clean and very affordable Motel. The couple that own it are very nice and reserved a block for us for guests to our wedding.
