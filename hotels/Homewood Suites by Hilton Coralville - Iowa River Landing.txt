Text: Where has this hotel been my entire life? Warm and inviting lobby, spacious and quiet rooms, great water pressure, strategically placed outlets, etc. Details matter, and Homewood Suites has it figured out. In addition, this hotel is located in the Iowa River Landing, a wonderful development. Five high-pressure showers out of five.

Text: Had an amazing time here! Only got to stay one night, but enjoyed ourselves very much! M-Th night, they have a dinner/reception with serve-yourself wine and beer! The pool was clean and warm, the hit tub was hot, the room we had even had a door to separate the living and sleeping space! The kitchen was a really good size with a full fridge, half a stove and a sink! Breakfast in the morning had plenty of options! 
The weather while we visited was incredibly hot, and the A/C froze in the living room. It was still cold, but made a huge watery mess on the floor. We informed the front desk, and they were very friendly. We didn't want to bother with moving to a new room, but it would have been nice if they had discounted the room a bit for us. Other than that, no complaints!!
Would highly recommend!

Text: great place to stay. wish we could stay another night. clean large rooms at a reasonable cost. beds are comfortable and the room was quiet. we slept good.

Breakfast was a dissapointment. it may be a cultural thing, but the scrambled eggs were "gooey" and the home fries were mushy. the boiled egg had the texture of saw dust. all the fruits seemed to have no taste except the grapes were good. the sausage cake and waffle were good and the coffee was good.
