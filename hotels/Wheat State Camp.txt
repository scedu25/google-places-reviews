Text: How nice it is to see that the Wheat State Campus has continued to be improved!   However, I loved it when I was a young person and the cabins were roughly finished and there was little landscaping.  The friendships, the counselors, the services, crafts, food, the all-
important snack bar, and much more left  me with warm lasting memories and continued walk with God.  I sent my children there and they have many great memories, too.

Text: Spend three days here at camp for an encounter. The camp has been around, but even though it shows its age a bit the whole campus is clean and kept up very well. The staff at our function was really top notch. The air was cold outside and I was concerned the dorms might be cold, but we didn't need to worry, it was as comfortable as you can get when you are trying to sleep in a room with a bunch of guys - thanks to the ear plugs we did sleep ok. Keep it up!
