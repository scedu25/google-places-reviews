Text: This is for the experienced traveler.....my husband n I have been on the road this time for 2 weeks. We had the best night of sleep so far. It's a small CLEAN and well cared for family owned motel. The windows on both sides of the room gave us excellent  natural ventilation so we didn't need to use the AC. It had the necessary amenities such as REAL beds, refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot n WiFi. It was great to access our car directly from our motel room door.

Text: Rates are the best in town. Even have weekly rates for extended stays. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. They allow pets with a small fee. The hot water didn't work very well when we stayed but other than that it was a great place to stay. Very clean and appealing.

Text: It was a nice clean Motel. The rooms are small but taken care of very well. The only thing I didn't like is having the air conditioner blowing on my arm in the night. Highly recommend this Motel.

Text: Stay at a place like this before everything in the world is a Holiday Inn Express.  An old school "Motel" where you park outside the door of your room.  Rooms are tiny, but inexpensive, clean and neat as a pin.  Very well maintained but antique.  The ladies that checked us in were super-friendly and reminded me very much of my Iowa-born-and-raised Grandmother many years ago.  Not fancy, but great.
