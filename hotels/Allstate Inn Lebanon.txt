Text: Stayed one night & arrived late. We checked out by noon. At arrival, the 
First room, 1 King bed, had a slight odor and the smoke alarm was beeping(needed battery I am guessing) so we called down and said we needed a different room. She kindly walked upstairs to give us a key to another  room. It smelled better. It was 2 double beds. Nothing fancy for sure, however we did Not find bugs!  I would have been outta there. Both rooms was in the 2nd floor. Only 2 floors here. So I think we would try again if we needed a room. There was a worker there who stated he rented by the week. ($189) He was having no issues. 
There is No pool in Or out. No breakfast. Just a place to sleep! It cost us $55, 1 night.  So .... It was okay. No real complaints.
