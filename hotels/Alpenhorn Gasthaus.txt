Alpenhorn Gasthaus
Rating: 5
Text: Went for dinner, atmosphere was intimate and romantic. 2 rooms with tables for a small group, but still private for couples. Nice wine list to choose from. 4 course dinner was phenomenal! Squash stuffed pasta boat for appetizer was amazing! Fall salad delicious with spiced apples! Choice between pork medallions and red snapper, both were amazing! Dessert of chocolate cake with homemade whip cream and raspberry sauce! Amazing experience and would definitely recommend!

Text: Took a much needed R & R couple of days away and could not have been happier! The place was very clean and quaint. LOVED the animals, and that we were a little tucked away from Main St. Adrian was friendly and helpful in suggestions/recommendations where to eat and tucked away places to walk on the Katy Trail with the BEST view. Breakfast was fantastic! Thank you!

Text: Michael was the chef/concierge/chief of hospitality during this stay and he outdid himself. He was ready with amazing food, clean towels and much information about local and California wines. He went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and treasured and made our stay memorable and comfortable. The space at the Alpenhorn rivals any b&b that we've ever stayed at. Breakfast was phenomenal and dinner was unforgettable. Well worth every penny. We will only stay here in the future.

Text: Wonderful hospitality from Adrian, some of the best cooking I've ever had from Kate and gorgeous views. Ask Adrian for recommendations around town and you'll have a great getaway.
