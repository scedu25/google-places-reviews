Text: Just heard about this location and drove down to check things out today (august 7th). Great location for non electric camping. Nice handicap spots available. Many of the outer campsite spots have GREAT views of  the lake. Only problem we saw was that the grass looked like a field. Grass/weeds was at LEAST around 8 inches tall. Would not be ideal rent camping or comfortable for walking in and around on or playing :-/  Other than that, it was clean and quiet. 
The boat ramp was easily available. Clean area. Lots of parking. Even a ramp to pull up to, to easily load/unload your boat. 
The swimming beach was nice. Roped off for safe swimming, Sandy beach, a couple picnic tables in the grassy area and room for a gathering in another grassy side (if it were mowed better) with open grassy space and a picnic table alongside the parking lot. However, I did not anticipate the FEE to park and swim? 
Glad we drove down to check things out first, before we just loaded up and took off! We will most likely come down for day camping/beach play & more exploration....

Text: Sadly not as well taken care of as it used to be. Not completely overgrown by any means but I see why there were only two or three campers when we went through.
