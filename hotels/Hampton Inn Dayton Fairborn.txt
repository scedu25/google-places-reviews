Hampton Inn Dayton/Fairborn
Rating: 3
Text: Pretty decent hotel for the money. My room didn't have a microwave/fridge, so I asked the front desk if they had any carts with them to spare. They did not, but they actually upgraded me to a room that had them already. I was really appreciative of that service. Definitely likely to come back another time.

Edit: Removing a star because the microwave in my room didn't work and, while I brought it up twice, it was not fixed during my stay. I still appreciate the fridge though. I'd give a 3.5 rating if that were an option.

Text: It was really quiet due to the overall location and the amount of other hotels everywhere. It was really nice that we didn't have to worry about noisy neighbors. Breakfast was good, the pool looked nice (although we didn't use it), and the rooms were very well kept. But everything about the hotel was on the smaller side. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dayton.

Text: The rooms are clean, the beds and pillows are decent. The bathroom is quite cramped though. Breakfast is nothing spectacular, but certainly not to be avoided. The front desk attendants have been exceptionally friendly and helpful.

Text: This is an older hotel but clean. I checked in online but arrive past midnight, my room was ready and the night manager was super friendly. My room was a king and the only problem is that it seemed to have too much furniture for the room size. Overall, it was clean and comfortable. There were kids from a softball tournament here but i didnt hear any noise at all. The breakfast was typical Hampton Inn fare and well maintained. I'll be back in Dayton in the fall and will stay here again.

Text: Just returned from a weekend stay ( softball tourney). The hotel was very clean, very accommodating.  I enjoyed my stay. BIG thank you to Connie in the kitchen area for serving up my favorite Hampton Inn breakfast!
