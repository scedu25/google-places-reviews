Courtyard by Marriott Detroit Pontiac/Auburn Hills
Rating: 1
Text: Housekeeping horrible. Did not replace coffee. Did not take trash. Did not replace towels. Bedding not clean. 

Shower does drain, water ankle deep.   Overall bad experience for a Courtyard. 

Troy Courtyard is worth the drive vs staying close to customer.

Text: The location was near the place I needed to visit for work. Whilst staying there, I did not have a chance to use the pool or workout facilities, but, they are in very good condition. They start was very friendly and I will definitely stay here again.

Text: Absolutely gorgeous property and rooms. The lobby, common areas and guest suites are modern and comfortable. I will always stay here if given the choice between the 3 Marriott properties in the area...great value!
