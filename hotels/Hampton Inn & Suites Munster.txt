Text: Horrible experience. Staff was so unfriendly. It was our wedding night and they released the room that was promised to us. My wife had worked with 3 different people in the sales department leading up to our wedding day. Super unorganized. The facility it self was nice, but we will absolutely never stay there again.

Text: Beautifully renovated. We were impressed with the rooms, the pool is indoors which is a plus and the breakfast was really good. They even made us some eggs without the ham just cause we asked. Would stay here again.
