Hampton Inn Dubuque
Rating: 4
Text: Clean rooms with comfortable beds.  No picturesque views, (parking lot and rooftop on all sides) but overall a nice place to stay.  Pool and Spa had clear water and the establishment seems relatively well kept.  The doughnut offering at breakfast was not fresh but the whip cream and candy toppings provided for the self serve waffle bar made up for that.  Plenty of choices on the breakfast bar.

Text: Clean rooms. Employees were professional but had a good sense of humor. Reasonably priced rooms and plenty of parking. Best breakfast selection I've seen at a hotel. Plenty of room for everyone even though the hotel was completely booked.

Text: Same Hampton inn, nice and well kept. Slow at cleaning the rooms, checked in at 5:00 and still did not have room ready. Next day out of the room from 8:30 till 3:30 still did not find the time to clean it. They need to update the pillows ours were flat and the first time I've been to a Hampton inn and not had 5-6 on the bed
