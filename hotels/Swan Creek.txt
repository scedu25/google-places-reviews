Text: Moved in here 2011, after the first year, things started changing! Now it's 2017, a whole lot worse! Most of the time ,no one in office, to answer your call for problems, to be fixed in rental home we are in! Management now is not qualified, for the position, neither is maintenance. Drives the truck around scraping all evening, that's supposed to be parked at office! Don't move here if you want to have a good place to live! If you want something fixed, attitude, told for months things will be fixed, still waiting. Do NOT move in !

Text: Very rude and unprofessional staff. Ignoring phone calls. Very vague when finally getting through about application approval. Screened phone calls so they wouldn't answer calls for days at a time and when they did they would have an attitude as if it wasn't part of their job to answer phone calls. Glad we didnt move here as i could imagine trying to get anything done with this office staff in charge of daily operations. Might be time to clean house and start over. Dont waste your time money and effort. Move elsewhere.

Text: As a current resident that has lived her over 3 years, let me tell you. The community itself is nice and the homes are nice but the office staff both local and corporate are very unprofessional. The office hours are never accurate, the office staff make them up as they go and the pool was closed before the end of the season last year. Over the past 2-3 months a new maintenance guy has just been hired and he is nice, professional and great at what he does! I do not recommend this location.

Text: I don't recommend it to anyone. The office manager is unprofessional. The maintenance guy doesn't know what he's doing or how to communicate. They've taken about 3 weeks - a month and a half to fix any maintenance issue. Overall not a great experience in my year living here.
