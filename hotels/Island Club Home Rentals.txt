Text: Good location, but the cabin could use some work. Fan/light in the living room didn't work, the furnace has one setting and that is to hell, and the water pressure sucks. Otherwise it's good.

Text: Aside from maybe a little extra effort cleaning? I'm satisfied. Place was comfortable. The shower worked and the toilet flushed. Neighbors weren't bad. Nice place for a weekend trip.

Text: House itself was well furnished/maintained. Taxi service available to residents is quality and efficient. Location frequently used for parties (bachelor/ette etc.) so always something going on which can either be fun if that's what you're looking for or too loud depending on the group.

Text: Great place to stay on Put-n-Bay If you don't want to be at the center of the party 24/7. All the things you need EXCEPT Wi-Fi.  3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, bar, had grill and back porch. I absolutely well stay again!
