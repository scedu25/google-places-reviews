Text: The receptionist, named Sonya, was very knowledgeable. She helped us with our check in, and insured we had everything we needed. A very good job, indeed.

Text: Dirty hotel, a bug on the floor in my bathroom that never got picked up the 5 days I was here. Along with a dryer sheet most likely from someone else because the bedding was dirty and stained. The breakfast was nothing there but a bowl of rotten banana's and no creamer for your coffee. Not worth coming back to and the management doesn't care.

Text: Nice bed. The lights (lamp) don't work till you screwed the bulb in, had to find a plug for the tv, it was not plugged in. The towels look like they have not been washed, stained and dingy looking. It was not worth &99.68. Very unhappy!!!

Text: Looked like a new bed. Huge new t.v.. only downside was the smell of curry when you walk in the door.
