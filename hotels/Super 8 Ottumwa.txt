Text: The pool seems larger than many of the other hotels in the area. My general impression of the hotel is it is alright and you get what you pay for. My room was clean although a little cramped. Everything in the hotel is a little worn but not dirty. Breakfast was serviceable but nothing special. If you don't have kids and aren't worried about them crawling on the floor then this is alright if you are looking to save a few dollars compared to others in Ottumwa.

Text: The only real issue that my wife and I had was that the room smelled overwhelmingly like a citrus fruit. To the point that we both got a headache from the smell. Otherwise the room was in great condition and everything was wonderful for our overnight stay.
