Text: 1.  Day 1, went through 9 key cards, They did not touch my cell phone.  Toilet ran all night.  No plate on the door to secure it.  Day 2,  Moved me to suite, the lock did not lock.  Moved me to another room, A/C plug was not connected to the wall.  Electrical outlet was broke.   Milk left in the refrigerator.  Will not recommend this for a visit ever.  No bacon or sausage for breakfast.  Staff was friendly.  Room are not worth the price.  I have picture to back up what a say.

Text: I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!!!!  Outside appearance was horrid. Rooms looked "alright" as in the rooms are outdated. They had no air conditioning in the room when we first arrived. It took the window a/c around 30 minutes for it to be comfortable enough to even sleep. Not enough parking spaces- had to park in the parking lot of the hotel next door. The room smelled bad. Customer service is terrible. Waited to talk to the person on the phone several minutes. She would ask me a question then do something else and a minute later ask me another question then ignore me for another minute. The experience with Days inn was HORRID!
