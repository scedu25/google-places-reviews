Text: This is a gem in Kansas! It really is clear as they say. You can camp in a tent here too. They have reserved and walk-in spots. We tent camped and although the wind was strong and broke our tent it was worth it. There are hidden swim spots that are shaded most of the day. Randy the maintenance guy was extremely helpful and kind!

Text: Beautiful location a good seven miles from the freeway on a large lake. Loved the peace and quiet, the view, the spacious lakeside sites, the friendly host and the stars!
