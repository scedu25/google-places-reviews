Text: Awesome trip with The Outlaw group. $80 for canoe/float/camp, dinner and live entertainment was such a great deal! Will be back!

Text: Sand Spring Resort is a great place to stay when visiting the State  Park for fishing, or a picnic. The resort has a beautiful indoor swimming pool, floating availability,  and BBQ pits. This is our go to place to stay.

Text: Had some trouble with our other arrangements to get a canoe so we ended up at here to see if they had any available. The staff was extremely nice and got us right in. We ended up missing our stop to be picked up and floating to another a few miles away. They picked us up without any hesitation. The man driving was super friendly even after driving quite a bit further to get us in the rain. We had a great time and would definitely love to come back!

Text: Hands down the best place to stay when visiting Bennett Spring. No Ritz Carlton, but the owners and staff make up for it with awesome service. And the prices are extremely reasonable.

Text: We stayed her for 3 nights, we got here and there was only one other camper put of 12 spots, made us park under a dead tree, well the next morning, we woke up to a huge dead branch fell through our camper. The staff said it had been dead for 2 years, next guy said it was beautiful 3 weeks ago, even though someone did bring a tarp and rope to us, they did not give us a sturdy kayak paddle because, half way down the 4 mile float the black tape holding it together, had snaped. (Mowing is nice to).
