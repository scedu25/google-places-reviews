Text: The restaurant is fantastic. Food and service is great but the speak easy is run by a total d bag. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal just avoid the temptation to go to the speak easy

Text: What can I say, this place is amazing. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Rooms were very clean and very modern. The drinks at the speakeasy downstairs are incredible as well. Great place to stay and we will be returning!

Text: I've never stayed here, but a newly remodeled landmark in Wichita lives on. Since I can't comment on the hotel itself, I'll focus on food & drinks. Sienna Steakhouse on the first floor is one of the best places in town. Great staff, atmosphere & chefs. Folks at the bar really take pride in making great cocktails & they even have some local craftbeer. Food is superb, order whatever looks good you won't be disappointed. If you can find your way down to the basement, you might stumble upon Dockum, a Speakeasy in the lower level. It's a pretty special place, but I think I've said too much already

Text: Neat speak-easy style bar in the basement. Very large rooms and closets, but sound carried pretty bad. Parking was pricier than I was expecting for Wichita.
