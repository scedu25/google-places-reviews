Super 8 Rockford
Rating: 2
Text: Just pulling up to the hotel, I was not impressed.  When you walk in the front door (which really is not clearly indicated), you are right in the breakfast area with a small counter to the side for check in.  Everything in this place seems to be an after thought.  The front desk clerk is also the laundry person, and probably also the cleaning staff.  She was efficient, thought not particularly friendly.  After receiving our room key, we headed down the hall and were turned off even more than pulling up out front.  It was dirty and worn.  The room was neat and appeared clean, but the bathroom was very small and could really use some new fixtures.  The coffee maker was right on the very small sink outside the bathroom.  I wouldn't try to wash my hands and make coffee at the same time; you might get electrocuted.  I went outside to get my bags and brought them back to the room, but after walking down the hallway again, I realized that I could not stay at this place.  I checked out within 5 minutes and headed to the Holiday Inn across the street.  The front desk clerk didn't seem surprised or concerned at my rapid departure.  If you are looking for a hotel based on price, you definitely get what you pay for at this Super 8.

Text: Very poor hotel / motel !! No hand towels or washcloths, soap, toilet barely flushed,  bathroom light and fan open and one bed had been slept in hair and stains, blankets had burn holes in them . 6 of them . Talked to the front desk she didn't seem to care . Never received linen.  Will not stay ever again feel like I need a can of lysol. Someone said the front desk wasn't around much in the morning during breakfast.  Well that's because they are at the nice hotel eating.  Seen them when we moved .

Text: Been to many hotels in the past couple days since I'm on a road trip across the U.S: and I'd say skip this one. Hotel rooms are disgusting and so is the hotel in general. Don't let the price fool you. Found cigarette hole burns in our sheets, stains in the carpets, has a nasty odor. If you're traveling on I-90 West I recommend traveling about another 45 minutes farther west for a nicer hotel.  I'm usually not picky because I've slept in pretty trash places before. But it was unprofessional and insanitary. Got my refund for sure. 0 Stars if I could.

Text: The only good thing I can say about this place is that the girl working the front counter was friendly. Otherwise. Gross. Moldy shower, dead bug in the window, poorly taken care of, broken bathroom door, awful bed with one terrible pillow on each side. It honestly felt like a creepy hotel room strait out of a horror movie & the fact that the bed is weirdly close to the door doesn’t help. Never again.

Text: Honestly, one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at! Stayed there for 6 nights and had to ask for towels every day, and when I did they acted as if I was bothering them. Took 3 days before the trash was taken out, the plumbing was a joke in the building. They advertise a free continental breakfast, which was a waffle iron and some batter. I left a wake up call and never got it. I could could go on and on with what was wrong with this place if I wanted to make a 3 page complaint. I will say I will never stay there again and can not recommend the SUPER 8 in Rockford.
