Lake Cove Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel was clean and comfy. The bed was a newish pillow top mattress with clean sheets/blankets. The fridge in the room was nice, but no microwave, which was fine, just FYI. The hallways were quiet the night of our stay despite it being busy. The housekeepers did start vacuuming the hallway outside our room at about 7 am which wasn't my favorite thing. The shower head pressure was very good and the bathroom was clean. We did have one bug turn up on the floor dead overnight, but saw no actual bug activity, so it may have come inside with us (being a muggy August evening.) Overall, very pleased with our stay and would choose Lake Cove again.

Text: Thanks for having us. We will be back. Fenced in closure for parking your boat with available power for your batteries. Bait store, full service gas station with a bar and grill attached within stubbing distance. We get first dibs when we're coming.
Thanks, again!!!
