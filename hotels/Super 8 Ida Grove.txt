Super 8 Ida Grove

Text: Stayed here recently while in town attending a funeral. The staff were VERY friendly and accommodating. They let us check out later than usual for no extra charge due to the funeral being that day. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Good waffles for breakfast too!

Text: Quiet hotel. The Staff is very interested to make sure your stay is comfortable at an affordable rate. Rooms are clean with appropriate decor for "farm country."

Text: The Bug Hotel.

Stayed here for a siblings wedding and it was the worst experience of my life. The manager woman is a grumpy old bag and my child has bug bites after sleeping in the bed. As a local, I knew better than to stay here but didn’t have much of a choice. Freaking nasty.

Text: Usually you think of Super 8 as a low quality budget place to stay. (No problem with that)
However this place is genuinely quite nice. It far exceeds the expectations of most Super 8s.
