Text: Very nice man and daughter  are the hosts. It's  got a 50's vibe  with  pink  tile  around the tub, but there has been a nice "face-lift ".  Good TV, and a fridge, which is always welcome. Clean and comfy, and for 57 bucks, including  tax, how can you beat it?

Text: I have stayed here during summer and winter and both A/C and heat work amazing. Rooms are simple but the beds are comfy and the rooms quiet. Best of all is how clean the rooms are! Family owned business, super nice people!
