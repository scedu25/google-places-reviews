Howard Johnson Inn Wichita Airport
Rating: 2
Text: Our room was not nice. We had no towels, no extra pillow, no fan. Huge sticky spot on carpet. Beds made with flat sheets, not fitted. We booked 3 nights, our shampoo/conditioner have never been replaced. Our key cards stopped working. Second floor smells like an ashtray. Anyone can get into the building

Text: Was a great place to stay at after a long flight. No real complaints the staff was great they had me already vhecked in by the time i got there from the airport. The room was a good price and the room was very clean. Will be staying there again.

Text: I'm giving the Howard Johnson inner Hotel in Wichita Kansas 01 star because that place is not fit for nobody. Second-floor your  it's for people that want to get high and I know it. I learned my lesson that will never happen again

Text: It was decent for the price. Got a good deal thru Expedia that included the car rental. The room was actually clean, close to the airport and stores/restaurants which was a plus. Didn't enjoy waking into the lobby smelling cigarette smoke though which would be my most negative comment.
