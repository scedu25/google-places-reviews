Highway K Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We went camping here in the middle of the week in August and had the primitive camping area to ourselves. The sites are beautiful here with plenty of space. 

There were TONS of raccoons who were not afraid of anything so keep food stored correctly and put trash in the dumpster before you leave your campsite.

 It was located right near the river so check weather reports and river levels before heading here since this area is prone to flooding.

Only downfall was when the wind would shift and we'd receive a smelly breeze from the restrooms.
