Carriage House At the Harbor
Rating: 5
Text: This was a truly beautiful place to stay! Just one block from the B&B is the beach and a pier within walking distance. Truly gorgeous! Our room (The Brett) was very clean and cute. We had a jacuzzi tub and a private balcony porch. Everything was great! Only two things I would have liked to be different was that the bed was super squeaky and the shower made a ton of noise until I really pulled hard on the lever to get it to stop. Jacuzzi was great and water temp could go to boiling hot so no lack of good hot water. Breakfast was amazing and the views were too! Highly recommended!

Text: Lovely place. Friendly, helpful hostess and  service staff. Just across the draw bridge from down town, an easy walk away. Great views over the harbor. Our room had a great personal and private deck with terrific view. Room clean and comfortable. Breakfast amazing taste and aesthetically pleasing. Best place in SoHa.

Text: The location is incredible and all the reviews are on target in regards to the Carriage House.  A few critiques based I have observed during my numerous stays.  The breakfast is dreadful but I think they try really hard for it to be fancy.  I think they hit all of the starch food groups on both days during our stay.  Sorry, Carriage House ya'll are so sweet I feel bad for even writing this but it's constructive feedback.  They would be better served simply making eggs to order, sausage or bacon for those with restrictive dietary needs or live a healthy lifestyle.  For those of us that work during vacations to support lazy ex's the internet is useless  so come prepared:)
