King's Way Inn
Rating: 3
Text: It's located right in the middle of a construction zone which is hard to get through due to the traffic at times, room looks shabby but the A/C worked and the TV was decent. Carpet in the rooms looks updated, crappy little Continental breakfast in the mornings if you would like.... Not a bad place to stay for two nights.
