Dune Lake Campground

Text: I thought this campground was great! The prices are very reasonable and they are very family friendly. While we don't have kids, it was fun to see kids having fun riding their bikes and having their own summer adventures free of phones and devices. The curfew was enforced from what I could tell. Everyone was very quiet by 10pm. They are 20 minutes from South Haven and St Joseph, so there is plenty to do in the area for day trips. I am ready to book for next summer!

Text: This place has great potential, if they updated the facilities a little and the husband quit being a jerk.  A couple own and operate, wife seemed nice, husband was rude for virtually every interaction and made up "rules" along the way.  Probably ok for a small family that is very quiet, but not if you want to stay up around the campfire and have some laughs.  We were part of a group of families and I would not recommend if you are a larger group they don't seem to like that.  Bottom line I would not recommend

Text: Small but well taken care of. The sites are really close together so there's not a ton of privacy but they clearly work really hard to take care of the place. Props!
