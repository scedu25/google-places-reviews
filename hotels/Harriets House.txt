Harriets House
Rating: 1
Text: A group of friends and I recently stayed at Harriett House for my bachelorette party. We were treated terribly by the owners. They were not hospitable, they failed to provide simple amenities like trash bags and towels, and we were treated very poorly by the property owners. Our first night, we had friends come to spend time with us. Our friends were told they were not allowed to use the restroom, and forced to leave the property. 

The owners constantly reminded us how expensive the property was, how much their mortgage was, etc. It did not feel like a vacation, and they were very rude and confrontational with our group. Keep in mind, we were a group of women in our 30s, some of my friends have families. Keep in mind, we did in fact pay $1,000/night to stay in this property. 

Overall, I highly recommend looking elsewhere for lodging on the island. The owners do not know hospitality, and they have no business renting this property to eager island visitors who want to have fun.

Text: We stay here every year for a 3 day weekend. The owners are friendly and accommodating. The property is always clean and the property is within close proximity to all of the local attractions.

Text: Place is very clean and nice. Great place to go if you want to be treated like a 16 year old.
