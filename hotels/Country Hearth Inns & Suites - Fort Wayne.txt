Text: Went in to pay my dad's rent while he's in the hospital.  The man at the desk, straight out ignored me for at least 20 minutes.  Finally, I said are you going to help me or not?!  He was rude until I told him who my dad was, then he wanted to be nice, me dad has been living there for over 2 yrs.  I went to get a few things in my dad's room for him and was pretty grossed out by the state that hotel is in.  Very dirty, smelled of heavy smokers and pot. Dirt and ashes everywhere in the hallways, clearly not swept and carpets clearly never cleaned.  My dad's room (he'd already been in the hospital for 2 weeks at the time) was now majorly infested with bed bugs, I mean SERIOUSLY infested!  I was there once, a month before and went in the back door, didnt notice how bad the halls were at that time, I helped him clean up and round up laundry, no bugs at that time.

Text: I stayed here for years and had to leave, because my job transferred. I do not want to leave here. The staff is so friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: A death just occurred in room 121. Full of drugs as the other hotels owned by the same owner are. They don't pay their bills to the little guys,and if you have an ID they will take your money. Pretty sad.
