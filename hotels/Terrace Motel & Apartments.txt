Text: How about what I don't like ? I don't like the fact that our toilet over flowed an was told there was no plunger readily available for us to use and I had to go buy 1. As a hotel guest my family and I shouldn't be held liable for possible  over flow sewage problems that I was told happen from time to time an supply our own plunger & clean up the mess on our own time in order to have a clean and sanitary bathroom.
