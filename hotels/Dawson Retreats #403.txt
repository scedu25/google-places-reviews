Dawson Retreats #403
Rating: 5
Text: It was a relaxing stay at the Dawson house for us while we were in Hamilton to do some quilt store shopping.  I was with 3 of my sisters and my 87 year old mother.  It was nice for us to have a place to come back to for our meals and to take breaks in a place that was quiet and comfortable.  The only concern we had:  a walk-in shower for my mother would have been nice.  She can't lift her legs high enough to get into the tall tub shower.   Since we were only there for 2 days she was satisfied with 'sponge bathing' but if we would stay longer, she would appreciate a shower.  Otherwise, everything else was great.  Thank you again.
