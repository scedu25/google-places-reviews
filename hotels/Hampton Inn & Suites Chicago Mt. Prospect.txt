Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago/Mt. Prospect

Text: We have stayed at this hotel several times and keep coming back. The rooms are a good size and well appointed. The complimentary internet access for being a Hilton Rewards member is a nice and useful perk. The complimentary breakfast is nice with both hot and cold options. The underground parking garage is worth the little extra charge. We will absolutely be back!

Text: Very fancy place. Great location nice staff. Took too long to get checked in. Room was not as clean as we expected. AC was roaring loudly they said they fix it they did not. They offer another room but to was 1040pm by that point and didn't want to move the family. They tell me they are going to refund my night have not seen it yet.

Text: Wonderful place to stay for a business trip. The property sits next to Costco and in a shopping complex with retail stores, restaurants, and a movie theater. There is a grocery store within a 5 minute walk. Parking is in an underground garage with elevator access to all floors.

Text: Great hotel in a fabulous location. Family members use it at least 9 times a year. The parking garage is a huge bonus in this climate.
