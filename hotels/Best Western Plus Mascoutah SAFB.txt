Best Western Plus Mascoutah/SAFB

Text: This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. The front desk workers were far from friendly. There was things on the carpets in the hallways looks like it hadn’t been vacuumed. The public bathrooms were far from clean. The lobby floor was sticky. The only good thing about this place is the clean rooms and the breakfast. Never again will I stay at a best western and definitely not this place.

Text: This hotel was clean & had everything I needed for my couple of nights there. Good selection for breakfast. I didn't use the pool but like that it is indoor & heated. It was very close to the highway so very convenient. It's about 20 minutes from downtown St. Louis so it's easy to get to all the amenties there(Cardinals baseball games, Arch, etc). The price was very good for the hotel. I would definitely stay there again.

Text: We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel to stay at for the Eclipse Day in Carbondale, and visit St. Louis sites before the Eclipse. This hotel exceeded our expectations. Very nice hotel and staff. Beds were very comfortable. If we ever make it back to the St. Louis area to see the sites we missed this time, this will be the place we stay again.

Text: This should be a nice place. If housekeeping completed their job,  it would be. The floors weren't clean. I mean there was coffee, Or some unknown brown liquid, was all over the bathroom floor. Who knows what else want replaced or cleaned?
