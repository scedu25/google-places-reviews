North Sandusky Campground
Rating: 4
Text: We camped there over the weekend and it was nice and peaceful as the woods can be with all the frog/cricket/insect sounds. They really need trash cans in public areas. There was electric hook ups but no water hook ups. The bathrooms were somewhat close so we were happy overall with our experience.
