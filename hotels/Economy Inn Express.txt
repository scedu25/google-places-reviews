Text: The beds were good, motel was older but clean, desk personel were very friendly would recommend this motel to others, the only problem was the heater in our room wasn't heating the room that much, but the complaint was handled very quickly and we had a brand new large space heater which was more than enough for our room, I didn't really have a problem with it after that.
