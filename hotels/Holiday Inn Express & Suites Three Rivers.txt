Holiday Inn Express & Suites Three Rivers
Rating: 5
Text: I travel every week for my job and lately it's been in Three rivers for sometime now.  I've stayed at many hotels.  This Holiday Inn and Express is home away from home.  All the staff treat me like family and always meet any of my needs.  I'm here five days a week and they have been amazing every time.  The area is beautiful and I would never think of staying anywhere else!

Text: Service was great with helping us add a night to our stay. Rooms were clean, up to date and nice. It was easy to access off of 131 and was overall a pleasant stay.

Text: Room smelled like smoke. Old decor, old carpet, old bathroom. TV worked great. Toiletries by the sink were a nice touch. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. They say it'll be renovated soon.

Text: Good location, price is steep for the level of customer service, cleanliness, guest services/amenities and quality of rooms but overall a decent place for a short stay while passing through when necessary!

Text: I read some very bad reviews about this hotel, but didn't have a choice and stayed. The reviews were not really true. I have stayed at over 80 HIE hotels this year. While it's true they do need updating, they are about to begin a full renovation. I can say that the housekeeping staff is going well beyond what some others do...this place is clean. The bed was so comfortable I fell asleep after just sitting down to watch a little TV. You should get to breakfast early though, they ran out of some things and they weren't refilled.
