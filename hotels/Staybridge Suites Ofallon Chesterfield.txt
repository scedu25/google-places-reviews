Text: Beautiful hotel.  The rooms are very nice and so is the staff.  Free hot breakfast every morning and free happy hour and dinner most weekday nights. 

My reason for not giving 5 stars is because the front desk rep gave me a room that was already occupied and I ended up walking in on someone.  When i got to my own room the toilet didn't look like it was cleaned well and I was told housekeeping would change the sheets every day but that never happened. 
There is also no bellman to help you with bags. 

I would stay here again and just tell the front desk my housekeeping concerns.

Text: The location is extremely easy to access from the highway, with plenty of food choices and a gas station right down the road. The rooms are very nicely kept, and the designs are very home-like. Also the great room and breakfast are fantastic!

Text: I would like to share but when showed up to check in was told that due to mechanical issue in the room I was to get , they had no room for us.  they tried to put us up in a place across the street.   this could not have just occurred but no phone call to inform us.   No apology to situation .  this reservation was made over 2 months prior.   Really poor service
