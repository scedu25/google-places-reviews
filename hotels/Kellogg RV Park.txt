Kellogg RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed in the campground over 6 weeks while waiting on our home to be ready. Met some great people, ate at the burger cafe (many times) enjoying most of their menu and the ice cream...  It was a great treat! Had a few campfires with other campers and that was a ton of fun! The campground staff is always a joy to talk to...  And the owner is a sweet guy who is always willing to help. We HIGHLY recommend this campground!!! Great rates, GREAT people!!

Text: Clean,comfortable and convenient.  The sites are pull through.  Our site 22 was too far from the sewage.  No we used the dump station.  
The park is right off #80.   Noise of traffic all night.  The sites are close together but everyone is friendly.

Text: Normally a good place but they often will mess up your reservation. Has never prevented us from getting a site. If your in a group that wants to be together make sure you confirm your reservation well before your trip. Sites are also very close together and not all sites have fire rings.

Text: Campground is well maintained. Sites are mostly gravel, pull through, and while there are trees for shade, we were able to position for slides.  There are some ground squirrel holes to watch out for.  Shower house is clean. Clientele is upscale. We have stayed here twice in a 5th wheel.

Text: Very friendly staff, and the food at the office/restaurant is great. There are pull thru spaces for smaller rv's with shade trees ( the larger spaces are out in the open).  The restrooms and showers are simple but clean.  I-80 is nearby, but the noise is not bad.
