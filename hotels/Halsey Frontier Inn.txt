Text: Rooms were clean and bed was comfy. The train was close but didn't bug me at all when I was asleep. Their sign says "arrive as guests and leave as family" which the owners truly lived up to. We had a wonderful time on our stay. We will definitely stay here again and would recommend to our friends.
