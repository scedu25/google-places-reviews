The Steamboat House
Rating: 5
Text: Just had the most wonderful weekend in Galena and our stay at the Steamboat House perfectly accented the trip.  We felt like we were right at home.  Breakfast was excellent and timed perfectly so you could walk downtown for shops opening.  My wife and I enjoyed relaxing in the rockers on the porch after a hard days shopping and wine tasting(s).  Coffee before breakfast, wine and cheese at 5, and homemade cookies at 8.

This was our first time going to Galena and we will definitely come back and stay at this beautiful Bed and Breakfast.

Text: I was quite happy with my stay at the Steamboat House. The room was clean and comfortable (and very pretty), although it didn't get very bright in our room (Elsie's) because the window faced a cliff wall and the light bulbs in the room didn't get very bright. Breakfast was tasty, but served a little early in my opinion (9am). The owner was friendly --she let me keep things cold in the fridge and freezer and let me keep my car parked in the lot for a few hours after I checked out. She provides wine, both red and white, and cheese and crackers in the late afternoon and cookies in the evening. The rest of the house was gorgeous and very peaceful. There is a library with information on Galena and Dubuque as well as an entire wall of DVDs that guests are welcome to take and play in their rooms. There's a billiard room, too. On top of all of that, the location was great. It took less than 5 minutes to get to Galena's main strip on Main Street and it was very nice that we had a lot to park in. The Steamboat House was everything I was looking for and at an affordable price.

Text: Really loved our stay.  The house was everything you would expect from a B&B.  The hosts were open and friendly.  Breakfast was very good and everything was freshly prepared.  Definitely will return.
