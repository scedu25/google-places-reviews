Super 8 Lexington
Rating: 2
Text: It was a nice enough hotel with simple amenities like a light breakfast, wifi, and free parking. The room was easily accessible and the furniture was in decent condition. It was quite small and awkward, but we only stayed from about 8 pm to about 9 am, so it wasn't an issue. My husband and our 3 small children slept very comfortably. Overall, I would stay again for a late night stop if we needed another hotel in Lexington, but would spring for something a little nicer for a longer stay.

Text: Was able to check in quite late. I believe there is a 24 hour check in. Room was clean and the TV had many stations. Right off 80 so that was quite convenient. Also right next a gas station so we were able to fill up before leaving the next morning.

Text: The first room we were in had a bathroom that wasn't clean. They moved us to another room with no hesitation. The new room was clean and comfortable. Even though it was marked a smoking room, it didn't smell of smoke. The shampoo bottle was half empty in the new room, so it doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to the bathrooms there. 
My experience was a mixed one. There were not so good things and minor things that didn't care about. But it wasn't a horrible experience. If you want a place to just rest your head for a night and aren't picky then go for it.
