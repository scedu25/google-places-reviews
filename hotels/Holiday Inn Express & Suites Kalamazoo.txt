Holiday Inn Express & Suites Kalamazoo
Rating: 5
Text: This hotel is one of the BEST I have stayed at. The staff were super friendly and welcoming and the hotel rooms were immaculate. I needed a hotel last minute and booked online. When I found I'd be arriving later than usual I called the front desk who assured me it was no problem. When I arrived I was created by the same gentleman who I spoke to on the phone who engaged me in conversation while completing my reservation. The staff in the lobby at breakfast were extremely friendly as well and greeted everyone who walked in. Its conveniently located near the Air Zoo just off if I-94 and not far from WMUs campus.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the Kalamazoo area!

Text: Great staff I really enjoyed my stay. The staff went over and beyond to make sure I was happy. Always kept my towels and bedsheets fresh and new. The hotel staff brought me extra coffee for the room. Stayed there 5 nights and highly recommended.

Text: Can't think of enough good things to say about this place. Clean, well-staffed, quiet rooms, great service, fast check-in and check-out. Makes me wish I was able to get myself out of bed to get their breakfast!
