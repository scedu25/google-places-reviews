The Marcum Hotel & Conference Center at Miami University
Rating: 5
Text: During a professional event I was in the lobby and conference room. I had no issues whatsoever and the hotel was in very nice shape. It's a perfect addition to Miami's campus.

Text: We requested a room with two doubles and got denied. When we arrived there were only about 5 families there. So there were obviously open rooms out of the 50+. The pull out bed I got only fit in the hallway in front of the bathroom. Speaking of which, the bathroom door was too big for the frame and didn't close, and the toilet seat wouldn't stay up. At least it looked nice.

Text: Very nice, clean hotel, with a small bar, 2 beer choice and 3 or 4 wines. Nice outdoor courtyard. Rooms comfy, not large. Beds also comfy.

Text: Comfy bed, great tv, good food. Only reason I gave a four was I didn't test the shower so can't comment on it.
