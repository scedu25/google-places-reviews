Country Inn Cafe & Motel
Rating: 5
Text: The Country Inn Motel and Cafe was one of the most enjoyable motels I stayed at while traveling Old Route 66 from California to Illinois. The room was very lovely furnished, nicer than most I stayed at during the trip. The owner made a special effort to create a lovely decorated and comfortable room, including a comfortable sitting area, flowers, and lovely artwork.  The room had a nice view of the park across the road.  The bed was very comfortable.  The room was very clean and quiet. The motel also has a wonderful restaurant, with great food and service. The family who owns the motel were very friendly, and I enjoyed visiting with them during my stay.  The motel and cafe were both great value for the price.

Text: Great breakfast selections, service was a bit slow, but it was Sunday and they were very busy. Seems like a place where all the locals go, and the food was worth the extra bit of waiting time. They were very good about keeping our beverages full while we waited, so overall, a very nice experience.

Text: My wife and I eat at the Country Inn for breakfast everyday but tonight we had dinner.  The special was 1/4 fried chicken.  It was wonderful.  For dessert we had the most delicious pie ever!!  Brenda, the owner's wife, is the pie baker and the lemon meringue pie was the best I every had.  You should stop by and have some of Brenda's pie!!

Text: The motel is right off the interstate which is easy to access! Room is extremely clean, with a charming yet vintage look! It's a no frills motel but for the price is really worth it. Free breakfast in the AM at the cafe,  is a huge plus! The cafe has delicious food, and a small town feel. If you need a good nights sleep and a satisfaction of hunger, the Country Inn Cafe & Motel is a perfect stop!

Text: After a show in St. Louis I thought I'd be able to drive straight back home to Chicago. Terrible idea, but, I was lucky enough to pull over in Livingston and stay here. 1) I love a good old fashioned motel. 2) For under $60 you get a clean quiet room, comfy bed and a complimentary breakfast. 3) Everyone was very nice .

Tom, the owner is very kind and well above and beyond your run of the mill hospitality. Thanks again and I'll give you an update on how the stew or soup turns out. 

I would definitely recommend this place  and I will certainly return if heading down that way again.
