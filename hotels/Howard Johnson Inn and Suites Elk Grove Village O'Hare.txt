Howard Johnson Inn and Suites Elk Grove Village O'Hare

Text: Clean and nice.   Several fast food places within walking distance.  Breakfast is all carbs, but it's free, so I can't complain and I really liked the pancake machine.  Rooms are a good size and there is also a cushioned window seat so you can easily sleep five people in these rooms.

Text: Decent place to stay. The rooms are a bit small but clean & quiet. Breakfast is pretty average but the pancakes are a nice feature. I appreciate the 2:00 checkin time. Staff seems nice. Lots of TV channels, though the signal is not HD. There are some fast food options and a gas station but no grocery store in the area.

Text: Rooms are on the smaller side but this hotel provides the basics needed for a cheap price. It's a bit out of the way from downtown. The area is mostly industrial. Staff are friendly and accommodating.

Text: We stayed here one weekend a couple months ago for a "staycation". We had Wyndham rewards points we needed to use anyway, so we thought "why not"!? The outside of the building is very nice and the property is kept very clean. The hallway smelled like marijuana because someone was smoking in their non-smoking room. I hate the smell but didn't complain because it was just in the hallway, it didn't get into our room. The rooms are OK, ours had a cool little "bonus bed" on the bay window. It was a really nice spot to sit and read. I didn't like that the TV was small, so high up, and in the corner of the room. It made it uncomfortable to lay in bed and watch tv. They did have a mini fridge and a microwave in the room which was nice. Breakfast was great, they have a really cool make your own pancakes machine, and the pancakes were delicious. The juices were fresh as well as the pastries. The front desk attendant was very helpful and showed us how to use the pancake maker and showed us where everything was. He was super friendly. Overall it was a good stay, and we would consider going back in the future.
