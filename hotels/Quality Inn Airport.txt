Text: Lovely staff, nice looking rooms. Horrible pool dead animals floating everywhere. Staff does not do a good job of cleaning the room all they do is make the bed we never get new towels unless we call the front office. Do not stay here we had a broken toilet so we changed rooms and the new room we got had bed bugs and we are stuck in this room for the rest of our stay. My family and I have bites everywhere. Breakfast is great though.

Text: I'm very happy with my room and bathroom. I'm very picky...bathroom and bed was amazing for the price.  I see others had issues with bathroom but mine was perfect. Breakfast couldn't be any better at restaurant next door which is where continental breakfast is!

Text: Not a bad  place to stay. The price point is comfortable. I believe we stayed in an older part of the motel that hadn't been updated as much. I am not sure. The night staff was very helpful and greeted us with a smile. The morning staff, not so much. She answered any questions I had, but she was on the phone the whole time I was in the lobby. It sounded like a personal call. It is nice to just take the shuttle to the airport. It use to be if you stayed in this airport, you could park free while you were gone. That made it more appealing. Now you pay  $6 per night.

Text: This hotel is great. Debora gave my did and I a warm welcome. The room was clean and comfortable. Even the restaurant next door, the Golden Pancake, was awesome. 10/10 would stay again.

Text: The thing I can say that was good was the free breakfast next door. It's was a awful place to stay. When u first walk in the lobby that should be a indication to leave. The smell was of cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be non smoking. In the room there was a musty smell, the mattress was springy, they probably haven't ever been changed. I will never stay at another one.
