Text: Stopped on our way through town. Tried 3 other places and they were all full. Saw the sign and tried this one. They had one room left, so we took it. Opened the door, tried to turn on the light. Nothing. Only light in the room that worked was the bathroom. Saw 3 roaches crawling around the shower stall. We were afraid to turn on anything since the TV, microwave, and mini fridge were all plugged into the same outlet. There were stains on the sheets, and the room absolutely reeked.Pillows looked like they had been run over by a steam roller. Room needs updated badly, fumigated, and cleaned thoroughly. Don't believe we'll be staying there again.

Text: Horrible place, even worse management! Reserved 2 non-smoking, king bed rooms for a 2pm check-in. Show up at 2:20 get our keys and the staff is just starting to clean the room. Take a look inside and the bed is a full/queen with an ashtray on the table! Go to look at the 2nd room and as soon as we open the door we are hit hard with the smell of smoke and a quick glance around shows an ashtray on the table in room 2 also... Go to the manager to ask for our original reservation and we are told the rooms are non-smoking and that they can't babysit the customers to be sure there's no smoking, there's a no-smoking establishment by city ordinance sign on the office window. They offer one other room but say they are full and there are no other rooms available. Go to look at the new room and yet again there is only a full/queen bed and there's a cigarette hole in the sheets and another ashtray. We go ask for our money back and are told there are no refunds.  We called to report the non-smoking ordinance violation and are told by local police that they have been to this motel on numerous occasions and have multiple complaints against them and are given recommendations for better options in the area by the officer! We ended up having to dispute the charge with our bank to get our money back. Wish we could give negative stars!!!

Text: This is the worst Hotel Ever!! Management lies and just don't care. My son in law went to stay at this hotel and when they got to the room they found bugs throughout the room, also bed bugs, stains in the linens. So they went to the management and they would do nothing about it. My son in law told them that they were not going to stay, and they wanted their money back. The management would not give them no type of refund on this room that they were in maybe 5 minutes. I have tried to contact the hotel and been hung up on lied to, and informed that they don't care. I told  Mia ( co-owner) that I was going to contact the Attorney Generals office about this. She stated I don't care that's happened before. So I filled a complaint with the Missouri Attorney General's Office. I believe that the positive reviews for this hotel are fakes ( friends of owners), the real reviews are easy to spot. Don't stay HERE.

Text: American Hotel was beautiful. It had tons of detail in the hotel lobby's, and rooms. The only problem I had with it was the cleaning. They could have done a better job. The toilet had potty stains and the windows of our room were disgusting. Other than that, the place was awesome.

Text: did not know a motel could be this bad! rude staff, they charged us $87 for a room that should have been $30!  rooms were discusting!  we would have went somewhere else but the town was full, since we were all there for a tough mudder run. we had to go to walmart and get sheet sets and blankets, because the bed sheets had stains and holes. we did not dare use the bath tub that night! and we got lysol to spray EVERYTHING! seriourly thought about sleeping in the van. DON'T go here EVER!!
