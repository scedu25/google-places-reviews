Hampton Inn Kansas City-Near Worlds of Fun
Rating: 5
Text: The location is beautiful. We drove up a tree lined road to get to the hotel and the entrance is on the side so it doesn't open onto the busy street. The room was clean and well appointed. Breakfast the next morning was included with the room and was buffet style with plenty of good food.

Text: Great location convenient to the amusement park. Very good service including the maintenance personnel. There was a maintenance issue with the lock on our room which was responded to quickly. We were comped for one of the nights of our stay. Again, great customer service.

Text: The lobby and shared areas of the hotel are very nice and is very conveniently located for Worlds of Fun. The breakfast was on par with other Hampton Inns. On the downside, the room was in need of some maintenance and cleaning. The bathroom floor was sticky. I was told that this was because the fire sprinklers had recently gone off. The shower also was in need of some heavier cleaning. Also the TV stopped working the first day. After some troubleshooting it turned out the power outlet had stopped working, which was concerning.
