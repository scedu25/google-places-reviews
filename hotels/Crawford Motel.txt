Text: I stopped here on my way through NE on 10/2/14 just to see it as I know the lady that used to run it, she is a woman in her 80's now in a nursing home in another state and all she talks about is her Crawford Motel in Central City, NE and the man who helped her run it. I was right in how I thought this placed looked. It was run down, broken windows, cars parked there that looked like they hadn't moved in months. The Lobby was locked and no one answered when I pounded on the door. Odd thing is this nasty looking motel is still being advertised in a Nebraska travel magazine. I can't imagine anyone actually staying in this place, unless you were homeless and had no choice!

Text: Honestly this motel should not be allowed to remain open.I'ts beyond filthy.Anyone staying their is putting your health in danger.Saw roaches,spiders & the presence of mold.The best opened the bed more bugs between the sheets.The owners another whole story not good!! Did i stay? I drove away & stayed else where in Central City.Which was a great place.
