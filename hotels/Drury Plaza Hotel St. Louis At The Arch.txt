Drury Plaza Hotel St. Louis At The Arch
Rating: 5
Text: I have never been to a Drury Inn and received poor service. The staff is always incredibly friendly and personable. They are always willing to help you and they are always smiling. I love their 5:30 kickback too (free dinner!) Which also saves us one more meal we have to buy. The rooms are also clean and very nice with fridge and microwaves. Overall, Drury Inn is one of the best hotels to choose from. The price is very well worth it and even that isn't bad!

Text: Hotel was very nice looking and had great security. The food there was good, as well as the snacks. Rooms and amenities were great as well, and I particularly thought it was interesting they had reusable body wash/shampoo/conditioner dispensers in the shower. The shower heads were good too now that I mention it. Overall, was a good stay. Definitely recommend, prime location too!

Text: Now this is what you call a hotel in a big city that knows how to treat their guests! The rooms are so immaculate condition and so beautiful inside nice and big and roomy! Comfortable beds with nice feeling sheets! Breakfast every morning which is delicious! A dinner buffet at night that is amazing!!! Also have a thing called kickback that comes with your room that gives you 3 free drinks per night from 530 to 7!!! We will be staying at this place everytime we come to St Louis from now on!!! What a superb place!!!

Text: Great experience at this hotel! Staff was courteous and helped out our group through numerous changes and odd-time checkouts/check-ins. Free breakfast and free "social hour" (which included dinner and 3 free drinks) were a welcome surprise. The quality of the food was alright, but free is free. Views from my room (608) looked out right over the Old Courthouse, with looks at the Arch if you really stretch out. Walking distance to the Arch, Courthouse, and Cardinals stadium. This place does get packed with Cardinals fans during home games though, so book early.
