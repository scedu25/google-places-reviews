Text: I have stayed at Ashley Quarters several times for my husbands job. It is always wonderful! Great  always clean rooms! Nice choices for breakfast! In the warmer months the outdoor grill and pool areas are wonderful! Ashley Quarters is perfect for long term stays with the fully stocked kitchens!

Text: Ashley Quarters is a fantastic home away from home.  You are treated like family at this independently owned hotel.  The rooms have full sized kitchens and appliances and are huge.  Mattresses are very comfortable and the newly renovated bathrooms have sweet rain shower heads.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the variety of people you meet is awesome due to the new local attraction, the Ark encounter, and the international business people that stay long term.  This place is a gem, none like it!!

Text: Arrived at 2 a.m. & able to access our keys just as promised!  Spotless, modern & so comfortable!  Email correspondences & helpful map made a long drive tolerable!  Thank you for the best hotel of our trip!  Highly recommend Ashley Quarters over any named "chain" hotel!

Text: Stayed here for about 4 nights and the place was absolutely amazing.  The room was incredibly clean and comfortable. I loved the full kitchen.  If anything, the continental breakfast was a little light, but I understand that considering we're given a full kitchen, the hotel wouldn't need to spend much money on preparing us breakfast.

It's located near a bunch of restaurants and shops.  It is also very close to the Florence Mall, maybe about a 5 minute drive if anything.

I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any family or friends that are/will be visiting the area.
