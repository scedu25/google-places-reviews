Courtyard by Marriott Bloomington Normal

Text: We were staying overnight for two nights for a family trip. The beds we're nice and the room was clean. The only problem we had was our toilet did not flush right. However, it was fixed immediately after we mentioned it. Overall, very happy.

Text: Rooms are updated (as of mid 2017) but some of the basics are missing, like proper working locks on glass sliding doors and even deadbolts lining up well on the room door. The bistro for breakfast (what I can speak to) produces very basic foods - only the fruit seems fresh, not frozen. The gym has two treadmills, one elliptical, and an adjustable bench with some dumbbells. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and quiet at night, is in a safe area of town, and has quick access to the interstate. Decent option for the area.

Text: We we're told the couch turned into a pull out full bed and that a cot would be available. Cot wasn't available and the couch bed was only a twin, and very uncomfortable. Staff was nice, but also no breakfast. Not impressed

Text: Room was very clean and modern. This hotel has rooms with outside decks which is great on nice evenings. The staff was great.
