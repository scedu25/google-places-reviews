Text: I will give this place a double "F" and that would be nice. This is the deplorable and most dated place I have ever been in. We arrived late into the night and were very tired and just decided rather than sleep in our vehicle we would just stay there. WRONG move we should had slept in our vehicle. We were told that they are in the process of remodeling and there were new items in their parking lot on lifts on trucks. I wish them luck and we appreciated the room for the 2 nights, but we will never, ever return.

Text: I was told I could get a refund and given a hand written and signed receipt. When I was 5hrs away at home they decided to call and say "no more refund".
In my room the tv was broken, cheap carpet, a.c. was rigged up where it wouldn't really work, fowl odor in the whole building, doors leading out of the rooms didn't work, broken toilet seat, no covers on the receptacles, and the list goes on. This place is a joke and sorry individuals try to run it.

Text: Rooms were very dirty; stains on pillows and sheets, cobwebs in corners, rust on light switch plate, carpet not vacuumed, two towels in bathroom had brownish dust covering from not having been used or laundered, handle on door to parking lot completely broken, and a strong odor of cigarettes, body odor, and urine. We'd have left immediately if there were other vacant hotels within ten miles. They also jacked the room price up twenty dollars over the advertised price. We all woke up congested and warm from no air flow. Please avoid this "hotel" unless you are in dire need and have a strong immune system.
