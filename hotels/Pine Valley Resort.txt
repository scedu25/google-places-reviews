Pine Valley Resort
Rating: 4
Text: Cabin with two beds, fully equipped . Clean and quiet Came in after 10 pm. without a reservation. Halfway point from Sturgis to home. Owners provided us with coffee for the next morning! We are planning to include Long Pine in our ride home next year and stay a few days to unwind. Would have givin it 5 stars but the driveway to the cabin is steep and soft sand in places. Ride out was...  interesting. Thanks Going Again.

Text: Spent a night on a whim.  Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The owners are extremely personable and helpful.  Clean, comfortable, and very good value.  Whether a family or a couple looking for a convenient place to stay, this is ideal.

One point.  The resort is actually West of the location on google earth.  A turn to the north at the street leading to Long Pine is the actual entrance to the resort.  There's a sign.

Text: This place is the best in the area. Beautiful cabins. Well equipped with full kitchen with pots, pans, dishes, small appliances. Very clean. Air conditioning, charcoal grills, plenty of space, long pine creek access, tube rentals... Even a awesome pavilion in the middle of the cabins with its own sink, refrigerator, stereo, fire pit, grills, toys for the kids, put-put and horseshoes. Great place for large family gatherings!
