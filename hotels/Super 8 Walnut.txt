Super 8 Walnut

Text: DIRTY!... The bathroom was falling apart. There were young dead roaches in the hall and under the bed - which means they are spraying for them often, which means there is a problem!
The ONLY positive was that there were no bed bugs.  It took an hour to get an extra blanket. And the pull out couch... was just a chair with a foot rest. I would never stay here again, I would assume sleep in my car.

Text: I usually avoid Super 8 like the plague after some horrid experiences, but this one has pleasantly surprised me. It's not really up to date, but it's clean, doesn't smell, and has friendly staff. The furniture in the rooms is in good repair, the showers work well, and the beds are decent. I haven't eaten the breakfast due to dietary restrictions; it looks "meh" but not awful. My only semi-major complaint is that the air units aren't great (noisy, always either too warm or not warm enough). But they're also not moldy like at the last Super 8 I stayed at, so I'll take it!

Text: Great customer service from Brian. Encouraging during late night calls to change reservations, courteous, and very helpful. Room was clean. Breakfast reached deep into mediocrity or I'd give this hotel a 5* rating. Pets welcomed. Great stay for overnight travel. Decent value for $.

Text: Great place. Rooms are very clean and very quiet. Comfy beds. Diane, who checked us in, was extraordinary!  She went out of her way to help us out. All 3 staff members we interacted with were friendly and helpful.

Text: BEWARE OF BED BUGS!!! Itch happened all over in the middle of the night, so lifted the bed sheets and found bed bugs!!! Motel gave a refund, but it's the MOST UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE when you need decent sleep after many hours of driving.
