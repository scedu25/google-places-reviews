Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Jackson
Rating: 3
Text: Two fellow students and myself spent three nights in Jackson Michigan at the Fairfield hotel. The customer service was awesome, the breakfast was very delcious, rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. However, when we went to use the amenities of the hotel (the hot tub) it was scalding hot to the point where we could not stand in it for more than 10 seconds. We asked politely that night and the next morning if they could turn down the temp., they failed to do so. Not a huge deal, more of an annoyance. Everything else was superb!

Text: This was a nice stay. There was nothing that really sticks out as particularly good or bad. The room was a little dated. The one thing I was happy with was that the pillows actually had some body to them. Sometimes you need 2-3 hotel pillows to be comfortable. That wasn't the case here.

Text: It was very nice, clean, and the staff were very friendly. It was a nice surprise to find out they had a hot tub and the temperature was perfect. Quite relaxing and the breakfast was good.

Text: Clean room, the breakfast spread was plentiful. Very friendly staff, always greeted us coming and going. The price was ok I guess, room was 139 the first night and 109 the second night, no explanation why. Many TV channels were fuzzy but not that big of a deal . Lots of places to eat nearby. I would recommend.

Text: Rooms and service are in pretty good shape. Be careful of the irons they use here, it burned my clothes on a medium setting and was largely useless on the lower settings. There was also a bug in my bathroom at night, and was still there in the morning (it was pretty chill so I didn't bother it). The breakfast buffet is pretty tops for a free deal: scrambled eggs, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, toppings, juice, fruit, and more.
