Days Inn Grand Island

Text: The place was filthy. Every surface had stains, and just little ones. The entire chair was stained with what was clearly bodily fluids. The smell and filth were so unbearable we didn't even stay the night. We couldn't bring ourselves to chance the bed. Even the bedding was stained yellow everywhere. Absolutely disgusting place.

Text: Nice clean hotel in a fun town. Our room was warm when we first got there, but we cranked up AC and it was fine after about 30 minutes.  Breakfast in morning was really good, they had waffles biscuits and gravy, eggs, fruit ;just a nice variety.  People were really nice who worked there too.

Text: Slept good.  Our room came with a microwave and refrigerator.  Free breakfast was a nice touch.  I am happy.

Text: I've been staying here at least a couple nights each month for the last 6 months. The place is very clean the staff is extra friendly! The breakfast isn't too bad at all, and there's over a million places to eat within walking distance. A few bars as well! The only thing I wish they had was a pool.
