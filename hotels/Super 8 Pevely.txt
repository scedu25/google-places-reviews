Super 8 Pevely
Rating: 5
Text: Stopped here on the way to 6 flags. Easy booking and check in. The staff was really friendly. The rooms are decent for 50 bucks. The shower had decent pressure, the bed was pretty comfy and everything was pretty clean with the exception of the carpet, it could use a good shampooing or 2. Enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Breakfast was just ok. I would stay again.

Text: This is an awesome hotel! Very clean, very good rates and amenities. We love the pool and hot tub. Perfect temperature. I give props to the maintenance for keeping it up and housekeepers for keeping the hotel neat and smelling good when you walk in. I've stayed at many super 8 or smaller hotels and I can say this property and staff are outstanding and so nice and welcoming when you walk through the door. I used to work at a very expensive hotel downtown and I can say super 8 can top that hotel with kindness and cleanliness. Most 4 or 5 star hotels just rob you of your money unlike the super 8 here you get what you paid for and more with the amenities and customer service. Keep up the good work Pevely Super 8!

Text: online booking, ratings were not too bad....  the hotel is in shambles and needs major attention.  our reserved king bed room has stuff smeared on the bathroom walls along with hairs stuck to it.  was a smoking room and nobody made that apparant to us. (wasn't aware they were even still available).  they swapped us to a double room, this one eith no fridge/microwave like in the king room we reserved.  our cold stuff (small cooler with drinks) wasn't cold in the morning as we had planned.  we accomidated though and pressed on.  i could not recommend this place to my friends or family.
