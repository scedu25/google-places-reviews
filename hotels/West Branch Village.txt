Text: my brother lived here for 10 years and i have been here almost 3. not bad at all. i have never had any problems. sometimes dogs from the dog park get the dogs barking here in the daytime but its not to bad. better than living in iowa city where there are sirens all the time and noisy town sounds.  there is a pretty decent cement tornado shelter, and extra parking there for campers and things. my location is mostly quiet. and as long as you do your part keeping your lot looking nice and pay your rent no one bothers you:) i will never go back to apartment living.

Text: Lived here for a year now and it is my opinion that this is the most cleanest mobile home village that we have ever seen. It is extremely family oriented and kid friendly. Management is extremely helpful in matters and do a great job on the up keep of the mobile home village. They offer different programs for the community such as shed purchase, payment plans for buying mobile homes. Over all it is a great place to live and we would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.

Text: West Branch Village is so well maintained and cared for.  The staff does an excellent job and are very nice.  The community was set up with consideration for families...children...even to mindful of fur family members.  With a park, a storm shelter, storage facilities etc...you can tell the community was created with consideration for those that live here.  During the summer there are events and there are pride in ownership awards.  If you need help getting something done they really try to help get you there.  Everything is nice and clean.  And best of all...the Hames family!  What a wonderful family they are.  Curtis is very kind and always seems to have a smile. Troy is probably one of the kindest men I've ever met.  He genuinely cares about other people and wants them to be comfortable and happy.  He just has this very warm and compassionate presence.  I've only spoken with Mr. Hames (the elder) on the phone but I was smiling the whole time...what a wonderfully lovely man!  If you want to live in a well-cared for, well-maintained, family friendly community run by kind and considerate property owners, this is the place to be.  Five stars are simply not enough!  I wish the lots were a little bigger...I mean, they are pretty normal sized and not small...I just wish they were a little bigger.
