Text: Worst experience of my life! Room was disgusting, there were bugs and food left in the refrigerator from previous guests. Toilet would not flush. Water would not drain! Drawers full of crumbs! This place needs to be shut down by health department!!

Text: Nothing bad about this place at all. We stayed over night in a smoking room. I was surprised how fresh it smelled. Beds were extremely comfortable, crisp, clean sheets, comfy pillows. The place is clean and kept up. Managers were extremely nice and continental breakfast was delicious. Biscuits and gravy baby!!! :)
Cheapest around also.

Text: The clerk didnt know how to run the credit card, the room was decent, but the bed wasn't comfortable. It's ok for an overnight stay, but i wouldn't suggest any longer.

Text: Customer service was excellent. Staff was professional & polite upon check in & check out. Staff asked several time if we needed anything & if everything was ok. Definitely patron friendly. Thank you for our nights stay. Breakfast in the morning was hot breakfast, juice, coffee waffles, fruit, cereal, oatmeal. Perfect for the family
