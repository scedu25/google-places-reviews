Hampton Inn & Suites Effingham

Text: While the rooms were nice, planning a room block here was far more difficult than I should have been. On several occasions our guests could not get a room within the block because the front desk receptionists did not know how to make this happen. As a result I had to call the program coordinator each time to get our guests added. Also we couldn't get a final guest count because none of the receptionists knew how to do this. Not the end of the world but easily preventable.

Text: Great hotel located off the interstate. Very clean and well kept. If you need a room just to sleep and relax while on the road this is a good place. We have stayed here twice while traveling to visit family and find it to be consistent in quality and service.
