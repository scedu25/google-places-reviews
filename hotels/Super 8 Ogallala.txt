Super 8 Ogallala
Rating: 4
Text: Easy access to the interstate, fast food and gas stations. Well lit parking. Central access to rooms, no parking lot access to the room doors. Bathroom was simple but well stocked with fresh towels and soaps. Beds and bedding were good. Breakfast has waffles and toast with fruit and yogurt complementing the pastries. Not a large breakfast room but plenty of seating and it was not crowded. A good value for the cost. I would seek out this Super 8 to stay in the future.

Text: Rooms are kind of small. Hardly had anything for breakfast. Make your own waffles, apples, and prepackaged cinnamon buns that's about it. But we did pass by toward the end. They do have a coin operated washer and dryer which was pretty nice but have a limited time to use it. We got there about 8-830 and you could also use it until 9pm which kind of sucks.

Text: Stayed 1 night with my husband and very satisfied with experienced. I'd like to recognize the staff from the housekeeper, receptionist and manager who took an extra effort and time to mail me the sunglasses I left in the room. I called them the next day when I found out  I left it in the room and everything was taken care off, what a great team. Kudos and will definitely come back in the future. Thanks a lot!

Text: For being a quick stop for the night, it was an awesome experience! Front desk was helpful and kind, the breakfast was good, parking was nice. Our room was tidy and the pillows were awesome! Though housekeeping comes around 8-9am, you gotta keep in mind that they are on top of things because of the high demand they are in trying to deliver quality customer service efficiently. Great price for what you are getting. Also the maids were so kind and patient!
