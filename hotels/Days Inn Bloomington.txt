Days Inn Bloomington

Text: My friend and I were in town for a football game and stayed at this Days Inn in Bloomington. Let's start with the fact that we paid $300 for one night because of "event pricing". That's nearly 5 times what you would be charged if you were just staying there with no event going on ($66/night), I drove home the day after our stay and realized when I got home that I had left my pillow at the hotell. I have left items at other hotels before and never had any problem getting them back. I called the Days Inn in Bloomington and the man I talked to on the phone tells me I have to come back to Bloomington to get my pillow because "the owner doesn't allow us to send items back to people  because we're too busy". I'm going to be honest with you. This hotel is 2* at best and I had interactions with the staff while I was there. I wouldn't consider them to have been "too busy". I understand things go on that a customer wouldn't see but there weren't that many people there and it didn't seem like it would've been an issue to send someone to the post office to send out some items. I even offered to pay up front for shipping and was still told they couldn't do it! I ended up calling corporate where I'm told that what was going on "does not line up with Wyndham policy" and was able to file a complaint. Now I have to wait for someone to get in contact with me "within the next week" in order to get something done. I won't be staying at another Days Inn. The only reason we stayed there was because of the location of the event and the proximity of the hotel to the event. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. And God help you if you make a mistake and leave something more important than a pillow.

Text: In all honesty, zero stars. Bed bug infested and not even a callback from the owner. Better off sleeping outside.

Text: Negative ratings horrible , if homeless people were offfed a free stay I think they would refuse.  The shower was dirty , you feet stuck to the rug.  Worst part is they got to charge 300.00 because of a game day!  They should honestly be shut down by the health department.  Oh and the toilet didn’t work!  I would be afraid to stay here since we used the ice bucket to fill the toilet my guess is after they found it next to the toilet they would put it back on the counter , I wouldn’t stay here.  Honestly if people stop staying there they would be forced to shut down!!!

Text: This is by far the worst days inn I've ever stayed in I travel for work and have stayed at much nicer ones than this the room was full of bed bugs and had a smell of methane gas in bathroom and the rest of room spelled of cigarette smoke and it was a non smoking room beds were very uncomfortable. Not worth the money to stay at this place and I wouldn't recomend this hotel to anyone.

Text: If you like your room not cleaned,  hot water going on and off while showering, TV not working,  and having to go back because hot key cards stop working.... this is the place for you.  Absolute nightmare experience and would rather stay on the floor in my son's dorm room than at this hotel again.
