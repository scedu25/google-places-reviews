ROSE CORNER INN
Rating: 5
Text: This gracious, well appointed, Victorian bed and breakfast far exceeded my expectations!  Within walking distance of Hillsdale College and Hillsdale's historic downtown, it was convenient, comfortable, and very, very quiet. 
There were several guests at the Rose Corner Inn during our stay, but we felt like we had the place all to ourselves.
