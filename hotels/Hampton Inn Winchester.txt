Text: Beyond excellent customer service! One of the best hotels I've ever been to! Had an issue with bed frame sticking out (pictured), I did cut my leg but they offered to comp a night and gave me an Amazon gift card.

Text: Beautiful hotel! Clean big king size room, we stayed 2 nights for a family party down the road. Our room was quiet and accommodating, everything very clean and impressed with the hair dryer!!   We will definitely stay here again for future visits with our family living in Winchester!    I gave 5 stars but I would have given 10.......

Text: This Hampton Inn ROCKS!  Wife and I checked in around 5:30 pm and we were in our room in minutes... fastest checkin ever.  Then we were surprised that Genny (Night Manager) put on a Beet Stew and/or Chicken N Dumplings buffet for the guests at 7pm.  Wife and I did not  have to leave the INN and spend another $40 for dinner.  We figure we saved about $30 on breakfast and another $40 for dinner.  Winchester Hampton Inn is awesome.

Text: Greeted with warm cookies and appetizers. King bed comfortable, room beautiful. Neutrogena toiletries. Probably the best hotel breakfast I have had in a long time! Waffles, oatmeal, Canadian bacon, fresh fruit, seriously the best! Even had breakfast to go bags for those folks. Stay here!
