Text: Place was disgusting. Everything in the room was broken from the door to the drawers to stained dirt in the tub. Can you believe they had sheets stuffed in pillow cases as your pillow. Towels were literally brown and had black stains on them. I asked for a refund considering i couldnt stay there and they were not trying to give it to me untill i called the health department.
