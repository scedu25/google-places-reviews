Country Hearth Inn & Suites - Mexico
Rating: 3
Text: We upgraded to the executive suite which included a nice jacuzzi tub. The room was large and had a balcony overlooking the pool area which would have been fantastic if we'd had kids. The room has all the standard amenities, but dated - a remodel is really in order. The bed was super hard and, in spite of an exhausting day dirt bike riding across the state, I didn't sleep well at all. The staff was super nice and did all the could to take care of us. They were more friendly than most, certainly, and they get five stars. I'd forgotten a toothbrush, but they didn't have any at the front desk which was also a disappointment. The motel is right off of 54, south of town, and conveniently close to Walmart which had toothbrushes. It was an okay stay, but because of the bed, if try a different place next time.

Text: Great crew! Gave us a good deal and helped is out when we were in a pinch, tired and road weary. Rooms were clean, but construction was subpar. Like, they painted before the drywall was sanded. Big glops of drywall mud we're painted over and the tile in the bathroom was smashed. But it was clean and the staff was awesome.

Text: Hotel was just ok the customer service was good but the rooms stunk and the carpets clearly needed a shampoo. The man opened the pool early for us which was nice because it allowed us to get on the road earlier. Pool was fine it's not a heated pool but was not too cold to get into. Pictures make hotel look nicer then it is it's a little run down. Breakfast was ok. Someone else made it sound like just toast but they hand cinnamon rolls and honey buns cereal bagels and muffins and bananas so not terrible. I plan to stay elsewhere else next time just because it stinks
