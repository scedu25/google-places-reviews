Text: It's a place to lay down. Not much more. Check in area reeked of cat urine. TV in my room didn't work. Bed spread had to be 25 years old. Towels torn and stained. Don't go in with ANY expectations and you won't be disappointed. I rated 2 stars because I'm sure there are places that are worse.  Don't know where those who rated it 4 or 5 stars stayed, but it wasn't this place.

Text: What a dump! Zero stars, stay away. 
Room had 3 holes in wall, tv had broken screen, only 1 light worked. Bathroom toilet ran all night, wet carpet near toilet. Linens very old and rough. The furniture was old, tub/shower even older. I've seen better stuff in the Goodwill dumpster. 
I dunno who would ever rate this 4 stars unless they just got out of a Mexican prison. Might be the worst hotel I have ever spent a night in.

Text: This place is disgusting. The owner is an ass, treats people awful. The beds are stained and the showers don't work. The staffing is awful, the people are disgusting. I would rather stay on the streets than in this gross disease trap.
