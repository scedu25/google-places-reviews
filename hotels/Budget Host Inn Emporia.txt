Text: First, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have stayed in alot of hotels, expensive and cheaper ones.  When I booked this hotel for under 40$, I honestly didn't expect much. But when we arrived I pleasantly surprised with free WiFi, clean room,  nice size tv with local and HBO and other upgrade stations.  It was also quite.  The front desk was nice and helpful. I would definitely go back!!
