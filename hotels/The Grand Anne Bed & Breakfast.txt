Text: My girlfriend and I drove 5 hours to get here and we were not even the slightest bit disappointed. We arrived after regular check in hours and they had no problem working with us to check in and get situated. Everything was simply amazing. The house itself was beautiful and the rooms were absolutely stunning. Very comfortable with an amazing view. The breakfast the next morning was fantastic, hot and extremely flavorful. Extremely wonderful expirence with an extremely friendly staff. HIGHLY recommend staying here. It is very much worth it!

Text: We stayed here during the Nauvoo pagent. It was about a 30 minute drive to get to Nauvoo. When we got there none of the workers/hosts were there. Our keys were taped on the front door with the room we were staying in. We stayed in Carol's-look out, it was a nice room. The bathroom was very small. Only a toilet and walk in shower were in there. The sink was next to the bed built into the wall-very interesting. We had to leave before breakfast was served, so i am not sure how that was. When we were getting ready to leave, none of the hosts were there-Odd. Overall the building was fun to stay in. Could use a coat of paint on the outside. The details inside were perfect for the Victorian styled home.

Text: Location was great, had a nice view of the Mississippi River. Breakfast in the morning was delicious! The hosts were nice. We stayed in the Tower Suite on the third floor. My only complaints would be that the room doesn't lock from the outside and the shower head wasn't ideal. Everything else was perfect and well thought out.
