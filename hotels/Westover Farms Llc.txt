Text: My fiance and I stayed in the Inn for a night during a hiking trip. The room was better than I expected. The photos don't do it justice. The building and amenities seemed like new. The bed was comfortable, especially with the super plush comforter. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We also loved exploring the grounds. Very beautiful scenery and stream. We even got to see a muskrat swimming in the water.

Text: Our Family of six stayed the night after a canoe trip.  It was a great experience.   Our cabin was rustic, with all the comforts of home. We ate all our meals in the kitchen and it helped keep the family hanging out more.

Lisa & Tom were helpful and delightful to be around.   Our kids had a great time on a walk about and hanging out.  We are not fisherman/women which did not hamper our visit as there was lots of other things to do.

This was a great camping trip for my family.  Nothing like staying in a four star cabin in the woods.

Text: Westover Farms provided a great afternoon of fly-fishing for myself and my 8 year-old nephew. He caught his first couple of rainbows on a fly and couldn't be more excited. We had a blast exploring the water and the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and inviting. Can't wait to go back.
