Knights Inn Ottawa
Rating: 5
Text: The best property in Ottawa and I've stayed at them all. Grew up in Ottawa but have lived out of state for 13 years, so visit family often. All Ottawa hotels are budget, mid-tier. Knights Inn is a budget hotel but stands out among them all. The rooms are big and very clean, with DIRECTV, nice pillows and great breakfast. I didn't stay at Knights Inn right away because I thought it would be too loud being close to Main Street and seemed small - but I wish I booked it from the beginning, 13 years ago! Impressive rooms, comfortable, clean, great price. Plus, the managers, Mr. and Mrs. Patel are wonderful. Stay here, you won't be disappointed!

Text: I don't require fancy, but I do require clean.  The room was a dive!  Non-smoking, but smelled of smoke.  The folks in the neighboring room backed their pickup in front of our room and sat on the tailgate smoking... constantly.  Wall paint by nightstand marred big time, phone was filthy, inside of door and door frame was grubby, a squashed bug on the sheets, dead bugs on floor in bathroom and main room, carpet soiled throughout, floor uneven, like the concrete under the carpet had holes and major cracks.  Complained and they did move us to the handicapped room, which was better.  Would not recommend this place and will not be staying here again.  We chose this place because of the positive reviews.  Positive would not describe what we found!  I don't know why, but the site is not putting the pictures I uploaded on this review.
