Rating: 5
Text: Spacious sites, friendly and helpful staff delivers wood right to your site. Very clean and up to date bathrooms (they even pipe in music). Store has fast food items and souvenir shop. Didn't use the pool but looked very clean with lounge chairs. Very nice Campground that is well managed...we'll be back.

Text: My family, extended family and friends have stayed here before and this is one well run KOA. I can't say enough about the staff friendliness, professionalism, thoughtfulness, etc...  The facilities are newer than most campsites and the very clean. I could go on and on but you have to do some research yourself. :). I'll conclude by saying; the have an ice cream shop, you can have tasty pizza delivered to your site and you would not believe the selection of homemade fudge!!

Text: Road into campground steep but doable, sites are roomy, general store has a lot, pool is small and the playground is small too.  Restricted  to 1 vehicle per site, my daughter had to park & leave her car up by the pool parking. Restrooms tiled, clean,  nice showers  good hot water! The entire campground sits on a hill. You are in Hocking Hills! Bike riding, unless your an athlete or mountain bike rider, is out. Unfortunately  we were here for Hippie Fest but thunderstorms kept us from going. But didn't  keep us from seeing the other main (usual) attractions everyone comes here to see!  Only gave it a 3 because small pool and not much at the campground to do but you have ALL the area to explore!  Good place to camp!   Would stay here again!

Text: This campground is in a beautiful setting.  The sites, while not huge, are big enough that you have a little elbow room.  Bathrooms, store, and activity room are all well-kept, and the staff is extremely friendly.

Text: We had a wonderful time. It was in mid September and things were slowing down, but the pool was still open. On a Sunday afternoon we had the pool all to ourselves!  Staff is so friendly and helpful. We love this place!
