Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park™ Camp-Resort at Dogwood Valley
Rating: 4
Text: Our family had a wonderful stay at Dogwood Valley last weekend.
We attended the Zombie weekend and our kids (9,5) had a blast.  The activities were well organized and fun.   The staff was very friendly and had great attitudes.  The boats were also available and our daughter loved trying paddle boarding!

About the campground (Tent Camping)
- The tent sites are a reasonable distance to the bathroom
- The sites are large enough to accommodate a large tent and dining tent and still have room for kids to play
- The restrooms were newer, very clean and free hot water showers (best camping restrooms I've encountered)
- Delivery of firewood and ice was quick and if you don't have cash they can put on your card on file
- Not many hiking trails
- Why they lost a star?....we requested a flat site and had one on a slight hill, not great when sleeping and kids around the fire.

We will most likely visit this park again, especially in the summer to enjoy swimming in the pond!

Text: Such a fantastic experience for my whole family. From the time I booked our cabin until we checked out after our stay, the staff was amazing! We had never really camped before, and they made sure we brought all the things we would need so there wouldn't be any unexpected surprises or need to leave for forgotten supplies. The grounds were spotless, the camp store was stocked with anything and everything you can imagine, and the activities staff was incredibly kind and welcoming. I would recommend this resort to my family and friends and anyone looking for some time away with their family. My kids never once said they were bored and their mobile devices sat unused the entire time. The owners personally greeted us and made us feel right at home. We look forward to trying to find an open spot again before the end of the season. Definitely book ahead because this place is very popular and fills up quickly!

Text: We're avid campers and really enjoyed our time here. Family focused campground with a plethora of activities. The grounds are clean, well maintained and plenty of mature trees offer great shade to most of the sites. We stayed at site 406. Look forward to returning next season!

Text: I had a terrific time at Dogwood Valley, the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. As novice campers, we wanted to find a location with activities and a clean, cozy environment. We found this and more at Dogwood Valley. I highly recommend Dogwood Valley for memorable family bonding, and time to unwind and relax. Thank you for an amazing experience. I definitely am looking forward to our next trip!

Text: Wonderful place for families! Activities all day long starting with a flag raising every morning at 9 am with Yogi and Boo boo! I can't say enough about the friendliness of the staff! Miss Karen and Ranger John were so good with the kids. Restrooms were clean and there were plenty to choose from. We had a blast!
