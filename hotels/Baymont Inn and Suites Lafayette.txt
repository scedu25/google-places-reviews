Text: We stayed here a couple years ago and it was great, which is why we returned this year. However, the couple of years wear was extremely evident. The room was fine, bed comfortable, service ok. However, the bathroom had ceramic tiles broken and missing, black mold on the wall above the shower and around the faucet knobs. We had to go to the desk to get more towels as there weren't enough in the room for the 4 of us registered guests. The breakfast ended earlier than what we were familiar with from other hotels and we missed it. It's time to redo and renew at this location. We'd like to be back.

Text: Staff was very nice. However the room could be cleaner. I saw a popcorn kernel on the floor, they provided a blow dryer however there was no place tp plug it in. They did some painting in the bathroom but they missed a couple of spots. I had to blow dry my hair out by the refrigerator since there's no outlet in the bathroom.  The bed was comfortable

Text: This place is in a nice quiet location. But its in serious need of a total facelift. Carpet looks worn, linens are dingy, furniture looks old and saggy. No hot food available at 6 am as advertised. Room key didn't work and has to back to front desk. I have stayed here 1-2 times annually for business and seen it go down hill. This was my last stay here.

Text: The Good: Place was clean and quiet. Breakfast was the average free breakfast.
Location is good right off I65 and about 15 minutes to Purdue.
The Bad: sheets and bedding old and stained, extremely thin in places. Towles stained. Curtains were ripped.
It's OK place if you need a cheap place to stay for just a night.
