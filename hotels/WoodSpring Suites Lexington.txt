WoodSpring Suites Lexington
Rating: 5
Text: After a divorce I found a beautiful extended stay in Lexington Kentucky. From the management, Ms. Brenda to the head housekeeper Ms. Charlotte I found a welcoming, attentive and caring staff. Not only do they make you feel like your part of the family but they extended kind heart felt service. They are amazingly strong and beautiful.

Text: TOTAL SCAM. I called a few days ago to ask about age requirements to rent room. While I was on the phone the desk lady asked me if I was booking through a travel website (which I was) so she told me that if I booked straight through the hotel she would give me a great deal. She gave me the pricing of $64 for one night which was awesome! We get to the hotel today and they charged my card $94 instead of the promised price. They won’t do anything about it. ALSO their “free wifi” has as good of a connection as Chevrolet and Ford. Don’t book a room here.

Text: Fire alarm pulled, smoke in the non smoking hallways, messed up reservation, ID kept at front counter, booked a king sized bed, dogs in adjoining rooms that bark loudly, and not able to get a refund with all these complaints. They blamed all this on the booking site.

Text: Very basic, even a bit sparse, but fairly clean and geared toward extended stays.  

4th floor goes to smokers and the first room I got on the third floor also smelled strongly of smoke.
