RIVER'S EDGE MOTEL
Rating: 5
Text: Wonderful stay. Beautiful scenery. Rooms had everything we needed. Owners are VERY kind and helpful. While in the area we unfortunately hit a deer. Owners helped us find a tow truck, a place to have windshield replaced, and the next morning even drove my husband to pick up our van. (20 miles each way) !
Highly recommend!!!

Text: I cannot say enough positive things about the River's Edge Motel. My daughter, baby granddaughter & I spent two days and nights in adjoining rooms #42 & #43, and we had a wonderful stay while there. The rooms were immaculately clean, and had a very nice size flat screen tv, a small sofa, a desk & chair, a refrigerator, a microwave, a coffee pot, a hair dryer, and plenty of room for us even with all of the baby paraphernalia that we had with us. The view of the bridge from our balcony was so beautiful and we spent several hours in the evening sitting on the balcony, relaxing, and enjoying the view. The owners were both so kind and nice to us and were very responsive to anything that we might need. They came in on our second day there and cleaned the rooms spotlessly even though we did not expect that. The room rates were very reasonable. We have several family members who are buried in Riverview Cemetery, and Jordan Buffalo Cemetery, and we like to visit at least once a year to pay our respects and put flowers on the graves. This is our first year to spend a couple of days/nights while visiting and we are so glad that we did so. The River's Edge Motel could not have been a nicer place to call home while we were there.

Text: It's a nice hotel with a beautiful view of the river. The rooms were pretty nice, although the showerhead was pretty confusing. Despite that, the motel was a very nice place overall.

Text: Wonderful. I had booked into the Eagle's Nest B&B but no one was there to let us in and no one answered any of the SIX numbers I had for them (DO NOT GO TO EAGLE'S NEST!) Found the River's Edge and got such a warm, friendly greeting, help finding our way around town, accommodations are clean and updated. Everything perfect. Thank you!
