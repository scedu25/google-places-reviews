Best Western Macomb Inn

Text: Extremely disappointed! We went for my daughter's birthday and we weren't happy. Not worth $100/ night. The staff were ok, but should've been much more helpful. The pool/ exercise area was a disaster... Very dangerous! The websites need to be updated because they say one amenity is the hot tub, nope. Possibility of a smoking room, nope.  I have never had issues with a best western until then.  I will definitely rethink going there again.

Text: Traveled from Chicago for a friends wedding and stayed the night there.

My only complaint, which brought it down a star, was that even though there was a room block for a wedding, I could only reserve a double queen room for 2 of us. $200 for one night was a little ridiculous. Though I was also told that it was because of Western Illinois' homecoming.

The service was great. The wedding was at 2:30pm, but check-in isn't until 3pm. I called and asked the front desk girl if there was any way we can get in earlier and she found a room for us at 1:30pm, despite being booked solid the night before. Made it to my friends wedding dressed and on-time. 

Continental breakfast was pretty decent too, considering it was included. Make-your-own waffles, breakfast burritos, yogurt, scrambled eggs, sausage, and other basics. Would definitely stay again if in the area, and if the price was 50% lower.

Text: Great hotel! I stay there every year when I visit my family. They are always so sweet and kind. The only problem is a lack of a jacuzzi.

Text: Property is nice, rooms spacious, clean, and fairly priced.  Conveniently located to WIU.  Front desk staff could use a hospitality refresher.  Will stay here again on next trip to visit our son.

Text: The room was good, clean beds that were soft, the bathroom was nice. Only complaints are: The hallway kind of smelled like someone had smoked, the breakfast was lacking, and the internet was slow. Otherwise service and quality was exceptional.
